               declare their choice, the British Parliament is the 
               <br />
               one who receives the people’s answer. If the 
               <br />
               answer is, “We want confederation", the British 
               <br />
               Parliament might well amend the BNA Act to 
               <br />
               make us a province, provided always the Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment of Canada also requested <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> In this way, the 
               <br />
               British Parliament has two requests ~— from the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland to make it a province; 
               <br />
               and from the Parliament of Canada to make New- 
               <br />
               foundland a province... 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I might point out that the BNA 
               <br />
               Act has already made provision, under section 
               <br />
               49, for the entry of Newfoundland into con- 
               <br />
               federation. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood In a Speciﬁc way - the joint 
               <br />
               addresses of the legislatures; but we have not got 
               <br />
               a legislature. We have the position that if in the 
               <br />
               referendum the people of Newfoundland say, 
               <br />
               “We want confederation” the rest is a mere 
               <br />
               technicality. I am not going to get excited over a 
               <br />
               mere technicality. What I am excited over is how 
               <br />
               the people will vote. The rest is mere formality. 
               <br />
               It is perfectly constitutional. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Some people do not care whether it 
               <br />
               is constitutional or not. But I also read the letter. 
               <br />
               Mr. King emphatically stated, apart from one or 
               <br />
               two matters like education, that this is the last 
               <br />
               word as far as terms are concerned. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Financial terms. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett These are ﬁnancial terms — that is 
               <br />
               ‘ what concerns the country most. I also point out 
               <br />
               there is a big discrepancy between the needs of 
               <br />
               this country as‘ a province and the actual receipts 
               <br />
               from revenues. You made it out slightly over $1 
               <br />
               million; I ﬁgured it out myself at $2 million. Mr. 
               <br />
               King says, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">”This</span> is the last word; we are afraid 
               <br />
               we will not be able to do anything further”. The 
               <br />
               reason I asked the question as to who will 
               <br />
               negotiate these ﬁnancial terms is, I want to know 
               <br />
               whether it will be the Newfoundland government 
               <br />
               or the British government? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Hollett has hopped from 
               <br />
               the letter to some clause. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett I do not hop, I jump. I am talking

               <br />
               then you say it is a mere technicality — “We do

               <br />
               want to bring that home. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood We will deal with that when we 
               <br />
               come to it. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett It is in the letter; you read the letter. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Reverting to the letter, the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister says: “I feel I must emphasise that 
               <br />
               as far as the ﬁnancial aspects of the proposed 
               <br />
               arrangements for union are concerned, the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada believes that the arrange- 
               <br />
               ments go as far as the Government can go under 
               <br />
               the circumstances." 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett This is something more important 
               <br />
               than mere money; it touches on matters of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con»</span> 
               <br />
               science. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I read from page 21 of the Grey 
               <br />
               Book. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett I read from the Black Book. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               With respect to those matters which are 
               <br />
               primarily of provincial concern, such as 
               <br />
               education, the Government of Canada would 
               <br />
               not wish to set down any rigid conditions, and 
               <br />
               it would be prepared to give reasonable con- 
               <br />
               sideration to suggestions for modiﬁcation or 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               When the government says these are ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               terms, they mean on the financial side, the money 
               <br />
               side. On the conscience side, such as touches the
