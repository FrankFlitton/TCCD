               Would Mr. Job tell us if that means that to take 
               <br />
               a hogshead of salt, say from St. John‘s on a 
               <br />
               government boat to some other place on the coast, 
               <br />
               costs as much freight as that hogshead of salt cost 
               <br />
               where it was purchased in the ﬁrst place? 
               <br />
               Mr. Job Most of the salt is freighted from the 
               <br />
               West Indies by the government boats, and the 
               <br />
               freight is about three times the cost of the salt in 
               <br />
               the West Indies. The freights are tremendously 
               <br />
               high. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood You mean that the salt is 
               <br />
               bought in the West indies and freighted to New- 
               <br />
               foundland, and the cost of the freight from West 
               <br />
               Indies to Newfoundland is about three times the 
               <br />
               price of the salt in West Indies in the ﬁrst place? 
               <br />
               Mr. Job Yes. 
               <br />
               Mr. McCarthy I wonder if Mr. Job would tell 
               <br />
               us what the freight is on salt from the West Indies 
               <br />
               to Newfoundland? 
               <br />
               Mr. Job Ican’t tell you. 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne At the time that we were writ- 
               <br />
               ing this sub~committec report the freight on salt 
               <br />
               was $12 a ton from the West Indies to New- 
               <br />
               foundland, and the cost of the salt was about 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$4.02</span> in West Indies, so that would bring it to 
               <br />
               approximately three times the price. Added to 
               <br />
               that are certain charges for loading and for in~ 
               <br />
               surance. Representations having been made to 
               <br />
               the Newfoundland Fisheries Board,l an arrange- 
               <br />
               ment has been made whereby there is a rebate 
               <br />
               paid of $1 per hogshead to the importer, in the 
               <br />
               outports particularly. I don't know if that applies 
               <br />
               to St. John’s as well, because the cargoes of salt 
               <br />
               to St. John’s come in much larger vessels, and 
               <br />
               you can expect a lower rate of freight; I think such 
               <br />
               a large freight rate on the government boats was 
               <br />
               on account of their smaller carrying capacity. 
               <br />
               They go to the West Indies with fish and they 
               <br />
               bring back molasses, and sometimes rum, and 
               <br />
               also bring back salt for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">outpons....</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. McCarthy Does that mean $4.02 landed 
               <br />
               cost? 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne No, that’s the rate in the West 
               <br />
               Indies, and there‘s a rebate of $1 per hogshead. 
               <br />
               Mr. McCarthy That would be $3 freight ap- 
               <br />
               proximately? 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne Yes, but the understanding is 
               <br />
               that the salt must be sold in the outports at $4.75 
               <br />
               per hogshead, which is the same price as in St. 
               <br />
               John’s when imported from the West Indies.

               Mr. Smallwood On page 7 of the Appendix: 
               <br />
               “We appreciate the important work that the New- 
               <br />
               foundland Fisheries Board is performing in its 
               <br />
               control over all branches of the fishing industry." 
               <br />
               I understand that the Fisheries Board has a 
               <br />
               deﬁnite policy to keep the exportation of ﬁsh in 
               <br />
               as few hands as possible. I heard or read <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some</span> 
               <br />
               where that the idea was to keep the number of 
               <br />
               exporters limited to around 50.... Now ier. Job 
               <br />
               tells us that that is the policy of the Fisheries 
               <br />
               Board, would he tell us how the Board, or the fish 
               <br />
               trade, proposes to deal with small exporters, and 
               <br />
               how it proposes to deal with new exporters. How 
               <br />
               can a man become an exporter if he is not one 
               <br />
               already? In the old days we have had men, we 
               <br />
               have one on Water Street today who began as a 
               <br />
               ﬁsherman in Bonavista Bay and started a small 
               <br />
               shop, and ended up one of the biggest exporters 
               <br />
               in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> If there had been a ﬁshery board 
               <br />
               at that time, could he have become one of the 
               <br />
               largest exporters in Newfoundland? Then I am 
               <br />
               wondering about the co-operative society. Can a 
               <br />
               co-operative society, as easily as anyone else, 
               <br />
               become an exporter?.... What do they look for- 
               <br />
               ward to, the day when they will succeed in having 
               <br />
               perhaps a dozen exporters in the country? Is that 
               <br />
               the ideal they are aiming at, a dozen, or 20, or just 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one?....</span>

               Mr. Job I don‘t know whether Mr. Ashbourne

               can answer that question; I can‘t because I am not 
               <br />

               <br />

               licenses were given to codfish exporters it was 
               <br />

               <br />
