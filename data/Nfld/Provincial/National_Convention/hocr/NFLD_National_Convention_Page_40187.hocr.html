               Mr. Smallwood I don‘t ask them to do that, but 
               <br />
               I am full of suspicion about this Labrador busi- 
               <br />
               ness. I feel very indignant about it. I think if this

               country today had the same suspicion thatI have 
               <br />
               got, and from scraps of information that I have 
               <br />
               picked up about Labrador and what is going on, 
               <br />
               there would be a little revolution in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> 
               <br />
               We have been very shortsighted in New- 
               <br />
               foundland, and it looks to me that we are in 
               <br />
               danger of making the same fatal mistake in 
               <br />
               Labrador. It is a very crucial time, and some 
               <br />
               queer things are going on behind the scenes. If 
               <br />
               necessary I would like to see a royal commission 
               <br />
               appointed to get to the bottom of this. There is 
               <br />
               some skulduggery going on about Labrador, and 
               <br />
               we ought to know the truth of it. If we have to 
               <br />
               decide what Labrador may or may not be worth 
               <br />
               to this country in the next 30 to 40 years we have 
               <br />
               to base it on some deﬁnite information. This 
               <br />
               report does not give that informadon.

               Mr. Hollett I support Mr. Smallwood. There is

               <br />
               when Mr. Smallwood has definitely thrown

               Forestry Committee my idea about this timber 
               <br />
               land in Labrador. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               We have large areas of timber land in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Labrador.</span> Some of it is not very important in our 
               <br />
               estimation, and some of it is very good timber. 
               <br />
               Now there is a reference here in this repon to the 
               <br />
               further concessions being made in Labrador. A 
               <br />
               great many concessions have been made as we 
               <br />
               see on this map, and I am wondering what is left 
               <br />
               to be conceded in the accessible areas, that is 
               <br />
               along the coastline. The vast areas in the interior 
               <br />
               are wooded, but it is wood with small growth, 
               <br />
               stunted. I understand from trappers, and my own 
               <br />
               observations by air over the country, it is not very 
               <br />
               thickly wooded, and being so far in from the 
               <br />
               water as 2-300 miles the state of the timber would 
               <br />
               make it almost not worth bringing out. That is 
               <br />
               considering the fact that we would have to build 
               <br />
               a railroad in there. It would have to be very rich 
               <br />
               timber to make it of any value to the country. At 
               <br />
               the present time,the interior can be left out as far 
               <br />
               as bringing anything into the treasury of this 
               <br />
               country of ours. At the present time close to the 
               <br />
               coastline there are areas taken as well. The area 
               <br />
               between Battle Harbour and Sandwich Bay is all 
               <br />
               taken by two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">companies.</span> That is the 6,074 miles 
               <br />
               referred to. 
               <br />

               up by those other companies. Now to come to the 
               <br />
               Hamilton Inlet area most of the possible 
               <br />

               the Three Rivers Estates and the Stag Bay Estate. 
               <br />
