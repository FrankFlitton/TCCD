               <br />
               Merchantable. Then again Madeira. Is it shipped 
               <br />
               out as Madeira? Under what names and grades is 
               <br />
               that ﬁsh shipped out? The mere fact that there is

               some technical classiﬁcation of only 2% <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mere</span>

               charitable makes me believe that there is some

               bad statements at times. Apparently he does not

               <br />
               grades have changed in the past few years, and I 
               <br />
               believe the ﬁgures are possibly correct. Speaking 
               <br />
               for our own firm we have not exported a mer-

               60% of our people. On Tuesday, fishermen north,

               south, east and west listened with great interest 
               <br />

               <br />
               an accusation, a firm or firms receiving an overall

               <br />
               the chairman’s explanation that in his opinion 
               <br />
               this is justified. The whole economy of our 
               <br />
               country revolves around our ﬁsheries, and I am 
               <br />
               surprised that so many delegates have not shown 
               <br />
               a greater interest in this debate. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I do not know what phase of our ﬁsheries 
               <br />
               should get top priority, 1 would say that one is so 
               <br />
               dependent on the other. Mr. Crosbie specialises 
               <br />
               in fresh codfish products, in this he is joined by 
               <br />
               Mr. lob, whose ﬁrm also figures largely in the 
               <br />
               fisheries. Butjust for purposes of comparison, I 
               <br />
               would point out that in the last ﬁshing season, 
               <br />
               1946, the value of the salt cod expert was more 
               <br />
               than three times the export value of fresh and 
               <br />
               frozen cod products. If, as Mr. Smallwood with 
               <br />
               his pessimistic outlook on this phase of the in- 
               <br />
               dustry suggests, or Mr. Crosbie with his “catch 
               <br />
               herring” policy points out, if this means curtains 
               <br />
               for everything but the fresh products and herring, 
               <br />
               then it devolves upon us to be up and doing 
               <br />
               something about the reconversion of the salt cod; 
               <br />
               and reconversion to the fresh and refrigeration 
               <br />
