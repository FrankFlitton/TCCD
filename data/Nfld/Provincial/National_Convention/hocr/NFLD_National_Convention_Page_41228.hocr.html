               surplus to do it. But as it happened, they’ve been 
               <br />
               taking in enough ordinary revenue this year to 
               <br />
               meet those special costs or nearly enough. I’m

               <br />
               don’t know. Now that fact does not change the 
               <br />
               situation. Those expenditures amounting to over 
               <br />
               $10 million are not ordinary expenditures, but 
               <br />
               capital account —- reconstruction expenditures. 
               <br />
               One such item is $500,000 for building new 
               <br />
               schools, and repairing and equipping old ones. 
               <br />
               The government, you may remember, laid out a 
               <br />
               three-year plan to spend $500,000 each year on 
               <br />
               building new schools or helping to build them, 
               <br />
               and repairing old ones and equipping them or 
               <br />
               helping to do it.... And this present year is the 
               <br />
               second year of that particular <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">three‘year</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">plan...1</span>

               Now in my provincial budget of ordinary ex- 
               <br />
               penditures I have shown exactly why it says 
               <br />
               ordinary expenditures. All the rest would be spe- 
               <br />
               cial reconstruction, or capital expenditures. Now 
               <br />
               that is reasonable. Because I have dropped this 
               <br />
               $500,000 from my list of ordinary expenditures 
               <br />
               it does not mean that that $500,000 would not be 
               <br />
               spent. Of course it would be spent, but it would 
               <br />
               be shown as capital expenditures, not ordinary, 
               <br />
               and this comes out of capital account, as it would 
               <br />
               have come out of capital account this very year 
               <br />
               had not the ordinary revenue kept up so high. I 
               <br />
               explained all this in clear simple language when 
               <br />
               Iintroduced my so-called provincial budget, and 
               <br />
               it is just downright misrepresentation, I will take 
               <br />
               that back, it was too bad for Major Cashin to 
               <br />
               make out that I was trying to do our school system 
               <br />
               out of the $500,000 merely because I did not 
               <br />
               show it in ordinary expenditure. 
               <br />

               1 am coming pretty close to an end of my reply 
               <br />
               to Major Cashin. He used up a large part of his 
               <br />
               speech dealing with the purely ﬁnancial side of 
               <br />
               confederation. Now that’s exactly what we 
               <br />
               would expect Major Cashin to do, he being the 
               <br />
               former Minister of Finance. He is interested in 
               <br />
               that more than anything else. I have detected in 
               <br />
               Major Cashin from time to time a sort of im— 
               <br />
               patience at anything and everything that came 
               <br />
               into this Convention that was not ﬁnancial. He 
               <br />
               took up a large part of his speech dealing with the 
               <br />
               purely ﬁnancial side of confederation, but I don’t 
               <br />
               think he did much to make the position clear to

               <br />
               mixed up and muddled by his own ﬁgures, thatI 
               <br />
               was at a loss to know which ﬁgures he meant us 
               <br />
               to accept. Let us see if we can rescue the simple 
               <br />
               truth from his conglomeration of ﬁgures. At one 
               <br />
               point he told us that the Government of Canada, 
               <br />
               the federal government, would take $75 million 
               <br />
               a year from us in taxes. Just remember that ﬁgure, 
               <br />
               please —— $75 million, that is what the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment of Canada would take from us. But what 
               <br />
               does he do? A few minutes earlier, when he was 
               <br />
               examining the Canadian government’s own es- 
               <br />
               timates of the taxes they would collect from us 
               <br />
               —- their estimate you may remember is $20 mil- 
               <br />
               lion a year, but that ﬁgure does not satisfy Major 
               <br />
               Cashin, so he ups it to $32 million. He says the 
               <br />
               Canadian government sent down this Grey Book, 
               <br />
               and if you turn to Annex IV in the Grey Book you 
               <br />
               will ﬁnd that the Government of Canada es- 
               <br />
               timates that all they will take from the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland in taxes is $20 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million.</span> Precisely. 
               <br />
               Foolishness, it will be more, it will be $32 mil- 
               <br />
               lion. Well, why doesn’t he make up his mind? 
               <br />
               Major Cashin should make up his mind. Is it the 
               <br />
               $32 million he tells us in one breath, or the $75 
               <br />
