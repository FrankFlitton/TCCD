               Chairman of the National Convention. Mr. Walsh 
               <br />
               pointed out that when the National Convention 
               <br />
               Act2 was being formed the government had ap~ 
               <br />
               preached Judge Fox, asking him whether or not 
               <br />
               he would accept the chairmanship of the National 
               <br />
               Convention. That was why it was inserted that the 
               <br />
               Chairman should be a judge of the Supreme 
               <br />

               ﬁnd ourselves without a Chairman, and Mr.

               ing the future position of Chairman; whether the 
               <br />
