               Mr. Chairman Let me rule if I may, gentlemen. 
               <br />
               The decision of this Convention is of a threefold 
               <br />
               nature. Let me try and reduce it to its simplest 
               <br />
               position. The act itself says that you shall <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con</span> 
               <br />
               sider the ﬁnancial and economic situation of the 
               <br />
               country since 1934 with particular reference to 
               <br />
               the impact which war prosperity might have had 
               <br />
               upon our economy, and that in the light of that 
               <br />
               you will go on to recommend the future possible 
               <br />
               forms of government. I reduce the second section 
               <br />
               simply to a three—fold position. The Convention 
               <br />
               shall consider, one, is the island self-supporting? 
               <br />
               That is the work of the Finance Report. Secondly, 
               <br />
               the Convention shall consider whether or not the 
               <br />
               island will continue self-supporting, and if the 
               <br />
               answer to that question is in the afﬁrrnative 
               <br />
               how long will it continue self-supporting? And 
               <br />
               then in the light of the decisions arrived at the two 
               <br />
               previous questions, to then recommend the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pos‘</span>

               The Finance Committee also deplores the 
               <br />
               action of the Commission of Government 
               <br />
               with respect to restriction by the Commission 
               <br />
               of the rates of pay to be given our New- 
               <br />
               foundland workmen in return for their ser- 
               <br />
               vices in the construction of the American 
               <br />
               bases inasmuch as it is asserted that the Com- 
               <br />
               mission of Government gave direct or in— 
               <br />
               direct instruction to the American and 
               <br />
               Canadian contractors not to pay New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders the same rates of pay as the 
               <br />
               American workmen for performing similar 
               <br />
               work on the grounds that it would upset the 
               <br />
               general economy of the country. 
               <br />

               Now I hold that this is relevant and comes 
               <br />
               under the terms of reference. As you have very 
               <br />
               excellently put it, our third duty is to recommend 
               <br />
               to the Dominions Ofﬁce a form or forms of 
               <br />
               government. I would say right here now, and I 
               <br />
               think every man here will agree with me, that if 
               <br />
               any government would stoop to do that which the 
               <br />
               Finance Committee have asserted they did, then 
               <br />
               that is one form of government which I could not 
               <br />
               safely recommend when it comes time. Therefore 
               <br />
               I say, it is very relevant and certainly within the 
               <br />
               terms of reference. 
               <br />

               Mr. Chairman I have to sustain you on that
