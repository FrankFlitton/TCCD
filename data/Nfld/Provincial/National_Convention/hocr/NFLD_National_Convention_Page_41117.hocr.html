               the amount which our trip cost the taxpayers of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. I would regard it as conscience 
               <br />
               money. Because the fact is that that delegation, 
               <br />
               in addition to being coldly received and treated 
               <br />
               as children, was simply wasting the people’s 
               <br />
               money, and I am now convinced that the same 
               <br />
               situation applies in the case of the delegation 
               <br />
               which went to Ottawa this past summer. What did 
               <br />
               we get for that three month trip? What have we 
               <br />
               got, I ask, to justify hanging up this Convention 
               <br />
               for more than 100 days? What have we got to 
               <br />
               justify the spending of around $30,000 of the 
               <br />
               people’s money? As far as I can see, all we have 
               <br />
               got for all this is two books with black covers and 
               <br />
               another one with a grey cover. And as far as they 
               <br />
               are concerned, it is my opinion that you could go 
               <br />
               into any bookstore in Ottawa and for about a 
               <br />
               dollar get a book containing the Canadian facts 
               <br />
               and ﬁgures. The Newfoundland part of the book 
               <br />
               could have been obtained locally for the expen- 
               <br />
               diture of another 50 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cents.</span> Yet, the three books in 
               <br />
               question cost us nearly $30,000. Why Mr. Chair- 
               <br />
               man, if the collectors of rare books knew that we 
               <br />
               were in possession of such valuable volumes, 
               <br />
               they would come running to have a glance at 
               <br />
               them. You wouldn’t have to pay that amount for 
               <br />
               a ﬁrst edition of Shakespeare.

               But these famous books we are asked to regard 
               <br />
               as containing the terms upon which Canada 
               <br />
               would be prepared to adopt us. Of course they are 
               <br />
               not called terms. That seems to be a dangerous 
               <br />
               word, and they are called proposals. The Ottawa 
               <br />
               delegation, by the way, was neither entitled to 
               <br />
               negotiate nor to arrange terms, but it is quite 
               <br />
               obvious that they have done both these things.

               Now my ﬁrst impulse, and that of many other 
               <br />
               delegates to this Convention when these terms 
               <br />
               were introduced here, was to have nothing to do 
               <br />
               with them —— to throw them out the window for 
               <br />
               the worthless things they were. But we did not do 
               <br />
               this, for the simple reason that if we did, some 
               <br />
               people might think that we were trying to hide the 
               <br />
               wonderful offering which Canada was making to 
               <br />
               us. Or they might think we were afraid to discuss 
               <br />
               them. They might think we were afraid of the 
               <br />
               effect they may have on our people. But sir, it was 
               <br />
               not for these reasons that I did not favour them. 
               <br />
               My attitude was then as it is now, that the contents 
               <br />
               of these books were worthless, for the simple 
               <br />
               reason that they only give us half the story, they 
               <br />
               are half-truths, what they tell us is what the

               I am not going to weary you by dealing in 
               <br />
               detail with the contents of these Canadian 
               <br />
               proposals. For there is not an item, not a ﬁgure 
               <br />
               which is not open to correction, criticism and, in 
               <br />
               many cases, suspicion. Let me give you an ex~ 
               <br />
               ample: when I received my copies of these books, 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst thing I set out to look for was the present 
               <br />
               Canadian national debt. I felt that if we were to 
               <br />
               go into partnership with Canada, it was proper 
               <br />
               that we see how our prospective partner stood 
               <br />
               ﬁnancially. I therefore went through the books, 
               <br />
               page by page, from cover to cover and from 
               <br />
               beginning to end. And did I ﬁnd what I looked 
               <br />
               for? I did not, because it was not there. It had been 
               <br />
               left out. I asked myself why it had been left out. 
               <br />
               I became suspicious. I concluded that it must be 
               <br />
               in the interest of the pro-confederates to leave this 
               <br />
               out, or it would be there, lined up with all the 
               <br />
               other attractive items. Well, I ﬁnally did dig it up 
               <br />
               in another way. I got it by discovering that the 
               <br />
               Ottawa delegation had brought home other docu- 
               <br />
               ments which they had not produced, some of 
               <br />
               which, I understand, were labelled “secret” in big 
               <br />
               red <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">letters.</span> It would appear that the people of the 
               <br />
               country were not supposed to know about these 
               <br />
               secret documents, even the Convention was not 
               <br />
               supposed to know about them. But murder will 
               <br />
               out, and so what I looked for, I found. I found 
               <br />
               that, according to this secret information given 
               <br />
               the Ottawa delegation by the Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern»</span> 
               <br />
               ment, the total federal debt of Canada amounts to 
               <br />
               over $18 billion, or a per capita debt on every 
               <br />
               man, woman and child in Canada of $1,492. 
               <br />
               From information taken from the Report of the 
               <br />
               Auditor General of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada,</span> we ﬁnd that the total 
               <br />
               interest charge on Canada‘s national debt is close 
               <br />
               to $450 million annually, or at the rate of $35 for 
               <br />
               every Canadian. But just compare this with our 
               <br />
               own country’s ﬁnances. Our national debt is 
               <br />
               roughly $70 million as against Canada’s $18 
               <br />
               billion. Our per capita debt is $213 as against 
               <br />
               Canada‘s $1,492. Our total interest charge,
