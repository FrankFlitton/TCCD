               actly What taxes will be placed on our people to 
               <br />
               raise those few million dollars in provincial 
               <br />
               taxes. They demand that I shall here and now turn 
               <br />
               myself into the provincial treasurer or ﬁnance 
               <br />
               minister and name the taxes that will give the 
               <br />
               provincial government those few millions a year. 
               <br />
               If I refuse to oblige them they raise a great chatter 
               <br />
               about property taxes. Sir, are their imaginations 
               <br />
               so poverty—stricken that they can think of nothing 
               <br />
               but property taxes? Is their knowledge of taxation 
               <br />
               so microscopic that they cannot look around in 
               <br />
               this country and see how taxes can be raised by 
               <br />
               the government without putting taxes on the bits 
               <br />
               of property our people have? Let me remind you 
               <br />
               that we are today collecting certain taxes that we 
               <br />
               can and will go right on collecting under con~ 
               <br />
               federation. Gasoline tax, motorcar and truck 
               <br />
               taxes, drivers’ licenses, liquor proﬁts, timber and 
               <br />
               mineral royalties, lumber royalties and a dozen 
               <br />
               other items that will bring us in close to $5 million 
               <br />
               a year. These are taxes that we have right now. 
               <br />
               These taxes can be kept on, and if we have any 
               <br />
               brains, any courage, any sense of fair play in us, 
               <br />
               we will collect the rest of the taxes we need out 
               <br />
               of the public domain of this country. And when 
               <br />
               I say that, I am not thinking only of the huge areas 
               <br />
               of holdings in this country that are tied up in the 
               <br />
               hands of persons living outside the country, but 
               <br />
               of actual operations going on right now. I am not 
               <br />
               going to tip my hand in this matter just now —— 
               <br />
               the time will come for that -- but when the right 
               <br />
               moment comes, I think I will be able to show 
               <br />
               some of our former ﬁnance ministers ways of 
               <br />
               getting taxes without grinding the faces of the 
               <br />
               poor. And that is a promise, if you want to take it 
               <br />
               that way, a promise or a threat, however you want 
               <br />
               to take <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span>

               Sir, the conduct of the members on this motion 
               <br />
               that will shortly be put to them for their vote will 
               <br />

               heard many passionate declarations of belief in 
               <br />
               democracy. We have been told how very anxious 
               <br />
               certain members are that democracy should be 
               <br />
               restored to Newfoundland. We have been treated 
               <br />
               to many ﬁerce denunciations of dictatorship and 
               <br />
               all its works. Well, we shall very soon see how 
               <br />
               sincere were those declarations. We shall soon

               how sincere these declarations really were. They

               broken its promise to restore responsible govern-

               <br />

               that this National Convention cannot recommend

               other forms of government. No longer can they

               say that an elected government could get better

               terms. No longer can they say that we must have 
               <br />
               responsible government ﬁrst. What have they left

               to say? What excuse can they think up now for 
               <br />
               cheating the people out of their right to decide the 
               <br />
               question of confederation in the referendum? Sir, 
               <br />
               there is only one reason they can have. They are 
               <br />
               afraid of confederation. They are afraid to put it 
               <br />
               on the ballot to let the people vote on it. They are 
               <br />
               afraid to let the people vote on it, for they fear 
               <br />
               that the people will vote for it. If they are not 
               <br />
               afraid, let them vote for this motion. I challenge 
               <br />
               them, I dare them to vote for this motion. I dare 
               <br />
               them to let the people decide on the question of 
               <br />
               confederation. We confederates were not afraid 
               <br />
               to let the people decide on responsible govem-

               <br />
               to place those two forms on the ballot paper. If 
               <br />
               the anticonfederates are not afraid that the people 
               <br />
               will vote for confederation, let them vote now, 
               <br />
