               thing that we ought not to be. That’s what we

               have been. You have ﬁve <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">corporations</span> in this 
               <br />
               country today. First, Bell Island. The story, if 
               <br />
               that’s ever written, of the taxes they have paid 
               <br />
               and have not paid, would raise anybody’s hair in 
               <br />
               this country. Some of it has been told, and men 
               <br />
               have almost gone to gaol over it, but they have 
               <br />
               never been treated as in almost any other country, 
               <br />
               except perhaps some oriental country where it is 
               <br />
               graft from the top to the bottom. This country has 
               <br />
               been treating these foreign corporations in the 
               <br />
               most gingerly way, and letting them off from the 
               <br />
               paying of taxes. Bell Island, the AND Co., 
               <br />
               Bowaters, Buchans and St. Lawrence — here are 
               <br />
               five companies. They did not put any minerals, 
               <br />
               timber or water-power in the country, but they 
               <br />
               have been taking them out and using them up and 
               <br />
               never paying to the government of New- 
               <br />
               foundland a just share of the cost of running the 
               <br />
               country, a fair share of the government’ 5 revenue, 
               <br />
               and when I say “just” I am thinking of the stand- 
               <br />
               ard that’s laid down in USA and Canada for taxes 
               <br />
               for such corporations. Compare our taxes with 
               <br />
               the tax that they get in Canada and the United 
               <br />
               States. A little later we will have the report on the 
               <br />
               Labrador Mining and Development Co. I am 
               <br />
               looking forward eagerly to what the government 
               <br />
               has decided they should pay in taxes. I don’t want 
               <br />
               to anticipate this part of the report, but by all 
               <br />
               accounts we are on the very trembling edge of 
               <br />
               one of the greatest mines of the earth. Are you 
               <br />
               going to have someone standing up 40 or 50 years 
               <br />
               from now talking about the short-sightedness and 
               <br />
               lack of imagination of the Government of New— 
               <br />
               foundland in the 19403 in giving away one of the 
               <br />
               great resources that God gave us? We are glad of 
               <br />
               the labour they have given and the wages they 
               <br />
               have paid, though I am not glad of what they gave 
               <br />
               us on the Railway, I regret we lost money on that. 
               <br />
               If we had refused to let them use the Railway they 
               <br />
               would have had to build a railway of their own. 
               <br />
               Instead of telling them to build their own railway 
               <br />
               we say, “Oh no, we will haul your concentrate for 
               <br />
               you at a loss”, and that’ 5 what we have been doing 
               <br />
               instead of letting them build their OWn railway, 
               <br />
               or letting them pay the cost. I like Buchans, I have 
               <br />
               gone in there on train, airplane, Speeder; every- 
               <br />
               thing but walk in there. I like the company and 
               <br />
               the people, and I am not grumbling with them for 
               <br />
               not paying more taxes than they are supposed to 
               <br />

               natural resources, I’d make them pay for it. You 
               <br />
               have to tax them or tax the ﬁshermen. We tax the 
               <br />
               fishermen so high that we can’t sell the ﬁsh in 
               <br />

               <br />
               big ﬁrm that’s making $18 million, and what do 
               <br />
               we hook off them? A little paltry $1 million. We

               ought to be ashamed.

               Mr. Hollett I am not ashamed of anything 
               <br />
               whatever. I would let companies bring in all the 
               <br />
               machinery they wanted duty free, but I would 
               <br />

               a prohibitive tax on machinery, who is going to 
               <br />

               <br />
               as the delegate from Bonavista has this afternoon. 
               <br />
               He is surely giving the Buchans Mining Co. a 
               <br />
               hard time of it, and he told us that God put the

               <br />
               inference that the Devil took it out, but when we 
               <br />
               look at it right, they give some 700 men $2,000 
               <br />
