               Mr. Chairman, I again draw to your attention 
               <br />
               the fact that the question regarding the Bank of 
               <br />
               Canada has not been answered. I drew it to your 
               <br />
               attention yesterday, and I have asked you to find 
               <br />
               out whether or not we’re going to get an answer. 
               <br />
               If they are not going to answer, let them say so 
               <br />
               right here and now. That’s number one. Second- 
               <br />
               ly, I asked the question with regard to the New- 
               <br />
               foundland Savings Bank. And I just want to say 
               <br />
               this, that if I don’t get a satisfactory answer to 
               <br />
               both of these questions tomorrow, I’m going to 
               <br />
               take some other steps. These are questions, 
               <br />
               proper questions put on the order paper and if you 
               <br />
               ignore them —— I don’t say the Savings Bank 
               <br />
               question is being ignored, because it’s only been 
               <br />
               there since yesterday, but the other one has been 
               <br />
               there since the end of November and has ‘been 
               <br />
               deliberately ignored. I want an answer to that 
               <br />

               in Canada there’s no government savings bank, 
               <br />
               none. To date the Newfoundland people have $20

               million approximately in that bank and the

               average rate of interest paid to depositors last

               Newfoundland Savings Bank is to be abolished, 
               <br />

               <br />
