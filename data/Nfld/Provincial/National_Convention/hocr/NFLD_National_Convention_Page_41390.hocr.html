               <br />
               is terriﬁc. But in spite of that we ﬁnd men who 
               <br />
               were expected to work one day for $4 and the next 
               <br />

               I have heard some things referred to in con-

               nection with the town councils, and I agree with 
               <br />
               the principle of town councils, provided they are 
               <br />
               not a burden to our people. I have in many cases 
               <br />
               heard old men, very wealthy and well able to 
               <br />
               afford it say, “Oh yes, we must have a town

               <br />
               that is not the same story. It did not cost them 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$3400,</span> it cost the people, unfortunately. The

               Commission made no provision whereby he or 
               <br />
               she could not pass it on to the poor man. I deplore 
               <br />
               that system of legislation.

               Getting back to the old politicians, I wish to 
               <br />
               be fair in this matter, and I am not trying to prove 
               <br />
               that all our public men were angels — just as the 
               <br />
               public men of any other country are not, and were 
               <br />
               not angels. In every phase of human action you 
               <br />
               will find the black sheep, but is it fair to condemn 
               <br />
               all the apostles because there was a Judas? Is it 
               <br />
               fair to condemn a whole nation because they have 
               <br />
               convicts in their goals? Must we condemn 
               <br />
               humanity because all were not perfect? Yet that 
               <br />
               is just what they try to do with us. I would suggest 
               <br />
               to the commission which was sent over here to 
               <br />
               make an inquiry, that they should search the 
               <br />
               Scriptures, and they might find something 
               <br />
               suitable. They would ﬁnd, if they took the 
               <br />
               trouble, that it is not fair to talk about the mote in 
               <br />
               their neighbours' eye, until they have plucked the 
               <br />
               beam out of their own. If our old politicians were 
               <br />
               the evil persons they say, then why was it that 
               <br />
               when they came here as a Commission they took 
               <br />
               into their ranks three of these old politicians? If 
               <br />
               they are correct in what they state, by this very 
               <br />
               act they condemn themselves. I hold no brief for 
               <br />

               In heaven’s name, when we discuss the past 
               <br />
               history of our country let us try to be fair, and not 
               <br />
               blind our eyes to the truth, I knew personally 
               <br />
               many of the so—called old politicians, and in 90 
               <br />
               percent of the cases I found them men who had 
               <br />
               given much more to the country than they ever 
               <br />
               got from it. They sacriﬁced their business, their 
               <br />
               time and their money to serve the public. I know 
               <br />
               many who had to neglect their business to attend 
               <br />
               to their public duties, and as a result lost their 
               <br />
               business. How often have we heard the sad story 
               <br />
               of public men, who after having given a lifetime 
               <br />
               to public service, died in near poverty? There 
               <br />
               were public men who made money, but they were 
               <br />
               men who would have made money anyhow ~— 
               <br />
               they were merchants, like the Hon. Mr. Job and 
               <br />
               Mr. Hickman and Mr. Crosbie, but just because 
               <br />
               they were politicians, envy said that they were 
               <br />
               grafters. Why, the best proof of it is the refusal of 
               <br />
               so many ambitious men to enter politics. They 
               <br />
               know that if they enter public life they will have 
               <br />
               to make too big a sacriﬁce in time and money, 
               <br />
               which they could have been devoting to their own 
               <br />
               business. Forget it I say, this talk about this 
               <br />
               country meeting the disaster of 1933 because of 
               <br />
               bad politicians.

               But apart from this altogether, let us remember 
               <br />
               that our task is not to deal with the past, but with 
               <br />
               the future. We have to look ahead, not behind. So 
               <br />
               then let us take stock of where we stand today and 
               <br />
               where we may hope to advance in the future. We 
               <br />
               have come a long way since 1933. Things have 
               <br />
               changed for us in such a way that we need never 
               <br />
               fear going back to the depths from which we have 
               <br />
               risen. Newfoundlanders today are in an era of 
               <br />
               prosperity, and it is much more than an unnatural 
               <br />
               post-war boom. It is, on the contrary, an era in 
               <br />
               which primary producers of goods have come 
               <br />
               into their own. The prosperous countries today 
               <br />
               are those countries which have natural resources
