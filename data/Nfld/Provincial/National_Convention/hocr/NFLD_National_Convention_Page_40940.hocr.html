               Mr. Chairman I would remind you that under 
               <br />
               the company laws of Canada, if you are going to 
               <br />
               operate in a single province then of course you 
               <br />
               take out a provincial charter.... The point is this: 
               <br />
               if you want the right to do business nationally 
               <br />
               then you apply for a federal charter, but that does 
               <br />
               not affect the right of any province to grant to any 
               <br />
               individual the right to operate in that province, 
               <br />
               therefore the Fisheries Board, if the set-up is as I 
               <br />
               see it, would be operating under a provincial 
               <br />
               law.... If we went into confederation, it would not 
               <br />
               in any way effect the provincial status that the 
               <br />
               Fisheries Board charter would then take.

               Mr. Crummey Mr. Chairman, my impression 
               <br />
               was that the Fisheries Board, as it operates in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, has the right to import and ex~ 
               <br />
               port. Under the BNA Act, a province has no such 
               <br />
               right, and naturally the Fisheries Board must go 
               <br />
               out of operation, but I think, in these terms, it is 
               <br />
               provided that the Fisheries Board may go under 
               <br />

               <br />
               employs 250 people, and collects today over $20 
               <br />
               million. When and if we went into confederation 
               <br />
               with Canada, according to statistics we have here, 
               <br />
               the customs revenue will be only $4 million. Now
