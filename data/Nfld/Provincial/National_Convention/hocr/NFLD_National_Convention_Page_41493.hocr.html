               to the Chair. Your task, sir, has been a very 
               <br />
               onerous one, but the wise judgement, cool 
               <br />
               decisions and great consideration which you 
               <br />
               have shown have added still more lustre to your 
               <br />
               already well-known abilities, and a greater ad- 
               <br />
               miration for one of Newfoundland’s greatest 
               <br />
               sons. To your immediate predecessor, my learned 
               <br />
               associate from Bonavista Centre, I would say that 
               <br />
               when and if the records of this Convention are 
               <br />
               written, history will accord no mean place to the 
               <br />
               name of F. Gordon Bradley, K.C. I would also, 
               <br />
               pay tribute to the memory of that great and good 
               <br />
               man, the late Mr. Justice Fox; to me (and I knew 
               <br />
               him but a short time), his demise represented a 
               <br />
               personal tragedy, and I shall treasure memories 
               <br />
               of that kindly gentleman long after Conventions 
               <br />
               are forgotten. To members generally, I express a 
               <br />
               deep sense of gratitude. As far as I am concerned, 
               <br />
               this Convention has been a great lesson in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">politi»</span> 
               <br />
               cal democracy at work, even though it may have 
               <br />
               been a very expensive one. Here the managing 
               <br />
               directors of the big vested interests were called 
               <br />
               by their ﬁrst names by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tax—schoolteacher,</span> the 
               <br />
               outport merchant. Here the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cit-policeman</span> from 
               <br />
               the west coast talked over his people’s problems 
               <br />
               with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">coop</span> worker from White Bay. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Forty;</span> 
               <br />
               ﬁve men with divergent views did much toward 
               <br />
               enlightening public opinion and awakening a 
               <br />
               sense of political responsibility among our 
               <br />
               people. If I may be permitted to be personal on a 
               <br />
               ﬁnal note, and I trust it is not in bad taste, I would 
               <br />
               express my sincere thanks to my good friend, Mr. 
               <br />
               Hickman, He probably more than any other has 
               <br />
               gone out of his way at times to extend those little 
               <br />
               courtesies that mean so much. Also to Mr. Cros- 
               <br />
               bie, the Hon. RB. Job, Mr. Smallwood and to my 
               <br />
               great friend, Arch Northcott, and to members 
               <br />
               generally; and I make my final bow by saying, 
               <br />
               “Thank you, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentlemen.”</span>

               subject was being discussed in committee of the

               whole to engage in the debate. I felt it was being 
               <br />
               buffeted around the house, and that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discus</span>

               <br />
               sides. And so I mostly sat it out. However, in view 
               <br />
               of the bigness of the question, and in view of the 
               <br />
               fact that I, on both occasions, voted in favour of

               <br />

               some comment at this time.

               <br />
               swear that my ﬁrst and perhaps only reason was 
               <br />
               a psychological one. We were called together to 
               <br />
               consider forms of government. The question of 
               <br />
               confederation had been up before. True, it has 
               <br />
               failed, but on its merits or demerits as the case 
               <br />
               may be. But it had become an object of con~ 
               <br />
               tinuous curiosity and many unfounded argu~ 
               <br />
               ments had, down through the years, been 
               <br />
               advanced in its favour. This old ﬂame had been 
               <br />
               rapidly fanned in the interim between the an— 
               <br />
               nouncement of the holding of this Convention 
               <br />
               and its opening date, September II, 1946. A 
               <br />
               glowing picture of union with Canada was laid 
               <br />
               before the people. It was not to be wondered at 
               <br />
               then, that since we were dealing with such ques- 
               <br />
               tions, that curiosity was further aroused and 
               <br />
               being aroused, had to be satisﬁed. It is not my 
               <br />
               intention now to comment on the methods 
               <br />
               adopted by the pro-confederates as to their fair- 
               <br />
               ness or otherwise, and I say but one thing, that 
               <br />
               they are, to my mind, not based on sound national 
               <br />
               principles and consequently could not be con— 
               <br />
               sidered as bait. A further remark is that its 
               <br />
               progress through this assembly has provided the 
               <br />
               means of passing on the bait.

               And so I voted for the motion to send a delega- 
               <br />
               tion to Ottawa. That decision was against my 
               <br />
               feeling, for in the autonomous sovereign integrity 
               <br />
               of our country I had a strong belief. But my 
               <br />
               feelings, I felt, should be set aside for the mo- 
               <br />
               ment, and should yield to a proven case: a case in 
               <br />
               which all the evidence should be submitted and 
               <br />
               considered. And there a great shadow came over 
               <br />
               our subject, our inability to negotiate. I do not 
               <br />
               pass reﬂections on those who gave us this job to 
               <br />
               do, and who set the limits wherein we work. No 
               <br />
               part of this is unwittingly planned, and it is well 
               <br />
               that it is so. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I voted to get the terms. That covered that. 
               <br />
               There was at one time a possibility of our having 
               <br />
               to consider what is still only a word, a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con»</span>

               was also a present~day application of repre~ 
               <br />
               sentative government. All these, I believe, were 
               <br />
               possible forms of future government and one 
               <br />
               would act in a restrictive manner not to favour

               <br />
               these forms of government, it does not necessari-
