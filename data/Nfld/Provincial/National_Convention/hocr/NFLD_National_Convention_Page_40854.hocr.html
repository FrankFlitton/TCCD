               Mr. Hollett What has Canada got to do with it? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood It has everything to do with it, 
               <br />
               if we are a province. Remember this, these words, 
               <br />
               if we became a province, would be enacted as a 
               <br />
               law; and the word “will” would become “shall". 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett This is not a law. 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood It is not a law until it becomes 
               <br />
               a law. That can be done by the Parliament of 
               <br />
               Great Britain.

               Mr. Chairman It is merely a proposal. This is
