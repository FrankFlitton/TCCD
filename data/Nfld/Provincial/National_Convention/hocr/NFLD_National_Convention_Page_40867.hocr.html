               the other provinces are very poor provinces; they

               Mr. Smallwood I will not be drawn on that at 
               <br />
               the moment. I will come back to it. We will ﬁnish 
               <br />
               this other point, this 89%. If my memory is right 
               <br />
               the population of Quebec, Ontario and British 
               <br />
               Columbia put together comes to 69% of the 
               <br />
               population of all Canada. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mia</span> Hollett said it was 
               <br />
               75%. Let us call it 75%; 75% of the population 
               <br />
               should pay 75% of the taxes; but they pay 89%. 
               <br />
               What does that mean? That means that the other 
               <br />
               six provinces, the Maritimes and the three 
               <br />
               prairie provinces between them pay 1 1% only of 
               <br />
               the revenue of the Government of Canada: 11% 
               <br />
               from six and 89% from three. Why is that? Be- 
               <br />
               cause of the kind of taxation that the Government 
               <br />
               of Canada collects. Most of it is corporation tax 
               <br />
               on big companies and corporations, and income 
               <br />
               tax. That is where she gets the bulk of her revenue 
               <br />
               ~- by taxing the people who have the money to 
               <br />
               pay. Now what would it mean if we were to 
               <br />
               become a province? There would be three rich 
               <br />
               provinces and seven not so rich. Suppose a large 
               <br />
               ﬁrm were to start nine branches... A year passes 
               <br />
               on and they get the balance sheet of each branch. 
               <br />
               They ﬁnd the only branches that made money 
               <br />
               were the ones at Grand Falls, Buchans and 
               <br />
               Corner Brook. The other six are losing money. 
               <br />
               They might let them run on for another year.... 
               <br />
               Those six branches have lost money, but the three 
               <br />
               branches made money. What do they do, if they 
               <br />
               are businessmen? They close down the six 
               <br />
               branches. 
               <br />

               Mr. Hollett That is what would happen to this 
               <br />
               province. It would be shutdown.

               Mr. Smallwood I am coming to that. They close

               down the six branches which are not paying, 
               <br />
               why? Because they are a business concern. They 
               <br />
               are not in business for fun they are interested 
               <br />
               in the balance sheets. Canada has nine provinces.
