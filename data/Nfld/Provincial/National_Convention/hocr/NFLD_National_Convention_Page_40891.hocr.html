               Mr. Smallwood It would be the same as exists

               today. In Newfoundland we have ships in the

               <br />
               ships that are so owned. In Canada there is the 
               <br />
               Canadian government merchant marine, there 
               <br />
               are privately owned ships, and l daresay there are 
               <br />
               provincially owned ships. Various things could 
               <br />
               be done. Maybe the Canadian merchant marine 
               <br />
               could be asked to operate them.

               Mr. Miller Since we are considering clause 5, it 
               <br />
               says, “At the union, or as soon as practicable 
               <br />
               thereafter, the following services will be taken 
               <br />
               over by Canada and become subject to the juris— 
               <br />
               diction of Parliament." 1 think Mr. Smallwood in 
               <br />
               his interpretation has to be governed by this Grey 
               <br />
               Book. It says further, “Newfoundland to be 
               <br />
               relieved of the public costs incurred in respect to 
               <br />
               each service after it is taken over”. We will be 
               <br />
               relieved only in pan of these public costs. We will 
               <br />
               be contributing to the taxes collected by the 
               <br />
               federal government, we will bear a proportion of 
               <br />
               this cost. A fair interpretation would be that the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland provincial government would be 
               <br />
               relieved of the cost, but Newfoundland as a 
               <br />
               people will pay a proportionate share of the cost
