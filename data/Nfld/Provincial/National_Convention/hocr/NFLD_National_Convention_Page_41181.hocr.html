               <br />
               was created. Perhaps it is not too much to say that 
               <br />
               to the casual listeners-in, it appears to be just so

               <br />
               regrettable indeed, for to many of us, who have 
               <br />
               had and will have no part or parcel of such

               <br />
               tedious repetition, sir, when I make reference to 
               <br />
               what you have so many times pointed out, that 
               <br />
               the speciﬁc mandate of this Convention was 
               <br />
               simply to examine into something, and on the 
               <br />
               basis of its ﬁndings, to make intelligent recom- 
               <br />
               mendations. That something was the ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               and economic condition of Newfoundland. Has 
               <br />
               it done that? It has, in my opinion, deteriorated 
               <br />
               from the status of a fact-finding body into two 
               <br />
               hostile political camps, each apparently led by a 
               <br />
               crusading giant in the realms of oratory, and as 
               <br />
               the leaders fence and draw, the minor Chieftains

               The Canadian proposals now on the desks 
               <br />
               submitted by the head of a sovereign government 
               <br />

               <br />
               and given many strange names. This, if I may say 
               <br />
               so, is hardly good ethics. Either they are good or 
               <br />
               they are not good; but perhaps the ﬁery en-

               thusiasm of the gentleman from Bonavista 
               <br />
               Centre has unwittingly helped to strengthen

               much of the criticism which these proposals have 
               <br />
               received. He may have meant well, but as far as 
               <br />
               I am concerned, confederation is not the brain-

               good friend, Major Cashin. It does seem to me, 
               <br />
               sir, that the debates and discussions have 
               <br />
               developed into a marathon, a rush to ring the 
               <br />
               voters’ doorbells, a scramble to see who gets 
               <br />
               there first with the most. Ironically enough, it 
               <br />
               may well be that in the finals, we will have 
               <br />
               brought too little much too late. I apologise for 
               <br />
               having perhaps generalised too much, but in view 
               <br />
               of the fact that my associate, the very able mem-

               <br />
               with a brief summing up of some particular

               is properI suppose, since two of the greatest fears 
               <br />
               of our race are death and taxes. Making a ﬁne 
               <br />
               speech in his usual very able way, Mr. Hollett 
               <br />
               told of taxes on the house, on the boat, on ﬁshing 
               <br />
               equipment. Now, it may well be that Mr. Hollett 
               <br />
               assumed such taxes would be necessary under the 
               <br />
               provincial set-up to pay for cost of government. 
               <br />
               Certain it is, that Mr. Hollett had no intention to 
               <br />
               tell Newfoundlanders that they were paying taxes 
               <br />
               now; for presently at the end of the fiscal year, 
               <br />
               the cost of government will have extracted from 
               <br />
               our people something in the vicinity of $40 mil- 
               <br />
               lions. Mr. Hollett very properly pointed out that 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen may have to pay a tax or license to 
               <br />
               operate ﬁshing equipment under confederation. 
               <br />
               May I be personal, Mr. Chairman, and get dis- 
               <br />
               trict-minded and be guilty of that Bonavista Bay 
               <br />
               provincialism? In 1946 a schooner in which I had 
               <br />
               an interest ﬁshed in the Province of Quebec. 
               <br />
               There was no tax other than a license fee of $10 
               <br />
               per codtrap. Thus the maximum taxes collected 
               <br />
               from the schooner amounted to exactly $30.... 
               <br />
               Against that, if I could have purchased supplies 
               <br />
               in that Canadian Labrador port, the cost of 
               <br />
               production of that schooner would have been 
               <br />
               reduced by not less than 25%. Furthermore, that 
               <br />
               same province pays a bonus to ﬁshermen for all 
               <br />
               small boats. That doesn’t exist here, Mr. Chair- 
               <br />
               man, except in cases of boats 12 tons and up; and 
               <br />
               my guess is that 90% of Newfoundland ﬁshing 
               <br />
               boats are less than ten tons. The ordinary New— 
               <br />
               foundlander does not need to be told that taxes 
               <br />
               are necessary, with that he is not greatly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con«</span> 
               <br />
               cemed. What does concern him is this: who will 
               <br />
               pay the taxes? Will it be, as it ever was in this 
               <br />
               country, placed on the backs of the toiling ﬁsher— 
               <br />
               men. the industrious farmer, least able to bear it?

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Chairman, we must not ask our people to 
               <br />
               accept conclusions that are disturbing or fantas- 
               <br />
               tic, or other than those that cool logic would 
               <br />
               allow. Mr. Fogwill talked a few days ago of 
               <br />
               excise taxes, excise duties, sales taxes, luxury 
               <br />
               taxes, presenting an imposing array of ﬁgures 
               <br />
               which, in my estimation at least, has singled him 
               <br />
               out as a topnotcher in mathematics. He pointed 
               <br />
               out how an extra $10 million from such sources 
               <br />
               would be extracted from Newfoundlanders, and 
               <br />
               thus go to enrich to coffers of the government of 
               <br />
               Mackenzie King. What Mr. Fogwill apparently 
               <br />
               forgot in his breakdown of ﬁgures and his ob- 
               <br />
               vious concern at their huge dimensions was just
