               I might be expected to comment on the man— 
               <br />
               ner in which we were told that in respect to local 
               <br />
               government we could please ourselves. That is 
               <br />
               largely true, but the truth was not fully presented. 
               <br />
               Local or municipal government in Canada is 
               <br />
               obliged to render greater and more costly services 
               <br />
               to the communities where they exist than they are 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland. For instance, half the cost of 
               <br />
               public relief, half the cost of education is thrown 
               <br />
               by the provincial government into the hands of 
               <br />
               local governments or councils as we know them. 
               <br />
               I do not grumble about the possibility of having 
               <br />
               to do this; what concerns me is the ability or 
               <br />
               inability of a council to take care of these added 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">obligations,</span> I can see in such a possibility the loss 
               <br />
               of the ground we have already gained, and a great 
               <br />
               and lasting injury done our people. But even 
               <br />
               these matters are secondary and could be 
               <br />
               sacriﬁced to great national principles if such 
               <br />
               could be served. Judged in this light, this union 
               <br />
               with Canada falls short again. For this is not a 
               <br />
               division; it is not a partition, it is absorption, it is 
               <br />
               the swallowing of a little country that was once 
               <br />
               called Newfoundland, and many of the 
               <br />
               privileges, many of the advantages which we 
               <br />
               now enjoy may cause indigestion to the Canadian 
               <br />
               appetite.

               The coming referendum and the few remain-

               <br />
               Jacob the brother replied, “Sell me thy

               <br />
               die what will my birthright avail me?" Thus he 
               <br />
               would lose forever the birthright for which he had 
               <br />
               so little account, and all for a mess of pottage.

               Mr. Figary Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the 
               <br />
               motion which is now before the Chair. In listen- 
               <br />
               ing to addresses of members of this Convention 
               <br />
               at this time and at other times, I have come to this 
               <br />
               conclusion: that there have been too many long- 
               <br />
               winded addresses which have been corrupting 
               <br />
               and confusing the minds of the people. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               We are here, Mr. Chairman, with this in mind: 
               <br />
               after considering the changes that have taken 
               <br />
               place in this country since 1934, to recommend 
               <br />
               to His Majesty’s Government in Great Britain 
               <br />
               suitable forms of government to be placed before 
               <br />
               the people in a national referendum, who will 
               <br />
               decide as to the future set-up, and I will not try to 
               <br />
               block any form of government going on the ballot 
               <br />
               paper, and I do not think it advisable for any other 
               <br />
               member to try and do so. We have thousands and 
               <br />
               thousands of people who favour confederation 
               <br />
               with Canada, and I do not think it right and 
               <br />
               reasonable for us, as members of this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion, to try and deprive them of that privilege. In 
               <br />
               speaking of the terms offered by the Canadian 
               <br />
               government, some I cannot accept but to a large 
               <br />
               extent, to my mind, they are quite favourable. 
               <br />
               The people of this country are looking for some- 
               <br />
               thing better than what they have been getting, and 
               <br />
               let us all hope that when the ballot is taken, a 
               <br />
               decision will be made in the right direction. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now, I am not at all sure that this country is 
               <br />
               so wonderfully prosperous today as we have been 
               <br />
               asked to believe. I will admit some people are 
               <br />
               prosperous, but there are thousands of fishermen 
               <br />
               and labourers who are still looking for this 
               <br />
               prosperity that they hear so much about. There 
               <br />
               are thousands of our people who are struggling 
               <br />
               day by day and week by week with the terrible 
               <br />
               high cost of living, a cost of living that seems to 
               <br />
               climb higher and higher month by month. It takes 
               <br />
               pretty high wages today for a working man to 
               <br />
               support a family. And what about the thousands 
               <br />
               who don’t get high wages in Newfoundland? I 
               <br />
               have noticed for a long time that the cost of living 
               <br />
               has an ugly habit of rising much faster than wages 
               <br />
               ever do. The ﬁshermen and workers get hit every 
               <br />
               time. This Convention must not run away with 
               <br />
               the idea that all our people in this country are so 
               <br />
               wonderfully prosperous. I can tell you plainly 
               <br />
