               <br />
               10% of the $20 million. That is much higher than 
               <br />
               the average rate in Canada. In Canada, from all 
               <br />
               the revenue they collect from the people of 
               <br />
               Canada, 4.28% is in customs duty. If they col-

               <br />
               foundland, they would be collecting a higher

               <br />
               in fact from the people of Canada. I say it is a 
               <br />
               reasonable assumption. Instead of collecting 
               <br />
               more than $2 million in customs duties, if it 
               <br />
               works out as it does generally in Canada, it will
