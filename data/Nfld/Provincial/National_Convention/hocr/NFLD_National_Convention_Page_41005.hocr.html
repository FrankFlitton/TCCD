               New in Volume 1, on page 2, there is a list of

               contents of chapter 3 — functions of certain 
               <br />
               federal boards, agencies, and offices, etc. I don’t

               <br />
               are, as I see it, six or seven of these matters that

               seem as though they might have some impor- 
               <br />
               tance, which we might take up. I was thinking, 
               <br />
               for example, of the Canadian Broadcasting Cor- 
               <br />

               sion; and another, the Foreign Exchange Control

               Board, and the National Film Board, the National 
               <br />
               Harbours Board, the National Research Council, 
               <br />
               and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. I 
               <br />
               thought that we might take up these and go 
               <br />
               through them and then turn to some other 
               <br />
               matters. New page 105 of the Black Book deals

               discussion of federal revenues and expenditures 
               <br />

               <br />
