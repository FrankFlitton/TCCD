               Mr. Smallwood When the report of the Local 
               <br />
               Industries Committee was brought in here, that 
               <br />
               report quoted a special memorandum prepared 
               <br />
               for the Committee by the Industrial Development 
               <br />
               Board, and I was particularly struck at the time 
               <br />
               by the reference to cement. The Industrial 
               <br />
               Development Board pointed out What a great pity 
               <br />
               it was that the two main ingredients necessary to 
               <br />
               make cement were separated from each other by 
               <br />
               roughly the width of the country. One was on the 
               <br />
               eastern side of the country, and the other on the 
               <br />
               western. The cost of bringing the two together 
               <br />
               was what caused it to be dropped. Now the Min- 
               <br />
               ing Committee brings a different light on the 
               <br />
               matter. I remember after the remarks I made 
               <br />
               when the Local Industries Report was being 
               <br />
               debated I ran into the Mayor of St. John’s, who 
               <br />
               was very enthusiastic about the matter. He told 
               <br />
               me that the St. John’s Municipal Council uses 
               <br />
               50,000 bags a year.... That’s only one case. If you 
               <br />
               could get cement in this country at reasonable 
               <br />
               price there would be thousands of people using it 
               <br />
               for foundations of their homes and for the erec- 
               <br />
               tion of buildings of all kinds, with remarkable 
               <br />
               progress in construction and industry. This is 
               <br />
               evidently one of the most important sections of 
               <br />
               this report. It absolutely contradicts the report of 
               <br />
               the Industrial Development Board.

               According to this, in the Port—au-Port area

               <br />
               limestone, and silica clay. These are the articles 
               <br />
               necessary for the manufacture of cement. They

               <br />
               Mr. Higgins could tell us if anyone is interested, 
               <br />
               and if there is any move on foot to start a cement 
               <br />
               industry, and could he throw a little light on this: 
               <br />
               “T he main question is, of course, whether or not 
               <br />
               cement could be produced at a cost comparable 
               <br />
               to the cost of the imported article." What is meant 
               <br />
               by that? What would be the cost? There would be 
               <br />
               the cost of mining and bringing them together to 
               <br />
               the point of the hydro-electric development, etc, 
               <br />
               all which, surely, should not cost any more, 
               <br />
               speaking generally, than anywhere else. Labour 
               <br />
               is certainly no better paid in this country than in 
               <br />
               Canada, generally speaking, and certainly no bet- 
               <br />
               ter than in the States. You can develop hydro— 
               <br />
               electric energy in this country as cheaply as 
               <br />
               anywhere. What are the prospects of making 
               <br />
               cement? Is there anything doing?

               more than I have on this matter. The last sentence
