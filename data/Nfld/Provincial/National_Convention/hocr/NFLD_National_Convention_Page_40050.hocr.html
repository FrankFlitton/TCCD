               I have been asked if I would give to the mem-

               I have always regretted that we are not so well 
               <br />
               equipped in Newfoundland as in some other 
               <br />
               countries to measure this factor, which is being

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,obtained</span> by reference to the appendix on page 
               <br />
               528 of the survey, edited by Dr. MacKay, to 
               <br />
               which I have already referred. It will be noted that 
               <br />
               lack of adequate basic information has prevented 
               <br />
               the writer from making more than a rough es— 
               <br />
               timate and has compelled him to make it with 
               <br />
               reference to a pre-war period. His estimate 
               <br />
               amounted to approximately $45 millions per 
               <br />
               annum, which he suggests had been doubled 
               <br />
               during the war. I do not know whether any of the 
               <br />
               members present are familiar with the intricacies 
               <br />
               of calculation of national income according to the 
               <br />
               formulae normally employed. It is a very compli- 
               <br />
               cated business and no statistical calculations can 
               <br />
               be of much value unless adequate and accurate 
               <br />
               basic information is available. It is certainly not 
               <br />
               available in Newfoundland at the present time 
               <br />
               and the only practical way of getting down to the 
               <br />
               task would probably be to take samples of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> 
               <br />
               dividual incomes of cross-sections of the com-

               munity as a basis to work on. One of our greatest 
               <br />
               difﬁculties in obtaining basic statistics in New- 
               <br />
               foundland has been the reluctance and suspicion 
               <br />
               of the persons called upon to give the necessary 
               <br />
               information, and it will need something in the 
               <br />
               nature of an educational campaign before we can 
               <br />
               obtain the data which we require for the purposes 
               <br />
               we are considering. Our difficulties are all the 
               <br />
               greater because of our scattered population and 
               <br />
               because such a large proportion of our population 
               <br />
               work as individuals rather than as wage-earners 
               <br />
               in industrial undertakings. I might add that not—

               <br />
               make it clear that, although our statistical infor-

               <br />
               it is nevertheless much more complete than it was 
               <br />
               a few years <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ago.</span> We have indeed made <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consider</span> 
               <br />
               able advance in this direction and, moreover, we 
               <br />
               have greatly improved the methods of collating 
               <br />
               the information obtained. Returns of imports and 
               <br />
               exports are, for example, now produced quarterly 
               <br />
               and much more promptly than formerly. I have 
               <br />
               brought with me a copy of those for the quarter 
               <br />

               There is no doubt that our taxable capacity has 
               <br />
               increased considerably since before the war. The 
               <br />
               country is stronger in a number of ways and a 
               <br />
               good deal of money has been spent in the reor- 
               <br />
               ganization and improvement of the fisheries, but 
               <br />
               there is still room for considerable development, 
               <br />
               as the chairman of the Fisheries Board pointed 
               <br />
               out the other day. To increase our standards of 
               <br />
               living we must, of course, increase our output per 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">capita.</span> Although we cannot expect the price of 
               <br />
               ﬁsh to continue at its present level, there are 
               <br />
               promising signs, such as the activities of the 
               <br />
               International Food Organisation, which suggest 
               <br />
               that a determined effort will be made to stabilise 
               <br />
               prices and to ensure that primary producers are 
               <br />
               given a fairer deal than they often were in the 
               <br />
               past. We have a number of promising new in- 
               <br />
               dustries, such as the canning factory which is 
               <br />
               being installed on the west coast, and the 
               <br />
               prospects of the paper and logging industries, for 
               <br />
               the next few years at any rate, are distinctly 
               <br />
               bright: the companies concerned are looking for 
               <br />
               additional labour. The future in regard to mining 
               <br />
               is not quite so clear, but work is steady at the 
               <br />
               present. We also have to take into account the 
               <br />
               several thousands of men engaged in steady 
               <br />
