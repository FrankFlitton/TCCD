               <br />

               <br />
               because I was the father of that clause, and the

               other members of the delegation will agree with 
               <br />

               time in the interpretation of any of the clauses,

               to which I think you want to address yourself? 
               <br />
               Mr. Penney That’s right, Mr. Chairman. In

               every other report brought in to this Convention 
               <br />
               on Newfoundland affairs, the general procedure 
               <br />
               was for the chairman of each committee to bring 
               <br />
               in the report and make a general explanation of it 
               <br />
               and leave it to the delegates to discuss it, and as 
               <br />

               man. This gentleman is completely out of order. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman That is not quite correct, Mr. 
               <br />
               Penney.... It was pointed out that some mode 
               <br />
               of procedure had to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">adopted.</span> The mode 
               <br />
               adopted was that the person who should pilot this 
               <br />
               measure, if you will, through the committee of 
               <br />
               the whole, should be such a person as appointed 
               <br />
               by me. In that connection, Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               produced and read from a letter from Mr. Bradley 
               <br />
               stating his inability to be present, and asking Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood to deputise for Mr. Bradley. I in- 
               <br />
               timated to members at that time that if you vested 
               <br />
               in me the power to appoint somebody to pilot the 
               <br />
               terms, then I would appoint Mr. Smallwood. As 
               <br />
               far as I know the Convention ratiﬁed my appoint— 
               <br />
               ment, and as far as I am now concerned Mr. 
               <br />
               Penney, however unwelcome it may appear to 
               <br />
               you, I have to hold at this time that Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood is only following the procedure that 
               <br />
               he was directed, at the instance of the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion, to follow, when he was appointed by me 
               <br />
