               school. Now let us ask ourselves some questions. 
               <br />
               We have had ﬁve years, ten years, 50 years 
               <br />
               without representative government, what then? Is 
               <br />
               the imperial government so naive that a group of 
               <br />
               citizens is going to grow up in Newfoundland that 
               <br />
               are going to jump in and after 14 years under the 
               <br />
               dictates of a dictatorship, be Sir Robert Bonds, 
               <br />
               Gladstones and Lloyd Georges? Even those 
               <br />
               Commissioners took some of those politicians 
               <br />
               they blackened and who, if the people had to 
               <br />
               elect, would not have elected them. What in 
               <br />
               heaven’s name was going to happen when this 
               <br />
               rest period was over? I suppose the smiling lord 
               <br />
               envisaged such a good government, that when the 
               <br />
               period was up we would be all saints, and after 
               <br />
               this 14 year period we would automatically, like 
               <br />
               a child, copy our elders. But what have we had? 
               <br />
               I’ll admit the Commission of Government has 
               <br />
               done some good — Napoleon did that, so did 
               <br />
               Hitler —-— and I want every red—blooded New- 
               <br />
               foundlander to weigh it up. Did the bad outweigh 
               <br />
               the good, or vice versa? I am the last one in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland to pat our old politicians on the 
               <br />
               back. Parliamentary procedure won’t allow me to 
               <br />
               say what I thought about them. A lot was good 
               <br />
               according to their time and place. They did a lot 
               <br />
               with a little. That you got to hand to them, but as 
               <br />
               fit to govern, no, and in the United States and 
               <br />
               Canada today the same old game is going on. I 
               <br />
               have seen some juicy things that would open your 
               <br />
               eyes, and things in Britain that were not so hot. 
               <br />
               There was the little story of our bonds, and this 
               <br />
               National Convention would not be held today if 
               <br />
               the Swedes had been as foolish as other govem— 
               <br />
               ments. The world would be likely singing 
               <br />
               “Deutschland Uber Alles”. You know there is no 
               <br />
               Iron Curtain for a sailor, he gets inside it. Now 
               <br />
               come back home, we suffered from too much 
               <br />
               selfishness, that both in the high and low. In fact 
               <br />
               to put it mildly we got the type of government we 
               <br />
               deserved, and I believe the Commission of 
               <br />
               Government has done some good in that they 
               <br />
               have taught us a lesson. But did we get a rest from 
               <br />
               politics? Although none of those men had to face 
               <br />
               the electorate, yet we ﬁnd public wharves built 
               <br />
               where there were only two boats, while other 
               <br />
               wharves, one costing $80,000, went into discard. 
               <br />
               It cost $1 million to build a railroad from Whit— 
               <br />
               boume to Heart’s Content under those politicians 
               <br />
               playing dirty politics, yetit cost $223,000 to build 
               <br />
               a road on the railroad bed and they have no road 
               <br />

               I have before me two documents -— one a 
               <br />
               report on Public Health and Welfare, which never 
               <br />
               was debated because we have another which is 
               <br />
               sub judice. I don’t know what this hambone Latin 
               <br />
               is, but it looks sub juicy to me. We were promised 
               <br />
               when we took it that there was an investigation 
               <br />
               on and that we, in time, would hear all about it. 
               <br />
               Well, it is dated March, 1946. Two years is long 
               <br />
               enough to have something like this cleared up. I 
               <br />
               cannot recommend this form of government to 
               <br />
               the people. There are all sorts of rumours out 
               <br />
               about it running anywhere from $100,000 to $1 
               <br />
               million adrift. The Auditor General says a ﬁnal 
               <br />
               and deﬁnite opinion cannot be recorded by him, 
               <br />
               as to the causes of errors and omissions without 
               <br />
               investigating matters which are outside his 
               <br />
               proper functions. The Auditor General says it is 
               <br />
               his duty to inform the Commission of Govem- 
               <br />
               ment that in his view the time has come for an 
               <br />
               enquiry to be made. Well, we were informed an 
               <br />
               enquiry was going to be made and we would 
               <br />
               know the outcome of it, but that’s as far as it has 
               <br />
               gone. I think myself it’s unfair for this stuff to be 
               <br />
               around charging people. If an investigation has 
               <br />
               been held we should be told about it, the innocent 
               <br />
               cleared, the guilty punished -— or the Auditor 
               <br />
               General told he was getting off a lot of hot air. 
               <br />
               It’s not possible that any graft is going on in a 
               <br />
               government the country believes is clear of those 
               <br />
               things — that could only happen under crooked
