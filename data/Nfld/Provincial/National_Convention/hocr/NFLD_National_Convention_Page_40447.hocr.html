               and put in your stores... It seems to me there is 
               <br />
               something lacking. Our men get no more money 
               <br />
               than the Norwegians and the Greeks. They get 
               <br />
               $120 a month. lean assure you there is no place 
               <br />
               in the world where wages are so small as in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland today. We never got more than 
               <br />
               $50 a month and often $30. I never got $30 on a 
               <br />
               Norwegian ship and I am sure they are as good 
               <br />
               as ours are. I am not satisﬁed with the answer 
               <br />
               given as to why we have not got a merchant 
               <br />
               marine. I think it is because there is an easierway 
               <br />
               to get money than to worry about where your 
               <br />
               ships are, and what they are doing, and where 
               <br />
               they are going to ﬁnd freights. That’s the trouble 
               <br />
               today.... You take the Prospero and the Portia,l 
               <br />
               they are still running, but they should have been 
               <br />
               diesel 25 years ago. These ships were repaired 
               <br />
               after they left here and I can’t see why they could 
               <br />
               not have carried on to a ripe old age. The Kyle 
               <br />
               could have been turned to oil too, and when you 
               <br />
               look at the money that’s spent every year in the 
               <br />
               coastal service of this country you can see that 
               <br />
               those ships are too costly to operate, and the same 
               <br />
               thing applies to everything. I would not be 
               <br />
               surprised that if Scandinavian or British owners 
               <br />
               came to Newfoundland they would make those 
               <br />
               ships pay, because in the ﬁrst place you have got 
               <br />
               the men — 460 men today are under register up 
               <br />
               at the railway ofﬁce waiting for jobs. I am sure 
               <br />
               it’s a disgrace that our country has got into this 
               <br />
               place when you take the place we were in 60 or 
               <br />
               80 years ago. We could have operated in the bad 
               <br />
               times for $20 and $25 a month and a lot of men 
               <br />
               would have been glad to get jobs, in fact I know 
               <br />
               men who signed on for $15 a month to get jobs. 
               <br />
               I can’t see why we pay more, and get more 
               <br />
               overtime. I believe something should be done in 
               <br />
               this line.

               Mr. Hollett Speaking of the mercantile marine, 
               <br />
               it is no use to have a mercantile marine unless we 
               <br />
               have something to put in the bottom, so to speak. 
               <br />
               Those ﬁgures that Mr. Ashboume has been so 
               <br />
               kind as to produce show that in I945 we could 
               <br />
               apparently ship less than 2% of our ﬁsh as mer— 
               <br />
               chantable. What has happened? Did the Commit- 
               <br />
               tee ﬁnd out the cause? Is it possible that our 
               <br />
               people can’t make Merchantable ﬁsh? I can 
               <br />

               Mr. Starkes In my opinion what is wrong is that 
               <br />
               years ago we always had our ﬁsh graded as 
               <br />
               merchantable, Madeira or West India. The 
               <br />
               people tried to get merchantable, which was the 
               <br />
               best price, but the past two years our ﬁsh has been 
               <br />
               graded as merchantable, Madeira, Thirds and 
               <br />
               West Indies. Thirds and West Indies are actually 
               <br />
               the same, but they have been receiving the same 
               <br />
               price for it as Madeira, Thirds and Madeira being 
               <br />
               the one price. They are not encouraged to make 
               <br />
               Madeira ﬁsh. If we had only three prices they 
               <br />
               would be encouraged to make good fish.

               Mr. Smallwood I raised that matter in the first

               <br />
               all the codﬁsh exported which is classiﬁed as 
               <br />
               merchantable. Is that the only word that is used? 
               <br />
               Is some merchantable ﬁsh exported from the 
               <br />
               country under some other name?.... Frankly I 
               <br />
               don’t believe that only 2% of the ﬁsh exported is 
               <br />
               Merchantable. I don‘t believe it, and I am not

               going to believe the Fisheries Board or the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cus»</span>

               <br />
               catch somewhere. Does it go out under some 
               <br />
               other name, and if so what is that name? For 
               <br />
               instance take shore fish, which is one quality of
