               Mr. Harrington Mr. Chairman, it seems to me 
               <br />
               that if Mr. Wheare at the outset of this Conven~ 
               <br />
               tion had given us a little talk we might be further 
               <br />
               ahead, instead of ﬂoundering around in amend- 
               <br />
               merits and substantive motions. However, when 
               <br />
               we started we thought the best way to get at the 
               <br />
               facts was by breaking up into committees. With 
               <br />
               regard to Mr. Smallwood’s statement I see no 
               <br />
               reason to change my stand from a week ago. I did 
               <br />
               not at any time tell Mr. Smallwood that I would 
               <br />
               support his motion and I wish that to go into the 
               <br />
               record. I did always lend a sympathetic ear to 
               <br />
               what he had to say. I am against the amendment 
               <br />
               to the amendment. The way I feel about the whole 
               <br />
               thing now is to see it thrown out. However, the 
               <br />
               position has been clariﬁed somewhat, and there 
               <br />
               is nothing we can do about it. I do not see why 
               <br />
               we should rush this thing, which is premature 
               <br />
               anyway. We have been 14 years under one form 
               <br />
               of government and surely we can stand to wait 
               <br />
               for another form for a reasonable while. But I 
               <br />
               want to make it clear that I did not say at any time 
               <br />
               thatI would support Mr. Smallwood’s motion.

               Mr. Butt Mr. Chairman, it is rather strange, but 
               <br />
               the essence of the two questions before the Chair 
               <br />
               is simple. Do you or do you not want terms from 
               <br />
               Canada and do you or do you not want them now? 
               <br />
               In speaking thus I expect I am expressing the 
               <br />
               view of a great many people. Personally I do not 
               <br />
               want them now and I am voting against the mo- 
               <br />
               tion.

               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, just a few 
               <br />
               words in reply to Mr. Harrington. He says he did 
               <br />
               not promise to vote for the motion 1 introduced, 
               <br />
               and I do not think that I said this afternoon that 
               <br />
               he had so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">promised.</span> What I did say this afternoon 
               <br />
               is that months ago Mr. Harrington told me that he 
               <br />
               would vote to get the terms of confederation, but 
               <br />
               he did not promise me with regard to this par- 
               <br />
               ticular motion of mine. I would like to reply to 
               <br />
               other remarks made with regard to this rushing 
               <br />
               business of getting the terms. I wonder if rushing 
               <br />
               is quite the right term to use. For 13 years we have 
               <br />
               had Commission of Government; for 79 years we 
               <br />
               have had responsible government and for 23 
               <br />
               years we have had representative government. 
               <br />
               Now the country has spent over 100 years under 
               <br />
               those three forms of government and I fail to see 
               <br />
               how the Convention would be rushing in this 
               <br />
               particular instance. It is true my motion had not 
               <br />
               speciﬁed the time with regard to the sending of a 
               <br />
               delegation to Canada but merely proposed that 
               <br />
               negotiations be held as soon as possible with the 
               <br />
               Canadian government relative to the terms of 
               <br />
               federal union. I realise some members voted 
               <br />
               against my motion as they were sincere in their 
               <br />
               belief that to accept it would be to taking a 
               <br />
               premature step, and in this connection <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> 
               <br />
               Bradley’s motion was for the primary purpose of 
               <br />
               meeting the objections of those who claimed that 
               <br />
               the original resolution was premature. Now my 
               <br />
               motion merely called for the accumulation of 
               <br />
               facts regarding possible confederation, whilst the 
               <br />
               amendment suggested that the collection of such 
               <br />
               facts be postponed for an indeﬁnite period, so that 
               <br />
               the acceptance of the amendment would only 
               <br />
               leave the matter open for future and acrimonious 
               <br />
               debate which would not be the best interests of 
               <br />
               the Convention. My resolution was simply to 
               <br />
               procure facts relevant to confederation, but 
               <br />
               would in no way give a delegation power to 
               <br />
