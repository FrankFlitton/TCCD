               I don’t think it is proper or right for any man 
               <br />
               in this Convention, with a microphone six inches 
               <br />
               away from his nose, to be continually getting up 
               <br />
               and damning anybody in this country. Whether 
               <br />
               they have done wrong in the past or not, that‘s not 
               <br />
               our job. Our job is to get the facts and present 
               <br />
               them to the people. The idea of these 
               <br />
               microphones is not so that a man can get up and 
               <br />
               display himself as a patriot to the people of the 
               <br />
               country. I do not agree that any man has a right 
               <br />
               to commandeer a microphone which is by his 
               <br />
               nose day after day, and give no other man a 
               <br />
               chance to speak. I say that with due respect to all 
               <br />
               the men who have the microphones near them. I 
               <br />
               do not intend to tolerate this. The thing has to be 
               <br />
               properly regulated or else the microphones will 
               <br />
               have to be taken away. No man should be able to 
               <br />
               get up and monopolise the air for three quarters 
               <br />
               of the time this Convention is sitting, and set

               himself up as a champion of the cause of the 
               <br />
               common man. I do not intend to stand this any

               point raised by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mri</span> Smallwood where he said 
               <br />
               there were 2,800 men or something. Any man 
               <br />
               who has any knowledge of mining knows that it 
               <br />
               is a pretty heavy job, and the men can’t stay down 
               <br />
               in the mines day after day for 363 days in the year, 
               <br />
               and there is considerable absenteeism. Some of 
               <br />
               the men do not work more than three quarters of 
               <br />
               the workable days of the year. That’s the explana— 
               <br />
               tion. You will ﬁnd that in every mine in the world.

               Mr. Ashbourne About the weighing of the ore, 
               <br />
               I don’t know how the compnay pays their men if 
               <br />
               it is not weighed. Is it by so much per ton?

               Mr. Hollett They pay them so much per day.

               <br />
               out by ships, and I presume it is sent out at a 
               <br />
               certain freight rate, which is so much per ton I 
               <br />

               the Mining Committee a question. How long do 
               <br />
               you figure it will take this Convention to reach 
               <br />

               Mr. Higgins I was going to add a paragraph 
               <br />
               from the minutes we took at our meeting with 
               <br />
               Mr. Anson that probably would explain a lot of 
               <br />
               the talk we have had: “0n the ore we sold to the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom this year we ﬁnally came to a 
               <br />
               price agreement with them in March (1946). That 
               <br />
               price agreement was negotiated on the basis of 
               <br />
               what they wanted to buy for, and what we wanted 
               <br />
               to get. Eventually we got this ﬁgure, their last 
               <br />
               offer. We had to make estimates of what it would 
               <br />
               cost us to produce on that basis, which meant 
               <br />
               putting all mines into full operation and making 
               <br />
               our estimates based on production of prewar 
               <br />
               days. We thought we could ship for what they 
               <br />
               offered and make a few cents. Unfortunately it 
               <br />
               did not turn out this way. On all the ore we are 
               <br />
               shipping this year to England I expect to show a 
               <br />
               loss of 30 cents per ton. You cannot run a business 
               <br />
               that way. Their price is always negotiated in 
               <br />
               sterling. We have to convert into dollars. If 
               <br />
               England next year will buy the ore at the same 
               <br />
               price she paid us this year, due to the drop in 
               <br />
               sterling, and between that and the loss this year, 
               <br />
               we have got 60 or 70 tons to make up. We have 
               <br />
               got to sell the ore and break even. If somebody 
               <br />
               can tell us the answer to that one I would like to 
               <br />

               Mr. Bailey A short time ago I was reading an 
               <br />
               article on ore, etc, and the question of Wabana 
               <br />
               came up, and also the question of steel. It said that 
               <br />
               because of the low content of the ore from 
               <br />
               Wabana, the steel works in Sydney were up 
               <br />
               against it; also that the ore in Labrador was of a 
               <br />
               higher grade, a superior ore, and it looks like in 
               <br />
               the next few years when the Labrador mines 
               <br />
               come into effect that the United States and 
               <br />
               Canada would make a change, and in that case it 
               <br />
               would give the low grade ore of Bell Island a 
               <br />
               chance. I think they have been having it pretty 
               <br />
               tough as far as I can ﬁnd out...
