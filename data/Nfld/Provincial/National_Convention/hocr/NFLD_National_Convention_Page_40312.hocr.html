               forward with any degree of optimism to being 
               <br />
               self~supporting, when we consider the enormous 
               <br />
               expenditure at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">present,</span> However, this may not be 
               <br />
               a true <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">picture,</span> We have been told that our 
               <br />
               economy is affected by things outside our con- 
               <br />
               trol. This is only partly true and might be partially 
               <br />
               overcome by a revised policy with a progressive 
               <br />
               programme to lessen these outside inﬂuences. 
               <br />
               Also we should produce in this country as much 
               <br />
               of our necessities which can economically be 
               <br />
               produced. We have plenty fish, and I am con- 
               <br />
               vinced and I believe the report of the Agriculture 
               <br />
               Committee will convince you that we can 
               <br />
               economically produce beef, pork, veal, lamb, 
               <br />
               chicken, potatoes, cabbage and turnips — besides 
               <br />
               other vegetables — as also milk and butter. If we 
               <br />
               can do this we should be able to export fish 
               <br />
               enough to give us a good surplus for luxuries, 
               <br />
               after buying the essential foods, clothing, etc., 
               <br />
               which we cannot produce ourselves.

               It should be obvious that the salvation of this 
               <br />
               country is primarily the fisheries from which the 
               <br />
               bulk of the proﬁts are ploughed back into the 
               <br />
               industry. Fresh frozen fish in particular should be 
               <br />
               encouraged and exploited to the full with an 
               <br />
               advertising campaign to secure more markets, 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bottoms.</span> Most important if we are to encourage 
               <br />
               young men to go back to the ﬁsheries is that we 
               <br />
               re-organise the whole set-up for a more equitable 
               <br />
               distribution of the profits so that the primary 
               <br />
               producer, the ﬁsherman, gets returns capable of 
               <br />
               giving his family the ordinary amenities of life.

               As pointed out we should expect some assis- 
               <br />
               tance in securing markets, by reason of the lease 
               <br />
               of bases to the United States of America and 
               <br />
               Canada. Most Newfoundlanders feel that we got 
               <br />
               a rotten deal as we got only the labour value of 
               <br />
               construction, and even this was considerably 
               <br />
               reduced due to our own government limiting the 
               <br />
               rate which Newfoundlanders should be paid. 
               <br />
               These bases were necessary for the joint defence 
               <br />
               of the United Kingdom, the United States of 
               <br />
               America and Canada; therefore we should get 
               <br />
               special consideration by all three countries, 
               <br />
               whether by tariff concessions or otherwise in the 
               <br />
               development of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">markets.</span> I will not now deal with

               Most delegates have spoken of conditions in

               <br />
               will permit me, I would make a few observations 
               <br />
               on my district. Road conditions in general are far 
               <br />
               below the level of secondary highroads with 
               <br />
               many sections without any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">roads.</span> The people of 
               <br />
               Colinet Island, where there are two settlements 
               <br />
               of about 50 families who make a comfortable 
               <br />
               living from the ﬁsheries, have been seeking for 
               <br />
               years assistance in the building of six miles of 
               <br />
               road. Colinet island is about one—half mile from 
               <br />
               Admiral’s Beach, a settlement on the mainland, 
               <br />
               six miles from O’Donnell’s, which at the present 
               <br />
               time is the end of the road connecting through to 
               <br />
               St. John’s and other points on the Avalon. It is 
               <br />
               unnecessary for me to elaborate on the con~ 
               <br />
               venience and necessity of this road to these 
               <br />
               people. Another instance of neglect is the settle- 
               <br />
               ment of North Harbour, one of the best harbours 
               <br />
               on the Newfoundland coast, where they have no 
               <br />
               road nor even telephone communication. Five 
               <br />
               miles of road would connect North Harbour with 
               <br />
               the Argentia hi ghroad at a point near Colinet. The 
               <br />
               lack of it necessitates a motorboat journey of 20 
               <br />
               miles, and in the case of medical attention or 
               <br />
               hospitalisation, this is not only very unpleasant 
               <br />
               and dangerous, but sometimes impossible. Both 
               <br />
               these settlements get a weekly mail service, 
               <br />

               office or mail service. I could go on picturing the

               utter disregard towards the people of Trepassey,
