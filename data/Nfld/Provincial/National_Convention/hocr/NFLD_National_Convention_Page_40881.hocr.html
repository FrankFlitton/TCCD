               tion 20.... Suppose I am 641/2 years old. I know 
               <br />
               at the age of 70 I am going to get the old age 
               <br />
               pension of $30 per month; I have my wife too. I 
               <br />
               am allowed $240 a year private income. I know 
               <br />
               that they may come and assess my house as being 
               <br />
               worth $10 a month or $120 a year. Then I would 
               <br />
               be allowed to earn only $120 a year. Sol transfer 
               <br />
               my house over to my son within ﬁve years. or say 
               <br />
               four years and nine months before 1 am 70, so that 
               <br />
               when I apply for the old age pension at 70 I have 
               <br />
               no income; I do not own the house. To prevent 
               <br />
               that from happening, if it is worth $500 or more, 
               <br />
               the government can say —— you transferred your 
               <br />
               house within the last ﬁve years. Was that done 
               <br />
               for the purpose of qualifying for the pension, so 
               <br />
               that you could meet the means test? In that case 
               <br />
               they can remedy it. Remember always the old age 
               <br />
               pension is only for those who need it. They have 
               <br />
               a scheme coming up in the next two or three years 
               <br />
               for universal old age pensions for everyone alive 
               <br />
               in Canada at the age of 65. That is a horse of a 
               <br />
               different colour.... That is a contributory scheme. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hickman You interrupted me to give an 
               <br />
               answer on the three years’ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">support.</span> You went off 
               <br />
               on something else. Now that you have got on it, 
               <br />
               it means that if the old age pensioner wishes to 
               <br />
               apply for and obtain a pension at the age of 70, 
               <br />
               he then has to make over his property to his 
               <br />
               children before he is 65 and has to go on for six 
               <br />
               years before he receives a pension, with no 
               <br />
               property in his own name. He would have to 
               <br />
               make over his property six years before he be- 
               <br />
               came pensionable, otherwise he cannot make a 
               <br />
               transfer under that section of the act?

               <br />

               agine, if we went into confederation with 
               <br />
               Canada, our laws governing this province have 
               <br />
               to be along the same lines of the other nine 
               <br />
               provinces. Pressure would be brought to bear on 
               <br />

               see how Mr. Smallwood can justify it — if 
               <br />
               anyone comes into this House they will have to 
               <br />
               fall in line with the general charters of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinv</span> 
               <br />
               ces. This is the sore spot in this. Mr. Hickman has 
               <br />
               put his ﬁnger on it. No odds how much we care 
               <br />
               for our sons and want to help them, I do not think 
               <br />
               we want to transfer our property until we have 
               <br />
               finished with it. There are cases where people 
               <br />
               who transferred their property over, even to their 
               <br />
               own sons, have had a pretty tough time after- 
               <br />
               wards. The whole thing does not look good to me. 
               <br />
               I do not know which way to take it. We have 
               <br />
               worked hard and done the best we can, and if the 
               <br />
               country gives us a pension, it should be given 
               <br />
               with no strings to it...

               Mr. Smallwood It is entirely wrong to assume 
               <br />
               as Mr. Bailey has done that the laws the Province 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland may pass are the laws other 
               <br />
               provinces pass. The laws the provinces pass will 
               <br />
               depend on the kind of legislature and House of 
               <br />
               Assembly each has. In British Columbia there is 
               <br />
               a coalition, a House of Assembly made up of 
               <br />
               Liberals and Tories; there is the Alberta govem- 
               <br />
               ment made up of the Social Credit party; in 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan they have a CCF legislature; 
               <br />
               Manitoba has a Liberal legislature; Ontario is 
               <br />
               Conservative or Tory; the Province of Quebec is 
               <br />
               nationalistic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—</span> Union Nationale; Nova Scotia, 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick have 
               <br />
               Liberal legislatures. The kind of laws that the 
               <br />
               legislature for each province will pass, and the 
               <br />
               kind of laws the Newfoundland House of As— 
               <br />
               sembly will pass, will depend on the kind of 
               <br />
               government it has... Let any other province have 
               <br />
               any other law it likes, that has nothing to do with 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us.</span> We make our own laws. Take for instance 
               <br />
               education, you have not the same laws in all the 
               <br />
               provinces. Education is an entirely provincial 
               <br />
               matter; so it is in a hundred other things. Where 
               <br />
               the province rules it rules. They are not told how 
               <br />
               to rule by anyone else. 
               <br />

               Mr. Bailey 1 am not interested in the kinds of

               government in Canada; my point is, whoever is 
               <br />
               in the government in this country will have to find 
               <br />
               the money to run it. Those nine provinces have 
               <br />
               had nearly 100 years of confederation and they 
               <br />
               ought to know something about it. We are com-

               ing into a ﬁeld we have not been in before. We 
               <br />
               have to follow some precedent. Whether we are 
               <br />
               Conservatives or Union Nationale, we have to 
               <br />
               find the money to do this. I have no doubt that in
