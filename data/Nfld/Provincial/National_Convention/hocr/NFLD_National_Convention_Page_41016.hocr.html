               Mr. Smallwood, and I have had something to do 
               <br />
               with making up an Economic Report, I believe it 
               <br />
               should be the work of the committee that went to 
               <br />
               Ottawa to do it. I am exonerating no one, I am 
               <br />

               <br />
               delegation should have been in a position when 
               <br />
               they returned here to lay the goods on the table 
               <br />
               as regards our position if we become a province 
               <br />
               of Canada. That has not been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">done.</span> There are 
               <br />
               some things in this Black Book, or one of the 
               <br />
               Black Books, and I will give you an itemjust to

               show you how foolish it is, while I am on my feet. 
               <br />
               I don‘t have to look at it. Mr. Chairman, if the 
               <br />
               members will turn up the ﬁnance revenue that 
               <br />
               they have estimated in that Black Book, we find 
               <br />
               repayments from the Housing Corporation 
               <br />
               brought in as prospective revenue for a province. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mrt</span> Chairman, would you ever think anything so 
               <br />
               silly? Because it is money which should go back 
               <br />
               to where it was borrowed from, and it is not 
               <br />
               revenue of the province, it is repayment of loans, 
               <br />
               and it is not a revenue.

               <br />
               adopted it in the beginning, and have to carry it 
               <br />
               on to the end. It is immaterial to me whether we

               here forever now. We are accustomed to being

               here, and the people are laughing at us for being 
               <br />
               here, because that’s all we are, a laughing stock. 
               <br />
               There is a matter on which I want to say a few 
               <br />
               words this afternoon, as people have been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">blow.</span> 
               <br />
               ing off steam, and that’s the matter of the public 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">debt.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman No, notjust yet. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin I am speaking to the members of the 
               <br />
               committee, and I am entitled to mention this 
               <br />
               matter, the public debt of Canada. In this book 
               <br />
               there is nothing regarding the public debt of 
               <br />
               Canada —— nothing. Why? Is that honesty on the 
               <br />
               part of the Canadian government? They were 
               <br />
               going to enter into a partnership with New- 
               <br />
               foundland, and they certainly put down 
               <br />
               Newfoundland’s debt and pointed out why they 
               <br />
               were going to take off $64 million or $65 million, 
               <br />
               whatever it might be; but they conveniently and 
               <br />
               deliberately refrained from putting in their own 
               <br />
               public debt, and showing the per capita debt of 
               <br />
               Canada as against the per capita debt of New- 
               <br />
               foundland, and I say that is done deliberately. in 
               <br />
               view of the fact that we questioned other figures 
               <br />
               in here, and that this $9.4 million has not been 
               <br />
               explained properly to this Convention, i am jus— 
               <br />
               tiﬁed therefore in saying that the exclusion of the 
               <br />
               Canadian public debt from being set side by side 
               <br />
               with the Newfoundland public debt has been 
               <br />
               deliberate, because we are going into partnership, 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman. And what do we find the 
               <br />
               Canadian public debt is today? We will use their 
               <br />
               ﬁgures this time, not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mine.</span> We ﬁnd that the total 
               <br />
               debt of Canada, federally now I am speaking, the 
               <br />
               total debt is $18,890,359,000.

               <br />
               Mr. Cashin Gross. And its per capita debt is 
               <br />
               $1,492.89. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Gross.
