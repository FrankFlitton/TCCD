               November 20, 1947. 
               <br />
               Dear Mr. Smallwood: 
               <br />
               Due to my absence from the Convention, 
               <br />
               I wish you to move the motion that is on the 
               <br />
               order paper in my name, and to pilot the 
               <br />
               debate in committee of the whole. 
               <br />
               Sincerely, 
               <br />
               F. Gordon Bradley. 
               <br />
               1 therefore move order No. 2 on the order paper. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman The motion is that the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion resolve itself into a committee of the whole 
               <br />
               to consider and discuss the proposals received on 
               <br />
               November 6 from the Right Honourable the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister of Canada. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins Before that motion is put, I would 
               <br />
               like to make a few remarks. Two or three days 
               <br />
               ago I suggested a private session to discuss the 
               <br />
               manner in which this particular motion is to be 
               <br />
               discussed. It was not thought ﬁt by members at 
               <br />
               that time that we should have a private session, 
               <br />
               but that it should be discussed in public. There- 
               <br />
               fore I should like to have a full discussion on how 
               <br />
               it is proposed to give effect to this resolution. If 
               <br />
               the Convention goes into committee of the 
               <br />
               whole, how is it proposed that we discuss this 
               <br />
               matter? Are we going to read through the Black 
               <br />
               Books? Ithink we should have some deﬁnite plan 
               <br />
               of action before we turn ourselves into a commit- 
               <br />
               tee of the whole, and know where we are going. 
               <br />
               Probably you, sir, could give us some idea of how 
               <br />
               we should be guided in the matter. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman This is a procedural question 
               <br />
               before the Chair. The advisability or otherwise of 
               <br />
               proceeding with this matter by committee of the 
               <br />
               whole is a procedural question which must be 
               <br />
               decided by the Convention... I think, however, 
               <br />
               your request is quite reasonable. In view of the 
               <br />
               fact that Mr. Bradley is sick, his request is that 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood should pilot this matter though 
               <br />
               committee of the whole; if you do not mind, Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood, would you be good enough to en- 
               <br />
               lighten us on how you think you should go about 
               <br />
               it? 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins The last part of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr,</span> Bradley’ s letter 
               <br />
               is quite improper. It is a matter for the committee 
               <br />
               to appoint its chairman. Mr. Bradley has nothing 
               <br />
               to do with appointing him. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman In my own limited experience 
               <br />
               here, the Finance Report and the Economic 
               <br />
               Report were piloted by a chairman not nominated 
               <br />

               by this Convention. Therefore there is no depar- 
               <br />
               ture from established precedent in Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood‘s presiding without a vote to that 
               <br />
               effect from the Convention. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins Surely it must be agreed to by 
               <br />
               somebody. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman It is purely a procedural matter 
               <br />
               which should have been dealt with, perhaps, by 
               <br />
               the Steering Committee... I am not prepared, not 
               <br />
               having examined the documents, to express an 
               <br />
               opinion as to the modus operandi if and when the 
               <br />
               Convention resolves itself into a committee of the 
               <br />
               whole. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood What I had in mind was, ﬁrst 
               <br />
               of all, not to make any long speeches in commit- 
               <br />
               tee of the whole; secondly, not to read through 
               <br />
               this communication from the Prime Minister of 
               <br />
               Canada; thirdly, not to read through the Black 
               <br />
               Books (that is, the report of the delegation). My 
               <br />
               proposal was to do this: immediately upon going 
               <br />
               into committee of the whole to read first, two or 
               <br />
               three passages from the speech of the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister of Canada opening our conference in 
               <br />
               Ottawa; secondly, one or two passages from the 
               <br />
               speech of Mr. Bradley in reply to the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister, because these two speeches gave the 
               <br />
               setting to the conference. Then, thirdly, I was 
               <br />
               going to read the letter of the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               contained in the Grey Book. Having done that, I 
               <br />
               was going to read clause one of the communica— 
               <br />
               tion of the basis of union, explain what that clause 
               <br />
               meant, and then sit down. If any member wishes 
               <br />
               to direct questions at me, beating on clause 1, I 
               <br />
               would attempt to answer. If any member cared to 
               <br />
               make comments on Clause 1, he would, of 
               <br />
               course, be free to do so. Clause I having been 
               <br />
               disposed of, I then proposed to read clause 2, with 
               <br />
               some brief explanation of it, then sit down. Same 
               <br />
               procedure, clause by clause; to refer to the Black 
               <br />
               Books (the report of the delegation) only by way 
               <br />
               of explaining any point that required explanation. 
               <br />
               It seems to me that if we followed that proce- 
               <br />
               dure in a businesslike fashion, and tackled this 
               <br />
               communication clause by clause, consulting the 
               <br />
               documents — the supporting papers, so to speak, 
               <br />
               we should be able to get through this thing in 
               <br />
               eight or ten days. 
               <br />
               Mr. Fudge As I understand it, due to Mr. 
               <br />
               Bradley’s illness he is unable to appear and he 
               <br />
               asks Mr. Smallwood to take over the piloting. 
               <br />
               Does that mean that when Mr. Bradley is medi- 
               <br />
