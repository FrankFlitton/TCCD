               <br />
               spoke about four ships, each about 3,000 tons 
               <br />
               gross and carrying about 5,000 tons of cargo with

               <br />
               built for the ice and should have their chill-rooms 
               <br />

               We can export too, there is nothing unsound 
               <br />
               in this. Also with woods operations, in carrying

               I picked up a paper the other day and saw that 
               <br />
               renders were being called for the Thackeray,2 
               <br />

               <br />
               have a ship for less than $300,000 for the trade of 
               <br />
               the country that perhaps would net the Railway 
               <br />
               $100,000. I interviewed the government 
               <br />
               authorities on it. They said they investigated but 
               <br />
               were not interested. If they bought her they would 
               <br />
               have no deﬁcit on the docks this winter as she 
               <br />
               would give work. The actual cost to the country 
               <br />
               would be little as the cash would be left in the 
               <br />
               country. No, the government cannot go into the 
               <br />
               business that pays, only the non-paying services 
               <br />
               come under their glance... If we are going to feed 
               <br />
               our people we must plan what is best for them 
               <br />
               and the country. The laissez-faire ways of the past 
               <br />
               must go as far back as the “Indian meal” days of 
               <br />
               our grandfathers‘ time. Now we must plan, and I 
               <br />
               believe the country has the resources. All we 
               <br />
               want is the brains, brawn and capital, and we have 
               <br />
               the last two. Is it possible that we haven’t got the 
               <br />
               brains to plan? We have the resources. There’s 
               <br />
               no doubt about that. We must awake to the fact 
               <br />
               that we must combine scientiﬁc knowledge with 
               <br />
               skill and change from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">worn‘out</span> ways of the 
               <br />
               past.

               We are ﬁshing the same way as in my grand- 
               <br />
               father’s day when a horn lantern and a compass, 
               <br />
               an open galley on deck, a jigger and dabber was 
               <br />
               about the whole equipment. Most places ﬁsh now 
               <br />
               with nets known as traps for fish to swim into. If 
               <br />
               the ﬁsh don’t swim in, all is lost. That era is past. 
               <br />
               The trap today must go. In my day, as a boy, the 
               <br />
               cod-seine was a part of the equipment of every 
               <br />
               second schooner. Today there is not a cod-seine 
               <br />
               around Newfoundland. If there is, I haven‘ t heard 
               <br />
               of it this last 30 years. The trap is going the same 
               <br />
               way, believe it or not. Take the increase of ﬁsh 
               <br />
               caught in Greenland. Fish are changing their 
               <br />
               habits, and this is where scientiﬁc knowledge and 
               <br />
               planning must go hand in hand, and we have to 
               <br />
               do it. Take our competitor, Iceland; 80% of her 
               <br />
               exports are from the sea. The money the govem- 
               <br />
               ment spent there paid off. And now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they’ve</span> had
