               <br />

               <br />

               three ﬁrms in Philadelphia and I wrote them; 
               <br />
               what do you think the price was? $12 a ton. How

               <br />

               <br />
               to import his feeds direct. If a farmer wants 100 
               <br />
               sacks of fertiliser he should be able to get a permit 
               <br />

               ﬁrst and brought back again. The same thing 
               <br />

               <br />
               more than he should, by reason of the fact that it

               Mr. Fudge I visited Midland a number of times

               fail to see the use of encouraging those men and 
               <br />
               spending a lot of money, without giving them

               protection in connection with marketing. We see

               ads in the papers advertising local potatoes. Sure-

               ly those men should be able to sell their 
               <br />
               vegetables. I regret that we get potatoes from 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island, and that’s the reason why 
               <br />
               some of our small farmers are unable to sell. I 
               <br />
               believe the government should see that their

               vegetables are sold before any are brought in
