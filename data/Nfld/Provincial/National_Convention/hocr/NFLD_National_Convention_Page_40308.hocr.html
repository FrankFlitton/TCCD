               Mr. Burry I would like to express my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfac»</span> 
               <br />
               tion about this supplementary report dealing with 
               <br />
               Labrador area. When the report came in ﬁrst I 
               <br />
               was very reluctant to accept the ﬁgures of 50 to 
               <br />
               100 million cords in Labrador, but now that we 
               <br />
               have the result of this survey made by the 
               <br />
               Bowater Pulp and Paper Co., which is reliable, I 
               <br />
               am satisﬁed that we do have a very fine bulk of 
               <br />
               timber in Labrador.... On this 6,000 square miles 
               <br />
               there is 25 million cords of wood, and that ter- 
               <br />
               ritory is drained by the great rivers of Labrador, 
               <br />
               Hamilton, Nascopie, Goose, etc. It is a wide area 
               <br />
               and takes in the lower waters of these rivers. l was 
               <br />
               pleased that Mr. Lewin says that it is possible to 
               <br />
               put in a sulphite mill in that area. The supplemen- 
               <br />
               tary report speaks of a paper mill going up on the 
               <br />
               southwest coast. Labrador will be pleased to be 
               <br />
               able to feed that mill. I always had doubts of that 
               <br />
               but Mr. Lewin knows what he is talking about, 
               <br />
               and he says it is possible. Of course that will be 
               <br />
               one of the conditions under which any conces- 
               <br />
               sions are given for this timber.

               I have been tempted to ask for roads, etc. for 
               <br />
               Labrador, but I don’t think we should take up the 
               <br />
               time for that. I do ask your indulgence for a few 
               <br />
               minutes about the possibilities of the sulphite 
               <br />
               mill. We have 130 - 140 families in this area that 
               <br />
               are going to be robbed almost completely of their 
               <br />
               means of livelihood down through the ages. They 
               <br />
               are trappers, and go far aﬁeld, and when this 
               <br />
               wood cutting project starts in these rivers, 
               <br />
               naturally it is going to destroy the trapping 
               <br />
               grounds, not only in the immediate vicinity but it 
               <br />
               will bring in other outside people who will not 
               <br />
               observe the customs and unwritten laws of these 
               <br />
               people under which they have been trapping all 
               <br />
               these years. These have been observed religious- 
               <br />
               ly among the people. Their trapping grounds 200 
               <br />
               miles away are going to be destroyed and their 
               <br />
               work spoilt. It will take a long time for them to 
               <br />
               change from that to wood cutting, and they are 
               <br />
               very much afraid of it. I think it is of great 
               <br />
               importance that whatever government is in power 
               <br />
               in the future Labrador is going to be represented 
               <br />
               on it, and this will be a point brought out at that 
               <br />
               time. I want the members to bear this in mind, 
               <br />
               when they do become members of the next
