               Several times since this debate began it has 
               <br />
               been hinted or bluntly stated that if we go into 
               <br />
               confederation the Newfoundlanders working on 
               <br />
               the American bases would lose their jobs. Major 
               <br />
               Cashin apparently couldn’t resist the temptation 
               <br />
               to make the statement. If this were true, if those 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">23,000</span> Newfoundlanders now working on the 
               <br />
               American bases were to lose their jobs because 
               <br />
               of confederation, or if they could be made to 
               <br />
               believe that they’d lose their jobs, that would 
               <br />
               mean many thousands of votes against con- 
               <br />
               federation. Now what’s the truth? Every member 
               <br />
               of the Ottawa delegation knows the truth, for the 
               <br />
               matter was raised by me in our talks with the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada, and every member of the 
               <br />
               delegation remembers what happened. We were 
               <br />
               told bluntly that the American bases would 
               <br />
               remain here. Mr. St. Laurent told us bluntly that 
               <br />
               the American bases would remain here as 
               <br />
               American bases. They would not be disturbed, 
               <br />
               and that the men would not lose their jobs through 
               <br />
               confederation. More than that, we were assured 
               <br />
               that an ofﬁcial statement would be made in Par- 
               <br />
               liament this winter to this very effect. And I see 
               <br />
               that since then Mr. St. Laurent in a public an- 
               <br />
               nouncement in Canada, sir, at a press conference 
               <br />
               has announced publicly to the world that the 
               <br />
               American bases in Newfoundland will not be 
               <br />
               disturbed by confederation. The American bases 
               <br />
               will go right on as though nothing had happened. 
               <br />
               And later this year there will be a statement in the 
               <br />
               Parliament of Canada itself, an ofﬁcial statement 
               <br />
               to that effect, saying that in plain words. The 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders working on the bases may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> 
               <br />
               come deceived on this matter for a short while,

               but they’ll know the full tmth before the referen-

               tion exists with regard to the 4,000 men who are 
               <br />
               employed on our railway system. A strong effort 
               <br />
               has been made to persuade our railroaders that 
               <br />
               some of them would lose their jobs under con- 
               <br />
               federation. The cold-blooded truth of course is 
               <br />
               that their only hope of not losing their jobs is 
               <br />
               confederation, their only hope. Sixty men have 
               <br />
               lost their jobs in the last few days already in 
               <br />
               Port-aux-Basques.... If we don’t get confedera— 
               <br />
               tion, if our transporation system is not taken over 
               <br />
               by the Canadian National Railways, then 
               <br />
               hundreds of railroaders are doomed to layoffs and 
               <br />
               wage cuts. Confederation is their only hope of 
               <br />
               security, stability, steady wages and expanding 
               <br />
               opportunities. When the matter came up early in 
               <br />
               the debate, I said I would settle it once and for all. 
               <br />
               I addressed the following question to the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment of Canada: “To ask His Excellency the 
               <br />
               Governor in Commission to ask the Government 
               <br />
               of Canada to state whether in the event of union 
               <br />
               and the consequent operation of the New- 
               <br />
               foundland railway steamship system by Canada, 
               <br />
               whether it would be the policy of the Government 
               <br />
               of Canada to continue in their employment all the 
               <br />
               employees of the system at the time of union, 
               <br />
               with the rights and privileges with respect to 
               <br />
               continuity of employment that are accorded to 
               <br />
               employees of the Canadian National Railway.” 
               <br />
               Now I ask you to note careﬁilly how I worded 
               <br />
               that question, for you may be sure that the 
               <br />
               Canadian government noted the wording very 
               <br />
               carefully. I did not ask if it would be their policy 
               <br />
               to hold on to some of the employees of the 
               <br />
               Railway, but all the employees existing at the 
               <br />
               date of union. That’s why it breaks my heart to 
               <br />
               see 60 men laid off today in Port-aux-Basques. I 
               <br />
               want to see no railroader laid off until after this 
               <br />
               referendum, not another man. Because all who 
               <br />
               are employed on the railway at the date of union 
               <br />
               will be kept on and it’s a shame to see a man laid 
               <br />
               off before that. I did not ask if it would be the 
               <br />
               Canadian government’s policy to hold on to some 
               <br />
               of the employees, but all the employees existing 
               <br />
               at the date of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">union...</span> My question was unmis— 
               <br />
               takable in its meaning. And what was the 
               <br />
               Canadian government’s answer? I’ll read it to 
               <br />
               you: 
               <br />
               As provided in clause 17.1 of the proposed 
               <br />
               arrangments, if the Canadian National Rail— 
               <br />
               ways were to assume responsibility for the 
               <br />
               operation of the Newfoundland Railway and
