               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">returns.</span> We saw the crowds of tourists in the 
               <br />
               country this year, even though no preparations 
               <br />
               had been made for their accommodation. We 
               <br />
               have seen all during the war years the potential 
               <br />
               visitors we will have, even if members of the 
               <br />
               forces and their relatives only came here once. 
               <br />
               All that goodwill that has been built up is in grave 
               <br />
               jeopardy by a government which, rightly or 
               <br />
               wrongly, is pursuing a most extraordinary policy. 
               <br />
               I have criticised Major Cashin in this House 
               <br />
               earlier in the debates about remarks made about 
               <br />
               this government. I am beginning to wonder if he 
               <br />
               is not right and I am wrong. Because the attitude 
               <br />
               of this government today is utterly incomprehen- 
               <br />
               sible; and your report, Mr. Smallwood, is the 
               <br />
               same thing. All we have to do is look at the 
               <br />
               correspondence between the Tourist Board and 
               <br />
               the Commissioner for Public Utilities leading up 
               <br />
               to the resignation, the most discourteous treat~ 
               <br />
               merit any body of citizens was ever handed in this 
               <br />
               country by any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government,</span> It is hard to realise 
               <br />
               that in the Commission of Government are three 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders who subscribed to the letters 
               <br />
               shown in this correspondence.

               The correspondence began September, 1945, 
               <br />
               urging on the government the necessity of taking 
               <br />
               action about the tourist policy. After a lot of 
               <br />
               cajoling they ﬁnally agreed to have two experts, 
               <br />
               one at a time —— the Mathes agency was the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               one, they came down and made a survey in 1945, 
               <br />
               and they made their report.1 On page I you will 
               <br />
               note: “Has Newfoundland a tourism potential 
               <br />
               worth developing? Our answer is most emphati- 
               <br />
               cally <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">YES,”</span> They 2give reasons why. You have 
               <br />
               the report of Oliver who comes back in his report 
               <br />
               this year entirely agreeing with the Mathes agen— 
               <br />
               cy. On page 1 Oliver says, “Newfoundland has a 
               <br />
               very considerable tourist potential, and there 
               <br />
               should be no doubt of that. I have not attempted 
               <br />
               to detail it, because Mathes’ presentation to your 
               <br />
               Board has already done so in comprehensive 
               <br />
               fashion.” These two reports were all any govern~ 
               <br />
               ment should need to be quite certain they were on 
               <br />
               the right track. They had their own Board’s 
               <br />
               recommendation for years before that; their con- 
               <br />
               stant urging on the govemment for action; and 
               <br />

               then to bolster that position that had these two 
               <br />
               agencies make these very valuable reports. And 
               <br />
               what do they do? All we have to do is refer

               <br />

               careful consideration to this report, and con-
