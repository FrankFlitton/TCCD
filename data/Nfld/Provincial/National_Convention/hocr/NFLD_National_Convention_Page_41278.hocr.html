               with any great amount of enthusiasm. Even more 
               <br />
               signiﬁcantly, people outside this chamber have 
               <br />
               not allowed themselves to be carried away by its 
               <br />
               rosy contents. The answer to this is not hard to 
               <br />
               ﬁnd. Newfoundlanders are as a whole a realistic 
               <br />
               and common sense people. They know by hard 
               <br />
               experience that pennies don’t fall from heaven. 
               <br />
               They look with suspicion on anyone who tells 
               <br />
               them they are going to get something for nothing. 
               <br />
               In spite of all the high pressure sales talk, in spite 
               <br />
               of all the hour-long speeches our people are still 
               <br />
               suspicious. In the meantime this Canadian 
               <br />
               prospect is being stripped down to its frame and 
               <br />
               the stufﬁng has been taken out. In short the thing 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’</span> is being debunked and Santa Claus is having his 
               <br />
               whiskers pulled off. If I were to give credit to any 
               <br />
               one man for his valuable service in showing up 
               <br />
               this confederation issue, it would be Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood. His over-eagerness to convince us 
               <br />
               showed us that we should not allow ourselves to 
               <br />
               be convinced, and above all, he is the one who 
               <br />
               impressed it indelibly on our minds, that we 
               <br />
               should not for a moment consider anything that 
               <br />
               would be of sound presumption. We remember 
               <br />
               how, when the Economic Report was brought in 
               <br />
               with its modest three year forecast, he denounced 
               <br />
               the committee for daring to make any forecast. 
               <br />
               Such things, he said, were not worth the paper 
               <br />
               they were written on. Mr. Smallwood told us it 
               <br />
               was neglect for us to work on the basis of 
               <br />
               presumption. And this same gentleman, this hater 
               <br />
               of presumption and forecast, came in here and 
               <br />
               coolly asked us to accept his budget based on no 
               <br />
               less than an eight year forecast. Well, we knew 
               <br />
               then just what we were up <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> We knew just 
               <br />
               how much value we could place on all that he had 
               <br />
               said before. I at least am duly grateful to Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood for his distinguished service in help-

               Mr. Chairman, I do not intend to waste the 
               <br />
               time of this Convention by dealing in detail with 
               <br />
               the report before the Chair. Other members have 
               <br />
               already dealt with the ﬁgures contained in it. 
               <br />
               They have dealt with them as they deserved, and 
               <br />
               it is not worthwhile kicking a dead horse We 
               <br />
               know that they are unreliable. I feel sure that all 
               <br />
               intelligent Newfoundlanders already know this, 
               <br />
               but there are doubtless many who have not the 
               <br />
               means of getting in touch with our deliberations, 
               <br />

               and they are still under a delusion. It should be 
               <br />
               the prime duty of all of us to get the truth to these 
               <br />
               people. I heard a lot of talk about taxes. But I note 
               <br />
               that when Mr. Smallwood is asked about certain 
               <br />
               taxes, he tells us that the Canadians won’t put that 
               <br />
               tax on us, that will be the matter for the provincial 
               <br />
               government. Is he trying to give us the impression 
               <br />
               that since the federal government won’t impose 
               <br />
               a particular tax, it won’t be imposed at all? We 
               <br />
               know too well that every tax necessary to balance 
               <br />
               our budget will be placed on our people. What 
               <br />
               does it matter who takes our taxes, so long as we 
               <br />
               have to shell out our dollars? This is one point 
               <br />
               you will not hear Mr. Smallwood talking about. 
               <br />
               All he has told us are the good things. For in- 
               <br />
               stance, they say that every Newfoundland child 
               <br />
               under a certain age will be entitled to a baby 
               <br />
               bonus. But why not say that the same child after 
               <br />
               he comes of age will spend the rest of his life 
               <br />
               paying back the baby bonus in taxes? They tell 
               <br />
               us all of all the beneﬁts which will come to our 
               <br />
               workers under confederation. But they do not tell 
               <br />
               us that under confederation every small industry 
               <br />
               and factory in the island will be put out of busi- 
               <br />
               ness and its workmen out of jobs. In St. John’s 
               <br />
               alone, Mr. Chairman, and throughout the country 
               <br />
               in a few years those industries will be reduced 
               <br />
               and our people out of work and forced to go and 
               <br />
               make a living elsewhere. In time, all we will have 
               <br />
               in this country will be the very young and the very 
               <br />
               old. Why not tell about the Canadian tax collector 
               <br />
               who will go around selling our people’s proper- 
               <br />
               ty? Why not tell our people that no government 
               <br />
               on earth gives its people something for nothing; 
               <br />
               that for every dollar the Canadian government 
               <br />
               gives us, it will demand a dollar, perhaps more in 
               <br />
               return? We will be taxed here, there and 
               <br />
               everywhere. We will be taxed from the cradle to 
               <br />
               the grave. This report is only a reminder of the 
               <br />
               saying that ﬁgures sometime lie, that it is easy to 
               <br />
               put a bright coat of paint over an old rotten skiff 
               <br />
               and pass it off as something good. I suggest 
               <br />
               therefore, that in the matter of this Ottawa report 
               <br />
               we accept Mr. Smallwood’s own advice and ac- 
               <br />
               cept nothing which is not based on facts, and that 
               <br />
               we throw his eight year budget, with all its 
               <br />
               presumptions, into the waste basket where they 
               <br />
               belong. 
               <br />
