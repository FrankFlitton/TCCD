               <br />
               ledum would both have felt very much at home 
               <br />
               in this chamber during the past several weeks. Up 
               <br />
               until as late as only yesterday I had no intention 
               <br />
               of risking my reputation, such as that may be, by 
               <br />
               becoming involved in this great ﬂoundering 
               <br />
               around the Canadian mulberry bush that has been 
               <br />
               going on here for some time. When at this late 
               <br />
               moment I do so, it is against my better judgement, 
               <br />
               and because I have been unable to resist the 
               <br />
               temptation to have a final word upon a matter that 
               <br />
               I have been at pains to stress throughout this 
               <br />
               Convention. I have kept out of this debate so far 
               <br />
               for a great many reasons, and by no means the 
               <br />
               least of these has been that I had a very inadequate 
               <br />
               training for effective participation in the genesis 
               <br />
               and genius of such debate that has been going on 
               <br />
               in this chamber of immortals. You see, sometime 
               <br />
               when I was very young I had the very great 
               <br />
               misfortune of being taught that two and two make 
               <br />
               four, and I have believed that all my life. But 
               <br />
               whenever during this Convention I have tried to 
               <br />
               put two and two together, I have found that my 
               <br />
               argument has been misinterpreted as adding up 
               <br />
               to 3.999 or 4.111, or what is undoubtedly held in 
               <br />
               some quarters to be the ﬁnal treachery of all, an 
               <br />
               argument for confederation. Or again, I have to 
               <br />
               be of the mind that what matters most to the 
               <br />
               average man, once he is free in the practice of his 
               <br />
               religion, is three square meals a day. And that 
               <br />
               granted that, he doesn’t worry very much about 
               <br />
               who sits in the seat of government and gets the 
               <br />
               grant. But I have found that to say as much in this 
               <br />
               Convention, has been to invite condemnation as 
               <br />
               a materialist. This I have found to be strange logic 
               <br />
               indeed, particularly when I remember that in 
               <br />
               1933 the only answer of some of our best minds 
               <br />
               to all who took a stand against the surrender of 
               <br />
               our constitution was, “And how do you propose 
               <br />
               to feed this people?” I have failed completely to 
               <br />
               understand how it could be patriotism to worry 
               <br />
               about three square meals a day for all in 1933, but 
               <br />
               merely materialism to worry about three square 
               <br />
               meals a day for all in 1948. In consequence Ihave 
               <br />
               preferred to stay out of this debate by distortion. 
               <br />
               That, in my opinion, is exactly What it has been, 
               <br />
               and I will content myself with the statement that 
               <br />
               during this debate statements have been made, 
               <br />
               and many of them, calculated merely so to distort 
               <br />
               the whole confederation issue as to leave the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland people completely confused.

               On the one hand I have heard everything con~ 
               <br />
               ceiveable thrown at the idea of union. All the old 
               <br />
               arguments, all the skeletons of ancient bogies that 
               <br />
               have been dangling in the closet since 1869, have 
               <br />
               been given a new coat of whitewash and brought 
               <br />
               out for further service — all, that is, with one 
               <br />
               exception. I have heard no mention as yet of that 
               <br />
               most effective propaganda piece of 1869, that 
               <br />
               Canadians shoot babies out of cannons. I suggest 
               <br />
               that that is something not to be overlooked. For 
               <br />
               after all, it would be just as logical to expect 
               <br />
               people to believe that as to expect them to believe 
               <br />
               some of the things that I have heard in this cham~ 
               <br />
               ber during the past weeks. On the other hand, it 
               <br />
               is not impossible that some of our people may 
               <br />
               have been left with the impression that with con- 
               <br />
               federation, we should come into the inheritance 
               <br />
               of a new Jerusalem flowing with milk and with 
               <br />
               honey and with maple leafs. I have no objection 
               <br />
               to the coming of the millennium except, perhaps, 
               <br />
               that I think that I should find it dreadfully boring. 
               <br />
               But I don’t expect to see it come to pass in my 
               <br />
               time, and I very much doubt that my son will see 
               <br />
               it come to pass in his time. Being a reasonable 
               <br />
               man, I am quite prepared to think that Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood is not inclined to tell us that the 
               <br />
               millennium will come upon us in consequence of 
               <br />
               confederation.

               It is not my intention at this late date to try to 
               <br />
               sift for you the proof from the propaganda. But 
               <br />
               for the satisfaction of my own conscience, I have 
               <br />
               tried to keep in View the point that this debate was 
               <br />
               supposed to be about in the ﬁrst place, namely 
               <br />
               whether or not a fair and equitable basis may exist 
               <br />
               for federal union of Newfoundland and Canada. 
               <br />
               That is what the delegation was sent to Ottawa to 
               <br />
               investigate, and that is what each of us has to 
               <br />
               decide for himself upon the basis of the docu- 
               <br />
               ments submitted to us. The only alternative is to 
               <br />
               play it safe, and to avoid the issue and take refuge 
               <br />
               in a confession of inability to complete the work 
               <br />
               that in standing for election we undertook to do. 
               <br />
               I have no intention of going into the decision that 
               <br />
               I have come to in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matter.</span> I shall get around 
               <br />
               to that in the great ﬁnal debates that will follow 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">immediately.</span> For the moment, I want merely to
