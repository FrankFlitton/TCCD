               There are enough concrete facts in this report

               to convince the strongest critic that the charges

               so frequently laid against past statesmen in this 
               <br />

               <br />
               debt of about $35 million after 450 years of 
               <br />
               inhabiting and opening up a wilderness is not a 
               <br />
               bad showing. The amount at credit to capital 
               <br />
               account of treasury and people of $150 million is, 
               <br />
               in my opinion, most conservative. I feel

               whichever government succeeds the present, 
               <br />
               steps should be taken to effect a saving on our

               I feel the merchant navy branch of the service

               should have been segregated from the Railway

               <br />

               are on an island, we are not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self!</span> sufﬁcient, and

               bounds of reason. Our paper industry is making

               rapid strides, which can only be retarded by a

               <br />
               producing fruit and vegetables in a really big

               <br />
               entered the machine age in this respect, we can 
               <br />

               It has been generally agreed that it would not
