               Some people think, “We are ﬁshermen! How

               can this country expect ﬁshermen to carry on a 
               <br />
               mining operation?” To offset that, I would point 
               <br />
               out that in St. Lawrence we have a mine, and 
               <br />
               Mr. Poynter told us that when they went there 12 
               <br />
               years ago, the men around there were ﬁshermen 
               <br />
               and knew very little about mining, and now, 12 
               <br />
               years hence, they have very ﬁne miners, equal to 
               <br />
               any in the world.

               As far as the people in Labrador are con- 
               <br />

               These people suffer intensely from lack of funds.

               This mine is in Labrador. We want to see those

               coast and go into the interior of Labrador, and 
               <br />
               become miners and if anyone is in doubt that the

               <br />
               the ﬁrst question they would ask was, “When are

               we going to get our winter? You do not have low

               northern Ontario. We are certain you must have
