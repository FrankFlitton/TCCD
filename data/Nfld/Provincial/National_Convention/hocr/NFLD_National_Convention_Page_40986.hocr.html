               is a law in Canada which, as I pointed out before, 
               <br />

               is noted for treating them generously. Because 
               <br />
               the act says “may” and not “shall”, shall we

               Mr. Butt Mr. Chairman, I assume no such thing, 
               <br />
               and I would not dream of doing any such thing. I 
               <br />
               think Canada is a great nation, and anything I say 
               <br />
               is not anti-Canada. I admit quite freely that they 
               <br />
               have done great things for their veterans, and for 
               <br />
               their citizens for that matter. I admit that, but I do 
               <br />
               want to ﬁnd out the truth of it. Here we have a 
               <br />
               known parallel, but it is not put down in an act. 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne Well, that’s questioned as to 
               <br />
               whether or not we have that parallel. Of course 
               <br />
               the GWVA and the NPA as has been pointed out, 
               <br />
               has certain provisions for men who apply for 
               <br />
               them, but in this veterans‘ charter, sir, which is a 
               <br />
               book of 300 and some pages, the members can 
               <br />
               readily see the very same words as has already 
               <br />
               been read here, or printed here. I will just re- 
               <br />
               iterate them for members to check against them. 
               <br />
               “In Canada may receive an allowance.” Well, 
               <br />
               then he may receive the allowance. That is for the 
               <br />
               veterans' allowance, and that is the law in 
               <br />
               Canada. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Butt And the word is “may”, and that’s the

               right word. 
               <br />

               Mr. Chairman The point is that in statutory law

               “may" is permissible, and “shall" is mandatory. 
               <br />
               Therefore Mr. Butt takes the position that there

               is nothing mandatory in there. Therefore the point

               Mr. Chairman Mr. Butt’s point is simply this:

               that it must not be assumed that that action shall 
               <br />
               be applied. Quite obviously the word “may" is 
               <br />
               used to permit investigation, and if, upon inves-

               tigation it is found that there is no fraud employed

               <br />

               <br />
