               question either in your mind or your pockets. 
               <br />
               The cost of living here in Newfoundland has 
               <br />
               been referred to not only by Mr. Smallwood but 
               <br />
               by other speakers, and one would think to listen 
               <br />
               to them that with the stroke of a pen the cost of 
               <br />
               living will come down <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">considerably.</span> This is 
               <br />
               another false idea which people may get into their 
               <br />
               minds. If you will refer to the report made by the 
               <br />
               Federation of Labour on the cost of living today 
               <br />
               and the amount required by a man with a family 
               <br />
               to live, you will see (and here Mr. Fogwill can 
               <br />
               support me, as he was one of the members of the 
               <br />
               committee that drew up the report) that the duties 
               <br />
               paid on foodstuffs consumed amounted to not 
               <br />
               more than approximately 5% of the earnings 
               <br />
               spent in this direction, and if you further take into 
               <br />
               consideration the local products which such a 
               <br />
               family would buy here in a year, like potatoes, 
               <br />
               turnips, fish, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">etc.,</span> the total duty on that family’s 
               <br />
               outlay would amount to not more than about 
               <br />
               4.5%. Union with Canada will not bring us 
               <br />
               geographically any closer to the mainland and we 
               <br />
               will still have to freight our imports to this 
               <br />
               country and distribute them as before, and union 
               <br />
               with Canada or any other country cannot get 
               <br />
               away from this factor in the cost of goods to the 
               <br />
               consumer. Mr. Smallwood has referred to special 
               <br />
               freight rates operating east of Quebec which 
               <br />
               should reduce the rates, so that it would in turn 
               <br />
               bring down the cost on the goods. I might say, 
               <br />
               ﬁrstly, that freight rates are not a large percentage 
               <br />
               of the cost of the goods, but in any event this 
               <br />
               reduction of rates would apply only to those 
               <br />
               shipments through the Canadian National Rail— 
               <br />

               Mr. Hickman And the larger percentage of our 
               <br />
               goods coming into this country do so by steamers, 
               <br />
               operated by lines and companies other than those

               <br />
               portion of our goods are moved direct by steamer 
               <br />
               from that port to the west coast through Comer 
               <br />

               On this cost of living being cheaper, I wonder 
               <br />
               do people realise that at present there is no duty 
               <br />
               on flour, salt beef and pork, cooked corned beef 
               <br />
               in tins, butterine and tinned milk, which are all 
               <br />
               staple products in the people’s diet? In addition 
               <br />
               to this, we have items coming in duty free such 
               <br />
               as fresh fruit, prunes, currants, raisins, feeds, long 
               <br />
               rubber boots, fruit juices and vegetable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">juices,</span> All 
               <br />
               I have mentioned are duty free, and will not be 
               <br />
               affected by union with Canada. There are addi- 
               <br />
               tional items which have a very low duty basis 
               <br />
               such as peas, beans, rice and barley at 1 cent per 
               <br />
               1b., oatmeal and rolled oats at 1/2 cent per 1b., 
               <br />
               cornmeal at 1/8 cent per lb. The elimination of 
               <br />
               duty on these and a lot of other items will have 
               <br />
               no obvious effect on the cost of living, because 
               <br />
               the duty is so low that the removal of it will not 
               <br />
               easily be seen. But, however, union with Canada, 
               <br />
               while it may remove some of these very low 
               <br />
               duties, will place an 8% sales tax and excise duty 
               <br />
               on some of these items, and indeed on some of 
               <br />
               the more staple ones; the sales tax in many cases 
               <br />
               will more than offset the reduction of duty.

               Mr. Chairman, Mr. Smallwood did not point 
               <br />
               out to the people that ﬁshermen could buy their 
               <br />
               salt for approximately $2 per hogshead cheaper 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland; that oiled clothing per suit is 
               <br />
               not any higher in Newfoundland than it is in 
               <br />
               Canada, although we pay 20% duty on it; that 
               <br />
               herring nets in this country are slightly cheaper 
               <br />
               than in Canada; that rubber boots are cheaper 
               <br />
               here today than they are in Canada. To get this 
               <br />
               comparison of ﬁgures, I have used the ones <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sub«</span> 
               <br />
               mitted in the Black Book against local prices 
               <br />
               here, and I have written to Halifax and compared 
               <br />
               the prices existing in Canada only a month ago, 
               <br />
               because those in the Black Book were probably 
               <br />
               compiled six months ago. There may be some 
               <br />
               reductions in some items, but one must remember 
               <br />
               that this will be offset to a great extent by federal 
               <br />
               sales taxes, import duties and excise duties. In 
               <br />
               referring to the price for salt to the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               fishermen, which is $2 cheaper here, I might say 
               <br />
               that I cut down the Canadian hogshead to the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland hogshead... If Canada, as 
               <br />
               claimed by some, can do so much better for us 
               <br />
               (and with which I cannot agree), then why should 
               <br />
