               Mr. Cashin Mr. Chairman, before we proceed 
               <br />
               this afternoon there are a few remarks I want to 
               <br />
               make. One is that about 12 months ago Mr. K. M. 
               <br />
               Brown, a delegate to this Convention, was strick- 
               <br />
               en here in the discharge of his duty. Yesterday I 
               <br />
               received the following message from Mr. Brown, 
               <br />
               which I propose to read: 
               <br />
               Mr. R]. Cashin, SLJohn’s. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I eagerly awaited your report and sat up 
               <br />
               until midnight and listened to every word. It 
               <br />
               was one of the ﬁnest ever delivered in that 
               <br />
               famous chamber. Congratulations. We must 
               <br />
               have responsible government and all the

               Mr. Hollett Mr. Chairman, I rise to make a few 
               <br />
               remarks with regard to this long awaited Report 
               <br />
               of the Finance Committee on the economic side. 
               <br />
               First and foremost I would like at this moment to 
               <br />
               offer to that Committee and to its chairman, 
               <br />
               Major Cashin, my heartiest congratulations for 
               <br />
               the manner in which this report has been 
               <br />
               presented to us, and I feel that we owe them a debt 
               <br />
               of gratitude for the promptness with which they 
               <br />
               brought this report before us at such short notice. 
               <br />
               I am quite sure that we all agree, as we read 
               <br />
               through this, that these men have done an excel- 
               <br />
               lent job.... Each and every one of these men who 
               <br />
               has signed this report is in my opinion deﬁnitely 
               <br />
               an honest man.

               <br />
               here that this report was not an honest report. 
               <br />

               then they are dishonest. I cannot agree with the

               remark which was made by a certain speaker in

               <br />
               revenue from 1897 to Sept. 30, 1947 amounted 
               <br />

               properly audited, properly copied from the
