               <br />
               we are to build in the future. I am satisfied that 
               <br />
               then we can get down to work in earnest. I came 
               <br />
               here with no fixed views whatsoever, I still 
               <br />
               remain so, and, until I can see the picture of the 
               <br />
               future of the country, I will not decide in favour 
               <br />
               of any form of government Maybe I should go 
               <br />
               as far as to say that I am voicing the sentiments 
               <br />
               of others in this assembly. It is the ﬁrst time that 
               <br />
               such a gathering has come about, and this as- 
               <br />
               sembly will go down in history and will be 
               <br />
               remembered for what it did accomplish and what 
               <br />
               it did not accomplish in the interests of the masses 
               <br />
               of this country. At this time in the history of our 
               <br />
               country we have to consider the general welfare 
               <br />
               of the masses and not the few. The whole has to 
               <br />
               be considered and not the part. I think that is very 
               <br />
               important. Thank you. 
               <br />
               Mr. Fudge I feel that I cannot let this oppor— 
               <br />
               tunity slip by without making some remarks on 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood’s statement, wherein he said that 
               <br />
               our people were 100 years behind the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">times.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood No, I am talking about the 
               <br />
               country, not the people. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Mr. Smallwood, address the 
               <br />
               Chair please. 
               <br />
               Mr. Fudge I wish to say that during the past 
               <br />
               eight years I have represented at least5,000 of the 
               <br />
               people of this country. The general labouring 
               <br />
               man in this country is not 100, or even 50 years 
               <br />
               behind the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">times.</span> This is ridiculous, furthermore 
               <br />
               I will support the idea and the thought that there 
               <br />
               has been a little National Convention held outside 
               <br />
               this place by a few. 
               <br />
               Mr. Brown I did not intend at this particular 
               <br />
               time to have anything to say in connection with 
               <br />
               the resolution introduced by my honourable 
               <br />
               friend, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Smallwood. I may say to begin with, 
               <br />
               that whatever reason or whatever sympathy I 
               <br />
               would have with joining forces with Canada, 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood has killed it all in his address here 
               <br />
               this afternoon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*I</span> also think it is premature; we 
               <br />
               have not gotten though the business of this house 
               <br />
               —— the business we were sent here to do. Only two 
               <br />
               committees have reported There was an interim 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">report</span> of the Fisheries Committee, which report 
               <br />
               was referred back to them 2md I would say, for 
               <br />
               the information of the delegates, that the next 
               <br />
               report will be a ﬁnal one and that will not be for 
               <br />
               some time yet. After all, the ﬁshing industry is 
               <br />
               the greatest industry we have in this country and 
               <br />

               tion is concerned, there is nothing wrong with 
               <br />
               sending a delegation to Canada; that could be 
               <br />
               tolerated, but Mr. Smallwood in his address says 
               <br />
               Newfoundland is so far behind the times. I have 
               <br />
               travelled perhaps as far in Canada as Mr. Small- 
               <br />
               wood — I could not go any farther in Canada than 
               <br />
               I have been —- I have been through Alaska as 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">well,</span> and during these travels I learned much 
               <br />
               about Canada and Canadians, and I never thought 
               <br />
               our country and our people were so far in the 
               <br />
               background as Mr. Smallwood says. If that is his 
               <br />
               reason for introducing this resolution, then I do 
               <br />
               not see eye to eye with him. I am not a con- 
               <br />
               federate. If I could be convinced, perhaps I would 
               <br />
               be; but, Mr. Chairman, it will take a lot of con- 
               <br />
               vincin g before I cast a vote for confederation with 
               <br />
               Canada. Let us take the eastern provinces and ask 
               <br />
               the man on the street what he thinks of confed- 
               <br />
               eration; many have told us, “We are in now and 
               <br />
               we cannot get out; if we were out, we would never 
               <br />
               go in.” Again he referred to health and in par- 
               <br />
               ticular to tuberculosis; I might ask Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood if he has ever read a clipping in one 
               <br />
               of the Canadian newspapers in connection with 
               <br />
               the percentage of tuberculosis on the Gaspé coast. 
               <br />
               Perhaps Newfoundland can hold a candle with 
               <br />
               Canada, and Newfoundland is not as far back as 
               <br />
               100 years behind another country, and I say New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders are not 100 years behind other 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I did not say that, I said 50 
               <br />
               years behind and in some things 100 years. 
               <br />
               Mr. Brown Do you believe that? 
               <br />
               Mr. smallwood Yes. 
               <br />
               Mr. Brown I would not believe you or anyone 
               <br />
               else. You may go down below Cape Chidley and 
               <br />
               find a few Esquimaux who are that far behind. It 
               <br />
               was that kind of talk and the publication of it that 
               <br />
               got us where we are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today.</span> Your remarks today 
               <br />
               will go all over Canada, over the world; how can 
               <br />
               we blame people or newspapers for publishing 
               <br />
               things about Newfoundland —— calling us Indians 
               <br />
               and Esquimaux when we ourselves are calling 
               <br />
               ourselves Indians. I thought this resolution would 
               <br />
               come in, and 24 hours after he introduced it in the 
               <br />
               house it would be debated. I did not think there 
               <br />
               would be any speeches or addresses given on it 
               <br />
               this afternoon. But Mr. Smallwood’s address, I 
               <br />
               do not mind telling you, pierces the hearts of 
               <br />
