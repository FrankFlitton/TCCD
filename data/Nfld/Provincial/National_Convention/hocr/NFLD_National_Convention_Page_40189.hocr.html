               Mr. Ashbourne I would like to know the poten— 
               <br />
               tial value of Labrador to Newfoundland. I know 
               <br />
               that her ﬁsheries are most valuable. We know 
               <br />
               that the stand of timber on the Labrador is a stand 
               <br />
               which, in my opinion, is virgin growth and we 
               <br />
               also have heard quite a bit of the value of the 
               <br />
               minerals there, Now since last night I have been 
               <br />
               doing a little ﬁguring, and I think it can be safely 
               <br />
               assumed that we have in Labrador 110,000 
               <br />
               square miles, and seeing that half of that might 
               <br />
               contain a stand of timber, which would be 2,000 
               <br />
               square miles (and by the way about 10% of 
               <br />
               Labrador is under 99-year lease), this gives us 
               <br />
               about 35,200,000 acres, and I believe Major 
               <br />
               Cashin said last night that it has been said that the 
               <br />
               yield of wood on the acreage is up to 15 cords an 
               <br />
               acre. 1 think that’s quite high myself. I am taking 
               <br />
               half of that, 7.5 cords the acre, which would bring 
               <br />
               the cordage, according to my ﬁgures, to 264 
               <br />
               million cords of timber. Now I see an estimate 
               <br />
               here of from 50 to 100 million cords in the report, 
               <br />
               as compared with 60 million cords in New- 
               <br />
               foundland... I am greatly interested in the state- 
               <br />
               ment given to the Convention by Mr. Burry this 
               <br />
               afternoon, and I am sure that when he speaks 
               <br />
               about the timber he knows what he is talking 
               <br />
               about, but in view of the fact that we have no 
               <br />
               competent surveys of the timber areas in 
               <br />
               Labrador, and I believe that we should get those 
               <br />

               <br />
               should try as a Convention to ascertain some real 
               <br />

               <br />
               ﬂuence the climate, and if we do not, in my 
               <br />
               opinion, look after the matter of reafforestation, 
               <br />
               a matter which I advocated in the Assembly over 
               <br />
               20 years ago, I fear very much that the time will 
               <br />
               come when Newfoundland will be cutout. I can 
               <br />
               quite understand that, according to the two large 
               <br />
               pulp and paper companies, by discriminate cut- 
               <br />
               ting they may be able to afford a program of 
               <br />
               reafforestation which will look after their needs, 
               <br />
               but i believe it was Mr. Fudge who talked of not 
               <br />
               a stick of wood remaining in 40 years in the 
               <br />
               country generally, and I think that the time has 
               <br />
               come when the recommendation as given by this 
               <br />
               Committee should be apprehended. If there is 
               <br />
               indiscriminate cutting in Newfoundland we can 
               <br />
               reasonably expect to know what is in store for us.

               The fisheries of Newfoundland, in my 
               <br />
               opinion, are inﬂuenced to a great extent by the 
               <br />
               fall of snow which happens during the winter on 
               <br />
               the northeast coast of Newfoundland particular- 
               <br />
               ly. We know that the last two years particularly 
               <br />
               we have had poor voyages and some of it may be 
               <br />
               because there is not enough snow on the ground. 
               <br />
               Years ago the fisherman used to say if we had lots 
               <br />
               of snow you would have a good cod fishery. As 
               <br />
               the snow settles on the ground, and as the rains 
               <br />
               descend in the spring and wash out from the 
               <br />
               ground the salt and other minerals of the land, we 
               <br />
               know that the fish pick up these minerals, and as 
               <br />

               got to do with the present report? 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne Well, I am talking about the 
               <br />
               reafforestation of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland,</span> I don’t want

               bald rock, and not be able to have any snow settle 
               <br />
               on the lands so that our fisheries would be 
               <br />
               depleted, because the earning power of our 
               <br />
               people comes from the natural resources of our
