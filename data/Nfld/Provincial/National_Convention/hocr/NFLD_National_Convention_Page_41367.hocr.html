               As a result of all this I have now made up my 
               <br />
               mind, with all the detachment and intellectual 
               <br />
               honesty of which I am capable, that full self~ 
               <br />
               government would be in the best interests of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, particularly at this moment in our 
               <br />
               history. My reasons for coming to this conclusion 
               <br />
               will, in some measure, be set before you now. 
               <br />
               Before I give my reasons, however, I would like 
               <br />
               to say that I am accepting without question the 
               <br />
               assumption that the political freedom which goes 
               <br />
               with self-government —— with all its dangers, 
               <br />
               weaknesses, corruptions, responsibilities on the 
               <br />
               part of politicians and on the part of citizens ~— 
               <br />
               is the goal of all peoples like ourselves, nurtured 
               <br />
               in the democratic tradition. I therefore propose to 
               <br />
               give my attention chiefly to this matter of 
               <br />
               material security, which is not unnaturally agitat- 
               <br />
               ing men and women and on which is laid the 
               <br />
               emphasis of our times, always bearing in mind, 
               <br />
               however, that too great a price must not be paid 
               <br />
               for the one at the expense of the other. There will 
               <br />
               be, as I think it is inevitable, some repetition in 
               <br />
               what I have to say at this time. Nearly all of it has 
               <br />
               been said before, perhaps on more than one occasion. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The most important point of all, the point 
               <br />
               which caused the turning—point in my thinking, 
               <br />
               arose out of our visit to London; and this was that 
               <br />
               it was only by getting our own government ——I 
               <br />
               am giving the substance of what we were told by 
               <br />
               the Secretary of State —- that we could raise the 
               <br />
               question with our friendly and wealthy neighbour 
               <br />
               nation, the USA, on some form of concessions, 
               <br />
               by trade agreement or otherwise, for the granting 
               <br />
               of extra-territorial rights to that nation without 
               <br />
               our consent. I am well aware that Newfoundland 
               <br />
               had to be, of necessity, whether she liked it or not, 
               <br />
               a factor in the defense of the western hemisphere, 
               <br />
               which she will have to be in the future, whether 
               <br />
               she likes it or not; just as Canada will have to be 
               <br />
               a factor, and in the end will be dominated by the 
               <br />
               USA in that respect. But I am also aware of the 
               <br />
               fact that a nation which today, in common with 
               <br />
               the British Empire, represents the highest ideals 
               <br />
               of “live and let live” in this world of ours, would 
               <br />
               not be unwilling to take the necessary measures 
               <br />
               to see that a small people from whom she has 
               <br />
               taken, in no small measure, a large part of her 
               <br />
               sovereign rights was vouchsafed some returns for 
               <br />
               her sacriﬁce. And I would point out here that 
               <br />

               what to us would be of tremendous advantage, 
               <br />
               would be a very small concession on the part of 
               <br />
               our great neighbour.

               Now as I have said before, I am not satisﬁed 
               <br />
               to let the opportunity of approaching the United 
               <br />
               States, whether we get anything or not, go by 
               <br />
               default because we may not have the vision or the 
               <br />
               courage to see the possibility. It was for that 
               <br />
               reason that I pointed out on a former occasion, 
               <br />
               that we ought not to deliver into the hands of any 
               <br />
               other country the controlling power of our 
               <br />
               strategic position. But some sceptic may be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for.</span> 
               <br />
               mulating this question: “But what has that to do 
               <br />
               with the standard of living for New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders?” If we let control go by default, 
               <br />
               nothing. If we do not, the answer is that our right 
               <br />
               to bargain for trade concessions would have in- 
               <br />
               ﬁnite possibilities which would affect the earning 
               <br />
               power, and hence the standard of living of every 
               <br />
               individual citizen in this country. A trade conces- 
               <br />
               sion, for instance, which would increase our 
               <br />
               markets or even create a new market for our ﬁsh 
               <br />
               of all kinds, could spell all the difference for our 
               <br />
               people between a decent standard of living and 
               <br />
               an uncertain one. Our ability to negotiate with 
               <br />
               any country could only be the highest under 
               <br />
               self-government; and I repeat that that was the 
               <br />
               deﬁnite impression on this matter that I received 
               <br />
               from the Secretary of State. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               My second reason is this. I believe we are on 
               <br />
               the verge of a tremendous development of air 
               <br />
               trafﬁc, and it so happens that Newfoundland is so 
               <br />
               strategically placed as to be of the utmost impor- 
               <br />
               tance as a junction for one of the most important 
               <br />
               air routes of the world. In this connection once 
               <br />
               again it was made abundantly clear, and we got 
               <br />
               the deﬁnite impression, that that matter could 
               <br />
               only be handled if we were to get a government 
               <br />
               of our own, for the simple reason that it could not 
               <br />
               be done under the present circumstances, for 
               <br />
               political and other reasons, by His Majesty’s 
               <br />
               Government in the United Kingdom. In this mat— 
               <br />
               ter of air control and trafﬁc of the future, I again 
               <br />
               repeat what I have said before, that we ought to 
               <br />
               be able to extract certain material rights which 
               <br />
               ought to affect the well—being of every citizen in 
               <br />
               this country. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               My third point is this, that during the last 
               <br />
               couple of years it has been abundantly clear that 
               <br />
               the USA as a nation has become of necessity, 
               <br />
