               Speaking in support of this motion 1 might say 
               <br />
               that our Letters Patent of 1934, wherein we were 
               <br />
               promised the return of our former status on the 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self»supporting,</span> has caused me considerable 
               <br />
               perplexity, especially in the early days of this 
               <br />
               Convention when we heard so much talk of the 
               <br />
               constitutionality of almost everything before the 
               <br />
               Chair. At that time I was quite concerned, and 
               <br />
               was most desirous to have the constitutional 
               <br />
               angles ironed out, and as yet I fail to see why 
               <br />
               some of our legal minds did not have the position 
               <br />
               clariﬁed for the beneﬁt of the electorate How- 
               <br />
               ever, this issue appears to have disappeared with 
               <br />
               the disappearance of the constitutional expert,

               Mr. Chairman, the electorate of this country is 
               <br />
               awakening to that political interest which was 
               <br />
               drugged into insensibility during 14 years of non-

               people a realisation of the purposes and duty of 
               <br />
               government. Incidentally I feel that this Conven— 
               <br />
               tion, with all its shortcomings, has been unduly 
               <br />
               censured. We were given a job that usually re- 
               <br />
               quires experts and expected to do it without the 
               <br />
               necessary assistance and co—operation that ex- 
               <br />
               perts usually receive. However, we are about to 
               <br />
               ﬁnish our work and in a short while the people 
               <br />
               will be asked to register their decision on the form 
               <br />
               of government they desire, and in my opinion it 
               <br />
               should be made as easy and clearcut as possible, 
               <br />
               it being our duty to give them a factual and true

               Under the motion we are to concern ourselves 
               <br />
               with two forms of government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> responsible and 
               <br />
               commission, and I wish to say that it is my

               have the honour to represent are concerned with 
               <br />
               only these two forms, and because of the small 
               <br />
               minority who have mistaken ideas about the latter 
               <br />

               deal with that ﬁrst. I would point out to these few

               that, to use a very common and oft-repeated

               tion of default in 1933 —— so were others. 
               <br />
               Anyway, it was ﬁne to have Britain underwrite 
               <br />
               our obligations, but in giving credit where it is 
               <br />
               due, we must also realise that in making a com-
