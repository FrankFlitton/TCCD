               Mr. Burry I ﬁnd this debate on this report very 
               <br />
               helpful and interesting. I am bound to point out, 
               <br />
               however, that there is no reference made to 
               <br />
               Labrador. The members can very well be excused 
               <br />
               for that, because no one would think that 
               <br />
               Labrador is an agricultural country. Ibring it up, 
               <br />
               because I think the agricultural prospects of 
               <br />
               Labrador are based on the future welfare of New- 
               <br />
               foundland and Labrador.... I foresee that a lot of 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders will be called upon to go to 
               <br />
               Labrador to take part in the mineral and timber 
               <br />
               operations there, and I think that Newfoundland 
               <br />
               should know something of the agricultural 
               <br />
               prospects of Labrador. When families are asked 
               <br />
               to uproot themselves from our ﬁshing villages 
               <br />
               they will want to know the possibilities of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grow«</span> 
               <br />
               in g some vegetables. It would not have been a bad 
               <br />
               idea if the Committee had brought in something 
               <br />
               along that line. Because they have not, I want to 
               <br />
               tell you that there are possibilities for agriculture 
               <br />
               in a small way, for gardening, in Labrador. 
               <br />
               Anyone should not have any fear about the 
               <br />
               climate or the weather.... It is better than the

               Newfoundland, ProfessorR. A MacKay2 has this 
               <br />
               to say: “Agriculture’s claim to recognition in this 
               <br />
               country is as a handmaid to other industries rather 
               <br />
               than as an industry in its own right.” I believe the 
               <br />
               report bears out the truth of this statement and 
               <br />
               refer you to page 1, when the Government 
               <br />
               Analyst states that about 3% of our soil (some 
               <br />
               700,000 acres) is ﬁrst—class agricultural land, and 
               <br />
               30% is second-class soil. Of the 3% comprising 
               <br />
               700,000 acres, the 1945 census shows total hold- 
               <br />
               ings of 124,953 acres, which still leaves some 
               <br />
               600,000 acres for those who believe in the back-

               birth that some of us grew up in districts where a

               fact remains that in a large part of our island the 
               <br />
               development of agriculture is severely limited by 
               <br />
