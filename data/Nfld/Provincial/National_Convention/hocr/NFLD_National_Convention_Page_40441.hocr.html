               I asked whether it was consistent with the whole

               idea of the co-operative movement that it should

               answer, and I am surprised, from two men who 
               <br />
               are so prominent in the co-operative movement. 
               <br />
               They should have said, “No, the government has 
               <br />
               nothing to do with it.”

               Mr. Hollett I asked for it. If you could not

               answerit you might have said, “I’m sorry I cannot 
               <br />
               answer it”, but to give a camouﬂaged answer and 
               <br />
               use the word ideology, to try to cover up the

               <br />
               anybody much credit for that. The whole idea is 
               <br />
               not to get any assistance whatever from the 
               <br />
               government. It starts from a very small nucleus 
               <br />
               and builds up gradually. If you are going to get 
               <br />
               the government to come in and spend $50,000, 
               <br />
               where is it going to stop and when? If they are 
               <br />
               going to spend that much why should they not 
               <br />
               spend $500,000 or more to put it through? The 
               <br />
               co-operation Mr. Ashboume is speaking of is 
               <br />
               entirely different. We all believe in co-operation, 
               <br />
               but whether we all believe in the co-operative 
               <br />
               movement is another thing; but I do believe, 
               <br />
               according to Dr. Coacly, that it is not the way to 
               <br />
               get a co—operative movement going well in any 
               <br />
               country, to get assistance from the government or 
               <br />

               <br />
               it was by somebody. He and all the other people 
               <br />
               had to eat, they had the elementary human needs, 
               <br />
               somebody had to pay them. The point is this: if

               in the beginning you had not had the government 
               <br />

               <br />
               been mooted. I agree that the sooner the co-

               tional work, the better — in some places they are 
               <br />
               strong enough. in the Flowers Cove area they saw 
               <br />
               ﬁt to withdraw the ﬁeld workers, so we are going 
               <br />
               to pay for it ourselves. The people dug into their

               pockets. That was only after they got a start. 
               <br />
               Whatever we feel ideally, we have to be practical
