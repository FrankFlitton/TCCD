               Mr. Ashbourne I would like to correct what I 
               <br />
               said regarding the express train at Lewisporte, 
               <br />
               that this year passengers had to leave the express. 
               <br />

               <br />
               cause at the present time the train from 
               <br />
               Lewisporte does meet all the expresses that come 
               <br />
               through. But last spring, (1946) and early in the 
               <br />
               summer, the train from Lewisporte only met cer- 
               <br />
               tain expresses.

               railway was built out there, Norris Ann was 
               <br />
               supposed to be the water point, so to speak, and 
               <br />
               that’s why the railroad was brought out to Norris 
               <br />
               Arm, but had people had the vision at that time

               <br />
               I think these men would have put the main line 
               <br />
               right out to Lewisporte, and I believe it could 
               <br />
               have been done at very little cost, and it would be 
               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. Bailey I have been handicapped the past 
               <br />
               few days with a cold, and have not been able to 
               <br />
               take part in the discussion, but I have been listen— 
               <br />
               ing attentively when I could. I have heard the 
               <br />
               description of conditions throughout the island, 
               <br />
               and would like to have something to say about 
               <br />
               the way things have been handled in general. I 
               <br />
               don’t think anybody has been treated worse than 
               <br />
               the people who belong to the district (Trinity 
               <br />

               things and had them taken away from you, it hurts

               a lot more.

               <br />

               <br />
               sentation. We had a royal commission come out

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">here],</span> I was not in the country at that time, and it 
               <br />
               harked back to our old responsible government, 
               <br />
               but that government gave us, where I come from, 
               <br />
               a wharf at New Chelsea that must have cost 
               <br />
               $8,000; a wharf at Hant’s Harbour, and you have 
               <br />
               got to take a mark to ﬁnd where that was today; 
               <br />
               at Winterton there was a wharf, and at New 
               <br />
               Perlican; and at Heart’s Content we had a wharf 
               <br />
               that cost $80,000, and a 12,000 ton ship could 
               <br />
               load at it. From Heart’s Content to Whitbourne 
               <br />
               we had a railroad that cost the country, the old 
               <br />
               “irresponsible" political parties, $1 million, and 
               <br />
               it gave good service. It got to a situation where 
               <br />
               they could not ﬁnd $200,000 to ballast the track 
               <br />
               and put it back again. I was one of the committee 
               <br />
               that was ﬁghting the government to hold the 
               <br />
               railroad to Heart’s Content. They said they had 
               <br />
               to put the rails somewhere else in the country, but 
               <br />
               I found out that $350,000 was spent to build sheds 
               <br />
               in St. John’ s. Now we work with committees, and 
               <br />
               ﬁnd out that it cost $500,000 dollars to put a road 
               <br />
               where there was a good road, between St. John’s 
               <br />
               and Woodstock. When you consider the money 
               <br />
               that responsible government spent and the money 
               <br />
               that Commission of Government is spending, 
               <br />
               you begin to wonder what it is all about. I am sure 
               <br />
               that one of the other ideas of the home govern— 
               <br />
               ment, was that they would relieve the depression 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland by building railroads. They 
               <br />
               quit building roads, at a cost of 15 or 20 cents an 
               <br />
               hour, because the cost was prohibitive; surely 
               <br />
               they don’t expect us to build roads now when the 
               <br />
               British government would notbuild them in 1938 
               <br />
               because they were too costly.

               When the cost of living came up here today I

               <br />
               spoke. I am sure Mr. Figary was right there on the

               spot with the railroad men, but I did not see

               anybody get up and say anything about John the
