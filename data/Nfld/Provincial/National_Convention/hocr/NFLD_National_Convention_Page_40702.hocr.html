               <br />

               <br />
               penditure you will get. On the other side you have 
               <br />
               not gone far enough. You have not given the 
               <br />
               Convention any kind of picture of what the 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood Thank you sir, I will try to be 
               <br />
               serious. If the gentlemen will turn to page 42, we 
               <br />
               come to the crux of the whole business... We all 
               <br />
               know we have had high revenues in the past few 
               <br />
               years, and the Convention Act tells us that we are 
               <br />
               supposed to pronounce as to whether these high 
               <br />
               revenues are the result of wartime conditions, or 
               <br />
               whether they are normal... What are we going to 
               <br />
               do Mr. Chairman? Are we going to make a report, 
               <br />
               and if we adopt this report that is what we are 
               <br />
               doing, to Newfoundland and to Great Britain 
               <br />
               along these lines: Before the war we were run- 
               <br />
               ning in the red all the time. We were losing 
               <br />
               money, the government was losing money, 
               <br />
               deﬁcit after deﬁcit, year after year we were sink- 
               <br />
               ing money. From 1920 to 1934 we borrowed over 
               <br />
               $50 million. From l934ti11 the war broke out we 
               <br />
               still did not get enough to pay expenses, so the 
               <br />
               British government had to give us a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grant-maid</span> 
               <br />
               every year to make up our loss. So from I920 to 
               <br />
               1940 we either had to go out and borrow the 
               <br />
               money to pay our way or get it as a grant-in-aid 
               <br />
               from the old country, but in spite of that the war 
               <br />
               came and our revenues have gone up and up. So 
               <br />
               have our expenditures, but not as high as our 
               <br />
               revenues, and we have had a Surplus. But now we 
               <br />
               want to report to you as follows: that these great 
               <br />
               revenues that have poured in on the government 
               <br />
               since 1940 or 1941, these great revenues are not 
               <br />
               the result of the war, oh no. What are they the 
               <br />
               result of? The growth of our main industries. 
               <br />
               But what made our main industries grow, if 
               <br />
               they have grown? Which they have not. Our main 
               <br />
               industries have not grown. It is true that at Corner 
               <br />
               Brook they have been installing additional <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">equip</span> 
               <br />
               ment, which when it is ready to operate will mean 
               <br />
               that that industry has grown. We have, in the last 
               <br />
               few years installed some freezing equipment, 
               <br />
               cold storage equipment, for the fresh fish part of 
               <br />
               our ﬁshing industry, which is only a small part of 
               <br />
