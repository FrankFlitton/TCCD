               vote against Commission government in the

               any help from her in the future, should we need

               earth, never did a country suffer as did the mother 
               <br />
               country this past ten <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years,</span> since 1938. Never did 
               <br />
               people sacriﬁce as the British people sacrificed 
               <br />
               and as they are sacriﬁcing today. They gave their 
               <br />
               all. They threw it into the ﬁght gladly; they 
               <br />
               stripped themselves to the bare bone; everything 
               <br />
               went until they were naked and empty of hand. 
               <br />
               The whole world has stood in speechless amaze- 
               <br />
               ment over the prodigious sacriﬁce of the British 
               <br />
               people; such effort, such sacriﬁce and such 
               <br />
               courage! I am reminded of the words of Winston 
               <br />
               Churchill, “Let no man underrate the abiding 
               <br />
               power of the British Empire, not because you see 
               <br />
               46 million people on our island harassed about 
               <br />

               not come through these dark days as we have 
               <br />
               come through the years of the past or that a half 
               <br />
               century from now you will not see 70 or 80

               million Britons spread about the world united in 
               <br />
               the defence of justice and way of life." These are 
               <br />
               brave words, sir, and true words. Britain will 
               <br />
               come back. Of that I have no doubt. It will not be 
               <br />
               soon, but she will receive help from her sons and
