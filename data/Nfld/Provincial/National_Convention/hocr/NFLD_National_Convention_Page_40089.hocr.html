               <br />
               through the years a feeling that agriculture, which

               <br />

               <br />
               These facts helped it to form an economy which 
               <br />
               has never in our history made for stability, and

               In a world in which industries were organised

               more or less on an individualistic basis, New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders were able to extract a tolerable

               recent times the emphasis in industry changed 
               <br />

               <br />

               always to be the interests of some power standing

               Carrying on this sketchy remembrance of past

               history we see weaknesses which may or may not 
               <br />
               have been caused by circumstances in our own 
               <br />
               handling of the situation: for example, a too great

               <br />
               ~— not that Newfoundland should not have given 
               <br />
               her utmost, but that she had no right to give far 
               <br />
               beyond her capacity; and afterwards, a complete

               lack of disinterested self-interest in handling the 
               <br />
               burden of debt at a time of world crisis; and 
               <br />
               further an apparent unwillingness or inertia on

               present day, we allowed ourselves to be put in a

               <br />
               straight to the point of the proposal, I must say 
               <br />
               that I realise that in the end governmental and 
               <br />
               economic inﬂuence lies where power resides. In

               island is dealt with as the powers decide. I am not 
               <br />
               concerned at the moment with whether binding 
               <br />
               contracts or legal technicalities may be used as 
               <br />
               an argument for a fatalistic attitude on our part. I 
               <br />
               am concerned with a new world which places

               I suggest, therefore, that this problem of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ap»</span>

               pealing to great powers on a humanitarian basis

               should be pushed to the limit of our ability. I 
               <br />
               would not have any of my listeners feel that I 
               <br />
               subscribe to a begging attitude. I suggest the

               problem be approached with dignity and on the

               <br />
               from fellow human beings — a position of 
               <br />
               strategic and geographical importance which 
               <br />
               should be as much shared by us as the position of

               <br />
               other countries in the interests of all. It may be 
               <br />
               argued that Newfoundland has already been paid 
               <br />
               for concessions which have been given to other 
               <br />
               countries in the form of a prosperity which we 
               <br />
               never before enjoyed, but I would point out that 
               <br />
               the prosperity came not so much by design as by 
               <br />
               accident and our concern is not with the tem—
