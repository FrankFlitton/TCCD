               I’ll take the report of the Fisheries Post-War 
               <br />
               Planning Committee ﬁrst. It says, “Foreign trade 
               <br />
               is the very life blood of Newfoundland and every 
               <br />
               effort should be made to co-operate with other 
               <br />
               producing countries in endeavouring to ﬁnd solu- 
               <br />
               tions for the numerous problems which will face 
               <br />
               the saltﬁsh trade in the post-war years.”1 It goes 
               <br />
               on to say that Newfoundland has no bargaining 
               <br />
               power with most countries consuming her 
               <br />
               saltﬁsh, and consequently it was to the British 
               <br />
               government that Newfoundland had to look for 
               <br />
               protection. We have had bargaining powers in the 
               <br />
               past. Did we use them? I cannot understand why 
               <br />
               we, a maritime race, had to look to Britain in the 
               <br />
               past; before steam at the end of World War I 
               <br />
               forced our sailing vessels from the sea we were 
               <br />
               in a more fortunate position then we are today. 
               <br />
               Now we have had two world wars; wealth, as we 
               <br />
               knew it in 1914, has been practically blasted from 
               <br />
               the earth. All nations have become creditor na- 
               <br />
               tions either to their own peoples or outsiders... 
               <br />
               We today are a fortunate people if we face and 
               <br />
               plan for the future...

               I don’t think the saltfish business is dead, but 
               <br />
               I ﬁrmly believe the time has come for a rejuvena- 
               <br />
               tion, and a nation with a backbone instead of a 
               <br />
               wishbone can do just that. This country has the 
               <br />
               resources to feed its people and could feed, clothe 
               <br />
               and house ten times as many more in a manner 
               <br />
               comparable with any frontier people. This will 
               <br />
               mean very careful planning unless we are going 
               <br />
               to continue in the same old Iairrez-faire way. If 
               <br />
               so, then heaven help us. The time has deﬁnitely 
               <br />
               come to call a halt and we must get busy and 
               <br />
               seriously co-operate along entirely different and 
               <br />
               more progressive lines if we ever hope to become 
               <br />
               economically independent. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               There is not one market that we had and lost 
               <br />
               that would have gone out of our keeping if we 
               <br />
               had shipped the proper quality ﬁsh, except those 
               <br />
               markets wherein the people have built their own 
               <br />
               ships and caught their own fish. Ever since I can 
               <br />
               remember I have heard it said that everything is 
               <br />
               OK if the quintal of ﬁsh buys the barrel of flour. 
               <br />
               It is when the price of flour is up and the ﬁsh 
               <br />
               down that the people worry. What steps have we 
               <br />
               taken to ensure our people that we can sell fish 
               <br />
               and buy flour? Not from 1931 to 1940, however. 
               <br />
               Look at our exports of ﬁsh in 1936-37, 965,699 
               <br />
               quintals — a drop of 766,688 quintals below the

               <br />
               should make one wonder how our people were 
               <br />
               fed. Bread from British mills, mostly from 
               <br />
               Spillers, bakers in Cardiff. Why did we get flour 
               <br />
               from there? Because Britain was supplying 
               <br />
               manufactured goods to Australia, Argentina and 
               <br />
               Canada and was getting wheat from them. Is it 
               <br />
               possible that with 150,000 square miles of this 
               <br />
               earth we could not ﬁnd anything to trade with 
               <br />
               those countries to get wheat to feed 280,000 
               <br />
               people? What was wrong? Let us examine the 
               <br />
               situation closely. Just where were those superb 
               <br />
               young seamen that the British Admiralty called 
               <br />
               for in October 1939 for boarding boats‘ crews? 
               <br />
               On the crossroads of every village in New— 
               <br />
               foundland, their hands nearly worn off through 
               <br />
               keeping them in their pockets so long, because 
               <br />
               somebody could not operate a merchant marine 
               <br />
               as cheaply as other countries. We had no ships. 
               <br />
               Who, when we were borrowing money by the 
               <br />
               millions, would not allow ﬁve ships to be built 
               <br />
               for the trade of the colony, who was to blame? 
               <br />
               Who in a changing world expected to carry on in 
               <br />
               the same old way? But look what we got. Now. 
               <br />
               the path is ahead of us today, a thorny path if we 
               <br />
               take the wrong turning, but a path that will give 
               <br />
               our people freedom from fear and freedom from 
               <br />
               want if we do what can and should be done. We 
               <br />
               have it in our hands today, let us plan wisely. 
               <br />
               Today we have no deadwood and we have a 
               <br />
               backlog, if I may use those terms. By that I mean 
               <br />
               we have no fleet of sailing vessels, the deadwood, 
               <br />
               like we had after the last war, which high <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in.</span> 
               <br />
               surance and low freight rates made obsolete in a 
               <br />
               few years. To enable us to enter the maritime field 
               <br />
               the people of Newfoundland, through the govem~ 
               <br />
               ment, have nearly $40 million, that is what I 
               <br />
               meant by the backlog. We have no obsolete ships 
               <br />
               like Norway and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Iceland,</span> We can start from 
               <br />
               scratch with all modern improvements in the ship 
               <br />
               of today, and this is where this island home of 
               <br />
               ours can begin to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">live.</span> In the past we had to sell 
               <br />
               our ﬁsh in cheap markets and buy our food in dear 
               <br />
               ones, we had no chance to barter. The lack of a 
               <br />
               merchant marine has done that to us, for no 
               <br />
               country today, no matter how willing they are to 
               <br />
               sell for cash, can sell to a country when they have 
               <br />
               no cash Formerly you could sell to one country 
               <br />
               for cash and take that cash to another country and 
               <br />
               buy goods, but that is impossible today. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">There</span>
