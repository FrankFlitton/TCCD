               <br />
               only one statement that deserves attention, for 
               <br />
               that one statement stands out above all the rest of 
               <br />
               his speech — I quote his exact words: “I like 
               <br />
               Canada, she’s a great country." Now, sir, why 
               <br />
               shouldn’t he like Canada? Why shouldn’t he 
               <br />
               think she’s a great country? He worked in 
               <br />
               Canada. He travelled right across Canada. He 
               <br />
               fought in the Canadian army. He’s an ex-officer 
               <br />
               of the army of Canada, retired with the rank of 
               <br />
               major from the Canadian army. For the past eight 
               <br />
               or nine years he has made Canada his home, 
               <br />
               although within that period he has managed to 
               <br />
               visit us here in Newfoundland a few times. His 
               <br />
               home is in Canada now, in Montreal. When the 
               <br />
               Christmas recess came a year ago, and again this 
               <br />
               year, when we all trooped off to our homes, 
               <br />
               Major Cashin did the same thing. He went to his 
               <br />
               home in Montreal. Evidently Major Cashin is not 
               <br />
               so scared of all those terrible Canadian taxes that 
               <br />
               he’s been telling us about. He can’t be so very 
               <br />
               scared of them when he has his very home in 
               <br />
               Montreal at this very minute. I sometimes 
               <br />
               wonder to myself, I sometimes wonder what 
               <br />
               would have happened if Major Cashin had been 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst to think of advocating confederation 
               <br />
               instead of myself. I sometimes wonder if he isn’t 
               <br />
               just a bit sorry that he didn’t come out for con- 
               <br />
               federation in the ﬁrst place. What a fine cham- 
               <br />
               pion he would have made for the great cause of 
               <br />
               confederation. In his heart he must know that 
               <br />
               confederation would be the best thing that could 
               <br />
               happen for the great mass of our Newfoundland 
               <br />
               people. But he started by boosting responsible 
               <br />
               government and now he’s stuck with it. He’s 
               <br />
               stuck with it, and finds that he can’t very well 
               <br />
               change before the referendum. But I wonder, I 
               <br />
               wonder if there will be a happier man in all 
               <br />
               Newfoundland when the votes are counted in the 
               <br />
               referendum this spring and he ﬁnds that con- 
               <br />
               federation has won with a thundering great 
               <br />
               majority? Will there be a happier man in New- 
               <br />
               foundland? I leave Major Cashin for the time 
               <br />
               being. I leave him, sir, with an invitation to come 
               <br />
               over with us, an invitation to become a con- 
               <br />
               federate right out in the open —— drop this non~ 
               <br />
               sense about responsible government. The people 
               <br />
               are not going to vote for it anyway, so what’s the 
               <br />
               use of wasting time over it? Let Major Cashin 
               <br />
               join up, let him enlist, let him enrol right now in 
               <br />

               I turn, sir, to Mr. Higgins. There are really only 
               <br />
               three or four points in his speech that seem to call 
               <br />
               for attention. Mr. Higgins told us that a lawyer 
               <br />
               often takes on a case that he doesn‘t especially 
               <br />
               like and sometimes acts for a client that he isn’t 
               <br />
               a bit fond of. But he takes it, he takes the case and 
               <br />
               he does his best. I know that’s true, and Mr. 
               <br />
               Higgins has demonstrated that truth very well in 
               <br />
               this Convention. When Major Cashin made that 
               <br />
               early speech of his, a few days after the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion opened, Mr. Higgins got up and attacked 
               <br />
               what Major Cashin had said, and in very trench- 
               <br />
               ant language told Major Cashin that he disagreed 
               <br />
               absolutely and completely with him. We all 
               <br />
               remember Mr. Higgins’ speech on that occasion. 
               <br />
               It was eloquent, logical and persuasive. Then two 
               <br />
               or three months later Mr. Higgins gotup and took 
               <br />
               it all back, apologised to Major Cashin and in 
               <br />
               effect said that he now agreed with him. We all 
               <br />
               remember another occasion when Mr. Higgins 
               <br />
               delivered a trenchant and eloquent speech, the 
               <br />
               best speech that he has delivered in this chamber, 
               <br />
               when Mr. Jackman introduced his motion to send 
               <br />
               a delegation to the United States to discuss 
               <br />
               Newfoundland’s pulling down the Union Jack 
               <br />
               and running up the Stars and Stripes to become a 
               <br />
               part of the USA. Mr. Higgins spared no words. 
               <br />
               He hit that motion and he hit it hard, and he told 
               <br />
               us we weren’t going to be like rats deserting a 
               <br />
               sinking ship. His speech made an excellent im- 
               <br />
               pression at the time. But now he gets up and tells 
               <br />
               us he’s changed his mind again. Now he thinks, 
               <br />
               after reading about the expanding American im- 
               <br />
               perialism that he told us about in his speech, that 
               <br />
               Mr. Jackman’s motion wasn’t so bad after all. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Well Mr. Smallwood, lawyers 
               <br />
