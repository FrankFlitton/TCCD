               out, there are possibilities for good in these 
               <br />

               Another thing that the people need more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">en«</span> 
               <br />
               lightenment on is how we are going to fare as a 
               <br />
               province. By that I mean, how is the provincial 
               <br />
               government going to raise sufﬁcient revenue to 
               <br />
               take care of provincial matters such as public 
               <br />
               health and welfare, education and so on? We have 
               <br />
               had a so-called budget presented to us, a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provin~</span> 
               <br />
               cial budget that would apply to this country if and 
               <br />
               when we became a province; not a budget cover— 
               <br />
               ing one or two years, but for a period of eight long 
               <br />
               years, during which time anything may happen, 
               <br />
               from a war to a world depression. Incidentally, 
               <br />
               the author of this budget prophesied only a few 
               <br />
               days ago that we were going to have a depression 
               <br />
               and have it very soon. To my mind, it is a budget 
               <br />
               based on anything but sound, solid facts. In fact, 
               <br />
               it is based in some part, if not for the most part, 
               <br />
               on supposition. For instance on how our $28 
               <br />
               million surplus will be handled, $16 million of 
               <br />
               which is out of our reach and will remain so for 
               <br />
               some years to come. The supposition is that some 
               <br />
               means may be found to get that $16 million back 
               <br />
               in dollars, whereas now it is in sterling. Are we 
               <br />
               going to base our recommendations on supposi- 
               <br />
               tions such as that? Without knowing for sure 
               <br />
               whether it can be done or not? 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Again, this budget says that we shall need $15 
               <br />
               million to cover ordinary expenditure as a 
               <br />
               province. Others in this Convention contend that 
               <br />
               it will take around $18 million, and these conten~ 
               <br />
               tions have been based, to my mind, on sound 
               <br />
               reasoning. Who is correct? More than that, how 
               <br />
               are these monies to be raised, and in the raising 
               <br />
               of it, how is it going to affect the ordinary New- 
               <br />
               foundlander, the ﬁsherman, the logger and the 
               <br />
               miner? These questions and many others have not 
               <br />
               been answered to the satisfaction of thousands of 
               <br />
               our people. Again, Mr. Chairman. how are our 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen going to be affected by confederation? 
               <br />
               Are they going to be affected adversely or other-

               which has done a tremendous amount of good, 
               <br />
               our system of marketing? And also, how will our 
               <br />
               markets be affected? Every ﬁsherman in this 
               <br />
               country wants to know that. Do they know it? 
               <br />
               They most certainly do not, and until they do, I 
               <br />
               cannot see how we can justify ourselves in 
               <br />
               recommending confederation as a form of 
               <br />
               government. Some of these questions have been 
               <br />
               answered, after a fashion, by Mr. Smallwood; but 
               <br />
               I am not prepared -- neither are thousands of 
               <br />
               people in this country prepared -—— to accept these 
               <br />
               answers at the last word. Our people deserve the 
               <br />
               best, and the best is none too good for them. 
               <br />
               Confederation may be the best, but do we know 
               <br />
               that it is the best? I am quite sure that the majority 
               <br />
               of them do not. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I am a young Newfoundlander, Mr. Chairman, 
               <br />
               and will in all probability spend the rest of my 
               <br />
               days here. I do not want to be a party to recom- 
               <br />
               mending something to the people of this country 
               <br />
               which they might regret for the rest of their days. 
               <br />
               In my opinion, government means a great deal to 
               <br />
               a people. It has been pointed out here that as long 
               <br />
               as people have three square meals a day, a decent 
               <br />
               suit and a tight roof. they do not worry who runs 
               <br />
               the government. Personally, I cannot subscribe to 
               <br />
               that. What about our educational system? Our 
               <br />
               social services? And many other things that are 
               <br />
               equally important as food, clothing and shelter. 
               <br />
               Would I, as a Newfoundlander, be satisfied, as 
               <br />
               long as I had enough to eat, enough to wear and 
               <br />
               good shelter, to see Adolph Hitler as the head of 
               <br />
               our affairs? I hardly think so. Again, Mr. Chair- 
               <br />
               man, I want to say that I do not want to deprive 
               <br />
               the people of anything that may affect them for 
               <br />
               good. But in view of all the circumstances, as I 
               <br />
               see them, I cannot in all sincerity support this 
               <br />
               motion of Mr. Smallwood’s.

               that what we have learned will stand as in good
