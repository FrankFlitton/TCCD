               When we look around we know what we have 
               <br />
               to have. Take just Public Health and Welfare. We 
               <br />
               will go through the villages of Newfoundland. It 
               <br />
               is not because it can’t be done, or should not be 
               <br />
               done, but because the people don’t understand. 
               <br />
               You want a staff of people going through this 
               <br />
               country just to educate people. If you don‘t, it will 
               <br />
               cost money just to prevent ill-health in many 
               <br />
               cases. There are hundreds and thousands more 
               <br />
               items that I could think about if I had the time, 
               <br />
               but I don’t want to keep this Convention too long, 
               <br />
               Ijust want to emphasise the fact that those taxes 
               <br />
               have to be raised, and yesterday I brought it down 
               <br />
               to two localities; I did no harm in what I was 
               <br />
               trying to do, I wanted to show the responsibility 
               <br />
               that would fall on the people of the different 
               <br />
               villages and settlements and towns throughout 
               <br />
               this country if we have got to put those services 
               <br />
               in. I believe they should be put in if we have 
               <br />
               responsible government or Commission of 
               <br />
               Government. I am sure it should be done if we 
               <br />
               have Commission government. And then we will 
               <br />
               have our people saying, “I don’t know how much 
               <br />
               taxes I am paying". Nobody knows. Canadians 
               <br />
               know, yes the Canadians know Why does the 
               <br />
               Canadian and Nova Scotia man know? Because 
               <br />
               the Nova Scotia man collects the taxes, and not 
               <br />
               only collects the taxes, but he employs an army 
               <br />
               — six councillors here and six there and 12 
               <br />
               somewhere else to see if those taxes are used 
               <br />
               right.

               That’s all I am going to say on this, and I 
               <br />
               believe there are others wanting to get the ﬂoor. 
               <br />
               I want to emphasise this fact to our people that 
               <br />
               we cannot go on, and we are not going to go on 
               <br />
               getting a handout from the federal government of 
               <br />
               Canada to run this country. Now that‘s all we 
               <br />
               talked of so far — handouts. When that time 
               <br />
               comes we will have a royal commission and what 
               <br />
               will we ﬁnd? Perhaps $100,000 or $200,000, 
               <br />
               perhaps $500,000 being collected for municipal 
               <br />
               services outside St. John‘s. What is the royal 
               <br />
               commission going to say? “Why you are not 
               <br />
               taxing your people at all — look what our people 
               <br />
               are paying. You have got to bring it up." And that 
               <br />
               is the question before <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us'</span> today. Now whether our 
               <br />
               people are going to have that royal commission 
               <br />
               down is none of my business, they have got the
