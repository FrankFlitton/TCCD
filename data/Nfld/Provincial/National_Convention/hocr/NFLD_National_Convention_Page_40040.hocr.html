               <br />
               was the thought of the people who sent me here. 
               <br />
               I have hesitated to mention such a mundane affair 
               <br />
               as eating hitherto, because our discussions have 
               <br />
               been of a somewhat exalted nature, concerned 
               <br />
               with such things as rights and wrongs; but I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">don’t,</span> 
               <br />
               think the question can belong avoided. I hold it 
               <br />
               true that political independence is based on 
               <br />
               economic independence. We had a form of politi- 
               <br />
               cal independence in this country for many years. 
               <br />
               When we lost our economic independence our 
               <br />
               political independence went too. Should we not 
               <br />
               learn something from our own history, and make 
               <br />
               sure that we are not to be faced with a similar 
               <br />
               situation? The economic independence of our 
               <br />
               country is in turn dependent on the economic 
               <br />
               independence of the people who compose it. If a 
               <br />
               man is not economically independent, what 
               <br />
               freedom has he? He may vote in a free election 
               <br />
               for the candidate of his choice every two weeks 
               <br />
               or every two years; but if he isn’t freeto eat three 
               <br />
               times a day, I repeat, what freedom has he? What 
               <br />
               do I mean by economic independence, you ask? 
               <br />
               Just this. In a parody of the famous words of 
               <br />
               Mr. Micawber, annual income $1,000, annual 
               <br />
               expenditure $900 -— result freedom. Annual <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in‘</span> 
               <br />
               come $1,000, annual expenditure $1,100 — 
               <br />
               result economic servitude. The man in this 
               <br />
               country who can look his neighbour in the face 
               <br />
               and tell him what’s what is economically free, 
               <br />
               and if he hasn’t got political freedom he’ll soon 
               <br />
               start getting it. People who have money to spend 
               <br />
               are not afraid to assume their own respon~ 
               <br />
               sibilities. Let us set our economic house in shape, 
               <br />
               let us have independent-minded men, and you 
               <br />
               and I can go home tomorrow. Let us fall short of 
               <br />
               that attainment and we may wrangle on here till 
               <br />
               doomsday.

               There are those who claim this country is 
               <br />
               self-supporting, and maybe it is. But I wonder 
               <br />
               whether they also assert that our economic sys- 
               <br />
               tem is fundamentally sound. When things are 
               <br />
               going well most of us fail to see the inherent 
               <br />
               weakness of the very system that is providing the 
               <br />
               monetary prosperity. Perhaps it is because we are 
               <br />
               too conservative in our thinking. We are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extreme.</span>

               many new ideas and someone might call you a 
               <br />
               radical, or even a socialist, or perhaps something

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anachronism.</span> It’s almost medieval. Certainly our 
               <br />
               economic setup has all the earmarks of the old 
               <br />
               feudal system, with its lords and villeins. Perhaps 
               <br />
               in our case the villains are the lords.

               <br />
               change the rules. Our economic system has not

               changed its fundamental character, except in 
               <br />

               our economic setup is not conducive to individual

               ting it so mildly I have not obscured the fact. If

               you want something specific to argue about take 
               <br />
