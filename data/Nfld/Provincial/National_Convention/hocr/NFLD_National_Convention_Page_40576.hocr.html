               Firstly, what did the mission of this delegation 
               <br />
               to London accomplish? To begin with we were 
               <br />
               successful in having the £400,000 temporary 
               <br />
               loan of 1917, on which no interest had been paid, 
               <br />
               cancelled — it’s off the books. Secondly, I con~ 
               <br />
               tend that we were primarily instrumental in 
               <br />
               having our sterling debt which amounts to nearly 
               <br />
               $72 million and which now bears interest at 3%, 
               <br />
               converted, or rather we were promised it would 
               <br />
               be converted, to 2.5% on January l next. In 
               <br />
               addition, we were successful in having the British 
               <br />
               government use the sinking fund of this debt, 
               <br />
               which will amount to $8.25 million in July, for 
               <br />
               the purpose of reducing this particular debt. By 
               <br />
               this action the treasury of the country will save at 
               <br />
               least half a million dollars annually. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               We are of the opinion, or at least I am, that 
               <br />
               because of our representations the Dominions 
               <br />
               Ofﬁce will probably devote our interest-free 
               <br />
               loans to the further reduction of our sterling debt, 
               <br />
               and that because of our consistent emphasis, there 
               <br />
               is a good possibility of the United Kingdom 
               <br />
               giving us an order for our fresh and frozen fish 
               <br />
               this season. They assure us that they are doing 
               <br />
               their best, such as it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is.</span>

               To me, this whole affair simply represents a 
               <br />
               continuance of the policy which has been operat- 
               <br />
               ing in Newfoundland since 1934. It is just another 
               <br />
               piece in the jig-saw puzzle into which New- 
               <br />
               foundland has been cut up. But these pieces are 
               <br />
               gradually being put together, and when the last 
               <br />
               piece is put in place, and the puzzle solved, some 
               <br />
               people amongst us may be in for a surprise. 
               <br />
               Because, if the forces opposed to us have their 
               <br />
               way, it will not be a picture of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               they will see, not the Newfoundland which the 
               <br />
               Commission took over in 1934, but instead a part

               <br />
               But for the present let me continue my comments 
               <br />
               on the delegates’ visit. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Let me say that i do not believe that the British 
               <br />
               government ever wanted to see a delegation from 
               <br />
               this country coming to England. And why should 
               <br />
               they? For has not this visit shown that they had 
               <br />
               long ago finalised their plans concerning us? But 
               <br />
               this Convention decided to send a delegation, and 
               <br />
               faced with this request, the British government 
               <br />
               had no other choice but to put a good face on the 
               <br />
               matter. It would have been very bad politics for 
               <br />
               them to have done otherwise. Even so, they 
               <br />
               showed very little enthusiasm. Members will 
               <br />
               remember that before they would consider meet- 
               <br />
               ing us they demanded that we ﬁrst place on paper 
               <br />
               the matters we wished to discuss. This was hardly 
               <br />
               an invitation to the open and free discussion we 
               <br />
               had hoped for. You know how it is when someone 
               <br />
               calls at your door that you don’t want to see. If 
               <br />
               you can’t say you are not at home, you tell the 
               <br />
               servant to ask the man what he wants to see you 
               <br />
               about, and so it was with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us.</span> Viscount Addison 
               <br />
               first wanted to know what we wanted to see him 
               <br />
               about to prepare himself in advance. He did not 
               <br />
               want to be taken by surprise. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now compare this with the preliminaries of 
               <br />
               sending a delegation to Canada. Did they send us 
               <br />
               a guarded request to know what we wanted to see 
               <br />
               them about? Did they ask for memorandums? 
               <br />
               Not at all. They almost fell over themselves put- 
               <br />
               ting out the welcome hand. A delegation would 
               <br />
               be welcomed with a heart and a half. The joy bells 
               <br />
               will ring out in Ottawa when they arrive. Now 
               <br />
               what does all this mean? ln the first place it means 
               <br />
               that the British government has endorsed 
               <br />
               Canada’s action <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-—</span> that she has encouraged 
               <br />
               Canada to give us a big hand. And ifshe has done 
               <br />
               this, it also means that the British government is 
               <br />
               prepared to see us go into Canada — that she 
               <br />
               wants us to go in with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada.</span> For myself I see 
               <br />
               in it just a further continuation of something 
               <br />
               which I have long expected. I have much <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inter</span> 
               <br />
               esting evidence, which I may place before this 
               <br />
               house at a later date, when the matter of forms of 
               <br />
               government eventually comes up. But for the 
               <br />
               present I say this, and you may think i am talking 
               <br />
               rashly if you wish. I say to you that there is in 
               <br />
               operation at the present time a conspiracy to sell, 
               <br />
               and I use the word “sell” advisedly, this country
