               the Economic Committee delivered through 
               <br />
               Major Cashin its Economic Report. As a supple- 
               <br />
               ment to this report, the Committee made a 
               <br />
               serious, and I believe sincere attempt, to give an 
               <br />
               estimate of our probable revenue for the next 
               <br />
               three years, which period they called the foresee~ 
               <br />
               able future. They were careful to say that they 
               <br />
               were guessing, but that this guess was based on 
               <br />
               present day facts, as they saw them; and as they 
               <br />
               were all intelligent men, they made what they 
               <br />
               said was an estimate of what our economic con-

               <br />

               <br />
               15 months ago. Mr. Smallwood ridiculed the idea

               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ahead.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mrl</span> Smallwood used his bitterest sarcasm

               <br />

               <br />
               delivers it for our appreciation. And I have no

               doubt if the gentleman from Bonavista Centre

               further into the stratosphere, he would have done

               so with equal facility.
