               <br />
               in rising to move that the Forestry Report as 
               <br />

               weekly since appointed some four weeks ago, 
               <br />
               and have been able to get together some most 
               <br />
               interesting and valuable information relative to 
               <br />
               the forest industries of the island of New- 
               <br />
               foundland and its possession, Labrador. All mat-

               <br />
               under severalheadin gs, have received the closest 
               <br />
               attention of every member of the Committee and 
               <br />
               I am glad to be able to inform the Convention that 
               <br />
               our ﬁndings are definitely unanimous. I regret 
               <br />
               however, that owing to our friend Mr. KM. 
               <br />
               Brown having been ill, he was unable to attend 
               <br />
               all meetings. I want to take this opportunity of 
               <br />
               paying special tribute to Messrs. MacDonald, 
               <br />
               Vincent, Dawe and Cashin, who were the sub— 
               <br />
               committee appointed to draft this report, and who 
               <br />
               have been instrumental in making the report of 
               <br />
               such general interest. I would now request Major 
               <br />
               Cashin to give a review of the entire report for 
               <br />

               have noted, the various phases of the report cover

               did not get all the information which we required

               <br />
               been unable to furnish us with any survey of 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               will notice, we have deemed it advisable to fur- 
               <br />
               nish some historical background. We have 
               <br />
               thought this necessary, in order that the Conven— 
               <br />
               tion may more clearly understand just how things 
               <br />
               are with us today. I might say, and I feel that I 
               <br />
               speak on behalf of the members of our commit- 
               <br />
               tee, that irrespective of our individual political

               leanings, we have always kept in mind the neces- 
               <br />
               sity of our being as objectively factual and as 
               <br />
               impartial as possible. No attempt has been made 
               <br />
               to distort circumstances or exaggerate ﬁgures, 
               <br />
               and we have only criticised where we conscien-

               tiously felt that such criticism was fully justiﬁed

               will be noted that by far the greater portion of our

               timberlands has been acquired by the two pulp 
               <br />

               <br />
               be regarded by some as debatable. But certain it 
               <br />
               is that we cannot do much about it just now, and
