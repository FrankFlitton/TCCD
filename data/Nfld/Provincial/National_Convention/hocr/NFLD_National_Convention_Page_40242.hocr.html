               Mr. Job Mr. Chairman, I support the resolution 
               <br />
               proposed by Mr. Smallwood, and take the oppor— 
               <br />
               tunity to make a few remarks on the subject which 
               <br />
               I think is allied to the resolution. My view for 
               <br />
               some time has been that we shall not make serious 
               <br />
               progress in helping to remedy certain existing 
               <br />
               defects in the economic position of New- 
               <br />
               foundland until we, as Newfoundlanders, are able 
               <br />
               to sit down at a round table conference with 
               <br />

               <br />
               discuss not only the question of operation of 
               <br />
               airports, and the concessions already given and 
               <br />
               asked for in connection with defence bases, but 
               <br />
               also our general economic position. As you are 
               <br />
               probably aware by this time, I am of the opinion 
               <br />
               that we should on every possible occasion stress 
               <br />
               the fact that our valuable strategic position is 
               <br />
               being utilised by Canada, the USA and Great 
               <br />
               Britain for defence and other purposes, without 
               <br />
               any material return to Newfoundland for its use, 
               <br />

               <br />
               Newfoundland.

               there may be other matters which the members
