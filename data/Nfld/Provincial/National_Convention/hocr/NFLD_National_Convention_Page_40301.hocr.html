               Section 3 is the section that may be com- 
               <br />
               mented upon controversially, but which I hope 
               <br />
               will be accepted in the spirit in which it is offered. 
               <br />
               In my opinion we were elected to this Convention 
               <br />
               to deal in a fair and broad way with our problems, 
               <br />
               and to make recommendations for their solution. 
               <br />
               It may be that some think that the confederation 
               <br />
               issue would be better left alone altogether, and 
               <br />
               that it is not our business even to discuss it, but 
               <br />
               in view of the ruling of our late respected Chair- 
               <br />
               man, Mr. Justice Fox, concurred in by Professor 
               <br />
               Wheare, and I think I am right in saying by our 
               <br />
               present Chairman, that confederation with 
               <br />
               Canada is one of the issues open for debate, we 
               <br />
               would in my opinion be wrong in not facing this 
               <br />
               fact now, and making some preparations for its 
               <br />
               discussion at a future date. The inclusion of the 
               <br />
               confederation issue in this resolution is made 
               <br />
               only so that our deliberations and recommenda- 
               <br />
               tions can come to an end as soon as possible. I 
               <br />
               think that a discussion of the pros and cons of 
               <br />
               confederation or of any other form of government 
               <br />
               at the present juncture would be a great mistake, 
               <br />
               but I cannot agree that we would be unwise in 
               <br />
               seeking to gather now certain details which must 
               <br />
               have a bearing on the forms of government which 
               <br />
               it is clear to me we must debate if we are to 
               <br />
               accomplish the duties for which we were elected. 
               <br />
               However, the gathering of such information is the 
               <br />
               sole object of the resolution, which in its present 
               <br />
               form provides for reporting back to the whole 
               <br />
               Convention prior to the despatch of any delega-

               I would like to add that it is my ﬁrm belief that 
               <br />
               confederation with Canada would not be a satis- 
               <br />
               factory solution to our problems, but it is also 
               <br />
               evident to me that a considerable number of the 
               <br />
               people who have elected this Convention will 
               <br />
               expect a fair and free discussion of the subject. 
               <br />
               The main pointI want to stress is that this is in no 
               <br />
               way a resolution favouring confederation or any 
               <br />
               other form of government, and thatI have worded 
               <br />
               it as broadly as possible in the hope that it will be 
               <br />
               accepted as a non-controversial motion. There is 
               <br />
               only one other remark I would like to make, and 
               <br />
               that is that this whole resolution has been drafted 
               <br />
               by myself without any inﬂuence from any other 
               <br />
               member of the Convention.

               study very carefully and think about before we 
               <br />

               <br />
               ves quite a lot. In the first place, I would say 
               <br />
               “what steps, if any, are to be taken for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">estab»</span>

               lishing of improved economic or ﬁscal relation-

               ships" is a matter which is wholly and solely for 
               <br />
               the government of the day, or for the business 
               <br />
               people of the time. I can find nothing in the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland Act, or the Convention Act, 
               <br />
               which authorises us to set ourselves up as a body 
               <br />
               to deal with other nations... I wonder what at- 
               <br />
               titude the Commission of Government would 
               <br />
               take if we attempted to interfere in their preroga- 
               <br />
               tive, which they undoubtedly possess as the 
               <br />
               government of the day. It is surely their duty, and 
               <br />
               theirs only, to approach the United States with 
               <br />
               regard to concessions in tariff and other matters. 
               <br />
               On that point alone I think we are sticking our
