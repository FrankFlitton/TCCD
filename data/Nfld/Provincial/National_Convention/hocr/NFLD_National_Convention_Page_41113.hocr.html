               Mr. Smallwood All right; if Newfoundland rail— 
               <br />
               ways become CNR and you have to pay less than 
               <br />
               half what we are charged now, if you can get a 
               <br />
               berth for half what we are paying now, you will 
               <br />
               be glad to pay 35 cents tax. You are still saving 
               <br />
               dollars and dollars. The other question is, Mr. 
               <br />
               Fogwill has compiled a lot of ﬁgures with great 
               <br />
               industry - I know what it is to pore over docu- 
               <br />
               ments for hours and he must have worked hard. 
               <br />
               He has prepared a table showing to his own 
               <br />
               satisfaction where the Government of Canada 
               <br />
               would take from us $20 million. One of the 
               <br />
               ﬁgures he has to make up that $20 million is 
               <br />
               completely wrong. Another basis for his com- 
               <br />
               putation is, he ﬁgures the average Canadian duty 
               <br />
               as being 15% as applied to Newfoundland. Let us 
               <br />
               agree, for the sake of argument that that is correct. 
               <br />
               I think I know his reasoning, and there is a certain 
               <br />
               amount of common sense there. In Canada, the 
               <br />
               average is 10%. That is because of the large 
               <br />
               quantities of raw materials <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">transported</span> to go into 
               <br />
               their industries, which beings it down to an over— 
               <br />
               all rate of 10%. Whereas, in Newfoundland, we 
               <br />
               have mostly consumable goods coming in.

               Mr. Smallwood It may be 17% or it may be 
               <br />
               12%. I think that is a nice job for some Customs 
               <br />
               man to work out; I doubt my ability to do it and 
               <br />
               Idoubt Mr. Fogwill’s ability to do it. He has made 
               <br />
               a stab at it. I agree it would be more than the 
               <br />
               average in Canada, which is 10% and in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New«</span>

               something over 10%. Mr. Fogwill insists it would 
               <br />
               be 15%. I daresay if Mr. Howell were assisted by 
               <br />
               some of his ofﬁcials and were to spend several

               <br />
               to? He says 75% of what we are now importing 
               <br />
               is from non-Canadian countries. Why not say 
               <br />
               50%? How does he know it will be only one-third 
               <br />
               of what we import from the United States, British 
               <br />
               West Indies, the United Kingdom and the 
               <br />

               does he know in the future what we will be

               importing from Canada? Let us get down to brass 
               <br />
               tacks. I am interested in this confederation. If we 
               <br />
               become a province, no doubt there will be a 
               <br />
               change in our trade. Goods coming in from 
               <br />
               Canada will be duty free; and if you can get the 
               <br />
               goods from Canada, will not more be bought 
               <br />
               there rather than from other countries when you 
               <br />
               would have to pay duty? You will buy as much 
               <br />
               as you can from Canada, if Canada has it to sell. 
               <br />
               You cannot buy what she has not got. In some 
               <br />
               cases you may buy from other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">countries</span> and pay 
               <br />
               the duty and still save money, compared to what 
               <br />
               you would have to pay in Canada. There will be 
               <br />
               cases like that. What these cases are, I do not
