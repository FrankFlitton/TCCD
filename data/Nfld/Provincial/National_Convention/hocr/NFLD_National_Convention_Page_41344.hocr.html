               Most people realise now that the stabilisation

               <br />
               ment; and to those who talk of our additional 
               <br />
               social services, I would say that the millions spent 
               <br />
               on dole made necessary many of these services 
               <br />
               — I have in mind the undemourishment of our 
               <br />
               people as a cause of the present high cost of 
               <br />
               Public Health and Welfare. I feel that these high- 
               <br />
               ly-spoken-of additional services may be a burden 
               <br />
               of expense which any future government may 
               <br />
               very well find it difﬁcult to maintain. This 
               <br />
               degrading dole business brought to many of our 
               <br />
               people a lack of that independence and initiative 
               <br />
               so characteristic of Newfoundlanders, many of 
               <br />
               whom are now willing to wait for government 
               <br />
               assistance or accept bonuses from other 
               <br />

               niﬁcent role played by Britain in the recent war, 
               <br />
               we must realise that she is in the worst position 
               <br />
               of her history, so we cannot expect her to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under»</span> 
               <br />
               write our ﬁnances. Most of the evils of Commis- 
               <br />
               sion were due to the set-up rather than the 
               <br />
               personnel, as in all matters of policy they were 
               <br />
               subject to the Dominions Office, and in my 
               <br />
               opinion the English Commissioners were never 
               <br />
               left here long enough to get a thorough grasp of 
               <br />
               the problems of our economy or the requirements 
               <br />
               of our people. Certainly, they could not expect to 
               <br />
               get a knowledge of the former, with their behind- 
               <br />
               the—scenes policy, having no consultations with 
               <br />
               the men who make possible our trade and com~ 
               <br />
               merce, and most certainly not the latter, when 
               <br />
               people were completely ignored and disregarded 
               <br />
               on all matters pertaining to their welfare. To put 
               <br />
               it simply, it is practical dictatorship from 
               <br />
               Dominions Ofﬁce, the heads of which were quite 
               <br />
               satisﬁed with balanced budgets, and that no loud

               that we fully appreciate Britain’s war effort, and

               Mr. Chairman, before I deal with responsible 
               <br />
               government, it might be well to point out that 
               <br />
               whilst the primary function of government is to 
               <br />
               provide rules and safeguards for law and order, 
               <br />
               to secure freedom and liberty and protect the 
               <br />
               rights of the people, it should also provide an 
               <br />
               efﬁcient administrative service, advance the 
               <br />
               causes of public health, education and other social 
               <br />
               services; provide communications, endeavour to 
               <br />
               raise living standards, assist trade and commerce 
               <br />
               and help develop natural resources. When this 
               <br />
               country ﬁrst got responsible government, its 
               <br />
               population was something over one-third what it 
               <br />
               is today, whilst its revenue was only about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one</span> 
               <br />
               eightieth, Yet our forebears had the courage to 
               <br />
               want to govern themselves. Today, with a record 
               <br />
               revenue of $40 million, when we are enjoying the 
               <br />
               greatest prosperity in our history, some of our 
               <br />
               people are so lethargic as to shun the respon~ 
               <br />
               sibilities of self-government. We undoubtedly 
               <br />
               have made steady progress since the beginning of 
               <br />
               this century. We have a much larger population; 
               <br />
               our standard of living is higher, and many of our 
               <br />
               natural resources are being developed, and it is 
               <br />
               time that we realised our importance. We should 
               <br />
               remember that from the very discovery of this 
               <br />
               island we have had something that others <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wanted.</span> 
               <br />
               In our early history, it was our teeming waters, 
               <br />
               today it is the key position of strategic value in 
               <br />
               the defence of the western hemisphere. The 
               <br />
               recent war really put us on the map, and our 
               <br />
               country has become known and its value ap- 
               <br />
               preciated by the occupation forces from all over, 
               <br />
               both the USA and Canada. This factor alone, 
               <br />
               gives us a strong bargaining power. It is quite 
               <br />
               unnecessary for me to dwell further on this point, 
               <br />
               as it has been thoroughly covered by other 
               <br />
               delegates, particulzuly by Mr. Higgins and the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> R. B. Job. Coupled with this is another 
               <br />
               factor of equal importance, the vast mineral 
               <br />
               deposits of our northern dependency, Labrador. 
               <br />
               This point has been stressed by Major Cashin, but 
               <br />
               it well merits repetition, without becoming 
               <br />
               tedious.
