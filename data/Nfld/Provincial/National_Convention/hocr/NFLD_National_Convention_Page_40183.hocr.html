               Mr. Cashin We discussed that matter at our

               <br />
               is about 50 years, something should be done in 
               <br />
               order to guard against possible denudation of 
               <br />

               in the Evening Telegram this evening which

               questioned the report’s statement of the timber 
               <br />
               owned by the AND Company. But if you take

               <br />
               story.
