               In our Mining Committee investigations, we 
               <br />
               picked up material everywhere. Some of it was 
               <br />
               authentic, and some was fairy tales. Some that 
               <br />
               was given as authentic by responsible authorities, 
               <br />
               was retracted as late as 12 o’clock today. Can we, 
               <br />
               in view of all this, make up our minds and be 
               <br />
               straight about it? We looked back to the year 
               <br />
               books and other books to find the history of the 
               <br />
               iron ore industry and the steel industry, which we 
               <br />
               know nothing about in this country. We know 
               <br />
               plenty about the iron ore industry and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nig»</span> 
               <br />
               gardIy manner in which it has been developed 
               <br />
               here, and we find that iron ore mines never pay. 
               <br />
               One man said, “We lost 30 cents a ton last year 
               <br />
               due to a low dollar rate and 30 cents a ton because 
               <br />
               we wrote a contract and the sterling exchange 
               <br />
               failed.” 60 cents a ton on their ore production, and 
               <br />
               they go right on operating! They don’t hesitate. 
               <br />
               What is the answer? The answer is that they feed 
               <br />
               the raw material to the company away, and the 
               <br />
               steel company makes a proﬁt. That is a mean 
               <br />
               position for Newfoundland to be in. If it can be 
               <br />
               avoided in a second instance, it is well worth 
               <br />
               consideration for a few minutes today. I don’t 
               <br />
               want to force you into it, but I do point out that 
               <br />
               such is the position, and we may have a repetition 
               <br />
               of it again. True, there is everything in the act to 
               <br />
               protect us in the net proﬁts and more in the 
               <br />
               income tax act, but that company has a right to 
               <br />
               sell out to a steel company. and after that our 
               <br />
               trouble begins.

               We had a question of 10 cents per ton, which 
               <br />
               came up before the government some years ago 
               <br />
               and was written into the original agreement. The 
               <br />
               company argued that they could not operate if 
               <br />
               they had to pay 10 cents a ton, but among the 
               <br />
               information that we presented to you on page 16, 
               <br />
               there is a little tabulation of ﬁgures... Let’s not 
               <br />
               forget that this Labrador Mining and Exploration 
               <br />
               Co. could not pay us 10 cents a ton, and let’s 
               <br />
               compare their operations with present prices in 
               <br />
               the Michigan area. We ﬁnd there is one opera- 
               <br />
               tion, taxes paid the government, 24 cents per ton. 
               <br />
               That’s the Gogebic, it’s underground mining and 
               <br />
               we believe the ore content would be about the 
               <br />
               same percentage. You have taxes of 24 cents per 
               <br />
               ton. You have 33.5 cents per ton <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">royalty...</span> In the 
               <br />
               town you have federal income and excess proﬁts 
               <br />
               to the extent of 15 cents a ton. If you add all these 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               up you will ﬁnd that that mine pays out as royalty, 
               <br />
               as these ﬁgures add up, 69 cents per ton... We 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that the Michigan operation pays 69 cents 
               <br />
               per ton, and the company coming in here is 
               <br />
               flabbergastcd at the idea of paying 10 cents a ton. 
               <br />
               Has anyone got the answer to that? Give me the 
               <br />
               answer to that, and 1 will sit down quite conten-

               tedly. But the information came at a late date on

               a lot of these items, and we have not been able to

               Mr. Hollett I don’t intend to say much on this. 
               <br />
               but I am entirely in agreement with Mr. Miller. I 
               <br />
               am thoroughly convinced that Newfoundland as 
               <br />
               a country has got a raw deal in this 1944 act, and 
               <br />
               I can‘t understand any man trying to praise it and 
               <br />
               saying we got the best act in the world.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Hollett Idon’t know. You might not have 
               <br />
               been here. The 1938 act does not look so bad. 
               <br />
               There were some chances for the treasury to 
               <br />
               obtain some income from it, and after all that’s 
               <br />
               the only direct value to the treasury — the royal— 
               <br />
               ties and the income tax which can be obtained 
               <br />
               from the operations. Under this 1944 act, if you 
               <br />
               run through it carefully, you will find that by the 
               <br />
               time the company has taken out all the things 
               <br />
               which they may take out, it is practically impos- 
               <br />
               sible for them to make any proﬁt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whatever,</span> and 
               <br />
               they will be like the mine in the Michigan area. 
               <br />
               They have been operating at a considerable loss 
               <br />
               but still are in operation, and 1 am quite sure that 
               <br />
               all these mines are under the contract of certain 
               <br />
               steel manufacturing companies. I am not con- 
               <br />
               vinced yet that this company in Labrador is not 
               <br />
               working in conjunction with steel manufacturers, 
               <br />
               because I can’t understand anyone spending 
               <br />
               $125 million without having made some 
               <br />
               provision for the sale of their ore, and I think the 
               <br />
               steel companies are in league with them on this 
               <br />
               deal. It is pointed out that we will have a lot of 
               <br />
               men down there in that visionary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">town.</span> I fail to 
               <br />
               see where, in this country, they are going to get 
               <br />
               many miners. We have some in Bell Island and 
               <br />
               some in Buchans, but no others. If we put them 
               <br />
               in Labrador you have to deplete the manpower of 
               <br />
               these other places, and you <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can’t</span> expect the men
