               Mr. Miller Mr. Chairman, before you proceed 
               <br />
               with notice of motion there is one point I would 
               <br />
               like to be satisﬁed on. Since it seems necessary 
               <br />
               to be known by certain names I suggest that I be 
               <br />
               known as “the very brief speaker.” There are only 
               <br />
               two things necessary here and that is clarity and 
               <br />
               consistency. My friend from Bonavista stated last 
               <br />
               fall and reiterated today, and very emphatically, 
               <br />
               that we could not approach the United States on 
               <br />
               this tariff <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question.</span> I am not doubting his word at 
               <br />
               all, but I am going to refer you to the ﬁfth line in 
               <br />
               the paragraph that deals with clause one,1 which 
               <br />
               was in reference to the tariff question... Now 
               <br />
               that’s a report back to us from the Commission 
               <br />
               of Government. Am I to believe that the Commis- 
               <br />
               sion would not hazard an opinion as to whether 
               <br />
               or not we could do this? Why don’t they give us 
               <br />
               a clear understandable answer that it could or 
               <br />
               could not be done? This is a masterpiece of 
               <br />
               discreetness. I would accept it with better grace 
               <br />
               if I did not think it was in part subscribed to by 
               <br />
               our own Committee. The whole thing has been 
               <br />
               passed over very lightly. They went to confer 
               <br />
               with the Commission of Government with a 
               <br />
               resolution that contained three important clauses. 
               <br />
               Somewhere along the way they forgot about one 
               <br />
               clause, and they come back with this answer, 
               <br />

               <br />
               of any matter the ﬁrst essential is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">estab»</span>

               mission of Government did not give an opinion, 
               <br />
               and the Committee did not give an opinion. The 
               <br />
               word “doubtful” stays here, despite the fact that 
               <br />
               we have the opinion of the member from 
               <br />
               Bonavista, expressed twice, that we cannot do it. 
               <br />
               I want to know can we do it or can’t we? If we 
               <br />
               can’t, then I think it should be stated definitely 
               <br />
               and in understandable language in this report, and 
               <br />
               until such time as this paragraph dealing with 
               <br />
               clause one is corrected I certainly will not vote 
               <br />

               Mr. Fudge There is no need for me to go into

               <br />

               <br />
               do not agree with it. It has been my contention all

               along that the first duty of this Convention is to

               <br />
               only prejudice our possibilities of the best

               I regret that thus far there has been nothing or 
               <br />
               very little said of an encouraging nature as far as 
               <br />
               our country is concerned. We have been sub- 
               <br />
               jected to‘a steady ﬂow of hot air which has tended 
               <br />
               to hold our little country up to the ridicule of the 
               <br />
               outside world. Sometime ago we were given 
               <br />
               good advice by our fellow member when he said 
               <br />
               if we had any dirty linen to wash, why not wash 
               <br />
               it in private? I feel very strongly about the time 
               <br />
               which is being wasted. In the early days we had 
               <br />
               a resolution to send a delegation to Ottawa and 
               <br />
               we are still talking about delegations outside of 
               <br />
               our own country when we do not know what is in 
               <br />
               our own warehouse.

               Mr. Chairman, if any delegation goes from 
               <br />
               this country they should know what stock is in 
               <br />
               our own warehouse and then find out what the

               <br />
