               Yesterday I think I ended on a certain tax 
               <br />
               notice which I have in my hand, with reference 
               <br />
               to an amount of some $28.62, levied on the estate 
               <br />
               of a deceased person in Cape Breton. The estate 
               <br />
               was valued at $100, and the amount of taxes 
               <br />
               collected up to that time, at least the amount of 
               <br />
               taxes accrued in four years was $28.62, and that 
               <br />
               consisted of the county rate, school rate and poll 
               <br />
               rate of$7. 13 per year. It has been intimated to me 
               <br />
               outside this House, that that is not the case all 
               <br />
               over Canada. I have also a notice which appeared 
               <br />
               in the Port Arthur News Chronicle on Thursday, 
               <br />
               November 6, dealing with the public sale of land 
               <br />
               because taxes and costs had not been paid...

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I read that to show that in the provinces of 
               <br />
               Canada, as in Newfoundland when we are a 
               <br />
               province, monies have to be raised in order to pay

               and all other things pertaining to government in 
               <br />
               any province or country. These monies have to 
               <br />
               be raised, and the point I am trying to make, 
               <br />
               which I think nobody in this House can deny, is 
               <br />
               that ifwe give away our revenue—producing taxes 
               <br />
               now, if we give up our customs duties. if we give 
               <br />
               up the monies which the Assessor collects from 
               <br />
               our people, we lose about $30 million in this 
               <br />
               country; and we still have to carry on the services 
               <br />
               for forestry, and various other things — justice 
               <br />
               incidentally has to be taken care of. So in order 
               <br />
               to raise the money we must tax. There is nothing 
               <br />
               left to tax except our land, homes, personal 
               <br />
               property, in other words real and personal proper» 
               <br />
               ty. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               1 think I have got almost as far as to say that, 
               <br />
               for the ﬁrst three years of confederation, the 
               <br />
               Province of Newfoundland will have a revenue 
               <br />
               of $11,462,128. You remember 1 accepted the 
               <br />
               irreducible minimum, and not the $6,820,000, 
               <br />
               because, as 1 pointed out, your irreducible mini» 
               <br />
               mum is the only thing on which you can bank. 
               <br />
               The only guarantee from the Canadian govern» 
               <br />
               merit is that that will be paid and I showed you 
               <br />
               how, in one province in Canada, the irreducible 
               <br />
               minimum was last year all that could be paid, 
               <br />
               because the GNP and the population had altered 
               <br />
               to such an extent that it could not be increased. 
               <br />
               And so we go back to the beginning of union with 
               <br />
               a revenue of $11,462,128, or, for purposes of 
               <br />
               reckoning, let us add another $500,000 for the 
               <br />
               possible purpose of interest from our so»ealled 
               <br />
               surplus. Right here I must say that we are banking 
               <br />
               an awful lot on the surplus, $28 million apparent» 
               <br />
               ly. £9 million of that is in Great Britain, in sterl- 
               <br />
               ing. That is $15 million subtracted from $28 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million,</span> That leaves $13 million, ifI am correct. 
               <br />
               There is no gainsaying that we may not have to 
               <br />
               do the same thing next year to market our ﬁsh or 
               <br />
               our iron ore. But let us say we have about $12 
               <br />
               million in this country in dollar funds. One-third 
               <br />
               of that will go to Canada to be placed at interest 
               <br />
               there, which we cannot use for current expendi- 
               <br />
               ture, which will leave us only about $8 million. 
               <br />
               So don’t let us bank on that $28 million too much, 
               <br />
               a surplus is of no value to this country unless it is 
               <br />
               liquid, unless you can obtain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> If it is in sterling 
               <br />
               funds in Great Britain it might just as well be in 
               <br />
               the bottom ofa mine. It is of no value to us unless 
               <br />
               it is liquid, if you like to pay for our ﬁsh or iron 
               <br />
