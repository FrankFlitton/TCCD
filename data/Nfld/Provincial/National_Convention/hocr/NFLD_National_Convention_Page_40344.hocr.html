               right! When we come to talk about making a tariff

               <br />
               the Government of Newfoundland, whatever that 
               <br />
               may be, not the Convention. We were not elected 
               <br />
               as a government to do the job of the government; 
               <br />
               not elected to make a trade treaty or get tariff 
               <br />
               concessions with the United States...

               Suppose we had responsible government in 
               <br />
               ofﬁce today and we wanted to take up with the 
               <br />
               United States this question of trade tariffs and 
               <br />
               concessions, could our responsible government 
               <br />
               do it? Yes! On two conditions. First, if Great 
               <br />
               Britain were willing. Up to the last minute we had 
               <br />
               responsible government in 1934, the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment of Newfoundland could not go gallivanting 
               <br />
               up to make trade treaties on its own. If we had 
               <br />
               signed the Statute of Westminster we would be 
               <br />
               able to do it. But we never signed that. In 1920 
               <br />
               when Sir Richard Squires wanted a treaty with 
               <br />
               Spain and when Sir Robert Bond wanted a treaty 
               <br />
               with the United States, they had to do it through 
               <br />
               diplomatic channels, that is the British ambas— 
               <br />
               sador, and the British foreign minister. That is 
               <br />
               how we would have to deal today if we had 
               <br />
               responsible government, only if the US were 
               <br />
               willing to discuss the matter. Why will they not 
               <br />
               discuss it? Because in April they are having an 
               <br />
               international conference and until that is held, 
               <br />
               they have no intention whatever of making any 
               <br />
               separate deals with individual <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nations...</span>

               So the government gave us this advice, and 
               <br />
               you have to give credit where credit is due. They 
               <br />
               said this matter of trade concessions, allowing

               Government of the United States... I do not like 
               <br />
               the Commission of Government. At least, if

               anyone comes in here to paint them as a pack of 
               <br />
               scoundrels, let us have proof! Then Major Cashin 
               <br />
               read out something Mr. Attlee said, adding 
               <br />
               “when I made that statement a lot of the members 
               <br />
               did not agree with my interpretation of it." The 
               <br />
               interpretation was this: Mr. Attlee said and could 
               <br />
               mean only that they were here for another three 
               <br />
               years. You can hold your Convention and 
               <br />
               referendum; they are going to be here for another 
               <br />
               three years... Where is there a scrap of evidence 
               <br />
               that the Commission is going to be here another

               unless it is some cockeyed foolish thing, they will 
               <br />
               put on the ballot and the people will get their
