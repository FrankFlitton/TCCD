               going to hurt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them...</span> But it is going to hurt 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. If this goes on we will do an 
               <br />
               injustice that will take a long time to live down. 
               <br />
               This delegation to be sent to England should 
               <br />
               not be put in the embarrassing position of going 
               <br />
               over there with the record of this Convention and 
               <br />
               some of the ungrateful and unkind remarks be- 
               <br />
               hind them, about the British government in its 
               <br />
               dealings with this country. We are not out of the 
               <br />
               woods yet. We might have to go to the British 
               <br />
               government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">again...</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I believe in London there is 
               <br />
               information that this Convention needs to have 
               <br />
               and the people of Newfoundland need to have. I 
               <br />
               am very much in favour of sending a delegation 
               <br />
               to London to get it. 
               <br />
               Mr. Bailey I think this is a move which should 
               <br />
               have been taken, not in 1947, but every year since 
               <br />
               1934. I fail to see how any country can govern 
               <br />
               another country without some connection <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be»</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tween.“</span> I have listened carefully to the remarks 
               <br />
               of our learned friend from Labrador and I ap- 
               <br />
               preciate what he said. I honestly believe that what 
               <br />
               we have said here should have been said long 
               <br />
               before because —— as I told His Excellency and as 
               <br />
               I told members of the Commission - the greatest 
               <br />
               crime that any nation can do against another 
               <br />
               nation is to take away from it something that men 
               <br />
               had given their very lives for, the right of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self»</span> 
               <br />
               government. For the sake of $2 a head, we lost 
               <br />
               that. There may be members who do not feel the 
               <br />
               way I feel about it, but I will never forgive the 
               <br />
               British government, whether Conservative, Tory 
               <br />
               or Labour for the wrong they have done in taking 
               <br />
               our liberty from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us...</span> I have read the Amulree 
               <br />
               Report through 27 times. I am sure if everyone in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland had read that report they would 
               <br />
               have realised that our government should have 
               <br />
               been restored in 1942; now we ﬁnd that Amulree 
               <br />
               had no right or authority to make the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland believe the things contained in 
               <br />
               this report, and it is nothing to our credit. Nobody 
               <br />
               has made any representations at all, and in fact 
               <br />
               the members who are in the British House of 
               <br />
               Commons today don’t know what to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do.</span> Had 
               <br />
               there been six or seven men each year going over 
               <br />
               to the British House of Commons, and letting the 
               <br />
               people of Britain know what we want, it would 
               <br />
               have been all right, but I doubt if there are 50 
               <br />
               people in the British House today who know what 
               <br />
               is going on in this country.

               <br />

               our fortune or misfortune? We are not too strong
