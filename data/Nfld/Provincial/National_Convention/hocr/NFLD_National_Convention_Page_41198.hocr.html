               <br />
               this talk about us being sold up the St. Lawrence. 
               <br />
               Let us for a moment give a little thought to the 
               <br />
               value of the Black Books. One member has stated 
               <br />
               they’re not worth 25 cents -— remembering of 
               <br />
               course, that the same gentleman said this Con- 
               <br />
               vention is a fraud, and said so before it came into 
               <br />
               being. Still, you let him become a part of it, and 
               <br />
               he is still with it. With the knowledge the thing is 
               <br />
               wrong, he still remains in it. Is it too much to 
               <br />
               assume that the same member knows responsible 
               <br />
               government is wrong, as far as the working man 
               <br />
               is concerned? Whether he is activated by per— 
               <br />
               sonal motives or the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wellvbeing</span> of the people may

               be debateable...

               Mr. Starkes Personal income tax. It is true that 
               <br />
               income tax is owed in Canada. But what does it 
               <br />
               amount to? For example, take a married man with 
               <br />
               no children in Newfoundland. He would pay no 
               <br />
               income tax up to $2,000, but he pays at least 15% 
               <br />
               on the $2,000 that he spends in this country, 
               <br />
               which means that he pays in duty $300 to the 
               <br />
               importer of the goods he buys, and he also pays 
               <br />
               that importer at least 20% on the proﬁt on the 
               <br />
               duty, making a total of at least $360 that family 
               <br />
               man paid at the present time. In union with 
               <br />
               Canada he would pay no duty if he imported 
               <br />
               goods from Canada, but he would pay sales tax 
               <br />
               on say $1,000 of the $2,000, because over 50% 
               <br />
               of what he was buying would be exempted from 
               <br />
               sales tax. Therefore, on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,000</span> that he spent 
               <br />
               he pays 8%, which is $80. That is sales tax. So 
               <br />
               union with Canada takes from that man $80; 
               <br />
               while responsible or Commission government 
               <br />
               takes from that same man approximately $360. 
               <br />
               That is to say he is paying $280 more each year 
               <br />
               than he would have to pay under confederation. 
               <br />
               Now take a married man earning the same 
               <br />
               amount, with three children in the family. He 
               <br />
               would pay no taxes in Newfoundland under 
               <br />
               $2,000 except the duties. He now pays, as already 
               <br />
               stated, around 15% and the proﬁt, which totals 
               <br />
               $360. Under union with Canada, he would pay 
               <br />
               the $80 sales tax only, and he would receive from 
               <br />
               Canada at least $250 family allowance —- that 
               <br />
               man would save $360 plus $250 family <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">allowan~</span> 
               <br />
               ces, which gives him a total of $610. And he pays 
               <br />
               out $80 sales tax only. He therefore has ap- 
               <br />
               proximately $530 more to spend under con— 
               <br />
