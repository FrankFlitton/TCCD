               clannish, and in war they are very loyal, but at 
               <br />
               home we are suspicious of our governments and 
               <br />
               one another, very divided in our opinions. Lord 
               <br />
               Ammon, of the British Goodwill Mission, who 
               <br />
               visited here some few years ago said, “If I talk to 
               <br />
               five Newfoundlanders I get five different 
               <br />
               opinions. How can I tell the British Parliament 
               <br />
               what Newfoundlanders want? They do not know 
               <br />
               themselves.” The British Parliament knows the 
               <br />
               state of affairs out here, and regardless of what 
               <br />
               people might thing, I am of the opinion they are 
               <br />
               doing the right thing not to give us back respon- 
               <br />
               sible government. They will let us decide for 
               <br />
               ourselves at the referendum, and then if the 
               <br />
               majority should wantresponsible government we 
               <br />
               will get it. I have yet to be convinced that England 
               <br />
               will force us into any form of government, al- 
               <br />
               though we have given her plenty of provocation 
               <br />
               to do so. Throwing ourselves on her mercy in the 
               <br />
               1930s after admitting we could not govern our- 
               <br />
               selves, she had every right then to attach us to 
               <br />
               Canada or any other country, on any terms. In- 
               <br />
               stead, she tried to build up our economy and to 
               <br />
               give us another chance.

               After throwing in the sponge and admitting we 
               <br />
               could not govern ourselves, England set up a 
               <br />
               government by commission, a dictatorial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern»</span>

               ment. But after the ﬁasco we made of our affairs 
               <br />
               we needed a bit of dictatorship, and it has been 
               <br />
               good for us in many ways. It’s not the ideal thing 
               <br />
               for Newfoundland, and it was never intended to 
               <br />
               last any longer than necessary. They have made 
               <br />
               mistakes, and will continue to make them as long 
               <br />

               <br />
               be excused, as all governments make mistakes. 
               <br />
               The main thing is to see they are not repeated. But 
               <br />
               they have done a great deal of good, which fact 
               <br />
               cannot be denied by the ardent supporters of any

               The ﬁrst seven years of their rule were the 
               <br />
               seven lean years —— there was no com in Egypt, 
               <br />
               and very little in any other country. What could 
               <br />
               any government do during these years to better 
               <br />
               the living conditions of the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               people? Many schemes were tried, many millions 
               <br />
               of dollars from the pockets of the British taxpayer 
               <br />
               were spewed out to keep our people alive. Many 
               <br />
               of the schemes failed, as was to be expected, but 
               <br />
               some were good and are functioning today. Then, 
               <br />
               after the seven lean years, came the seven fat 
               <br />
               years, brought about by a war which devastated 
               <br />
               untold millions of lives and property in other 
               <br />
               parts of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">world.</span> Their loss was our gain: money 
               <br />
               poured so fast that the government could not 
               <br />
               spend it. We created a surplus; we became to all 
               <br />
               intents and purposes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selfesupporting.</span> But just as 
               <br />
               the people needed not seven years of plenty, but 
               <br />
               twice that time to get back on their feet from the
