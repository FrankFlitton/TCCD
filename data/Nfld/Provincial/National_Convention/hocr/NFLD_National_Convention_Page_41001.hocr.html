               tax in Canada The point I want to make is this; 
               <br />
               if you take the amount of income tax which will 
               <br />
               be collected under confederation, the amount of

               <br />
               ment, it will be much more than $3.2 million. 
               <br />
               That is why I think the suggestion made by Major

               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. Job I was going to say, Major Cashin has 
               <br />
               pointed out some deﬁnite, concrete things; par- 
               <br />
               ticularly that liquor tax which is down here as 
               <br />
               $400,000; Major Cashin has shown very clearly 
               <br />
               that that should be $1.6 million. That, in itself, is 
               <br />
               an item that shakes your faith, absolutely shakes 
               <br />
               your faith, in this thing. Another thing is, if the 
               <br />
               federal government have made mistakes in this, 
               <br />
               their offer is all wrong, as it is upon this federal 
               <br />
               revenue that they based their offer. It is very 
               <br />
               important then to get this into the hands of experts
