               viewpoint, they will be joined by a few here in

               mistaken, to keep the discussion on political and

               three months that will be the matter with which 
               <br />
               the Convention will be fully occupied, and before

               a matter with which Major Cashin has dealt at 
               <br />
               least briefly here this afternoon. Major Cashin 
               <br />
               has said that he condemns the motives that in— 
               <br />
               spired the creation of this Convention I want to 
               <br />
               say, Mr. Chairman, that in my view the whole 
               <br />
               idea, the whole conception of the recent National 
               <br />
               Convention election, of this Convention, of the 
               <br />
               national referendum to follow, constitute in the

               aggregate the most thorough democratic proce—

               dure in the entire political history of New- 
               <br />
               foundland. I see in it nothing sinister. I see in it 
               <br />
               no attempt whatever to railroad this people or this 
               <br />
               Convention. I see nothing suspicious in his 
               <br />
               presence and appointment of Professor Wheare, 
               <br />
               though I heard it suggested on the air, that he, or 
               <br />
               the person appointed in his place, was to be a

               the delegates elected would be merely puppets in 
               <br />
               his hand. I see no evidence of it, and I do not 
               <br />
               believe for a moment that was the intention. Let 
               <br />
               us look at it for a moment. There are five <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">docu«</span> 
               <br />
               ments relative to the whole political situation —- 
               <br />
               the Amulree Report, the British government 
               <br />
               white paper, the joint address of the legislature of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, the act of Parliament, and the 
               <br />
               letters patent. If I am not mistaken, there is a 
               <br />
               phrase in identical language in all ﬁve documents 
               <br />
               to the effect that responsible government would 
               <br />
               be restored to Newfoundland when New- 
               <br />
               foundland became self-supporting again, and 
               <br />
               upon request of the people. It is therefore very 
               <br />
               clear that a contract was indeed set up between 
               <br />
               the Parliament of Britain and the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland, and the contract laid it' down that
