               <br />
               this debt. Let me point out at this juncture that 
               <br />
               this debt is held in sterling funds and that the only 
               <br />
               beneﬁt accruing to Great Britain with respect to 
               <br />
               dollars in this connection, is that the interest is 
               <br />
               paid to Britain in dollars, and it is for this reason 
               <br />
               that the United Kingdom government does not 
               <br />
               see its way clear to conceal the debt. They also 
               <br />
               told us that the matter of its conversion to a lower 
               <br />
               rate of interest has been under consideration by 
               <br />
               the Commission government for some time. Such 
               <br />
               a statement, in my opinion, is far from the truth, 
               <br />
               and I have no hesitation in saying that neither the 
               <br />

               through the efforts of this Convention. .Again l 
               <br />
               repeat what I have so frequently stated before, 
               <br />
               that all the efforts of the Commission government 
               <br />
               have been devoted to increasing the expenditures

               tion by the Commission can only result in the 
               <br />
               ultimate spending of all our treasury balances. No 
               <br />
               effort whatever has been made to curtail unneces-

               The Dorninions Office informed us that upon 
               <br />
               the conversion of our 3% sterling debt to 2.5%, 
               <br />
               the sinking fund now lying to our credit in the 
               <br />
               Bank of England would be deducted from this 
               <br />
               particular debt. This sinking fund amounts to 
               <br />
               around $7.5 million at the present time, and as 
               <br />
               there will be another payment made to this fund 
               <br />
               on July 1 next, the total amount will then be 
               <br />
               approximately $8.25 million. It has been stated 
               <br />
               definitely in the Financial Report1 presented to 
               <br />
               this Convention, that these annual sinking fund 
               <br />
               payments should have been deducted from the 
               <br />
               principal of our debt each year, as the monies 
               <br />
               were used for the purchase of our outstanding 3% 
               <br />
               stock. I say now, that by the manipulation of this 
               <br />
               sinking fund, Newfoundland has lost in the 
               <br />
               vicinity of half a million dollars, and that the 
               <br />
               decision of the United Kingdom government to 
               <br />
               use this sinking fund for the reduction of this 
               <br />
               sterling indebtedness is no concession on their 
               <br />
               part, but really an obligation which they should

               have carried out yearly since 1937-38. Neverthe-

               It will be seen from the memorandum we sent

               the United Kingdom government, and their 
               <br />
               memorandum to us, that the matter of the disposi-

               <br />
               cussed. It will be observed that the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom government informed us that on the 
               <br />
               advice of the Commission government, it would 
               <br />
               not be prudent to use the balance of these loans 
               <br />
               for the reduction of our sterling indebtedness, as 
               <br />
               such monies may be required for development

               purposes. Neither would the United Kingdom 
               <br />
               government undertake to pay the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               treasury any interest whatever on these loans, 
               <br />
               although the treasury of Newfoundland today is 
               <br />
               paying 3% per annum on these very loans.

               Our delegation took the position that these 
               <br />
               loans should be used for the purpose of reducing 
               <br />
               our sterling debt, and we pointed out to the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom government that we could not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under</span> 
               <br />
               stand the attitude of the Commission in this mat- 
               <br />
               ter. The Secretary of State had consistently 
               <br />
               pointed out to us that, owing to the shortage of 
               <br />
               dollars in Great Britain, they were not in a posi~ 
               <br />
               tion to devote this money to the reduction of our 
               <br />
               debt; whilst on the other hand the Commission 
               <br />
               government had intimated that they might need 
               <br />
               the money for future development purposes. it 
               <br />
               can be seen how inconsistent the Commission 
               <br />
               government and the Secretary of State were, be- 
               <br />
               cause to be of any use for development purposes 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland, this money would have to be 
               <br />
               converted back to dollars, whilst under the 
               <br />
               present circumstances it would not be necessary 
               <br />
               to ﬁnd dollars for the purpose of reducing our 
               <br />
               debt, as this debt is principally held in the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom and our loans are now in sterling cur- 
               <br />
               rency. The Dominions Secretary advised us that 
               <br />
               it would be a matter of policy for the future 
               <br />
               government of Newfoundland as to the disposi— 
               <br />
               tion of this money, and this was concurred in by 
               <br />
               both Mr. Bradley and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Keough. Five of us 
               <br />
               delegates took the position that it would be good 
               <br />
               business to use this money to reduce our debt, as 
               <br />
               it would mean a further reduction in interest and
