               Mr. Smallwood, I have to advise you that we

               cannot interfere with matters of government

               Mr. Bradley If part of ourduty is to examine the 
               <br />
               position of the country, it seems to follow that we 
               <br />
               have the right to know what assets this country 
               <br />
               has, and it follows upon that we have a right to 
               <br />
               know what is being done with the assets. Ido not 
               <br />
               know what the Commission is doing. I know 
               <br />
               what they have done and I shall have something 
               <br />
               to say about it before this Convention closes. But 
               <br />
               Ido not know what they are doing now. I want to 
               <br />
               know what assets are left, and whether any at- 
               <br />
               tempt is being made to dispose of them by what 
               <br />
               may be a dying government. The chairman of that

               particular committee should report to the Infor-

               mation Committee and if that committee cannot 
               <br />
               get satisfaction, it will be reported to the Conven-
