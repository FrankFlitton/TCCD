               eyed world we are Newfoundlanders; that we are 
               <br />
               equal to any people inside or outside the house. 
               <br />
               We are as good as any other people, no better, no 
               <br />
               worse. The world today is struggling to get a 
               <br />
               government which will be effective in stopping 
               <br />
               the excesses of nationalism which led to blood 
               <br />
               and tears, but that is no reason why the drive and 
               <br />
               morale caused by love of country should be lost 
               <br />
               sight of, and treated by many people as a thing to 
               <br />
               be scorned and looked upon almost with con- 
               <br />
               tempt. This error is, to my mind, one (and this is 
               <br />
               a hard thing for me to say) for which we have to 
               <br />
               thank, in large measure, the intellectuals of this 
               <br />
               country — this talk about the intellectual and 
               <br />
               historic processes driving this country into politi~ 
               <br />
               cal union with another country! We are told by 
               <br />
               many people that we have no right to expect to 
               <br />
               stand on our own feet because we are only a small 
               <br />
               group of 300,000 people, as if character and 
               <br />
               brains and resources were developed only by 
               <br />
               bigness in the world. The whole negative attitude 
               <br />
               that I have heard on many occasions, I now 
               <br />
               repudiate and deny. There should be a pride in the 
               <br />
               things done well in this country, and we have 
               <br />
               done them well. If we were not so prone to tell 
               <br />
               our young politicians that they have been used, 
               <br />
               when they stand to a question of principle; if we 
               <br />
               had not been so prone to tell our teachers that they 
               <br />
               cannot teach as well as people in other countries, 
               <br />
               that our education is not as good and as ﬁrmly 
               <br />
               rooted as the education system of other countries; 
               <br />
               if we had not been so prone to go outside and get 
               <br />
               experts, you would have a better country and 
               <br />
               more morale than you have today. The negative 
               <br />
               approach I repudiate and deny, as it is one of sure 
               <br />
               inertia, and also one of eventual death. There 
               <br />
               were some scornful remarks made when I hap- 
               <br />
               pened to raise the question of faith in speaking of 
               <br />
               the Economic Report. Faith should be an in— 
               <br />
               gredient. People may sneer, but faith is the most 
               <br />
               important thing you can have, whether in an 
               <br />
               organisation, a family, a country or any unit. You 
               <br />
               call it faith in one instance and morale in 
               <br />
               another....

               I want to give you another example. When we 
               <br />
               were discussing the problems of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               in England, I did a lot of study and had hoped I 
               <br />
               would have been able to show, in my own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">per.</span> 
               <br />
               sonal way, the aspirations of Newfoundlanders, 
               <br />

               if at all possible. I know many of my colleagues 
               <br />
               felt the same way. The dead hand of officialdom 
               <br />
               did not allow it. Once we got outside ofﬁcialdom 
               <br />
               in England, I found they could not understand 
               <br />
               why we in this country had such little faith in 
               <br />
               ourselves; why we were not taking a holder hand 
               <br />
               in our own affairs than we are taking. I found it 
               <br />
               in the printing presses we went to see. I talked to 
               <br />
               the printers. I found it outside, in places we went 
               <br />
               looking for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">information.</span> I found it from ex-ofﬁ- 
               <br />
               cials of the British government. I found it with 
               <br />
               the people with whom I lived. I came back to 
               <br />
               Newfoundland and the ﬁrst thing I had to face as 
               <br />
               a Newfoundlander was the dead hand of so many 
               <br />
               in this country: “Newfoundlanders cannot do 
               <br />
               this. We have no faith in ourselves. We are too 
               <br />
               small. We must tie up with some other country. 
               <br />
               We must become the tail—end of a kite before we 
               <br />
               can go anywhere on our own.” I feel deeply about 
               <br />
               this. I have felt for many years that the problem 
               <br />
               of this country is more morale than it is material, 
               <br />
               and I am not neglecting the importance of 
               <br />
               material things in this world. I am not thinking in 
               <br />
               terms merely of baby bonuses or unemployment 
               <br />
               insurance. I am thinking in terms of that drive 
               <br />
               which can make us work together as a unit to 
               <br />
               bring about a decent standard of living for every 
               <br />
               man, woman and child in this country. Call it 
               <br />
               vague talk; sneer, call it unreal, if you like —I 
               <br />
               have heard it said, “It is sheer idealism to talk that 
               <br />
               way.” As far as I am concerned, let him who 
               <br />
               wants to sneer, sneer. But I cannot leave either 
               <br />
               this subject or this Convention without giving 
               <br />
               expression to that one thing which I feel, and feel 
               <br />
               very deeply, is important to us when we face this 
               <br />
               issue either of confederation or return to respon— 
               <br />
               sible government, or any other form of govern— 
               <br />
               ment. If you were to turn up the World Report of 
               <br />
               December, 1947, you will ﬁnd there an expres- 
               <br />
               sion of what Canadians are saying on union with 
               <br />
               another country. It is one man‘s opinion, I will 
               <br />
               willingly admit; but in their present difﬁculties it 
               <br />
               is being suggested in many quarters that political 
               <br />
               union with the United States would be the easiest 
               <br />
               way out of the trade difﬁculties of Canada in her 
               <br />
               present situation. If you would care to look up the 
               <br />
               World Report you will know what I mean. You 
               <br />
               will know also that opposition to this kind of 
               <br />
               union has been and is widespread in Canada. The 
               <br />
               answer to it is the Canadian citizenship law. A 
               <br />
               quotation from that report shows they are afraid 
               <br />
