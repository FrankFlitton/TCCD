               outﬁtting for that fall trip, which is much more 
               <br />
               than for a trip in the summer or spring, and that 
               <br />
               cost was largely brought about by the money 
               <br />
               which ﬁshermen were charged up with on ac— 
               <br />
               count of bait. I think it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">important</span> for us to know 
               <br />
               just how the supply of bait now would apply to 
               <br />
               the possibility of ﬁshermen prosecuting the bank 
               <br />
               ﬁshery in the late fall, and whether or not we 
               <br />
               might not come to the conclusion that the ﬁsher- 
               <br />
               men are perfectly right. It is senseless for a man 
               <br />
               to go out on the last trip in the fall if they ﬁnd 
               <br />
               when they come in with a loaded ship that they 
               <br />
               still have nothing coming to them towards their 
               <br />
               income for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">winter...</span> I would suggest that it 
               <br />
               would be wise if we knew just what it would cost 
               <br />
               a banker, or the individual member of a crew, to 
               <br />
               get sufﬁcient bait to enable him to proceed on the 
               <br />
               fall trip. 
               <br />
               Mr. Job That’s an interesting point. I really 
               <br />
               don’t know, but we could take it up. I should have 
               <br />
               thought that there would be no question at all that 
               <br />
               they would make a good deal of money on it, but 
               <br />
               I can’t say deﬁnitely. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett I am referring to the salt ﬁshery 
               <br />
               more than to the fresh. 
               <br />
               Mr. Job I was thinking of the fresh ﬁsh. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> MacDonald <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mrt</span> Chairman, might I ask the 
               <br />
               committee if they can tell us by whom these ships 
               <br />
               are owned or who operates them? Another heavy 
               <br />
               investment is the draggers. Is that investment by 
               <br />
               private enterprise or is the government going to 
               <br />
               bill us for new draggers? 
               <br />
               Mr. 15tu <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr</span> Chairman, there is a small item 
               <br />
               here regarding the smelt ﬁshery. l have no doubt 
               <br />
               there will be more said about that, but I wonder 
               <br />
               if there is any idea of continuing this industry to 
               <br />
               any extent, of if it means anything to New— 
               <br />
               foundland. I know there is a lot of smelt on the 
               <br />
               Labrador, and I was wondering if there was any 
               <br />
               possibility of the fresh freezing process being 
               <br />
               continued, as I think we might have some frozen 
               <br />
               and sent to the markets. I know the committee 
               <br />
               will be dealing with this further and they might 
               <br />
               go into that. 
               <br />
               Mr. Job I think it is gradually increasing. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Any further comment on that 
               <br />
               section, gentlemen? Are you ready for the ques— 
               <br />
               tions? Moved that section 1 be adopted.

               Mr. Northcott I wonder if the committee could 
               <br />
               tell this Convention just what is Newfoundland’s 
               <br />
               quota on ﬁllets, etc., under the preferential rate 
               <br />
               of l~7l8 cents. 
               <br />
               Mr. Job We are really operating under a joint 
               <br />
               quota and it is to this country’s advantage to get 
               <br />
               as many pounds as possible in under this quota at 
               <br />
               the earliest possible date. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Northcott Any duty on fresh salmon and 
               <br />
               lobster? 
               <br />
               Mr. Job I cannot touch that question. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Is there a race to get in that 18 
               <br />
               million pound quota? 
               <br />
               Mr. Job We produce as much as we can and get 
               <br />
               it in as soon as we can. There is no actual race. 
               <br />
               We want to get a quota of our own, and a special 
               <br />
               one, if we can. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood With the total quota for New— 
               <br />
               foundland and Canada being 18 million pounds, 
               <br />
               is the situation now that the one who gets there 
               <br />
               ﬁrst gets the larger share of the total quota? Might 
               <br />
               it not be a little dangerous to get a quota of our 
               <br />
               own? Our share ‘of the 18 million pounds was 5 
               <br />
               million, and unless the quota was increased might 
               <br />
               it not be dangerous? Last year we got 5 of the 18 
               <br />
               millions; we succeeded to that extent but if a 
               <br />
               deﬁnite quota is obtained is not the position that 
               <br />
               it might be less than the amount we got last year? 
               <br />
               I have in mind the pitifully small volume of 
               <br />
               ﬁshery exports of Newfoundland as compared 
               <br />
               with those of Canada. I am not in the trade and 
               <br />
               many of the members of the Fishery Committee 
               <br />
               are and undoubtedly they know of what is in the 
               <br />
               minds of the Fisheries Board and in Mr. Gushue’s 
               <br />
               mind, but to me it does seem that there is a certain 
               <br />
               amount of danger. 
               <br />
               Mr. Ballam I think there is a very great danger 
               <br />
               if we do not have a quota, in view of the fact that 
               <br />
               today you have a joint quota and this new plant 
               <br />
               is starting in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Louisbourg....</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Job That is why I referred to the necessity 
               <br />
               of making some special arrangements direct with 
               <br />
               the United States on this matter. Unless we do get 
               <br />
               some special arrangements we may not get <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> 
               <br />
               thing. We want to get a good quota but it will 
               <br />
               depend on ourselves. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett There is one paragraph to which I 
               <br />
               would like to refer. On page 4: “The codﬁsh sold
