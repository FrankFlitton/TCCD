               The common stockholders in that company have

               made a deal whereby they paid 10 cents royalty

               up to one million tons and 3 cents up to 1.5 
               <br />

               <br />
               $136,000 in settlement of back taxes. They paid

               produce at least 1.5 million tons a year in order 
               <br />

               war started the Germans were buying one million 
               <br />

               <br />
               from 6-700,000 tons, and if she continues to use 
               <br />
               that amount and Great Britain takes 750,000 tons

               <br />
               the union on Bell Island. I hope Great Britain

               continues to take ore from us instead of going 
               <br />
               back to Sweden. If she can take 750,000 tons of

               <br />
               will suit the furnaces, it would be a great thing. 
               <br />
               One of their greatest excuses was that the docks

               could not take the big ships for ore, but suddenly 
               <br />
               all this changes, therefore they were kidding us
