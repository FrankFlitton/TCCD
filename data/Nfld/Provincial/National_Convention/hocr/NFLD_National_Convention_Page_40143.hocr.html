               we should send a delegation now or in two weeks 
               <br />
               or in two months <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">time.”</span> I feel that too much time 
               <br />
               has been wasted on something that should have 
               <br />
               been ﬁnished many days ago. A gentleman told 
               <br />
               me this afternoon that he was going to move an 
               <br />
               amendment to the amendment. I hope he will 
               <br />
               soon get started and have 45 speeches made on it 
               <br />
               before it is too late. Personally I think this whole 
               <br />
               thing should be shelved until January next, and 
               <br />
               for that reason I support Mr. Bradley’s amend— 
               <br />
               ment... I am not a confederate and not supporting 
               <br />
               any particular form of government; but in the 
               <br />
               interests of the whole country I would like to see 
               <br />
               something deﬁnite done on this question once 
               <br />
               and for all.

               Mr. Reddy I would like to speak brieﬂy on the 
               <br />
               motion introduced by Mr. Smallwood. I am 
               <br />
               favourably impressed with the views of previous 
               <br />
               speakers. The people of my district are friendly 
               <br />
               disposed to confederation, and I would like to see 
               <br />
               all information available brought before this 
               <br />
               house for consideration with regard to this ques- 
               <br />
               tion. Remember that upon this the destiny of our 
               <br />
               country may depend, and the weal or woe of 
               <br />
               300,000 people may rest. Now the people who 
               <br />
               sent us delegates here are watching us closely. I 
               <br />
               may say that the final reports of two committees 
               <br />
               have been laid aside because of the time spent on 
               <br />
               these resolutions. Even at that it is not lost time, 
               <br />
               because it is vitally necessary to have this ques- 
               <br />
               tion explored to the fullest extent and have all 
               <br />
               information ready at the proper time. If this Con~ 
               <br />
               vention takes a year to complete its work, what 
               <br />
               is a year to the life of a country and its people? I 
               <br />
               was born in this country, lived in this country and 
               <br />
               I hope to die in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country...</span> Therefore, with a 
               <br />
               sincere heart, I will support the amendment. 
               <br />
               Mr. Crosbie Mr. Chairman, when this resolu- 
               <br />
               tion was introduced I was away, unfortunately. 
               <br />
               However, I heard most of the speeches over the 
               <br />
               radio and I would like to congratulate some 
               <br />
               people on the job they did not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do.</span> I do not think 
               <br />
               the time opportune to discuss confederation 
               <br />
               terms because we have not the facts and figures 
               <br />
               yet concerning our own country. At the moment 
               <br />
               the idea of preparing to send a delegation to 
               <br />
               Ottawa to discuss terms is ridiculous. For 
               <br />
               argument’s sake, I happen to own a business and 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood happens to own a business and 
               <br />
               we are thinking of amalgamating. Then he asks

               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, before coming

               to the main part of my remarks I would like to say 
               <br />
               how deeply grateful I am for the very many words 
               <br />
               of encouragement I have received since I moved 
               <br />
               this resolution on Monday last. By word of 
               <br />
               mouth, by telephone and by telegraph from many 
               <br />
               parts of the country these encouraging messages 
               <br />
               have come, enough to show me, if I had not 
               <br />
               known before, that this country wants the resolu- 
               <br />

               <br />
               Harrington. I am deeply sorry to find that we are 
               <br />
               on opposite sides. I did hope it would be other- 
               <br />
               wise. As he said himself, I was expecting his 
               <br />
               support of this motion, for months ago he 
               <br />
               declared to me his intention to do so. From the 
               <br />
               moment I first met him — that was when he 
               <br />
               worked with me on the Book of Newfoundland1 
               <br />
