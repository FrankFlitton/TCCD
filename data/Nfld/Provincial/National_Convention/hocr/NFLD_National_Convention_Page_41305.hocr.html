               to decide our future destiny as a free people." I 
               <br />
               do not need to point to Newfoundland’s loyalty. 
               <br />
               This has been amply demonstrated on numerous 
               <br />
               occasions and will be again if Great Britain does 
               <br />
               now, in what I consider her very last chance, give 
               <br />
               the freedom, rights and honour to Newfoundland 
               <br />
               for which we have paid for many times in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">blood.</span> 
               <br />
               I could not honestly call it a privilege or a favour, 
               <br />
               it is a just and honourable debt for which we, with 
               <br />
               her, side by side, gave the lives of the bravest and 
               <br />
               best of Newfoundland’s manhood and woman- 
               <br />
               hood. That debt can only be repaid by speedily 
               <br />
               undoing a wrong, by immediately granting what 
               <br />
               costs her nothing, not even her pride, self-govern- 
               <br />
               ment without delay to the people of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New«</span> 
               <br />
               foundland. I have stated that in my opinion this 
               <br />
               will be Britain’s last chance to do the right and 
               <br />
               proper thing If she fails in this crucial hour, she 
               <br />
               will do what the vast majority of the English- 
               <br />
               speaking world in the west is expecting, drive 
               <br />
               Newfoundland into the arms of the United States 
               <br />
               of America. There is a parable that says, 
               <br />
               “Children obey your parents." Again, “Parents 
               <br />
               provoke not your children to anger lest they rise 
               <br />
               up against you.” It is a common expression these 
               <br />
               days, that if Britain does not very soon wake up 
               <br />
               to her responsibility toward her oldest colony, 
               <br />
               Newfoundland must appeal to that great 
               <br />
               democratic republic to the west to save us from 
               <br />
               our friends. We are conscious of Britain’s plight 
               <br />
               ﬁnancially, but she is yet a great nation and what 
               <br />
               will make her greater still is to command the 
               <br />
               highest respect of all her people and especially 
               <br />
               her vast colonial empire. Many great sons have 
               <br />
               left unbearable home conditions only to become 
               <br />
               greater in the larger expanse of opportunity when 
               <br />
               the shackles of intolerable home life were 
               <br />
               released. Many depressed colonies of people 
               <br />
               have matured to great nations when the shackles 
               <br />
               of remote control were, at very often great 
               <br />
               sacriﬁce, lifted from their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">domain,</span> Surely it must 
               <br />
               be admitted that if Newfoundland is forced to 
               <br />
               seek a more democratic institution, she will only 
               <br />
               do it in desperation, after the mother country has 
               <br />
               ignored all the principles of the rights of man.

               <br />

               <br />
               thousands of the lives of our people. If it becomes 
               <br />
               necessary the supreme sacriﬁce will be made. 
               <br />
               Our people are true British stock, and history has 
               <br />
               proved many times that serious repercussions and

               most unsavoury situations might have been 
               <br />
               avoided if the heads of state had not been too 
               <br />
               stubborn to believe the inevitable could happen, 
               <br />
               and their refusal to recognise the rights of others. 
               <br />
               Someone must take the risk of stating these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">un«</span>

               her obligations toward Newfoundland before it is 
               <br />
               too late. Hatred and revenge in the hearts of our 
               <br />
               people will be a far greater enemy than an equal

               <br />
               at this time appeal to their sense of justice, to 
               <br />
               establish if necessary, a precedent in British 
               <br />

               <br />
               least are most grateful. We have delved deeply
