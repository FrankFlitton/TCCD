               to the fact that I have been charged publicly with 
               <br />
               having challenged Mr. Fudge to go outside and 
               <br />

               <br />
               and pointed to the door. Now that was not broad- 
               <br />
               cast, what was heard was me saying, “What, go 
               <br />

               <br />
               motion, and a few people in this House saw it, 
               <br />

               Mr. Chairman Before you take your seat, Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood, I feel compelled to rule that you used 
               <br />
               unbecoming and offensive language towards the 
               <br />
               member for St. John’s East, and whatever doubt 
               <br />
               I may otherwise have had upon my ﬁnding, it was 
               <br />
               resolved by your statement that you had nothing 
               <br />
               on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Higgins beyond the fact that you have 
               <br />
               been irritated by the manner in which he has 
               <br />
               debated certain measures before the Chair with 
               <br />
               you at various times. With the source of your 
               <br />
               irritation I am not concerned; I am seriously 
               <br />
               concerned, however, over the fact that members 
               <br />
               of this Convention and members of the public 
               <br />
               should labour, or be left under the dangerous 
               <br />
               misapprehension by words employed by you, and 
               <br />
               perhaps at a time when you did not intend to 
               <br />
               convey any such misapprehension, that you had 
               <br />
               something on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Higgins. According to you, 
               <br />
               beyond being irritated in the course of debate, 
               <br />
               you had nothing on Mr. Higgins, and there is 
               <br />
               nothing factual to justify yourleaving the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">impres«</span> 
               <br />
               sion with anybody that you had something on 
               <br />
               him, in other words that his integrity and his 
               <br />
               honesty was in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question.</span> Now, no man can afford 
               <br />
               to disregard what each needs for his own protec- 
               <br />
               tion, and it is my duty to preserve you, Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood, or any other member, from loose 
               <br />
               charges of dishonesty, and that is exactly what I 
               <br />
               propose to do as long as I am in this Chair for the 
               <br />
               obvious reason that all members stand equal 
               <br />
               before the Chair. In the circumstances therefore, 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood, I think you will agree that the 
               <br />
               fair and proper thing to do is to apologise to Mr, 
               <br />

               Mr. Fudge I rise to a point of privilege. Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood tried to kill two birds at one shot. He 
               <br />
               says I offered him a challenge yesterday after- 
               <br />
               noon. That is not correct. When he did get a wee 
               <br />
               bit excited, I suppose I did make motions with my 
               <br />
               hand to the gallery and to the people there. That 
               <br />
               was all that was in my mind. Eventually he said, 
               <br />
               “I am not afraid of you”, and he offered to chal- 
               <br />
               lenge me outside. Mr. Chairman, I am sorry for 
               <br />
               that, because I am not a rowdy. I can get along 
               <br />
               with people. But I am not prepared to accept a 
               <br />
               challenge from Mr. Smallwood and lie down on 
               <br />
               it. That is not my type. I do not permit Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood or anyone else to put anything over 
               <br />
               the air that would blacken my character. There- 
               <br />
               fore, if Mr. Smallwood thought, by the motion of 
               <br />
               my hand, it was a challenge to him to fight, he 
               <br />
               must have something. There was no such thing in 
               <br />
               my mind. When he offered the challenge, yes, I 
               <br />
               gladly accepted. That is all for now. That chal-
