               I feel that the proceedings of this Convention 
               <br />
               and the extramural activities of some of its mem- 
               <br />
               bers must be very disappointing to the people 
               <br />
               who sent us here. The talk of political intrigue 
               <br />
               that is going on, of ganging up in groups, the 
               <br />
               determination beforehand of attitudes that should 
               <br />
               be resolved in debate, the closed minds to every- 
               <br />
               thing that one does not approve, are a very 
               <br />
               definite setback to the birth of democracy in this 
               <br />
               land. ButI suppose it will be heartening for the 
               <br />
               whole country to learn from the remarks of two 
               <br />
               of the most outspoken, if not the most unbiased 
               <br />
               members that the people are our masters. I had 
               <br />
               begun to wonder if we were forgetting that. it is 
               <br />
               very encouraging to note that we are not going to 
               <br />
               tell the people of Newfoundland what they must 
               <br />
               do. Let us hOpe that spirit continues.

               Meanwhile we are here. And if the people are 
               <br />
               our masters, what is it they want us to do? They 
               <br />
               want us, surely, to secure the facts, the informa- 
               <br />
               tion on which they can base their decision. They 
               <br />
               did not send us here to devise methods for limit- 
               <br />
               ing their choice in that decision, or to inaugurate 
               <br />
               political careers for ourselves. Above all, they 
               <br />
               expect us to behave as rational, sensible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">men.</span> 
               <br />
               They expect us to have the mentality of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">jury.</span>

               They expect us to be fair—minded, not supermen.

               As reports come in here they do not expect them

               to be coloured by the political views of the

               authors <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">w</span> or maybe by this time they do. If we

               <br />

               form of government we, as individuals, believe 
               <br />
               in? We each have one vote in the referendum and 
               <br />
               no more.

               This Convention is unique not because it is a

               the opportunity to sit down coolly and soberly 
               <br />

               <br />
               findings the whole people will decide the form 
               <br />

               Meanwhile, our mandate from the people is

               clear and unmistakable. At least, mine is, A year 
               <br />
               ago the people whom I represent were holding 
               <br />
               meetings and discussing their future government.

               <br />
               things about it too. I think i can claim that they

               the Avalon Peninsula, from whose glittering 
               <br />
               highways I ﬁrst took my bearings. Some thought 
               <br />
               a revised form of the present system might be 
               <br />
               workable and desirable, at least for some time. 
               <br />
               There were a great many who thought that, and 
               <br />
               no doubt they still do. Others wondered if union 
               <br />
               with Canada might not be more practicable, par~ 
               <br />
               ticularly from an economic standpoint. Perhaps 
               <br />
               therein lay economic freedom. They wanted to 
               <br />
               know. I don't know how they feel about it now, 
               <br />
               but i imagine they must be pleased to learn from 
               <br />
               the member from Grand Falls that he thinks they 
               <br />
               still have a chance to qualify as loyal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfound~</span> 
               <br />
               landers. Most of them, frankly, found it difﬁcult 
               <br />
               to make up their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">minds.</span> They know what they 
               <br />
               don’t want — ever again. They weren’t so sure 
               <br />
               of what they did want. So I’m here to get certain 
               <br />
               information for them. And that is why I support 
               <br />
               this motion. I cannot conscientiously do other-

               those who will suffer or enjoy the consequences 
               <br />
               make the decision. If we are ever confronted with 
               <br />
               the choice of freedom or poverty ~— and with 
               <br />
               poverty there is no freedom —- and we choose to 
               <br />
               be poor but proud, let that decision be made by 
               <br />
               those to whom poverty is something more than a

               polite expression, and who have often in the past 
               <br />
               had to swallow their pride and accept a handout 
               <br />
               in one form or another. Whatever the choices are, 
               <br />
               they must be put as clearly as possible. That is

               <br />
               then talk about confederation? The motion as
