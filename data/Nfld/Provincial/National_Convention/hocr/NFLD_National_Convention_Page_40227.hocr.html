               accommodation in Newfoundland to look after 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               breadth of vision are essential in this matter, and 
               <br />
               I can only hope the resignation of this Tourist

               Mr. Northcott I too agree with the various 
               <br />
               speakers in connection with the tourist trade. It is 
               <br />
               nothing short of a crime that the government has 
               <br />
               not assisted in every possible way the tourist 
               <br />
               trade in Newfoundland. The possibilities are 
               <br />
               beyond all comprehension, and should be pushed 
               <br />
               to the limit, especially when the government had 
               <br />
               the men at its disposal to do the job. The figures 
               <br />
               of $50 per person quoted in the Amulrec Report 
               <br />
               are very conservative... If we go over the tourist 
               <br />
               trade in the right way and make it worthwhile I 
               <br />
               am convinced that it would be the second or third 
               <br />
               largest industry in this country today. I fail to see 
               <br />
               why the government has not taken a greater <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in‘</span> 
               <br />
               terest in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all‘important</span> issue. If it were outside 
               <br />
               interests looking for concessions the chances are 
               <br />
               they would have been given, but unfortunately 
               <br />
               the people asking for these concessions happened 
               <br />
               to be Newfoundlanders, and that is why I think 
               <br />
               they were not granted.

               Mr. Hickman Mr. Chairman, I am wondering

               if Mr. Smallwood could tell us, in relation to 
               <br />
               these ﬁgures covering the number of tourists 
               <br />

               people who travelled here by the 8.8. Fort/im-

               Mr. Smallwood The ﬁgures given are strictly

               <br />
               on pleasure bound. It would include some round

               trippers. The round tripper in any country is 
               <br />
               regarded as the poorest result of the tourist trade.

               count of the money spent. The Tourist Board 
               <br />
               estimates the money that a handful of tourists 
               <br />
               spent this year, 1946. They counted the number 
               <br />
               of tourists that visited a few rivers this year, and 
               <br />
               got an exact count of what they spent, and it was 
               <br />
               I think $80,000 or $90,000, an average of $400- 
               <br />
               500 per tourist.

               There are cases well known to the Board of 
               <br />
               tourists coming and spending from $1,000 to 
               <br />
               $1,500 or $2,000. We have all known of cases 
               <br />
               where the wealthy tourists have actually adopted 
               <br />
               the families of their guide for instance, and send 
               <br />
               money down to these families each year. Many 
               <br />
               of them are extremely wealthy men, some in 
               <br />
               Canada and the States whose income runs up to 
               <br />
               from $100,000 to $1 million a year, and they 
               <br />
               don’t mind spending $4-5,000 a year. It is a 
               <br />
               country they don‘t know, unusual and different, 
               <br />
               and these round trippers are so insignificant in 
               <br />
               number that it’s hardly worthwhile mentioning

               them at all.

               Incidentally, here is a table just brought in, for 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst nine months of this year, 1946. In the first 
               <br />
               nine months of 1946, 700,000 US automobiles 
               <br />
               entered the Maritimes with tourists. Incidentally, 
               <br />
               the house will be interested to know that 2,000 
               <br />
               motor cars arrived at North Sydney for the pur- 
               <br />
               pose of coming over to Newfoundland, thinking 
               <br />
               there was a ferry service on the boat, as there is 
               <br />
               on PE Island. The federal government has a ferry 
               <br />
               which takes 60 motor cars aboard. They do not 
               <br />
               need to get out of their motor ears. 2,000 arrived 
               <br />
               in Sydney thinking they were going to get to 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, in addition to the 700,000 who 
               <br />
               entered the Maritimes. We have no conception of 
               <br />
               what a monumental trade this travel is. 
               <br />
               Americans have itchy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feetM-they</span> get in their cars

               to get a batch of them here where they will spend
