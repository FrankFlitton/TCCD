               The report is a well-worded document; long 
               <br />
               enough to digest and plain enough for the average 
               <br />
               man to understand. Mr. Hollett touched on an 
               <br />
               important matter just now, that there should be 
               <br />
               more small boats, 15-25 ton boats. I am in accord 
               <br />
               with that. I am disappointed as a member of the 
               <br />
               Public Health and Welfare Committee over the 
               <br />
               little consideration given through the civil re-es- 
               <br />
               tablishment department to the ﬁshermen. We all 
               <br />
               know that the ﬁshermen received amounts vary- 
               <br />
               ing from $100 to the top man getting $700. In 
               <br />
               View of the fact that the present government is 
               <br />
               handing out in the vicinity of over $8 million to 
               <br />
               rehabilitate the men from World War II, under 
               <br />
               various headings such as back pay, gratuities, 
               <br />
               land settlement, university courses and various 
               <br />
               other brackets, in a country where the fishery is 
               <br />
               still the leading industry, it has received by far the 
               <br />
               lesser amount. I cannot ﬁnd words strong enough 
               <br />
               to condemn those responsible for creating such a 
               <br />
               scheme. I am not satisﬁed that this country has 
               <br />
               spent or is spending sufﬁcient to modernise the 
               <br />
               ﬁsheries. We know there is plenty of room for 
               <br />
               more cold <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">storages.</span> I would like to know from 
               <br />
               Mr. Job whether these 15 quick-freezing plants 
               <br />
               are owned by private companies or if the govem-

               Mr. Job As far as I know, it is entirely private

               interest as shareholders. They did make certain 
               <br />
               advances at one time, comparatively small 
               <br />
               amounts. In that connection, Mr. RH. Dunn in- 
               <br />
               troduced the act whereby loans could be made, 
               <br />
               but very little advantage was taken of it. The 
               <br />
               loans were not wanted. I think that is one of the 
               <br />
               sad features about it -—— that $4 million was voted 
               <br />
               for that purpose and none was used. It was ear- 
               <br />
               marked for loans and people did not want loans. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood They would rather sell the 
               <br />
               shares? 
               <br />
               Mr. Job They did sell shares and they put in 
               <br />
               their own money. The end of it was that the loans 
               <br />
               were not required. At least part of the trade 
               <br />
               thought it should be earmarked for certain things 
               <br />
               like the development of cold storage. It was simp- 
               <br />
               ly cancelled. It was reduced to something like 
               <br />
               $500,000 and I think it is still available. The 
               <br />
               trouble is, under the act, the government takes no 
               <br />
               risk. The government simply says, “We will vote 
               <br />
               $4 million, anyone who wants a loan may get it 
               <br />
               under certain terms -— safe terms to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern,</span> 
               <br />
               ment." The government should take part of the 
               <br />
               risk. I think there is a great deal to be said for the 
               <br />
               reason they give, they want to safeguard the 
               <br />
               public funds and not make loans without proper 
               <br />
               security, but it does not help the trade. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood How would bank credit and 
               <br />
               government credit compare as to the easiness of 
               <br />
               getting loans and time of repayment? 
               <br />
               Mr. Job About the same, I think. We could not 
               <br />
               see any advantage. The interest was perhaps a 
               <br />
               little lower in the case of the government. There 
               <br />
               was no term given. They were extremely par~ 
               <br />
               ticular about the matter of titles. There was so 
               <br />
               much exactitude that the people would not be 
               <br />
               bothered; they would rather go to the bank and 
               <br />
               get a loan; iftheircredit was good, they could get

               Mr. Vardy It does not make good reading when
