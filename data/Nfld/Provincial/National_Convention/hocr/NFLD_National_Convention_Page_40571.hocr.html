               to GreatBritain was for the purpose of discussing 
               <br />
               matters of future interest to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> The 
               <br />
               object was to try and get the British government 
               <br />
               to see and think reasonably, as we thought we 
               <br />
               were thinking, and as the majority of us still 
               <br />
               think. Our primary object was to discuss the 
               <br />
               reduction of our public debt by way of refunding, 
               <br />
               by the use of our sinking fund, and by the applica~

               <br />
               Britain; to discuss future trade relations with the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom government; to discuss the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fu‘</span> 
               <br />
               ture operation of Gander airport, and to seek the 
               <br />
               reason why Newfoundland has been burdened 
               <br />
               with any deﬁcit on its operation; to see if we 
               <br />
               could in some way or other impress upon the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom government the importance to 
               <br />
               the future economy of our country of Britain 
               <br />
               purchasing a substantial quantity of our fresh and 
               <br />
               frozen ﬁsh, as well as the product of our iron 
               <br />
               mines on Bell Island. These are the matters, 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, which I contend we went to the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom for, and whilst there appears on 
               <br />
               our agenda a heading “Development Loans", you 
               <br />
               will all remember that we deﬁnitely told the 
               <br />
               Secretary of State that Newfoundland required 
               <br />
               no loans for development purposes from the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom government at the moment, and 
               <br />
               this matter was dropped from our discussions. 
               <br />
               Again, let me repeat for the beneﬁt of the country 
               <br />
               as a whole, that our delegation did not go to 
               <br />
               London to seek any material assistance from 
               <br />
               Great Britain. We need no such assistance. If I 
               <br />
               may be permitted to say, Mr. Chairman, Great 
               <br />
               Britain is not in a position to give us any ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               assistance at the present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">time.</span> The fact of the 
               <br />
               matter is, Newfoundland has been and is still 
               <br />
               helping the United Kingdom government in a 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial way, and at the expense of the New— 
               <br />
               foundland treasury.

               At this ﬁrst meeting, which might be called a 
               <br />
               preliminary or informal meeting to discuss 
               <br />
               generalities, Viscount Addison took each ques- 
               <br />
               tion as outlined in our explanatory memorandum 
               <br />
               in sequence. And even though it is quite obvious 
               <br />
               that the intelligent discussion of these questions 
               <br />
               could only be discussed one with the other, the 
               <br />
               Secretary of State insisted that each question 
               <br />
               should be discussed separately. The firstquestion 
               <br />
               related to the public debt, and Viscount Addison, 
               <br />
               in effect, asked us what about it anyhow? In 
               <br />
               reply, we tried to convey that the public debt was 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               one which certainly called for reduction as well 
               <br />
               as refunding. We tried to point out that our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inter:</span> 
               <br />
               est—free loans to the United Kingdom should be 
               <br />
               used for the purpose of reducing our sterling debt. 
               <br />
               In our opinion, Mr. Glenvil Hall, the Financial 
               <br />
               Secretary of the Treasury, was certainly 
               <br />
               favourably disposed to such a proposition, but the 
               <br />
               Dominions Secretary was not so enthusiastic in 
               <br />
               this respect. The latter then suggested that the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom government might convert our 
               <br />
               sterling debt, which amounted to approximately 
               <br />
               $75 million and bore interest at the rate of 3% 
               <br />
               annually, to 2.5%, and that such conversion 
               <br />
               would take place on January 1, 1948, after giving 
               <br />
               the necessary three <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">months”</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">notice.</span> He also indi- 
               <br />
               cated at this meeting that the United Kingdom 
               <br />
               government would be prepared to reduce this 
               <br />
               particular sterling debt by the application of the 
               <br />
               sinking fund, which is held in the Bank of 
               <br />
               England and amounts at the present time to some 
               <br />
               $75 million.

               With regard to the base deals, we were simply

               It was pointed out to us, however, that if

               to further discuss the whole matter with the

               United States. We were unable to extract definite 
               <br />
               information as to whether or not the United States 
               <br />
