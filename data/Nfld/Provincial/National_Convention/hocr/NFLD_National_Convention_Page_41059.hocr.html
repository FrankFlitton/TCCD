               certain portion from taxation different from what 
               <br />
               we have got today. I want it made clear just what

               we have to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expect,</span> I believe in the quotation

               which was, I think, made in this House by some

               member, that the wrong way to tax a people is for 
               <br />
               one body to collect the taxes and another body to 
               <br />
               spend it. So I believe that When we get closer to 
               <br />

               <br />

               $5 million taxation. Now that’s the point I would 
               <br />
               like to make clear today. and ldon't see, looking 
               <br />
               at it from every angle. after the federal and 
               <br />
               provincial governments take their cuts. where the 
               <br />
               cut is going to come from for municipal purposes 
               <br />
               and for our schools. You will find out that the 
               <br />
               578,062 people of Nova Scotia are collecting 
               <br />
               $9,941,058 for their schools. I say we have got 
               <br />
               twice the territory to service, because we can’t go 
               <br />
               on leaving the Labrador in the place it is into; I 
               <br />
               am sure it is the greatest disgrace in the world, 
               <br />
               the way that Newfoundland has left the people of 
               <br />
               Labrador. If there is one body of people in our 
               <br />
               country that has raised themselves by the boot- 
               <br />
               straps, against odds that you can hardly under- 
               <br />
               stand, it‘s the people of Labrador. I believe that 
               <br />
               they should have the same as everybody else. 
               <br />
               There isn’t any doubt that there’s an immense 
               <br />
               amount of wealth in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country,</span> and our people 
               <br />
               in Labrador should not be left like the natives.

               I tried yesterday to explain in my simple way

               we were to make an impartial survey of Nova 
               <br />
