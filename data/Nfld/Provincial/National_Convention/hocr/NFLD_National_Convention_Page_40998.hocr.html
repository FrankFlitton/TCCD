               going to receive as a province and what the

               <br />
               — the difference between what we get from 
               <br />
               Canada and what has got to be raised from taxa— 
               <br />
               tion. I think that ought to be brought in here so 
               <br />
               that we can discuss that, as we did the Economic

               <br />
               raised and from what source it has to come. It is 
               <br />
               my guess that we are going to be $2 million or $3 
               <br />
               million short on provincial revenue after paying 
               <br />
               8% of sales tax and all other taxes. We have to 
               <br />
               get the provincial side of it. I would rather have 
               <br />
               the people see both sides. I do not want to hide 
               <br />
               anything — how much have they to pay and who 
               <br />
               is going to pay? I do not know whether it would

               should go ahead ﬁrst and discuss federal revenue

               <br />
               the way of doing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> But why not dispose of the

               question of federal government revenues and ex-

               While we have to do that, is it not important also

               to know what the federal government will spend

               into that fora day or two and spend the rest of the

               Mr. Chairman Except for this point, i agree

               with your contention that we are discussion prob—

               <br />
               respect to Newfoundland. That is quite so. in the

               course of your own remarks, Mr. Smallwood, 
               <br />
               you have pointed out that when this is finished, 
               <br />
               inevitably we must come to the time and place 
               <br />
               where we have to deal with purely provincial 
               <br />
               aspect of it. Now, members — at all events 
               <br />
               Mr. Hickman and Major Cashin — seem to be of 
               <br />
               opinion that they are not in a position to discuss 
               <br />
               the provincial aspect of it when we come to it. 
               <br />
               That raises the question as to whether or not it is 
               <br />
               necessary to secure supplementary information. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood i thought they were addressing 
               <br />
               themselves to the federal government revenues
