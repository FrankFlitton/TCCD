               Mr. Cashin Mr. Chairman, in reply to Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood, all I’ve got to say is that that it’s not 
               <br />
               in any of these terms. I want that from some 
               <br />
               ofﬁcial source besides Mr. Smallwood. If that 
               <br />
               was told them in Ottawa, it should have been 
               <br />
               included in one of these 25 cent books. I haven’t 
               <br />
               seen it in any of the secret documents. If I don’t 
               <br />
               know ofﬁcially tomorrow, I’m going to bring the 
               <br />

               taking Mr. Smallwood’s word for that, he 
               <br />
               wouldn’t take mine. Furthermore, he hasn‘t even 
               <br />
               told us about the Bank of Canada.

               <br />
               for a moment... I was referring yesterday to a 
               <br />
               motion introduced by Mr. Jackman some time in 
               <br />
               the early part of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proceedings,’</span> to the fact that 
               <br />
               when this Convention had almost unanimously 
               <br />
               turned it down, I had been approached by people 
               <br />
               asking where I got the right to do such things. I 
               <br />
               generally refused, and said that a number of other 
               <br />
               members had also been censured by various 
               <br />
               people. At that time Mr. Smallwood interrrupted 
               <br />
               and said nobody had spoken to him on the matter. 
               <br />
               That’s the statement as well as I recollect it. 
               <br />
               Nobody had spoken to him. Now either Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood has lost his memory or else he’s not 
               <br />
               telling the truth, because I was informed by a 
               <br />
               gentleman today that he had spoken to Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood, and had asked him what was the 
               <br />
               meaning of it, and that gentleman’s name is Mr. 
               <br />
               Walter Dillon, who’s a very prominent taxi-man 
               <br />

               Mr. Butt Yesterday, Mr. Chairman, I was

               <br />
               the terms of confederation as given to us here, 
               <br />
               would have to give up. Idid digress for a moment 
               <br />
               to say a word on the sales tax. I did that, sir, 
               <br />
               because I feel that there is a lot of misunderstand- 
               <br />
               ing on the point. Mr. Smallwood touched on it 
               <br />
               yesterday to a certain extent. For example, there’s 
               <br />
               such a thing as a retail sales tax, which means that 
               <br />
               if you go and buy an article costing $1 in a store 
               <br />
               and the tax is 2%, the two cents is tacked on to
