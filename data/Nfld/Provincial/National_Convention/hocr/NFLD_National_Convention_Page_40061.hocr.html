               I could not help thinking, when listening to 
               <br />
               Mr. Wild, with a revenue of $33 million, how our 
               <br />
               country in 1930 had exports valued at $7 million 
               <br />
               and a revenue of $1.25 million. Take our position 
               <br />
               today and then, are we not that much better <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">off?</span> 
               <br />
               If our social security and way of living would 
               <br />
               only increase with our expert and revenue, then 
               <br />
               we sure would have heaven on earth. I think in 
               <br />
               those days our “crooked” politicians did a good 
               <br />

               <br />
               am not in accord with this big plan spending. I 
               <br />
               believe in retrenchment with a capital “R" for the 
               <br />
               days that are always ahead after a war. Then plan. 
               <br />
               “Today” has always characterised their actions in 
               <br />
               the past -— always the wrong thing at the wrong 
               <br />
               time. I believe the government is making a mis-

               <br />

               <br />
               budgets. I have been a left wing socialist since 
               <br />
               1910, and have travelled to nearly every country 
               <br />
               with a coastline in the world. I have been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for“</span>

               tunate to meet folks who are trying and planning 
               <br />
               a better way of life. I have also taken notice of 
               <br />
               conditions in Newfoundland for 45 years and I’m 
               <br />
               not at all surprised that things are as they are, in 
               <br />
               fact with our laissez faire way its a wonder they 
               <br />
               are not worse... I can answer Mr. Newell, before 
               <br />
               we eat we have to have a government “of the 
               <br />
               people, for the people and by the people” who 
               <br />
               will see that those conditions are eliminated and 
               <br />
               the common man is represented. I spent the six 
               <br />
               years of the war with 28 voyages to Europe, with 
               <br />
               Russia and the Mediterranean thrown in, and I 
               <br />
               can assure my learned colleague, Major Cashin, 
               <br />
               that the ports of Britain are no stranger to me. I 
               <br />
               detested the Commission of Government and 
               <br />
               would have fought it if it had been the best

               <br />
               today. I remember one of them saying, “New-

               <br />

               we cannot place the blame on'the Labour Party, 
               <br />

               together of sterling character and demanded self

               <br />
               would have fought for us and I think the Tory

               element would have been glad to have changed 
               <br />

               out if there was really any political talent and 
               <br />
               interest in government was to call a National

               elected body and heartily sick of Commission of

               Government, and ask if they will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">turn</span> the govem-

               ment over to us and let us put parties in the

               confederation with Canada, fourth North of 
               <br />
               Ireland status, and for three years educate our 
               <br />
               people in what they have lost, so our people will 
               <br />
               have full knowledge of the issues at stake. I

               believe this is the best and cheapest way, and I 
               <br />
               don’t think it should be left to a later date. I

               have never thought the Commission of Govern- 
               <br />

               <br />
               British Commonwealth of Nations are in no way 
               <br />
               subordinate to each other, neither in their domes~ 
               <br />
               tic or foreign policy, and as I read it that cannot 
               <br />
               be changed without a plebiscite of the people. 
               <br />
               That plebiscite was not held, the Alderdice 
               <br />
               government was elected to bring back prosperity 
               <br />
               to the country, not to sell it.... We, as the first 
               <br />
               elected body of Newfoundlanders, will forget the
