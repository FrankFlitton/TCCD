               Mr. Hillier I have read the Education Report 
               <br />
               through and it contains some very important in~ 
               <br />
               formation. I think the report gives us an idea of 
               <br />
               what the expense of education will be in the 
               <br />
               future, also that it would be necessary to have a 
               <br />
               larger amount.

               In speaking of education we have to go some- 
               <br />
               times beyond our immediate vicinity, to look 
               <br />
               abroad upon this country, and we will find there 
               <br />
               are many small communities containing small 
               <br />
               schools, and the boys and girls can never hope to 
               <br />
               rise beyond a moderate standard of education, 
               <br />
               because of the early age at which they are advised 
               <br />
               to leave school. To the few is extended the op- 
               <br />
               portunity to obtain an education. We are specially 
               <br />
               privileged in St. John’s. In looking abroad again 
               <br />
               upon the outports there is a very large number of 
               <br />
               boys and girls whose parents have not the ways 
               <br />
               and means to send them to St. John’s or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">else</span> 
               <br />
               where to get an education. But in some of these 
               <br />
               communities there is a lot of hidden talent. So in

               <br />

               <br />
               Mr. Burry Much has been said about the need 
               <br />
               to raise teachers’ salaries and give them a better 
               <br />
               opportunity to get a better education and training 
               <br />
               with which I agree heartily, and would like for 
               <br />
               the Education Department of the government to 
               <br />
               do all it can to interest the teachers in New- 
               <br />
               foundland. They will not be wasting money. Any 
               <br />
               money spent will be well spent in the interest of 
               <br />
               education, but we ought not to overlook the fact 
               <br />
               that the Commission of Government has made 
               <br />
               great strides to increase the earning power of our 
               <br />
               teachers, and while in the lower brackets it is 
               <br />
               rather low, and perhaps not too high in the higher 
               <br />
               brackets, the fact is that the average teacher today 
               <br />
               is getting much more than he or she used to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">get.</span>

               <br />
               the salaries of teachers, but looking over this table 
               <br />
               1 ﬁnd that it refers to 1944, and there are only two 
               <br />
               teachers getting less than $300 a year, and 196

               <br />
               We all know that does not refer to the total 
               <br />
               amount that is paid to these teachers, because the 
               <br />
               cost of living bonus is not included, and the 
               <br />
               augmentation is not included. I am given to un- 
               <br />
               derstand that there is no graded teacher employed 
               <br />

               <br />
               the school year. 1 don’t know if the Committee 
               <br />
               will bear that out or not in their findings, but if 
               <br />
               that is so perhaps such words as “ridiculously low 
               <br />
               salaries" may not be used without hearing this in 
               <br />

               in mind that the salaries at the present time are
