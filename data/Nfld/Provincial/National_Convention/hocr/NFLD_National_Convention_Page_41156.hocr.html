               Canada in the order named. The direct interest of 
               <br />
               Great Britain in Newfoundland is small. There is 
               <br />
               the historic connection, composed of sentiment, 
               <br />

               North America represents for England not a

               sphere of interest but a supply base. Providing the

               <br />
               continent are a matter of indifference to Great 
               <br />
               Britain. Her anxiety about supplies would lead 
               <br />
               her to try to see that there are good bases from 
               <br />
               which they may be despatched, but efforts of this

               sort take the form of advice and request, not of 
               <br />
               direct action. In World War 1, Great Britain was 
               <br />
               still acting indirectly in British North America 
               <br />
               and there was much British naval activity in the 
               <br />
               Atlantic ports, especially St. John’s and Halifax. 
               <br />
               In the last war Canada replaced Great Britain,

               except in the matter of conveying ships.
