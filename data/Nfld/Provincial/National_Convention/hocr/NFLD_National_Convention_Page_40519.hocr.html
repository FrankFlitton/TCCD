               man getting out of it? That is what we had to 
               <br />
               consider on Bell Island, and here are the facts 
               <br />
               in regards to our position: we have an output, as 
               <br />
               far as Sydney is concerned, of 750,000 tons of 
               <br />
               ore, which gives us about two days work a week. 
               <br />
               It has been brought out in the board of arbitration 
               <br />
               and there is no question about it, that the Sydney 
               <br />
               steel plant is losing money and has been sub- 
               <br />
               sidised by the federal government of Canada, and 
               <br />
               it still is. I notice by today’s paper that the govem- 
               <br />
               ment is not subsidising the coal mines any longer, 
               <br />
               but they are subsidisin g the steel plant. We recog-

               nise that we are up against a hard proposition, but 
               <br />
               we have an opportunity to get into the British 
               <br />
               market, and we know just exactly what we are up 
               <br />
               against.

               <br />
               It is unbelievable that the government of the

               think it is true. I see by the Financial Post in

               recent issues that American capital is talking of 
               <br />

               make is this: we must be very much on our guard, 
               <br />

               <br />
               prepared to believe it, but I am also remembering 
               <br />
               that this is a company with two countries, one 
               <br />
               being Canada and the other Newfoundland. It has
