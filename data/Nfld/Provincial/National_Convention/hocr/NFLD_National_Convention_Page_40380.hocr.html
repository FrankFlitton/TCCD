               <br />

               would put my name in nomination the following 
               <br />
               day. Even then I felt my chances were very slim, 
               <br />
               as the opposition in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">St,</span> John’s (City) West was 
               <br />

               I have said all these things merely to underline 
               <br />
               the fact that the district that elected me knew what 
               <br />
               I stood for. Indeed, I will go so far as to say that 
               <br />
               the country knew <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> But now that I was into the 
               <br />
               fray, I left no stone unturned in order to keep the 
               <br />
               minds of the electorate clear on what I repre- 
               <br />
               sented. In the month and a half preceding the 
               <br />
               National Convention elections, I was engaged in 
               <br />
               writing a column for the St. John’s Sunday 
               <br />
               Herald, under the caption “Looking Ahead." In 
               <br />
               one of my columns I wrote, “The more one con- 
               <br />
               siders that clause of the statement relating to the 
               <br />
               National Convention, which suggests that can-

               <br />
               is inclined — especially a candidate — to come 
               <br />
               to the conclusion that it is either a very stupid 
               <br />
               clause or a very clever one. It has put every 
               <br />
               candidate in a somewhat embarrassing position, 
               <br />
               to say the least, and it has put the voting public 
               <br />
               into more confusion than previously <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">existed,"</span> In 
               <br />
               the light of past developments I am forced to the 
               <br />
               conclusion that it was a very clever clause, in the 
               <br />
               shady meaning of the word “clever“. Far better 
               <br />
               would it have been if every man could have gone 
               <br />
               out and campaigned on his own particular belief; 
               <br />
               when the election was over, we would have had 
               <br />
               a pretty good idea of where the country <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stood,</span> 
               <br />
               The delegates who did that, although against the 
               <br />
               spirit of the Convention as alleged, were by far 
               <br />

               make the National Convention a possible

               <br />
               they will be represented by a government 
               <br />
               which has been elected by a majority opinion. 
               <br />
               It certainly cannot be negotiated by an as-

               It was that belief, strengthened by subsequent

               events that caused me to adopt my uncompromis-

               On June 14, one week before election day, 
               <br />
               over radio station VOCM in a campaign speech, 
               <br />
               I said: “Ever since the announcement of the

               <br />
               the same line of reasoning, both in my Barrelman
