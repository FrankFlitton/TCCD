               Mr. Jackman Mr. Chairman, in rising to move 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               tion. I am a Newfoundlander and I am very proud 
               <br />
               of my birth. I lost in the ﬁrst world war the only 
               <br />
               brother in the world I could have as a companion, 
               <br />
               who laid down his life at Beaumont Hamel in 
               <br />
               1916, for the rights of all people to choose their 
               <br />
               own way of living. But I do recognise, sir, a 
               <br />
               certain subtle line of propaganda which we fell 
               <br />
               for in 1933, and which we are beginning to fall

               one part of it, when you said that the government

               Now Mr. Chairman, my idea in moving this 
               <br />
               resolution is only to satisfy a number of my 
               <br />
               constituents who are in favour of this. I have 
               <br />
               listened to a number of people apart from my 
               <br />
               constituency talking about the same thing. Per- 
               <br />
               sonally, whilst I move this, I do not agree with it. 
               <br />
               It sounds inconsistent but nevertheless I cannot 
               <br />
               help it. I believe that if we as a people want to get 
               <br />
               down to brass tacks, that there is only one way 
               <br />
               we can do it, and that is by standing on our own 
               <br />
               feet. I do not believe in getting everything from 
               <br />
               a government. As John Stuart Mill says, “The 
               <br />
               worth of a nation is the worth of the individual." 
               <br />
               We have been subjected, not only lately, but for 
               <br />
               a number of years, to this line of propaganda: 
               <br />
               “Give me your mind, and I will give you some- 
               <br />
               thing to eat.” I think it is appropriate to recall a 
               <br />
               warning from one of the greatest philosophers of 
               <br />
               modern times — by the way he was a German -— 
               <br />
               Hegel. He told the German people over 100 years 
               <br />
               ago, “Men are not free when they are not think- 
               <br />
               ing.” Of course the logical follow-up is this: there 
               <br />
               is only one way to bring it into action, and that is 
               <br />
               by the ballot, a secret weapon which all of us 
               <br />
               fought for, and it is sad to think that the battle of 
               <br />
               Runnymede, which was fought so long ago, 
               <br />
               should have been sabotaged in 1933. I do not 
               <br />
               wish to hold up the investigations of this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion, in fact I am very anxious to get it concluded 
               <br />
               as quickly as possible, because as I have said 
               <br />
               before, it is the common people who are paying 
               <br />
               for it and I don’t want to take anything off of 
               <br />
               anyone. Now at this time I think it would be very 
               <br />
               appropriate to quote a reference from the Bible, 
               <br />
               very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appropriate.</span> This is it: “For verily I say unto 
               <br />
               you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain: 
               <br />
               ‘Be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea‘ 
               <br />
               and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe 
               <br />
               that those things which he saith shall come to 
               <br />
               pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith.” 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Shakespeare says, “Our doubts are traitors, 
               <br />
               and make us lose the good we oft might win by 
               <br />
               fearing to attempt." Mr. Chairman, in moving 
               <br />
               this resolution I do it in this way: I have faith in
