               <br />
               point out that during the past four years it has cost 
               <br />
               the country $45,000 to send a nurse on the south—

               Mr. Hillier I think the point is the ship brings

               patients from the various places to the hospital, 
               <br />

               <br />
               instrumental in saving a number of lives. If she

               has done that it would not have been a waste.

               Probably she has been giving better service than

               point out, as far as I could gather from the inter— 
               <br />

               <br />
               department as to the value of the ship. As far as 
               <br />
               territory is concerned, actually when she went 
               <br />
               into service she covered part of the southwest 
               <br />
               coast, Burgeo to Hermitage. Now she is on the 
               <br />
               Fortune Bay run. The point should be made clear 
               <br />
               as to what her real value is. If she has saved one 
               <br />
               or two lives, her services are worth that.

               Mr. Cashin I wonder if Mr. Ashboume could 
               <br />
               try and get a statement from the department as to 
               <br />
               the total amount paid last year under the special

               <br />
               a statement how much was paid in each district 
               <br />
               under that heading, in goods or in cash? 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne 1 will try and gel that. 
               <br />
               Mr. Fudge l note there that the relief in the 
               <br />
               outports is $5 per head; special nourishment 
               <br />
               $7.50; in St. John‘s, $11.25 and $10 per <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">head,</span> I 
               <br />
               wonder why the difference. l doubt if some of the 
               <br />
               outports I know get either $7.50 or $5. 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne That was $7.50 in 1943 — they 
               <br />
               get $10 now. 
               <br />
               Mr. Fudge I doubt if some of those people get 
               <br />
               $10 in the outports. l have in mind one or two 
               <br />
               places, and according to what I can gather they 
               <br />
               have not gotten it. it largely depends on the 
               <br />
               relieving ofﬁcer. However, I would be pleased 
               <br />
               indeed if any of those people who have to apply 
               <br />
               to the relieving ofﬁcer in the district of Humber 
               <br />
               and who have not gotten this special $10, would 
               <br />
               wire me collect <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tomorrow,</span> so we can get a true

               picture. It depends upon the relieving ofﬁcer as
