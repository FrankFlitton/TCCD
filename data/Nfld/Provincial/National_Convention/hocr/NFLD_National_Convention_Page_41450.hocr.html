               Up until today an unfortunate illness has made 
               <br />
               it impossible for me to take any part in the debate 
               <br />
               on the confederation proposals which were intro- 
               <br />
               duced by my motion of last October. I have, 
               <br />
               however, followed the debate in my home, and I 
               <br />
               am compelled to admit that it was a most depress- 
               <br />
               ing and disappointing experience. Never in my 
               <br />
               whole life have I known the quality of debate 
               <br />
               upon so important a matter to fall to such a low 
               <br />
               level. During that period I was in the very heart 
               <br />
               of the largest ﬁshing town of this country,1 and I 
               <br />
               have to admit that the people there, and I feel that 
               <br />
               the whole country shared the feeling, were shock- 
               <br />
               ed by the refusal of many members of this Con- 
               <br />
               vention to treat this great question with the 
               <br />
               sincere impartiality and the friendly spirit of co- 
               <br />
               operation in search of truth which its importance 
               <br />
               demanded. I can assure you, sir, that their com— 
               <br />
               ments were caustic rather than complimentary, 
               <br />
               and they were unanimous, nor did they hesitate 
               <br />
               to express their disgust and indignation. Sir, I 
               <br />
               could not deny the justice of their criticism -— it 
               <br />
               was too true.

               representation and distortion, to pretty prejudice 
               <br />
               and personal antagonism. The Convention be-

               came a veritable battleground. Instead of making

               here on December 12 last, when we were closing 
               <br />
               for the Christmas vacation, when a majority of 
               <br />
               members walked out of the chamber with the 
               <br />
               perfectly obvious intention of preventing any 
               <br />
               reply to several hours of twisting and distorting

               Now there is a very urgent need indeed that in 
               <br />
               the interests of clear drinking a number of mis- 
               <br />
               conceptions that have grown up or been thrown 
               <br />
               up around this whole question should be cor- 
               <br />
               rected. Amongst these, sir, is the utterly foolish 
               <br />
               notion that the very fact that we are discussing 
               <br />
               confederation at all is the result of a breach of 
               <br />
               faith by Britain, that if she had carried out her 
               <br />
               obligation to us no confederation question would 
               <br />
               have arisen at all. Great currency has been given 
               <br />
               to this notion. Indeed it has been actively and 
               <br />
               sedulously circulated. This notion has growu into 
               <br />
               the more vicious and equally unfounded charge 
               <br />
               that Britain is false, that Britain is not to be 
               <br />
               trusted, that Britain is trying to cheat us out of our 
               <br />
               rights, including the right of responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern«</span> 
               <br />
               ment, that Britain is actively plotting to thrust us 
               <br />
               into confederation whether we want it or not, that 
               <br />
               Britain is plotting to retain Commission govem- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ment.</span> In fact about the only political crime that is 
               <br />
               not charged up to Britain today is that of trying 
               <br />
               to foist responsible government on us. It is in no 
               <br />
               way surprising, therefore, to ﬁnd that almost 
               <br />
               invariably, if not exclusively, every one of these 
               <br />
               charges is voiced by a supporter of responsible 
               <br />
               government. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now what are the bases of these charges? The 
               <br />
               argumentruns something like this: in 1933-34 the 
               <br />
               British government promised that when New- 
               <br />
               foundland became self-supporting responsible 
               <br />
               government would be restored if the people 
               <br />
               wanted it. Newfoundland is now technically self- 
               <br />
               supporting, and it remains therefore only for 
               <br />
               Britain to give us back responsible government 
               <br />
               and clear out. “Give us back what we had, give 
               <br />
               us back responsible government”, that is the cry. 
               <br />
               What are the real facts? It is quite true that the 
               <br />
               British government of 1933 did promise to re- 
               <br />
               store responsible government to Newfoundland 
               <br />
               if and when she became self-supporting, and if
