               Mr. Smallwood I am glad Mr. Butt mentioned 
               <br />
               that. I do not remember offhand what this present 
               <br />
               government has spent on lighthouses in the last 
               <br />
               few years; but on marine works generally they 
               <br />
               have spent immense amounts -— breakwaters and 
               <br />
               harbour improvements made in the last four or 
               <br />
               ﬁve years, it is a striking amount. I cannot answer 
               <br />
               for lighthouses. I do not know if any or many have 
               <br />
               been built or improved. What they did spend, 
               <br />
               they spent during the last two or three years. 
               <br />
               Before the war they did not have it to spend. If 
               <br />
               the amounts spent each year by the Government 
               <br />
               of Canada in the Maritime provinces on these 
               <br />
               things can be taken as an example, I think we 
               <br />
               could ﬁgure on something over $1 million on 
               <br />
               marine works to be spent in Newfoundland for a 
               <br />
               good many years. We have today something like 
               <br />
               300 public wharves. We have public launchways, 
               <br />
               public slipways, I think we have between 150 and 
               <br />
               200. Many of them have been swept away or gone 
               <br />
               into a bad state of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disrepair.</span> There will have to be 
               <br />
               an awful lot of money spent on marine works to 
               <br />
               bring them up to a half-decent standard.

               Mr. Bailey You mean we had them. I can point 
               <br />
               to one in Hants‘ Harbour where the marks only 
               <br />
               are left; you have to look for stumps. There was 
               <br />
               an $80,000 wharf in Hearts’ Content — where is 
               <br />
               it? There is one in New Perlican and I dare you 
               <br />
               to put a horse on it. They have spent a few dollars 
               <br />
               in Winterton. The breakwaters in Bay de Verde 
               <br />

               without giving credit. I have been hospitalised in 
               <br />
               many countries; I have had occasion at times to 
               <br />

               <br />
               the care given shipwrecked crews in this island. 
               <br />
               I believe in the care of shipwrecked crews —- we

               will not forget they were shipwrecked in New-

               foundland. I can tell our people, those men who 
               <br />
               had the misfortune to be hospitalised or 
               <br />

               the Black Books. The Broadcasting Corporation 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland would become part of the 
               <br />
               Canadian Broadcasting Commission. Although it 
               <br />
               would be owned and operated by the Canadian 
               <br />
               Broadcasting Commission, it would remain -— 
               <br />
               we were assured of that — that although it would

               as being a Newfoundland station. it would remain 
               <br />
               entirely what it is today. The main difference 
               <br />
               would be that the employees would be federal, 
               <br />
               paid by the CBC, and stations of the Corporation 
               <br />
               would carry the Canada news roundup, Canadian

               news. Any programmes originating in New-

               foundland, interesting enough to carry on the

               on our stations at the same time as on all stations
