               system of education of other countries. They do

               not believe that any system, no matter how excel—

               <br />
               evolve our own system of education completely 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               the necessary ﬁnancial arrangements should 
               <br />

               resolution be forwarded to the Honourable

               Mr. Chairman The situation is very awkward. 
               <br />
               That is not an amendment to the Education 
               <br />
               Report. It is an expression of opinion to be sent 
               <br />
               to the Commission of Government. I cannot see 
               <br />
               the connection. Frankly, I did not know what 
               <br />
               your motion was to be. I thought there was some- 
               <br />
               thing to be added to the Education Report.

               <br />
               government. The government has nothing to do 
               <br />
               with our reports. Here is a recommendation to the 
               <br />
               government. Some months ago we made a 
               <br />
               recommendation that nothing further be done 
               <br />
               with the assets of the country. That resolution was 
               <br />
               adopted and sent to the Commission. Now 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins thinks we should send another ex- 
               <br />
               pression of opinion, that the Memorial University 
               <br />
               College be given full university status. There is 
               <br />
               no reason why we cannot do that and not disturb 
               <br />
               the Education Report.
