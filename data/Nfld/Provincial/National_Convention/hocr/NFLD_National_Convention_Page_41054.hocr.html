               since we have nearly twice as much territory to 
               <br />
               service, is the Nova Scotia provincial budget 
               <br />
               $30,018,000? Now the municipal budget of Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia I believe is $9,941,000. I think that works 
               <br />
               out at around $18 a head. That’s just for roads and 
               <br />
               schools, and I can’t seem to be reconciled to the 
               <br />
               fact that this provincial parliament we are going 
               <br />
               to have, to give the people what we are getting 
               <br />
               now, can be operated on $15 million. I think there 
               <br />
               was a strong plea put forward as to our backward— 
               <br />
               ness, and I know if we are going to have services 
               <br />
               in this country we have got to pay for them, and 
               <br />
               the only way I know that you can pay for them is 
               <br />
               by raising taxes, and when you raise taxes you get 
               <br />
               revenue, and can do the work. I think the strong 
               <br />
               plea to send a delegation to Ottawa was that we 
               <br />
               could get a better way of life if we went into 
               <br />
               confederation with Canada, or if we negotiated to 
               <br />
               see how much better that life is going to be. But 
               <br />
               I have been struck very forcibly, and I have done 
               <br />
               a little deliberating, that the estimates of 
               <br />
               municipal taxes and everything has been kept off 
               <br />
               our desks. I hold that one of the ﬁrst things that 
               <br />
               the members of this National Convention should 
               <br />
               have had was all pertaining not only to the federal 
               <br />
               government of Canada, but if the people vote to 
               <br />
               demand confederation they should know the 
               <br />
               other side of the business. You have got nine 
               <br />
               different provincial governments in Canada, and 
               <br />
               since I have been in this Convention 1 have got to 
               <br />
               hear the ﬁrst word yet as to how John Doe in a 
               <br />
               ﬁshing village in Nova Scotia, or north New 
               <br />
               Brunswick, or the Magdalen Islands, or the 
               <br />
               Gaspc’ Coast, how he fares, and how he raised his 
               <br />
               taxes. The only way we can get that is by getting 
               <br />
               their estimates to see how they operate and work, 
               <br />
               and I ﬁnd it is being kept away from us as far as 
               <br />
               possible. Nobody in this country, not only in the 
               <br />
               government, not even the Trade Commissioner, 
               <br />
               can give me any idea of where one book can be 
               <br />
               found of how the provincial governments of 
               <br />
               Canada are being govemed. So I would like 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood to answer this question: how can 
               <br />
               he say that this country can be operated on $15 
               <br />
               million when we want new roads, we want 
               <br />
               schools, and the things that the Nova Scotlans 
               <br />
               have got, and the New Brunswickers and the 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Islanders are supposed to have, 
               <br />
               and the other provinces throughout Canada? I 
               <br />
               know how they get them, by lifting themselves 
               <br />
               by the straps of their boots. I think we have to go 
               <br />

               put into Newfoundland, and I am sure nobody

               under heaven knows how much they are going to

               <br />

               Bailey, who has been having very considerable

               enjoyment and interest I suppose in boning up, or

               studying the systems of taxation in some of the 
               <br />
               provinces ofCanada. To me, all learning is never 
               <br />
               a burden, it is grand to know things, and a grand 
               <br />
               thing to study; but in relation to Newfoundland I 
               <br />
               don’t see very much point in knowing what kinds

               of taxes they have in any particular provinces or
