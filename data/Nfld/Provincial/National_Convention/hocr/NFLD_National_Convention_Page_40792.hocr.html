               I would like to add to the Chairman’s remarks 
               <br />
               that, in consultation with our very efficient 
               <br />
               reporters, they very clearly stated it was not pos- 
               <br />
               sible to report on every night. This is a com-

               promise to meet the situation, and I believe it is 
               <br />
               very desirable... I think that broadcasting can be 
               <br />
               done, even if it is a little delayed.

               Mr. Hickman I am glad this amendment was 
               <br />
               made. I felt that six nights a week would not be

               suitable to all members. I have much pleasure in 
               <br />
               seconding the amendment. I feel we cannot get 
               <br />
               through this any too soon....

               Mr. Smallwood On the question of meeting at 
               <br />
               night time. Iwould like to say this. There may be 
               <br />
               in this Convention delegates who enjoy more 
               <br />
               than I do, being in here. I have yet to meet them. 
               <br />
               I enjoy being here as much as anyone. I love 
               <br />
               every moment of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> I hate to think of its closing. 
               <br />
               That is frank and it is sincere. Because, in my 
               <br />
               view, the people of Newfoundland are getting an 
               <br />
               education in the affairs of the country that they 
               <br />
               have never gotten in the history of the country 
               <br />
               since 1497. i love the thought of the people 
               <br />
               ﬁnding out for the first time something of what is 
               <br />
               going on in their country. As far as I am con- 
               <br />
               cerned, I would like Mr. Higgins’ motion to carry 
               <br />
               — to meet every night. Not only every night, but 
               <br />
               every day but Sunday. There cannot be too much 
               <br />
               of a good thing.

               <br />
               that month we have two orders of business to deal 
               <br />
               with: the question of confederation, and the ques- 
               <br />
               tion of the forms of possible future government 
               <br />
               that we will recommend to His Majesty’s 
               <br />
               Government in the United Kingdom to be laid 
               <br />
               before the people in the national referendum. A 
               <br />
               month in which to do that! As far as I am con~ 
               <br />
               cemed there should be a thorough debate on 
               <br />
               the terms of confederation, and that debate should 
               <br />
               be known and heard by all the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland. To the extent that the holding of night 
               <br />
               sessions might prevent the people from hearing 
               <br />
               the debates, I would not advise holding night 
               <br />
               sessions. If the night sessions are not to be broad- 
               <br />
               cast, it means the people are hearing only half the 
               <br />
               debate, and that might be a half when some 
               <br />
               essential matters are debated. I would like to be 
               <br />
               satisﬁed that debates held at night time are broad- 
               <br />
               cast.

               I do not feel like making an amendment to the
