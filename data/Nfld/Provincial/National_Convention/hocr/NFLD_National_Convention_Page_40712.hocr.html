               <br />
               remarks made about that paltry million dollars? 
               <br />
               How much would it take? Our friend from 
               <br />
               Bonavista said: “$1 million, you would want $10 
               <br />
               million”, but don‘t you see he is in a hurry to get 
               <br />
               across the Cabot Strait. I say $1 million is not 
               <br />
               enough too, but you have got to cut your garment 
               <br />
               according to the cloth. This is only one/tenth of

               <br />
               cause our saltﬁsh products go to people who are 
               <br />
               low wage earners in Europe and the West Indies 
               <br />
               and other places. They are not able to pay high 
               <br />
               prices for saltﬁsh. Saltﬁsh is not worth a high 
               <br />
               price, consequently if we are to raise the standard 
               <br />
               of living of our fishermen we must enable them 
               <br />
               to be paid more for their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁshw</span> Mind you I am 
               <br />
               not damning the saltﬁsh trade, that’s what I grew 
               <br />
               up on. I dare say I cut my eye tooth on a piece of 
               <br />
               salt cod. Our people here lived on salt cod, don’t 
               <br />
               forget that. There were no woods industries, or 
               <br />
               mining industries, or anything, just salt cod, and 
               <br />
               still they did not want to go across the Cabot 
               <br />
               Strait. Now we have those new industries and I 
               <br />
               am quite sure there is an unlimited future ahead 
               <br />
               of us. Mind you, it is not going to be easy going 
               <br />
               for everybody.... Our efforts for mankind are to 
               <br />
               raise the number of people who can so get to that 
               <br />
               standard of living where they will be able to live 
               <br />
               in comfort, and I hope in peace.

               some pool or tank”. That was the opinion of the 
               <br />
               member from Bonavista Centre. “It is absolutely 
               <br />

               <br />
               have no mercantile marine, and yet when the

               Finance Committee suggests that they should

               “No, you are only wasting money." I put it to you, 
               <br />
               is that sensible? $500,000 is not enough at all. 
               <br />
               That will only build you a couple of small ships,

               Mr. Cashin You can get a ship, a nice ship for 
               <br />
               $300,000. The Clarenville ships cost $300,000 
               <br />
               each, and they can only carry 300 tons. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Then there’s the Railway capital

               expenditure too. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin Well, it would need all that. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett That is with regard to what you are

               41. The honesty of that Committee, as I said 
               <br />
               before, was brought into question, and in order 
               <br />
               ﬁnally to prove that I think that any man who 
               <br />
               insinuates anything against the honesty of these 
               <br />
               men, or says they did not make an honest report, 
               <br />
               once you read that paragraph on page 41 you will 
               <br />
               see that these men were absolutely sincere: 
               <br />
               In presenting this report on the economic 
               <br />
               position of Newfoundland, we are aware that 
               <br />
               in all respects we cannot, as in the case of the 
               <br />
               Financial Report, deal with ﬁxed values. 
               <br />
               There are instances wherein we are un- 
               <br />
               avoidably compelled to deal in the realm of 
               <br />
               surmise and even conjecture. To some, this 
               <br />
               may give the impression that we may be 
               <br />
               colouring the picture to suit our particular 
               <br />
               idea or political inclinations. Such however 
               <br />
               is not the case. For throughout, our object has 
               <br />
               been to try and give as accurate a picture as 
               <br />
               we possibly can of the state of our country.
