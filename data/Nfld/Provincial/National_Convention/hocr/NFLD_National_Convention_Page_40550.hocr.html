               paragraph 5 of that Quebec act provides that

               before the ﬁrst of May in each year all such

               <br />
               auditors of the amounts actually spent. Paragraph 
               <br />
               6 provides that the company must in the calender 
               <br />

               <br />
               for 20,000 square miles. Paragraph 7 provides 
               <br />
               that the company can only acquire 300 
               <br />
               square miles. In Newfoundland they can get up 
               <br />
               to 1,000 square miles. You will note in paragraph 
               <br />
               7 of that act it says deﬁnitely that they are 
               <br />
               deﬁnitely obliged to mine on or before January 
               <br />
               1, 1958, and if they don’t mine on or before 
               <br />
               January 1, 1958, their licence to mine may be 
               <br />
               cancelled at the option of the government, and 
               <br />
               that proviso also applies if they fail to comply 
               <br />
               with putting in their claim. We have no such 
               <br />
               proviso The country could be tied up for 50 years 
               <br />
               for $64,000 a year, and a mining license or lease 
               <br />
               could be acquired up to 8 square miles. Paragraph 
               <br />
               10 provides that they have the right, during the 
               <br />
               period of ten years from the coming into force of 
               <br />
               the Quebec act to have a strip of land 10 miles in 
               <br />
               width contiguous to the area reserved for them. 
               <br />
               That is really one thing that they don’t have to 
               <br />
               pay anything for.... Paragraph 11 gives the right 
               <br />
               for the period of 60 years for the concession. As 
               <br />
               I said before, our act provides that they may have 
               <br />
               a non-mining licence period at 5 cents per acre 
               <br />
               for 50 years, and a lease period for 90 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years.</span> They

               Mr. Chairman I would like to point out that this 
               <br />
               is an act of some 24 pages, drawn up presumably 
               <br />
               by lawyers, meant to cover the legal rights and 
               <br />
               immunities anticipated by the company or neces—
