               ly asking the perfectly reasonable question: how 
               <br />
               does Mr. Fogwill ﬁgure, how does he estimate 
               <br />
               that if we imported $31 million from the rest of 
               <br />

               federation, with everything coming in duty free 
               <br />
               from Canada, how does he ﬁgure that we will 
               <br />
               bring in $20 million from the rest of the world? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I think the point is well taken by 
               <br />
               Mr. Fogwill. I know that I never advance an 
               <br />
               argument in the Supreme, or any other court, until 
               <br />
               I am satisﬁed myself that the argument is as it 
               <br />
               should be. Having satisﬁed myself, then I en- 
               <br />
               deavour to try and satisfy the judge and the jury 
               <br />
               that my argument is sound. Mr. Fogwill has 
               <br />
               broken down these ﬁgures, and assigned certain 
               <br />
               reasons, and in the course of his observations, if 
               <br />
               I understood him correctly, he stated that from 
               <br />
               that $31 million imported from countries other 
               <br />
               than Canada last year, his estimate would be, 
               <br />
               having regard to the type of article, where it 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood Not quite. His act of giving us 
               <br />
               these ﬁgures implies that he wishes us to consider 
               <br />
               these ﬁgures. Every man who stands up here, he 
               <br />
               naturally expects that his remarks are going to be 
               <br />
               analysed and broken down and examined. The 
               <br />
               net result of his speech is that he disagrees with 
               <br />
               the Government of Canada. He doubles it, and 
               <br />
               surely it is fair to ask Mr. Fogwill to explain the 
               <br />
               basis of his argument. At one point he has ex- 
               <br />
               plained it. He is taking 15% average duty coming 
               <br />
               in from other countries than Canada. OK, we will 
               <br />
               accept that. He is not far out, but we will say it is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">15%.</span> Now the next question is, so that he can 
               <br />
               build up his table, what will the Canadian govern— 
               <br />
               ment collect that from? How much other imports 
               <br />
               apart from Canada? So Mr. Fogwill lops off $11 
               <br />
               million, and still says we will import $20 million 
               <br />
               from countries other than Canada, and from that 
               <br />
               he collects 15% duty. I am asking on what basis 
               <br />
               does he ﬁgure that the trade of this country, under
