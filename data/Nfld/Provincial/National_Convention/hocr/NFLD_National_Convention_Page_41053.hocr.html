               the event of union with Canada some of the civil

               <br />
               other hand Mr. Smallwood said that under 
               <br />
               various departmental heads we would probably 
               <br />
               have an extra 1,000 engaged. That’s right isn’t

               is this: assuming they get $2.000 a head for an 
               <br />
               average salary, that's $200,000; who pays that,

               Mr. Smallwood 1 said that if we become a

               province our public service would be cut in two, 
               <br />
               one part would still be ours, and our provincial 
               <br />
               government would have to pay that. The other 
               <br />
               part of it would become federal government, and 
               <br />
               the Government of Canada would stand it. In the 
               <br />
               departments that the Canadian government 
               <br />
               would take over and handle, they would take the 
               <br />
               civil servants who are in each particular depart~ 
               <br />
               ment at the time union takes place. But on top of 
               <br />
               that again there are government departments in 
               <br />
               Canada which we have not got here at all, which 
               <br />
               would be established. The Canadian government 
               <br />
               would open new ofﬁces here over and above the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland ofﬁces that they would take over, 
               <br />
               and in those new offices they would employ 
               <br />
               something up to 1,000 people.
