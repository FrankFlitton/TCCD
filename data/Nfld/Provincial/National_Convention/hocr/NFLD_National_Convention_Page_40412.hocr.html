               matter of fact, when the people from my district 
               <br />
               read that the Convention is considering putting 
               <br />
               the codﬁshery on a cash basis they will probably 
               <br />
               lose all conﬁdence in the Convention from then 
               <br />
               on, for the idea of putting it on a cash basis is 
               <br />
               blasphemy to them. Let us think of the economy 
               <br />
               that would be affected if it were possible to put 
               <br />
               the codﬁshery on a cash basis. Let us say that an 
               <br />
               important wholesaler needs credit, I presume he 
               <br />
               goes to the bank and gets credit. Presumably he 
               <br />
               pays whatever the bank’s usual charges are, and 
               <br />
               these naturally are tacked on to the cost of his 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">goods,</span> Now that wholesale merchant has to deal 
               <br />
               with a smaller retail merchant somewhere in the 
               <br />
               outport, and he has to give this particular man not 
               <br />
               only six to ten months credit (because very few 
               <br />
               of them are in a position to buy for cash), but in 
               <br />
               addition to waiting for payment for his goods he 
               <br />
               has to undertake considerable risk as to whether 
               <br />
               he will get paid for it or not, therefore the cost of 
               <br />
               credit under such circumstances is fairly high. In 
               <br />
               turn the smaller businessman, who has secured 
               <br />
               credit from the wholesale merchant, lets out these 
               <br />
               same goods to your average ﬁsherman, again on 
               <br />
               possibly six months credit, and again taking con— 
               <br />
               siderable risk as to whether he shall within six 
               <br />
               months or ever be paid for these goods. All these 
               <br />
               credit charges have to be tacked on to the cost of 
               <br />
               the goods, and must therefore be reckoned when 
               <br />
               we are considering the cost of production of salt 
               <br />
               codﬁsh, because the cost of living of the in- 
               <br />
               dividual in the primary enterprise must be reck- 
               <br />
               oned in the cost of production. Now if we 
               <br />
               consider what all that means to our economy, and 
               <br />
               what a difference between prosperity and the 
               <br />
               opposite for a great many people in the ﬁshing 
               <br />
               industry this means, we begin to see just how 
               <br />
               important this sentence is: “We suggest that con- 
               <br />
               sideration be given to the idea that the codﬁshery 
               <br />
               be placed on a cash <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">basis”,</span> That’s a very impor- 
               <br />
               tant point, and I would hate to see it passed over 
               <br />
               without due consideration. As I say, the Commit- 
               <br />
               tee did not have the temerity to suggest how it 
               <br />
               should be done. It is a pretty tough problem, one 
               <br />
               of the main problems of our ﬁshing industry, that 
               <br />
               is our codﬁshery. A great many abuses that exist 
               <br />
               today from every side are tied up with the same 
               <br />
               thing. A little while ago we were discussing the 
               <br />
               supervision of codﬁsh that’s going to be ex- 
               <br />
               ported, because if we are going to stay in the 
               <br />
               markets we have to have a good quality, and look,

               I have never been in the salt codﬁsh business, 
               <br />
               but I know a good many who are, and many of 
               <br />
               them have reiterated that if a man comes along 
               <br />

               <br />
               codﬁsh which is in place of cash, the natural 
               <br />
               feeling is to say, “I am sorry I can’t take that fish 
               <br />
               at the price you want for it.” Usually he has been 
               <br />
               fortunate enough to get the money for it some-

               system“, and I think whether or not we can put 
               <br />
               our codﬁshery on a cash basis in the coming years

               Mr. Job The fresh codfish business has been on 
               <br />
               a cash basis, and one of the things the Committee 
               <br />
               had in mind was the possibility that the purchase 
               <br />
               of codﬁsh might eventually be made for cash, 
               <br />
               which would mean that the plants, or the oper~ 
               <br />
               ators, would have to make arrangements for 
               <br />
               curing the ﬁsh, and then the question arose as to 
               <br />
               how much more is it going to cost to cure ﬁsh in 
               <br />
               that way than when a ﬁsherman cures it himself. 
               <br />
               That’s a question which requires very careful 
               <br />
               consideration, but that would be the ideal sort of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arrangements</span> it is made a little more encouraging 
               <br />
               now by the fact that if you can bring the fish into 
               <br />
               one locality you will largely increase the value of 
               <br />
               your by-products, especially the offal for ﬁsh- 
               <br />
               meal. That’s one of the things the Committee had 
               <br />
               in mind. It is a very difﬁcult matter, and one that 
               <br />
               has to be enquired <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">into,</span> It is easy to put it on paper,
