               Mr. Hillier Mr. Chairman, with your kind <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">per“</span> 
               <br />
               mission, I wish to make a few remarks of a 
               <br />
               general nature. During the past few days, I have 
               <br />
               had the privilege to listen to some eloquent 
               <br />
               speeches bearing on matters now before the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Chair.</span> They made recommendations on which 
               <br />
               confederation might be considered. Major 
               <br />
               Cashin in his forcible address made reference to 
               <br />
               the necessity of a comparable future in consider- 
               <br />
               ing the entry into confederation; to that I agree. 
               <br />
               He also gave evidence that the ancient political 
               <br />
               spirit is not dead. Mr. Higgins, among other 
               <br />
               things, pointed out that by reason of Newfound- 
               <br />
               land’s geographical position she gradually grew 
               <br />
               in inﬂuence. He felt that under the circumstances 
               <br />
               the Ottawa delegation had done a good job and 
               <br />
               that the recommendations before us were a good 
               <br />
               basis for future negotiations. He stated further 
               <br />
               that confederation could be taken up at some 
               <br />
               future date. He gave me the impression that he 
               <br />
               had a feeling that at some future date it would be 
               <br />
               to the advantage of Newfoundland to unite with 
               <br />
               a larger power. I might say in passing that there 
               <br />
               are those who share our view. Mr. Harrington 
               <br />
               gave us a historical picture of Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               leading us step by step to her present importance. 
               <br />
               Other speakers have had their quota of interesting 
               <br />
               information. The majority, I think, advocated a 
               <br />
               return to responsible government realising of 
               <br />
               course that the final say rests with the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland... I have but one vote and after 
               <br />
               careful consideration of the whole question <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con«</span> 
               <br />
               fronting us, I shall do what I feel is in the general 
               <br />
               interest of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country...</span> The debate on the terms 
               <br />
               is shortly to be concluded, as is the Convention 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">itself.</span> In connection with the latterI say that it is 
               <br />
               high time. On the former, I am led to wonder to 
               <br />
               what extent have our people been helped in the 
               <br />
               making of the great and serious decision they will 
               <br />
               eventually be called upon to make. Personally sir, 
               <br />
               I feel they have not by this Convention been 
               <br />
               given the help they expected, and could and 
               <br />
               should have been given. I am convinced, further, 
               <br />
               far too much time has been taken up in airing our 
               <br />
               special political views. In consequence our 
               <br />
               people are left in mid-air, left to decide a great 
               <br />
               question based on knowledge they have acquired 
               <br />
               apart largely from that which was drawn out 
               <br />
               through the medium of this Convention. I said 
               <br />
               some time ago that this Convention would go 
               <br />
               down in history. It certainly shall, and be remem~ 
               <br />
               bered for one of two things: either what it did or 
               <br />
               did not accomplish for the common good of our 
               <br />
               fellow man. During the Christmas recess, Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, I met and conversed with men from 
               <br />
               districts other than my own and I am more than 
               <br />
               ever convinced that a lot of our people are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disap»</span> 
               <br />
               pointed because of the lack of helpful informa- 
               <br />
               tion thus far emanating from this Convention... 
               <br />
               I would have to say that it is not too late yet. The 
               <br />
               choosing of forms of government sir, is some- 
               <br />
               thing which should not be treated <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lightly...</span> It is 
               <br />
               generally felt that the mischief started in the early 
               <br />
               stages of the Convention by the entry of party 
               <br />
               politics which still is in evidence, that it has 
               <br />
               retarded somewhat the real purpose and work of 
               <br />
               this Convention. Some have expressed themsel- 
               <br />
               ves in favour of responsible government. Some 
               <br />
               have expressed themselves as favourable to 
               <br />
               union with Canada. That is their right... Per- 
               <br />
               sonally, because I feel that the question of con~ 
               <br />
               federation calls for careful thought based on 
               <br />
               deﬁnite and reliable facts, I refrain from express- 
               <br />
               ing my opinion as to the wisdom or otherwise of 
               <br />
               union with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada.</span> I do not mean to infer that the 
               <br />
               facts before us are not reliable or that I am hostile 
               <br />
               to confederation. I feel that at some time in the 
               <br />
               not too distant future, it will be much to the 
               <br />
               advantage of Newfoundland to unite to some 
               <br />
               larger power than herself, whatever that power 
               <br />
               may be. Every man and woman in this land will, 
               <br />
               in due time, be called upon to consider and make 
               <br />
               a choice of forms of government submitted to 
               <br />
               them. How necessary it is then, that they be well, 
               <br />
               impartially and correctly informed on all matters 
               <br />
               and that any personal ambitions of ours which 
               <br />
