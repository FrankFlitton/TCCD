               Mr. Bailey A very strong point, to my mind — 
               <br />
               I did not want to bring it up, but Mr. Miller 
               <br />
               brought it forward. For 40 years I have travelled, 
               <br />
               now and again, between North Sydney and Truro. 
               <br />
               If we are going to have that class of railroad under 
               <br />
               confederation, I do not think it is going to suit 
               <br />
               us.... The people up there have been ﬁghting to 
               <br />
               get a bridge across the Gut of Canso since 1910. 
               <br />
               Anyone who has travelled over that railway, 
               <br />
               especially if you are coming east, would think 
               <br />
               there are square wheels under the track. I will not 
               <br />
               say anything about the cars. It is apparent that it 
               <br />
               is worse today than it was back in 1911 and 1912. 
               <br />
               If that is the type of railroad we are going to get, 
               <br />
               I think we should hold on to the one we have. It 
               <br />
               is not going to be good enough. I am sure there 
               <br />
               was nothing in this country that was worse... We 
               <br />
               have the Grey Book and the Black Books and 
               <br />
               other books, but there is no guarantee. I would 
               <br />
               like to see their John Hancocks there before I 
               <br />
               marked my “x" for confederation. I have been 
               <br />
               doubtful about this all the time. Since Mr. Miller 
               <br />
               brought it up, I would bring it to the attention of 
               <br />
               the members here.

               ing the railway, sizing it up, getting the feel of it. 
               <br />
               I, for one, will say now that the worst railway 
               <br />
               across Canada is that railway, but it is better than

               Mr. Smallwood That is your opinion. The best 
               <br />
               way is for all of us to travel over the railway and 
               <br />
               see for ourselves. Every man can then make up 
               <br />
               his own mind. Now, let Captain Bailey go a little 
               <br />
               bit further, let him go down and take a look at the 
               <br />
               kind of service the Government of Canada is 
               <br />
               providing for tiny Prince Edward Island, 2,000 
               <br />
               square miles in size, with a population of 
               <br />
               95,000.... When that Island joined the union as a 
               <br />
               province, the terms contained a clause saying the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada would maintain a ferry 
               <br />
               service between the mainland and Prince Edward 
               <br />
               Island. I wonder if Captain Bailey has any 
               <br />
               knowledge of the monumental sum of money that 
               <br />
               the Government of Canada has spent to keep that 
               <br />
               promise. In 1917 the Government of Canada 
               <br />
               spent $1 million to build a ferryboat to connect 
               <br />
               that province. In 1927 they built another one 
               <br />
               which cost $2 million. Remember, our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Caribou}</span> 
               <br />
               cost$500,000 in 1925.... In 1947 the Government 
               <br />
               of Canada spent $5 million to provide a new ferry 
               <br />
               and in addition they spent $6 million to improve 
               <br />
               the terminals at each end of her run.... In addition 
               <br />
               to that, they found when they took over Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island, that they had a narrow gauge 
               <br />
               railway. They took over that railway. What did 
               <br />
               they do to that railway? They made it a broad 
               <br />
               gauge. I remember the ﬁrst time I ever visited 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island, the broad gauge railway 
               <br />
               ran only half-way across the Island, up to Char- 
               <br />
               lottetown; then the rest of the distance was nar- 
               <br />
               row gauge. The Government of Canada spent $1 1 
               <br />
               million in that little province in 1947. They have 
               <br />
               no political influence, they count very little...

               Mr. Fogwill Point of order. I think we should 
               <br />
               conﬁne our remarks to the report, not to what 
               <br />
               happened to Prince Edward Island.
