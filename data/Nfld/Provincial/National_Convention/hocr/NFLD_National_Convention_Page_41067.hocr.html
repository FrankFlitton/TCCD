               What was ﬁnally decided was the form of a 
               <br />
               subsidy from the Dominion treasury. The dif- 
               <br />
               ﬁculty however was to decide on a method of 
               <br />
               subsidy which would not appear unfair. For in- 
               <br />
               stance, to make up Nova Scotia’s deﬁcit on ac- 
               <br />
               count of loss of revenue, it would require $1.70 
               <br />
               per capita, $1.33 for New Brunswick, and but 38 
               <br />
               cents for Quebec and Ontario. They argued that 
               <br />
               if Nova Scotia was to receive $1.70 per head of 
               <br />
               population so should the other provinces. The

               Quebec Conference very nearly broke up over 
               <br />
               this matter. That was the Quebec Conference in 
               <br />
               1865, I think it was.

               this static ﬁnancial arrangement is anybody’s 
               <br />

               <br />
               was a hopeless one is to be found in the fact that 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia ran a heavy deﬁcit almost immedi~ 
               <br />
               ately, and had to seek better terms from the 
               <br />
               Dominion government within a year. By 1874 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia was expending $755,000 on neces— 
               <br />
               sary services, and could hardly be expected to 
               <br />
               carry on with $371,000 as agreed in 1867. Hence 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia, as well as the other provinces, had 
               <br />
               to go repeatedly to the Dominion government to 
               <br />
               beg for an adjustment, and they have been doing

               <br />
               pointedly by the fact that whereas in 1867 the

               total Dominion, provincial and municipal expen- 
               <br />

               <br />
               million. And it is interesting to note that in 1930. 
               <br />
               the provinces and their municipalities or town 
               <br />

               on the primary functions of government in

               <br />

               <br />
               Hon. Charles Dunning was able to say. “The ‘
