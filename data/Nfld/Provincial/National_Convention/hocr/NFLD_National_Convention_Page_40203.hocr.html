               on turning from the other three or four things on

               which a lot of public money is going to be lost,

               to something in which there seems an excellent

               prospect of getting money into the country in the

               pressed by what they have learned about the 
               <br />
               magnitude and value of tourist trade in North

               the six sections of this report. The understanding

               is we deal merely with Gander, and I suggest that 
               <br />
               the report be read section by section, with any

               airport was read]

               Mr. Chairman I was hoping the members 
               <br />
               would interrupt Mr. Secretary while he was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">read»</span> 
               <br />
               ing that report to take it up bit by bit, but they did 
               <br />
               not. I hope that we do not infer from that they do 
               <br />
               not intend to deal with it.

               Mr. Higgins The entire operating loss that you 
               <br />
               estimate as $500,000 to $1 million, does that 
               <br />
               include the value of the landing fees or not?

               <br />
               Mr. Higgins According to that, the country has 
               <br />
               spent $2.5 million for the airport, it pays out $1 
               <br />
               million for salaries and that is recoverable, our 
               <br />
               own people are getting the $1 million back again, 
               <br />
               and all the other companies are paying $1 million 
               <br />
               in salaries. By the way, you made a comment 
               <br />
               about why the plane companies were not ap- 
               <br />
               proached to take over this airport themselves. Did 
               <br />

               <br />
               preaching the airlines on that matter? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood No. Airlines have got some 
               <br />
               kind of contractual agreement with the govem—

               in any way or degree in the question of landing
