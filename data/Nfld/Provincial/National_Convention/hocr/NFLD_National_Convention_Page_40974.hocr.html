               satisﬁed by clear and unmistakable evidence that

               <br />

               I will have to go further into the question and find

               out the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">circumstances...</span> I make a direction now

               Mr. Job May I point out that in the case of the 
               <br />
               English delegation the same question arose, and 
               <br />
               it was withheld for some little time, but was 
               <br />
               ﬁnally released by the British government and 
               <br />

               beyond reasonable doubt that any information in

               Mr. Higgins I state again, as far as my position

               is concerned in the matter, everything was to be

               <br />
               may be a matter of conscience for them, it might 
               <br />

               In the one case, I think you took the position that 
               <br />
               nothing was to be regarded as secret as far as the 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               was secret for some purposes and not for others. 
               <br />
               I said the other day that I did not want to come 
               <br />
               between any man <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and‘his</span> conscience, but I think 
               <br />
               your suggestion is the proper one. If Major 
               <br />
               Cashin’s point is well taken. and I think it is, then 
               <br />
               to relieve any members who may feel that I am 
               <br />
               coming between them and their conscience, I 
               <br />
               think that you, Mr. Higgins, or someone this 
               <br />
               afternoon should table another question to the 
               <br />
               Government ofCanada. and let’s have it disposed 
               <br />
               of once and for all: whether all or any of the 
               <br />
               information in possession of all or any members 
               <br />
               of the Ottawa delegation is to be treated as secret. 
               <br />
               in the sense that it can be withheld from the 
               <br />
               members of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Convention.</span> 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Bailey Mr. Chairman. that is not what I was 
               <br />
               going to say. If the members of the Ottawa 
               <br />
               delegation are willing, I believe we could table a 
               <br />
               motion the same as we did with the London 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegation.</span> We had the very same trouble there, 
               <br />
               and after a while it came through. One man looks 
               <br />
               at it from one angle, and another from another, 
               <br />
               but to be fair to the Ottawa delegation, and also 
               <br />
               to be fair to the Convention and the people, I 
               <br />
               believe that the Canadian government should be 
               <br />
               asked to release everything so that we can get 
               <br />
               down to thejob. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">li‘l</span> may liken it to something, it 
               <br />
               is like coming in with the official log book. You 
               <br />
               lay it on the owner‘s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">table.</span> What does he know 
               <br />
               about it? But if you bring in a scratch log he can 
               <br />
               see the whole thing in a nutshell. and it seems to 
               <br />
               me that isjust like <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> We havejust got the official 
               <br />
               log, and the scratch log is something secret. The 
               <br />
               members of this delegation have something that 
               <br />
               we are not allowed to have. I believe the right way 
               <br />
               to get at it is to table a motion and ask the 
               <br />
               Canadian government if those people are bound 
               <br />
               by that.

               Mr. Smallwood I think perhaps the Convention

               table a motion to the Government of Canada
