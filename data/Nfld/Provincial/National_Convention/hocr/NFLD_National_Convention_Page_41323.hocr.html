               Mr. Hickman Mr. Chairman, I would like to say 
               <br />
               first that I am heartin in support of the motion 
               <br />
               before this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House,</span> To my way of thinking, and 
               <br />
               supported by the facts which I have been able to 
               <br />
               acquire during the long session of this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion, I cannot help but feel that the people of this 
               <br />
               country should ﬁrst be given the opportunity of 
               <br />
               having restored to them their own right to free 
               <br />
               democratic government of themselves and by 
               <br />
               themselves; and this principle should, I feel, be 
               <br />
               adopted whatever the circumstances may be. As 
               <br />
               it happens, this National Convention has unani- 
               <br />
               mously found this country of ours to be self-sup— 
               <br />
               porting and the previous Commissioner for 
               <br />
               Finance, Mr. Wild, stated also that New- 
               <br />
               foundland was self-supporting; but even in the 
               <br />
               event of their not being so, I have come to the 
               <br />
               conclusion that this should be the ﬁrst step in any 
               <br />
               reformation of our political and economic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs,</span> 
               <br />
               I say that I have come to this conclusion by facts 
               <br />
               and other material considerations that I have been 
               <br />
               able to acquire and carefully study since the 
               <br />
               opening of this Convention. It has been proven to 
               <br />
               my own satisfaction that a country can only 
               <br />
               decide its own future, both securely and safely, 
               <br />
               through its own government elected by and with 
               <br />
               the support of the people. It has been obvious to 
               <br />
               me in recent months, the hopelessness of en-

               As you are aware, Mr. Chairman, this Nation- 
               <br />
               al Convention at the outset appointed committees 
               <br />
               and after the completion of the work by the 
               <br />
               several committees, each report was brought 
               <br />
               before the full Convention and debated and ques- 
               <br />
               tioned in what I would consider a very thorough 
               <br />
               manner. To the members of this Convention, 
               <br />
               politically and governmentally blindfolded for 
               <br />
               some 12 years, these reports were undoubtedly of 
               <br />
               great benefit in helping them assess the present 
               <br />
               economic position of our country, as well as 
               <br />
               providing them with some foresight of at least the 
               <br />
               near future, which in this upset world today 
               <br />
               would not be possible in a great many countries. 
               <br />
               I consider that the Finance Committee’s report 
               <br />
               was really in substance a summary and factual 
               <br />
               finding of the remainder of the reports, and par- 
               <br />
               ticularly so was their report on the economic 
               <br />
               position of Newfoundland, which clearly indi- 
               <br />
               cated what the people of this country could ex— 
               <br />
               pect and realise in what was quite rightly called 
               <br />
               the “foreseeable future”. It has been clearly 
               <br />
               shown to me that this country is economically 
               <br />
               sound, self-supporting, and in a better position 
               <br />
               today than it has ever been in its history, and I 
               <br />
               doubt if there is a country in the world that can 
               <br />
               compare in this respect to Newfoundland. Our 
               <br />
               basic industries are in a much more sound, diver— 
               <br />
               sified and better economic position to face the 
               <br />
               future than they were before the war and, for that 
               <br />
               matter, any previous period in our history.
