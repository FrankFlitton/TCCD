               will buy from you. I supported Sir Richard 
               <br />
               Squires and went down with him. I said to him 
               <br />
               once, “I don’t know much about what can be 
               <br />
               done, I am not in the government, but I believe if 
               <br />
               this was gone into right we could get the thin edge 
               <br />
               of the wedge into Middle Europe”. He said, 
               <br />
               “What has Czechoslovakia got?” I said, “Boots 
               <br />
               and shoes”, and he said, “We have a local in- 
               <br />
               dustry”. “Well," I said, “we can’t produce shoes 
               <br />
               as cheap as we can herring, and if we don’t 
               <br />
               produce herring we can’t buy shoes whether we 
               <br />
               buy them here or not." That's the position. The 
               <br />
               first man in this country that you have got to look 
               <br />
               to is the primary producer — the ﬁsherman. We 
               <br />
               had only a small pulp and paper industry at that 
               <br />
               time, and there was lots of talk of the Humber, 
               <br />
               and things were pretty tough when fish dropped 
               <br />
               from $19 a quintal to around $8. Things were 
               <br />
               hitting the ﬁshermen pretty hard. Well, he said he 
               <br />
               would take it up and see whatcould be done about 
               <br />
               it. He went into it and a month or so afterwards I 
               <br />
               happened to go down to Mr. Halfyard‘s and Sir 
               <br />
               Richard was there, and he told me there was 
               <br />
               nothing could be done about it because of the 
               <br />
               local industries... We could have been putting 
               <br />
               one million barrels of herring into Europe. Now 
               <br />
               suppose that one million barrels only gave the 
               <br />
               fishermen perhaps $5 a barrel, what would it have 
               <br />
               meant to this country during the depression? Ac—

               <br />
               country, but according to what I have heard there 
               <br />
               were some boots and shoes imported into this 
               <br />
               country from Czechoslovakia; and children’s 
               <br />
               shoes could have been laid down here for 80 cents 
               <br />
               a pair, women’s for $1 and men’s for $1.20.

               We are not ashamed of anything we have done

               <br />
               facts, but we have no power at all. I believe the

               Referring to the tobacco factory. I was here in 
               <br />
               St. John’s in 1942 when one of the Commis- 
               <br />
               sioners came back from overseas and spoke for 
               <br />
               the boys, and asked people to give money to send 
               <br />
               them smokes. At the price we were paying for 
               <br />
               cigarettes it looked all right. I had been used to 
               <br />
               going to St. Pierre to buy Gem cigarettes for 60 
               <br />
               cents a carton, but this gentleman appealing for 
               <br />
               smokes for the boys — Wings, one of the 
               <br />
               cheapest cigarettes in the world —-— says, “You 
               <br />
               can buy these cigarettes for$1 .20 a carton", when 
               <br />
               the merchant in St. Pierre could buy them here 
               <br />
               and freight them to St. Pierre and sell them for 60 
               <br />
               cents a carton. I am wondering if the honourable 
               <br />
               gentleman had shares in the tobacco factory. This 
               <br />
               is one of the reason why the cost of living is as it 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is.</span> I am not going to take up any more time on

               this. I am not against local industries, I believe 
               <br />
               we should have more, but let us produce what we 
               <br />
               can produce cheapest, and sell to the people who 
               <br />
               can manufacture cheapest, so that the cost of
