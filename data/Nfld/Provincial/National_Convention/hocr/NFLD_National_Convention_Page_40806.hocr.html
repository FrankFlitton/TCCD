               country will stand this lack of planning and

               Mr. Chairman, a depression is forecast by our 
               <br />
               members; just when, even the most pessimistic 
               <br />
               souls are not able to state. I wish to ask the

               member for Bonavista Centre if he considers that 
               <br />
               from the whole world, this small island of ours is 
               <br />
               to be singled out for starvation? Any fool knows 
               <br />
               that the economy of any country fluctuates from 
               <br />
               time to time. In the event of international crisis, 
               <br />

               bread lines as before, are other countries to be 
               <br />
               spared them? Mr. Butt put forward what I con-

               sider to be a concrete fact when he stated that in 
               <br />
               economic spheres, material possessions may 
               <br />
               have more bearing on a country’s prosperity than 
               <br />
               existent dollars. The value of the materials New~ 
               <br />
               foundland possesses has increased beyond doubt; 
               <br />

               Mr. Fudge Mr. Chairman, before recess there 
               <br />
               was a point or two on which I felt that I should 
               <br />
               comment, and that is in connection with our ﬁsh. 
               <br />
               Our trouble with ﬁsh is caused by our customers 
               <br />
               in Europe who trade in sterling, and the inability 
               <br />
               of Great Britain to convert the sterling into dol— 
               <br />
               lars. This of course applies also to the woods 
               <br />
               situation. As far as the woods are concerned, I 
               <br />
               regret that the cut for this year is very near <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com~</span> 
               <br />
               pleted, but I think it is only fair that I should 
               <br />
               explain as best I can why it is that the cut is up so 
               <br />
               soon. It is because of the fact that due to a poor 
               <br />
               ﬁshery we have had such a ﬂow of men to the 
               <br />
               woods as we have not had for years and years, 
               <br />
               with the result that two weeks ago, in one week’s 
               <br />
               cutting, Bowaters had 27,000 cords of wood cut 
               <br />
               and piled. The like was never known before in 
               <br />
               their history. It must be understood that the 
               <br />
               forests cannot stand that...
