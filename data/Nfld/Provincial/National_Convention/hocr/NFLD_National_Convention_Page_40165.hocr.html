               million dollars on those school buildings; I have 
               <br />
               no doubt that is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessary,</span> We spent $15,000

               additional in the training of teachers. Is that a 
               <br />
               proper proportion? I do not know. If you have a 
               <br />
               good teacher you have a good school; and that 
               <br />
               does not mean it should be a good building. 
               <br />
               During the period, while spending extra amounts 
               <br />
               of money, have we increased the grading and 
               <br />
               standard of our teachers?

               Mr. Hollett The point is one which we did <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con~</span>

               sider, but we did not go into the various points 
               <br />
               you mention. We took it for granted that the 
               <br />
               Convention knew what is being done along the 
               <br />
               lines of health and nutrition in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schools,</span> We came 
               <br />
               to the conclusion that education has made very 
               <br />
               real progress That is something about which it is 
               <br />
               very difﬁcult to bring in facts. As for patriotism, 
               <br />
               that is instilled into children before they read or 
               <br />
               write. We are not saying it is like we should see 
               <br />
               it, but we realise that education is something 
               <br />
               which cannot be controlled by the thought of any 
               <br />
               one particularindividual. Education is something 
               <br />
               which grows by the instinct and ability, both 
               <br />
               financially and morally, of the people. We will 
               <br />
               not therefore give our personal views of the term. 
               <br />
               I don’t know if that answers the question.

               Mr. Butt I don’t want to be misunderstood, but 
               <br />
               I know the people in the education department 
               <br />
               very well. I believe very strongly that we have 
               <br />
               made real progress. I feel also that these people 
               <br />
               are doing a remarkably good job, and I am im- 
               <br />
               pressed with their sincerity. That is a correct 
               <br />
               statement; but the point I want to know is, are 
               <br />
               there main lines that you could have considered? 
               <br />
               For instance teachers’ grades, how far have you 
               <br />
               gone with that? I am not interested in particular 
               <br />
               examples, I am thinking of the main lines that you 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood I believe it was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Butt who

               <br />
               tion with road building. I think he cited an il- 
               <br />
               lustration of how an amateur can be fooled very 
               <br />
               easily by an engineer. Two estimates are made of 
               <br />
               the cost of building a road, one is small and the 
               <br />
               other a much larger amount. The amateur, not

               being equipped with technical knowledge, is 
               <br />
               easily fooled, and I think Mr. Butt’s illustration 
               <br />
               was that $40,000 went down the drain before ever 
               <br />
               a sod was turned because of the estimates. It 
               <br />
               appears that amongst engineers around the world 
               <br />
               the whole job is done by estimates. Well now, 
               <br />
               apply that to this matter of education. I have no 
               <br />
               doubt that there are men in the world today who 
               <br />
               could walk into the Department of Education and 
               <br />
               say, “What’s your total grant for education?" 
               <br />
               “What’s the total of your administrative cost?” 
               <br />
               “What is the total amount of your grant for 
               <br />
               teachers’ salaries?” “What is your total amount 
               <br />
               for this, that, and the other, in percentages?" And 
               <br />
               the minute they hear those percentages they com- 
               <br />
               pare them with a dozen or maybe 20 countries 
               <br />
               around the world, and, if they are trained they 
               <br />
               know if these are correct percentages or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not..,,</span> I 
               <br />
               would think that, after having spent some years 
               <br />
               in the department, Mr. Butt would have a general 
               <br />
               familiarity with that kind of thing, but I don’t 
               <br />
               think the Education Committee felt competent to 
               <br />
               approach the matter in that regard. There may be 
               <br />
               a dozen men in this Convention today who can 
               <br />
               blow holes in this report, and I know there are 
               <br />
               many men outside the Convention who can riddle 
               <br />
               it properly, and outside the country there are 
               <br />
               educators and professional educationalists who 
               <br />
               would make it look like monkey work. Unfor~ 
               <br />
               tunately we have not got that kind of training. We 
               <br />
               could only look at it as amateurs, ordinary New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders, in the light of how many school 
               <br />
               buildings, how many rooms, the cost of upkeep 
               <br />
               and the probable future cost, etc.

               These matters touch me closely. I feel very 
               <br />
               prejudiced on it. I have a deep suspicion of any 
               <br />
               attempt on the part of any country or government 
               <br />
               to use the schools for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">propaganda.</span> Hitler did that, 
               <br />

               government should foot the bills and then hands

               off. Least of all do I want our education system 
               <br />
               to be used for matters of propaganda, except 
               <br />
               maybe in the matter of health, and in that the
