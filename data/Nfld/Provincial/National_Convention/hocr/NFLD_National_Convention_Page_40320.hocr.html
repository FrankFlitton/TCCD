               Mr. Hickman To my knowledge. Here again 
               <br />
               there is one case brought up in the Committee. 
               <br />
               Some years ago the question of biscuits was 
               <br />
               brought up and we discovered that the fancy 
               <br />
               biscuits brought in here sold for 85 cents a pound. 
               <br />
               The local people bought them out and the im- 
               <br />
               ported ones were reduced to 45 cents a pound 
               <br />
               immediately. There are certain instances like that 
               <br />
               that we recommend there be a thorough study <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on.</span> 
               <br />
               I think that the sweeping statement you made 
               <br />
               should be left until the true picture is brought out. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I am trying to bring a plea to 
               <br />
               have the facts brought out. I don’t say the Com- 
               <br />
               mittee can do it, but I am only pleading that it be 
               <br />
               done, and let us know where we stand. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Penney I have served on the Local In- 
               <br />
               dustries Board, and I did not intend to have a 
               <br />
               word to say. I prefer to sit back and listen until 
               <br />
               the report at least is read; but I have listened to 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood bawling until our eardrums are 
               <br />
               ready to burst, and if I had my way I would have 
               <br />
               the microphones ﬁred out of this room today and 
               <br />
               save the people from having to listen to all this. 
               <br />
               Local industries made the United States and 
               <br />
               Canada, and are helping to make Newfoundland; 
               <br />
               and in the town where I come from they help 
               <br />
               support a good number of people, and no man 
               <br />
               should attack them. The tariff question is another 
               <br />
               matter altogether, and in our report, where we had 
               <br />
               doubt about the question of tariff we asked the 
               <br />
               Convention to investigate. Common courtesy 
               <br />
               would expect members to listen to the whole 
               <br />
               report before they make any loud attacks on 
               <br />
               industries as a whole.

               Mr. Smallwood I'am son'y if I have offended 
               <br />
               Mr. Penney. I hope that on reflection he will agree 
               <br />
               that I have not attacked local industries. I have 
               <br />
               not done so. I have attacked tariff protection of 
               <br />
               them. In the very fine and historic town from 
               <br />
               which Mr. Penney comes, Carbonear, they have 
               <br />
               a very ﬁne industry over there, but it is not 
               <br />
               protected. It is a magniﬁcent wood industry, and 
               <br />
               is one of the industries that are natural to the 
               <br />
               country. The raw material is here and you don’t 
               <br />
               need any tariff <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">protection.</span> Take for instance your 
               <br />
               paper industry, that is not protected, on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con“</span> 
               <br />
               trary there is a customs duty on many things that

               <br />
               no protective tariff, but they have to pay duty on 
               <br />
               the things that go into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> The industry Mr. Penney 
               <br />
               refers to is not only not protected, but it is hurt 
               <br />
               because they have to pay duty on some of their 
               <br />
               raw material. I say take off the duty and give that 
               <br />
               industry a better chance than it has. I am sorry 
               <br />
               that I bawled. I can’t change my voice any more 
               <br />
               than Mr. Penney can change the shape of his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nose.</span> 
               <br />
               I can’t help it.

               only a few days ago one of our industries is up 
               <br />
               for a higher tariff? They want to put 50% more 
               <br />
               on our fish, and you advocate free trade when the 
               <br />
               United States is advocating a higher rate of duty
