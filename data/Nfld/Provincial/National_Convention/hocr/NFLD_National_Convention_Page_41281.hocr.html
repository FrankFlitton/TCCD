               historic portion. We have been witness in our 
               <br />
               time to a great movement of the minds of men 
               <br />
               that’s already come to have some effect upon the 
               <br />
               economics we live by and that cannot but have 
               <br />
               further considerable effect upon the shape of 
               <br />
               things economic in this land. But before I go on 
               <br />
               to relate these proposed arrangements for the 
               <br />
               entry of Newfoundland into confederation to all 
               <br />
               that, let me say this.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               During all the days of this Convention, Mr. 
               <br />
               Newell and myself have gone out of our way at 
               <br />
               times to emphasise and italicise and reiterate the 
               <br />
               economics. We have hammered away at the 
               <br />
               theme of three square meals a day, and a decent 
               <br />
               suit of clothes on the back, and a tight roof over 
               <br />
               the head, every time that we have had our mouths 
               <br />
               open. Maybe we’ve overdone it, But I doubt that 
               <br />
               in this land such a theme can be overdone. I know 
               <br />
               that more often than not we have not said the 
               <br />
               proper things. But then, the thoughts that one has 
               <br />
               had holed up for the night in a tilt on the trail to 
               <br />
               Flower’s Cove, or wallowing around the bill of 
               <br />
               Cape St. George in a lobster smack, have not been 
               <br />
               particularly proper thoughts either. And the mere 
               <br />
               shift of scene to the National Convention has not 
               <br />
               been anything like enough to stifle that. We have 
               <br />
               had a long association, Mr. Newell and l, with the 
               <br />
               men of this island whose overalls reek with the 
               <br />
               salt of the fish ﬂakes, the manure of the barnyard, 
               <br />
               and the resin of the pulpwoods, and it has not 
               <br />
               been particularly conducive to the mouthing of 
               <br />
               platitudes. If at times we have sounded somewhat 
               <br />
               bitter, I hope that we haven’t, but if we have, then 
               <br />
               that has been because we have sometimes seen 
               <br />
               such sights as a whole family curled up for a 
               <br />
               winter’s night in a circle around the fire, or on the 
               <br />
               floor of a tar-paper shack; or a mother cooking 
               <br />
               for her children a dinner of pancakes of sour— 
               <br />
               dough on top of a sawed-off oil drum that served 
               <br />
               as a stove, or because, to quote Mr. Newell, “I 
               <br />
               saw death and hunger on a barren coastline/The 
               <br />
               empty cupboard and the lean winter —— IBut 
               <br />

               <br />
               we said things that have rankled, don’t think that 
               <br />
               they were dreamed up in an easy chair before a 
               <br />
               comfortable ﬁre, because they weren’t; and don’t

               Now, the great movement of the minds of men 
               <br />
               to which I refer has been a movement ofthe 
               <br />
               minds of men to the left; and this movement has 
               <br />
               had repercussions in the economies of most 
               <br />
               countries, including our own. All the days of all 
               <br />
               our lives, this movement of the mass of men to 
               <br />
               the left has been going <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on.</span> Sometimes it has been 
               <br />
               a dribble, sometimes a torrent. With some it has 
               <br />
               been a matter of honest, intellectual conviction 
               <br />
               that that is the way that they should go; with most, 
               <br />
               it has been merely a matter of hoping to be cut in 
               <br />
               for a larger slice of the cake to be divided among 
               <br />
               the numbers of the nation. Indeed, irrespective of 
               <br />
               what may have driven the pundits to the left, it 
               <br />
               has been the hope of more bread and more lavish 
               <br />
               circuses that has enticed the people. Inevitably 
               <br />
               there has been class conﬂict over the division of 
               <br />
               the cake. In some countries this has led to bitter 
               <br />
               class warfare resulting in the elimination of the 
               <br />
               older aristocracies and the setting up of a new 
               <br />
               aristocracy ruling in the name of the proletariat. 
               <br />
               Just how much of the cake the proletariat has 
               <br />
               come to be cut in for in consequence of all this, 
               <br />
               however, seems rather problematic. Every now 
               <br />
               and then there are disquieting rumours out of 
               <br />
               Russia, for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">instance.</span> Other peoples have settled 
               <br />
               for less than the dictatorship of the proletariat and 
               <br />
               are content, for the moment at any rate, with 
               <br />
               social security legislation calculated to improve 
               <br />
               the economic condition of low income groups. 
               <br />
               Scarcely a country but has in our own time made 
               <br />
               provision for a wider distribution of the cake. 
               <br />
               That is why you have workmen’s compensation, 
               <br />
               minimum wage legislation, unemployment in— 
               <br />
               surance, widows’ pensions, family allowances 
               <br />
               and all the rest of it. These are things that 
               <br />
               everyone has come to take for granted in the 
               <br />
               countries where they have them, or to look for in 
               <br />
               the countries where they haven’ t. Sol say that the
