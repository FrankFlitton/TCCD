               being civil servants of the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada. Now what Mr. Fogwill wants to know is 
               <br />
               this: who pays the pension of such a man in 
               <br />
               respect of the period that he worked for the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland govemment?.... The answer is the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland government pays it. Now second, 
               <br />
               about this deduction. You will notice that the 
               <br />
               word is “may”. If the Government of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New‘</span> 
               <br />
               foundland fails to pay the proper pension to a civil 
               <br />
               service pensioner that is his due, his right. that he 
               <br />
               earned by working for the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               government, then in order that that civil servant 
               <br />
               will not lose his pension rights for the period that 
               <br />
               he worked for the Newfoundland government, if 
               <br />
               the Newfoundland government does not pay his 
               <br />
               pension, then the Canadian government will; but 
               <br />
               it will deduct the amount from the subsidies they 
               <br />
               are expected to pay the Newfoundland govem- 
               <br />
               ment. It is not deposited in the civil servants’ 
               <br />
               pensions fund in Canada, because it is an actual 
               <br />
               pension. Have I made that clear? 
               <br />

               Mr. Fogwill I look upon it from a different light, 
               <br />
               for this reason: there is no doubt that there would 
               <br />
               be civil servants in the Government of New- 
               <br />
               foundland today rather up in age, we will say, and 
               <br />
               if they were 56 or 57 years old, would not be able 
               <br />
               to come under the beneﬁts of the Civil Service 
               <br />
               Pension Act of Canada, if they became civil 
               <br />
               servants of Canada...

               Mr. Fogwill Because of the fact that they would 
               <br />
               not attain the ten years service which is required. 
               <br />
               It does not matter to me very much, but in sum- 
               <br />
               ming up the situation of those people in the civil 
               <br />
               service today who will be taken over by Canada 
               <br />
               in the event of union, that number amounts to 
               <br />
               1,168, and the total payroll is $1,744,000. If we 
               <br />
               compute that into the average rate it would be 
               <br />
               approximately $1,000 per person. Now then, if 
               <br />
               they were taken over by the civil service of 
               <br />

               <br />
               vice fund at 5%, which is the lowest rate, that 
               <br />
               would amount to $87,208.

               <br />

               <br />
               a few years ago; nevertheless 1 would assume that

               the total years of service on these employees 
               <br />

               <br />
               vative, because I know many people who have 30

               $1,046, therefore we have got to make provision 
               <br />
               in this provincial budget, where you have 
               <br />

               lay down in your budget. Mr. Smallwood, a sum 
               <br />
               of $1 ,046,000. You can lay it down yearly, or you 
               <br />
               can lay it down in one sum. if you lay it down for 
               <br />
               an eight year period you have to lay down 
               <br />
               $130,000 for each year.

               Mr. Smallwood That‘s very interesting. We 
               <br />
               went into that at considerable length in one ofour 
               <br />
               committees in Ottawa. It struck me at one time 
               <br />
               that it might pay the government of the province 
               <br />
               to do exactly what Mr. Fogwill has suggested 
               <br />
               might be done, lay out the capital sum from the 
               <br />
               surplus and in that way wipe out at one blow the 
               <br />
               province’s liability for civil servants’ service 
               <br />
               pensions. That would be one way to do it, but, as 
               <br />
               we have got an amount of $200,000 a year in 
               <br />
               those estimates ofmine, and as civil service pen- 
               <br />
               sioners gradually die, we will ﬁnally reach a peak 
               <br />
               and then the peak will begin to fall, but it won’t 
               <br />
               be half $200,000. It will gradually as he says, 
               <br />
               begin to fall, so that the $200,000 a year covers 
               <br />
               it.... If Mr. Fogwill would like sometime to have 
               <br />
               a debate on the superannuation and pension 
               <br />
               schemes of Canadian civil servants I would be 
               <br />
               highly pleased to have it. it is one of the very 
               <br />
               ﬁnest. When a civil servant in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               gets a pension, when he dies then his pension dies 
               <br />
               too; but not in Canada, it goes on to his wife and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">children...</span> The point to remember is this. John 
               <br />
               Jones is now working in any post ofﬁce. We 
               <br />
               become a province, and Canada takes over the 
               <br />
               Department of Posts and Telegraphs. so Jones 
               <br />
               becomes an employee of the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada, so then he gets pensioned. The Govern- 
               <br />
               ment of Canada pays his pension out of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pen»</span> 
               <br />
               sion fund, towards which. it is true. he has 
               <br />
               contributed for his 15 years service with them, 
               <br />
               and the Newfoundland government pays his pen— 
               <br />
               sion for the 15 years he worked for them; so he is 
               <br />
               getting a pension from both governments. The 
               <br />
               number of pensioners that the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               government will have to pay for will be going on 
               <br />
