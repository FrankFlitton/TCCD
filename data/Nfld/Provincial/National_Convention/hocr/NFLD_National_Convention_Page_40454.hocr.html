               means to transport its own goods and return with 
               <br />
               other necessary cargoes. This is where we have 
               <br />
               to start today. We had in Australia, in 1908, a 
               <br />
               market for 65,000 quintals of ﬁsh. We lost that. 
               <br />
               The Norwegians and Icelanders were putting into 
               <br />
               the English market at that time their soft—cured 
               <br />
               ﬁsh, 18 hogsheads to the 100 quintals, we were 
               <br />
               putting in Labrador and Strait Shore cured ﬁsh, 
               <br />
               13 hogsheads to the 100 quintals, seven days sun. 
               <br />
               A ﬁsh that held up and sold itself wherever it 
               <br />
               went. That ﬁsh was the kind of ﬁsh that went to 
               <br />
               Australia, and every Australian who could get 
               <br />
               ﬁsh for tea Sunday evening had it. They called it 
               <br />
               Newfoundland tea <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁsh,</span> Messrs. Munn, Baine 
               <br />
               Johnston and Job started that time what we called 
               <br />
               the Labrador slop. Ships came out from England 
               <br />
               with coal, discharged here, were not cleaned out, 
               <br />
               had no inspection, and went north and loaded at 
               <br />
               Grey Island and down the coast. The ﬁsh was 
               <br />
               stowed in bulk, no cask, I helped load them. This 
               <br />
               ﬁsh went across and was shipped to Australia, 
               <br />
               and by 1913 not one ﬁsh was eaten in Australia. 
               <br />
               First the ﬁsh was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">softvcured</span> and could not stand 
               <br />
               the handling, then it was stowed in bulk with sand 
               <br />
               from the men’s shoes, coal dust from the stringers 
               <br />
               and other dirt and nobody would buy it. Brokers 
               <br />
               in towns in Australia took a beating of at least 
               <br />
               $4,000 on a single shipment. That is how we lost 
               <br />
               one market. 
               <br />
               We had quite a market in the west of England. 
               <br />
               I believe Mr. Goodridge knows how we lost that 
               <br />
               market during the ﬁrst world war. In the cities of 
               <br />
               Bristol, Exeter and Taunton, Newfoundland 
               <br />
               ' shore cod was on practically everybody’s table 
               <br />
               for Sunday’s tea. In October, 1917, the wholesale 
               <br />
               house on Broad Quay, Bristol, ﬁnished taking 
               <br />
               Newfoundland cod. It was Labrador slop, toe rag 
               <br />
               they called it. This grocer was 40 years in the 
               <br />
               business. I have shown you how markets were 
               <br />
               lost. I watched them go and talked with the men 
               <br />
               who imported the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁsh.</span> Others I could speak about 
               <br />
               but it is water under the bridge and time forbids 
               <br />
               me, but don’t forget we did not lose those markets 
               <br />
               because people did not want to buy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New«</span>

               foundland ﬁsh, but because we would not send 
               <br />
               them the quality of ﬁsh they required. Speak to 
               <br />
               the average Newfoundlander today and he will 
               <br />
               tell you that the saltﬁsh business is dying; sure it 
               <br />
               is, but handled right, shipped in the right type of 
               <br />
               ship, and stored in the right kind of stores in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, and you would sell 4 million 
               <br />
               quintals. The market is unlimited if marketed the 
               <br />
               right way, and it is one of the most expensive 
               <br />
               foods in the world. In the south I have never paid 
               <br />
               less than 50 cents a pound for cod in my life — 
               <br />
               58 cents in Montevideo in 1911, 63 cents in 
               <br />
               Panama in 1935, 32 cents in Bristol in 1914. 
               <br />
               There was a profit somewhere and anybody 
               <br />
               living in a tropical or semi-tropical country wants 
               <br />
               saltfish. I referred to the market we lost in 
               <br />
               Australia. We can get that market back when 
               <br />
               things settle down and the world gets back to 
               <br />
               normal. Now we cannot sell ﬁsh to Australia for 
               <br />
               cash because the rate of exchange is against us, 
               <br />
               but this is the way we can turn that cheap money 
               <br />
               to our advantage... First we have to ﬁnd at least 
               <br />
               four ships to do three jobs, seal ﬁshery, refrigera- 
               <br />
               tion for carrying perishable goods and other car- 
               <br />
               goes, built and owned by the country, operated 
               <br />
               by a shipping board like the Fisheries Board... 
               <br />
               By building those four ships it would be possible 
               <br />
               to operate in the trade of the island all the year 
               <br />
               around, and, under the direction of the shipping 
               <br />
               and ﬁsheries boards, all classes of exporters in- 
               <br />
               cluding the co-operatives would be able to avail 
               <br />
               of their services. They would be able to take any 
               <br />
               kind of a cargo, mixed or otherwise, anywhere in 
               <br />
               the world. They would not only be able to bring 
               <br />
               in the pelts from the ice but they would be able 
               <br />
               to bring in the meat as well. With cold storage 
               <br />
               facilities we could have seal meat all the year 
               <br />
               around. Perhaps we could ﬁnd a market for this 
               <br />
               meat in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">future“.</span> I see nothing improbable in 
               <br />
               this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">idea.</span> If the money that was put into the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland Hotel had been put into ships of 
               <br />
               this type at the time the hotel was built, it is 
               <br />
               probable that the ships would not be showing a 
               <br />
               deﬁcit such as the hotel <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is.1</span> If we had had the 
               <br />
               ships 1 have described, and a flour and feed mill, 
               <br />
               we could probably have created a market for 
               <br />
               about 100,000 quintals in Australia. They have 
               <br />
               nearly 6 million people and they have the wheat, 
               <br />
               wool, meat and dairy products that we need...
