               But getting back to my case history Mr. Chair- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">man,</span> I studied the story of Newfoundland, and I 
               <br />
               drew my own conclusions. So much so that in 
               <br />
               1943, when I made my first public address -— a 
               <br />
               toast to Newfoundland -— the sum and substance 
               <br />
               of my belief was contained in one sentence; that 
               <br />
               as far as I was concerned, “the miracle of New- 
               <br />
               foundland was not that so little had been done 
               <br />
               here, but so much.” The Amulree Report, with its 
               <br />
               condemnation of our public men, became the 
               <br />
               textbook of all those whose intention, deliberate 
               <br />
               or otherwise, was to damn with faint praise all 
               <br />
               responsible governments of Newfoundland be- 
               <br />
               cause it was the fashion. I think the attitudes of 
               <br />
               many Newfoundlanders to our former public 
               <br />
               men, especially those who should have known 
               <br />
               better, can be best summed up in a portion of the 
               <br />
               Gospel according to St. John: “They shall put you 
               <br />
               out of the synagogues; yea, the hour cometh, that 
               <br />
               whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth a 
               <br />
               service to God." And my own attitude on the 
               <br />
               radio, six times a week as Mr. Smallwood did 
               <br />
               before me, is contained in the two verses that 
               <br />
               immediately precede that portion I have quoted: 
               <br />
               “He shall give testimony of me; and you shall 
               <br />
               give testimony, because you are with me from the 
               <br />
               beginning. These things I have spoken to you, 
               <br />
               that you may not be scandalised.” 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               No, Mr. Chairman, there was no excuse for the 
               <br />
               suspension of responsible government in this 
               <br />
               country. No method of cure could be as drastic as 
               <br />
               that for whatever ills beset us. They cut the legs 
               <br />
               from under us and still expected us to walk and 
               <br />
               to advance. If one could strain a point and ﬁnd an 
               <br />
               excuse for the suspension of responsible govem- 
               <br />
               ment it might lie perhaps in the words of Com- 
               <br />
               missioner Lodge, just quoted: “To have assumed 
               <br />
               responsibility for the good government of New- 
               <br />
               foundland out of altruistic motives and to have 
               <br />
               achieved economic rehabilitation might have 
               <br />
               cost the British taxpayer a few millions. It would,

               however, have added to the prestige of the British

               What did happen? From 1934 to 1940 this 
               <br />
               country, this people, suffered privation the like of 
               <br />
               which was never known in her history. I was a 
               <br />
               civil servant from 1937 to 1941, in the Depart— 
               <br />
               ment of Public Health and Welfare. Every day 
               <br />
               there passed through my hands, as through the 
               <br />
               hands of many others, the harrowing story of the 
               <br />
               misery, distress, sickness and death; the Geth- 
               <br />
               semane, as someone already has said in here, of 
               <br />
               an entire people. I say there was a reason, too, for 
               <br />
               that — the absence of our traditional democratic 
               <br />
               institutions. Do you expect me to believe, that 
               <br />
               had Newfoundland retained the parliamentary 
               <br />
               system of responsible government that this 
               <br />
               country would have had to wallow in squalor and 
               <br />
               despair until a war brought unheard-of wealth to 
               <br />
               the island? Do you really believe that New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders elected by their fellow-New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders would sit indifferent to the cries and 
               <br />
               demands of the electorate? Do you think they 
               <br />
               would give away parts of our territory for 99 
               <br />
               years, without seeking and demanding something 
               <br />
               in return? But there is no need to go on, you know 
               <br />
               the answer as well as I do. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I fully agree with Mr. Smallwood, that Com- 
               <br />
               mission of Government is not a right or per- 
               <br />
               manent form of government for the people of this 
               <br />
               country; but I cannot agree that responsible 
               <br />
               government is so full of the doom and disaster 
               <br />
               that he now so ardently declares it will be for 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. In 1934 Mr. Smallwood was 
               <br />
               older than I am now, and the Who’s Who of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland declares with respect to Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood, that he was an ardent supporter of 
               <br />
               the commission form of government in the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               few years of its career. Thereafter he realised his 
               <br />
               error and become one of its stoutest opponents, 
               <br />
               and as has been pointed out, up to a few years ago, 
               <br />
               was the most redoubtable protagonist and booster 
               <br />
               of the return of Newfoundland to responsible 
               <br />
               government. I honestly believe that Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood in that role did more than most people 
               <br />
               to create the vague stirrings for national <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inde«</span> 
               <br />
               pendence which in recent years developed to a 
               <br />
               strong demand in many sections of the island. 
               <br />
               Surely, it seems fair to ask, why wasn’t union 
               <br />
               with another country suggested then either by Mr.
