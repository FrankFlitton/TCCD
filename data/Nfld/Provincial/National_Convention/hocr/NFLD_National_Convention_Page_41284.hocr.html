               effort. without disorder, without upheaval,

               without injury to the essential character of our

               national institutions. But if we won’t try it, don’t

               sounding like Jeremiah helping Cassandra with

               her homework. It has not been my intention to try 
               <br />

               <br />
               indicate a signiﬁcant phenomenon of our times, 
               <br />
               in consequence of which our economy will come 
               <br />
               to be changed. In that regard there is this that I 
               <br />
               can say in favour of these proposed arrangements 
               <br />
               for union. They meet the inevitable half-way. I 
               <br />
               hope that the change that must come will be 
               <br />
               accomplished without class conﬂict and social 
               <br />
               unrest. It can be, given the will. Economic 
               <br />
               security and political liberty are not incom- 
               <br />
               patible. I think that a satisfactory synthesis of the 
               <br />
               two can be achieved, to which the Christian con- 
               <br />
               science can subscribe. In our instance, the cause 
               <br />
               of peace and happiness, and the dignity of life in 
               <br />
               this land, will best be served if we go forward into 
               <br />
               the future prepared and ready to put in the way of 
               <br />
               the common man a larger slice of the cake that is 
               <br />
               ours to share. Indeed, only if the like be done all 
               <br />
               over the world, can mankind hope to see restored 
               <br />
               and kept inviolate the temple of human freedom 
               <br />

               Now, gentlemen of the National Convention, 
               <br />
               we go on to the last theme of all, to the recom- 
               <br />
               mendation of forms of government to appear 
               <br />
               upon the ballot, and a page of history is waiting 
               <br />
               to be written. A page of history is waiting to be 
               <br />
               written by the people of Newfoundland too. As 
               <br />
               they turn to face the greatest challenge that has 
               <br />
               ever been theirs to face, as they come to the 
               <br />
               making of the greatest decision that has ever been 
               <br />
               theirs to make, I should like to repeat for their 
               <br />
               guidance and their consolation the words with 
               <br />
               which His Majesty the King concluded his ﬁrst 
               <br />
               wartime Christmas broadcast: “And I said to the 
               <br />
               man who stood at the gate of the year, ‘Give me 
               <br />
               a light, that going forth into the darkness I may 
               <br />
               know whither it is I go. And he said to me, ‘Go 
               <br />
               out into the unknown and put your hand into the 
               <br />
               hand of God, and that shall be to you better than

               debate is now drawing to a close, and I want to 
               <br />
               say a few words just so that my silence might not 
               <br />

               <br />
               deeply impressed, as one of the Ottawa delega- 
               <br />
               tion, by the warm and sincere reception we got in 
               <br />
               Canada. From the time we stepped ashore in 
               <br />
               North Sydney, all we met was kindness and sin- 
               <br />
               cerity. It was very plain to see that the Govern— 
               <br />
               ment of Canada was very glad to have us visit 
               <br />
               them, as I know they will be glad to have New— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">foundland.</span> It is very plain that they would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wel-.</span> 
               <br />
               come Newfoundland into their family of 
               <br />
               provinces. This feeling was not conﬁned to mem— 
               <br />
               bers of the government, all the public men of all 
               <br />
               political parties were very glad to see us and to 
               <br />
               make us welcome. I’m sure that my friend Mr. 
               <br />
               Higgins will remember the delightful evenings 
               <br />
               we spent at the home of the leader of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opposi»</span> 
               <br />
               tion, Mr. Bracken... In every way possible the 
               <br />
               people and the Government of Canada made us 
               <br />
               welcome. Before we left Ottawa, we had all come 
               <br />
               to feel that we were among friends. There was no 
               <br />
               gulf between us, except for the Cabot Strait of 
               <br />
               course, just friendly and sincere understanding 
               <br />
               all the time. Whatever the people may do in the 
               <br />
               referendum this spring, the members of the Ot- 
               <br />
               tawa delegation, that clever and austere body of 
               <br />
               men, will always remember the kind friendships 
               <br />
               that we met in Ottawa. 1 thinkl can also say, Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, that we were surprised almost every 
               <br />
               day by the knowledge that these Canadians 
               <br />
               showed of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland.</span> I can assure you that 
               <br />
               we didn’t have to go up to Ottawa to tell them 
               <br />
               anything about Newfoundland, because they 
               <br />
               knew all about it before we went. This book on 
               <br />
               Newfoundland by Dr. MacKay is a master- 
               <br />
               piece... They had studied our country, our trade 
               <br />
               and industries, and they certainly had an excel- 
               <br />
               lent knowledge of the country.
