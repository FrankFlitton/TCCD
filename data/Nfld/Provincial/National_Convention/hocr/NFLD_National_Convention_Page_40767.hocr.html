               Take the matter of the fundamental character 
               <br />
               of our economy. It is still preponderantly an 
               <br />
               export economy. The national income is still for 
               <br />
               the most part derived from the sale of staple 
               <br />
               commodities abroad. But it so happens that the 
               <br />
               world today is temporarily more congenial to the 
               <br />
               well—being of an export economy than it has been 
               <br />
               for a long time. With the reconstruction of Europe 
               <br />
               to be accomplished, and a world—wide shortage 
               <br />
               of consumer goods to be ﬁlled, one would im~ 
               <br />
               agine that world demand for staple products will 
               <br />
               not be satisﬁed in a short time. So for the future 
               <br />
               there is some consolation in that. There is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com</span> 
               <br />
               solation too in the strengthening of our economy 
               <br />
               through the diversification that has been 
               <br />
               achieved in the ﬁshing industry and in a lesser 
               <br />
               dependence upon that industry; in the reduction 
               <br />
               of the burden of the public debt; in the increment 
               <br />
               to the national income derived from services 
               <br />
               rendered at the military installations; and in the 
               <br />
               accumulation of not insigniﬁcant national reser- 
               <br />
               ves. These are the major factors that urge us to 
               <br />
               look with hope to the future. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               But if there is reason to be hopeful there is also 
               <br />
               room for doubt. And I am not prepared to avoid 
               <br />
               this just because it may be held to be the proper 
               <br />
               thing to accent the optimistic View. You see, I 
               <br />
               belong to the generation that has never voted. We 
               <br />
               have grown up and come to our maturity without 
               <br />
               beneﬁt of all the tender ministrations of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shibv</span> 
               <br />
               boleth and political poppycock that other genera- 
               <br />
               tions have enjoyed. In consequence, we are far 
               <br />
               less likely than were our fathers to give our 
               <br />
               allegiance to a cause for purely sentimental 
               <br />
               reasons. The mere injunction that we should have 
               <br />
               faith in our country is notenough to scare us away 
               <br />
               from insisting that there is a dark side to the future 
               <br />
               too.

               Two years ago you could hardly get a man in 
               <br />
               this island to do an odd job. There was full 
               <br />
               employment. Wartime construction and the 
               <br />
               withdrawal of men from the economy to enter the 
               <br />
               ﬁghting services were what led to that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">condition,</span> 
               <br />
               It was not a matter of a sudden competency 
               <br />
               having come upon the economy to ﬁnd a niche 
               <br />
               and a living for all. Now the war jobs are over, 
               <br />
               and those who fought are returned. I doubt that 
               <br />
               all returned men have found employment — and

               The Economic Report is hopeful of a continu— 
               <br />
               ing annual revenue for the future of $30 million 
               <br />
               because this year we shall have a revenue of $40 
               <br />
               million. A pious hope, a goodly hope, but never- 
               <br />
               theless a ﬁgure pulled out of thin air. And it might 
               <br />
               just as well have been $20 million or $50 million. 
               <br />
               And if I prefer to contend that the year after next 
               <br />
               our revenue will amount to $50 million, I’d like 
               <br />
               to see anyone in this Convention undertake to 
               <br />
               prove to me that it could not be. It would be a 
               <br />
               most interesting manoeuvre to observe...

               Apropos of that revenue, there are two things 
               <br />
               worthy of mention. One is that it derives in part 
               <br />
               from not-so-efficient business <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">management,</span> 
               <br />
               During the war, goods were in such short supply 
               <br />
               that business ﬁrms began booking orders for this, 
               <br />
               that and the other thing over half the world. 
               <br />
               Orders were duplicated and triplicated and never 
               <br />
               cancelled. This year there has been a flood of 
               <br />
               goods emanating from these orders that should 
               <br />
               have been cancelled but were not. The revenue 
               <br />
               originating from this source may hardly be con- 
               <br />
               strued to have arisen from the normal needs of 
               <br />
               the people. Also there is a great deal of importing 
               <br />
               to satisfy what may be called an abnormal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re</span> 
               <br />
               placement demand. Many things wore out during 
               <br />
               the war years, which due to shortages could not 
               <br />
               be replaced. Indeed, in this island many things 
               <br />
               wore out during the Depression which people 
               <br />
               have only lately come to be in a ﬁnancial position 
               <br />
               to replace. Much current importing is being done 
               <br />
