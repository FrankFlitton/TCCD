               to get down to brass tacks we have to have before

               us an idea of how the Province of Newfoundland

               would operate — what the revenue and what the 
               <br />
               expenditure will be. We are not interested so 
               <br />
               much in how much the federal government is 
               <br />
               going to collect, as how we are going to run the

               province when she goes into confederation. Ot- 
               <br />
               tawa should prepare a proper report. This report 
               <br />
               is incomplete. It does not point out the sources of 
               <br />

               <br />
               does not point out the expenditures we are going 
               <br />
               to have as a province. And until such time as we 
               <br />
               know from a provincial standpoint where we are 
               <br />
               going, we cannot intelligently discuss the whole 
               <br />
               situation. We ought to defer discussion on these 
               <br />
               ﬁgures. They had experts in Canada; who are the 
               <br />
               experts in Newfoundland? Were they consulted 
               <br />
               to corroborate this? It is out at least 20%. i think 
               <br />
               before we go any further we should have a con-

               ference with the Finance Department and the

               If we become a province of Canada, our trade 
               <br />

               <br />
               from what it has been in the past, as regards the 
               <br />
               source of our goods. We have imported in the past 
               <br />
               from the United Kingdom, from Canada, from 
               <br />
               the United States and roughly speaking, take the 
               <br />
               years l900-l938 on the average this country 
               <br />
               imported roughly one-third of its goods from 
               <br />
               each of them. That is in normal times and under 
               <br />
               normal conditions, Newfoundland having her

               Newfoundland as a province becomes an entirely

               different country from the standpoint of tariffs 
               <br />
               and consequently from the standpoint of where 
               <br />
               she buys her <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">goods,</span> With free trade between the 
               <br />
               mainland and Newfoundland, we will naturally 
               <br />
               buy from Canada duty free all that we need that

               any businessman will import from wherever he

               can get them. When he does. he will pay taxation

               and Jones, ....25% is the average rate of duty on

               average duty. Take the same things in Canada and 
               <br />
               take all the imports into the Dominion, and 
               <br />
               what does it run to? 10% as against 25% in

               free... If Newfoundland were a province and any
