               Mr. MacDonald I am afraid I can’t accept Mr. 
               <br />
               Hollett's <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">explanation.</span> This motion distinctly 
               <br />
               gave permission to the Steering Committee to 
               <br />
               prepare a detailed statement of the questions to 
               <br />
               be submitted to His Majesty’s Government. Here 
               <br />
               we have a report practically the same as the 
               <br />
               motion, without any other explanation than that 
               <br />
               which was included in the motion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">itself.</span> If there 
               <br />
               is an explanation I am afraid I can’t accept it. The 
               <br />
               point is, if we are to appoint a delegation to go to 
               <br />
               the United Kingdom, is not this Convention and 
               <br />
               the people of the country entitled to know just 
               <br />
               what the delegation is going for? They are going 
               <br />
               over to consult the home government on the 
               <br />
               public debt. Now the public debt includes quite a 
               <br />
               number of questions. Are you going to the old 
               <br />
               country to say that we would like to have this 
               <br />
               public debtcancelled? All sorts of questions arise 
               <br />
               out of that. I am disappointed that the Steering 
               <br />
               Committee did not go into the questions raised in 
               <br />
               the original motion, and give us some informa- 
               <br />
               tion as to what they are about to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do.</span> It looks as if 
               <br />
               the Steering Committee are asking us to appoint 
               <br />
               a delegation of six and practically give them a 
               <br />
               blank cheque. I think the Convention is entitled 
               <br />
               to know at least the main questions in regard to 
               <br />
               the public debt, or the interest-free loans, or the 
               <br />
               development loans, and the various base deals. Is 
               <br />
               there any information to give this Convention? I 
               <br />
               am very disappointed in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">report.</span> They have 
               <br />
               had somewhere around ten days to discuss this, 
               <br />
               and I think we should have the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">information</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Newell I support the stand taken by Mr. 
               <br />
               MacDonald. I can appreciate the reticence of the 
               <br />
               Steering Committee to broadcast to the world at 
               <br />
               large questions which they do not want everyone 
               <br />
               to know about, but there are a great many ques- 
               <br />
               tions in connection with some of these items that 
               <br />
               have already been talked about so much, and 
               <br />
               broadcast to the world so often, that if the world 
               <br />
               has chosen to listen, it must by now know as 
               <br />
               much about these things as we do. However, the 
               <br />
               main criticism I have is this: if this were a report 
               <br />
               back to this Convention from the Steering Com-

               reception we would get from the Dominions Of—

               fice if we forwarded a communication stating that 
               <br />
               we should like to discuss the public debt, inter- 
               <br />
               est-free loans, development loans, etc. One of the 
               <br />
               members from Grand Falls said that a delegation 
               <br />
               going to England will have to be briefed. Of 
               <br />
               course it will. Presumably the delegation meeting 
               <br />
               us on the other side will also have to be briefed. 
               <br />
               ldon’t imagine they would turn over the Cabinet 
               <br />
               to us for a week or ten <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">days.</span> It is only reasonable 
               <br />
               to suppose that we should know more details 
               <br />
               about the things they are to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discuss.</span> I wish to 
               <br />
               register my disappointment with this report. 
               <br />
               Mr. Keough Mr. Chairman, I thoroughly agree 
               <br />
               with what Mr. MacDonald and Mr. Newell have 
               <br />
               said. This thing here is a hopelessly inadequate 
               <br />
               brieﬁng. As far as I am concerned the leading 
               <br />
               question I want to see asked, the leading question 
               <br />
               as far as Newfoundlanders are concerned is this: 
               <br />
               is the British government prepared to entertain 
               <br />
               the idea of a return of Commission of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Governv</span> 
               <br />
               merit as it is now, or a modification of it, if a 
               <br />
               number of people in Newfoundland express a 
               <br />
               desire to have it retained? I have no guarantee that 
               <br />
               this question is going to be asked. I want the 
               <br />
               delegation to be able to answer “Yes" or “No” to 
               <br />
               that question, and under what circumstances. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I would like to draw the atten- 
               <br />
               tion of members to the fact that you have to read 
               <br />
               this detailed statement of matters to be discussed 
               <br />
               with the British government with the resolution 
               <br />
               itself. Is there any further discussion? 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Miller Mr. Chairman, I hope it is not getting 
               <br />
               fashionable, but I really want to offer my word of 
               <br />
               dissatisfaction with the report too. After eight or 
               <br />
               ten days of the Steering Committee working on 
               <br />
               a report, sent out expressly to bring us back a 
               <br />
               detailed report, they come back with a curtailed 
               <br />
               report. Practically the only change in it is when 
               <br />
               they break up one clause and make two out of it, 
               <br />
               and the two clauses have less scope than the first 
               <br />
               one, and that particular clause was a very impor- 
               <br />
               tant one as well. The whole thing, as I see it, is 
               <br />
               the consummation of all the findings of the Con— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vention.</span> I don’t agree with Mr. Hollett when he 
               <br />
               says that those who will proceed to England will
