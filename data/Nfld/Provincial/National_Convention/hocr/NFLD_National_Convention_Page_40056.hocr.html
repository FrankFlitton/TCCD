               Mr. Job I wish to make the following remarks 
               <br />
               on the subject of this Chadwick and Jones report, 
               <br />
               which perhaps for short I may call the white 
               <br />
               paper. I hope there will be many other oppor— 
               <br />
               tunities of referring to it, and on this assumption 
               <br />
               I do not intend to speak at length on it today. It 
               <br />
               has been prepared from our own government 
               <br />
               department records, with a view to giving us a 
               <br />
               preliminary picture of the economic position of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. This document, in my opinion, is 
               <br />
               a deﬁnite <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contribution</span> to our efforts and cannot 
               <br />
               be lightly brushed aside. I believe that a careful 
               <br />
               study of it will help the delegates to get some sort 
               <br />
               of a picture of the government’s economic posi- 
               <br />
               tion, but it is far from providing all the informa- 
               <br />
               tion we will require. A careful study of that 
               <br />
               excellent review entitled <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland.</span> 
               <br />
               Economic, Diplomatic and Strategic Studies, 
               <br />
               edited by R.A. MacKay, of which a copy has 
               <br />
               been furnished to every delegate, will give us a 
               <br />
               still clearer picture. I wish today to brieﬂy call 
               <br />
               attention to two short sentences in this white 
               <br />
               paper, one of which on page 9 reads as follows: 
               <br />
               “The long term prosperity of the Island ultimately 
               <br />
               depends on a ﬂourishing export trade.” The other 
               <br />
               on page 21 reads: “Certain industries run by 
               <br />
               outside concerns bring into the country only suf- 
               <br />
               ficient money to run their operations, but the 
               <br />
               great bulk of earnings from the sale of ﬁsh is 
               <br />
               ploughed back into the economy.” 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Ihave emphasised, and will take every oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity of again emphasising, that the happy state 
               <br />
               of affairs declared to he so vital and desirable by 
               <br />
               those two bright young delegates, Mr. Newell 
               <br />
               and Mr. Keough in their admirable addresses, 
               <br />
               will never be achieved unless and until we are 
               <br />
               assured of a more stable and proﬁtable market for 
               <br />

               <br />
               in the past. Such a market will be available only 
               <br />
               if we take advantage of our strategic position to 
               <br />
               negotiate tariff arrangements with the mother 
               <br />
               country, with Canada and with the United States 
               <br />

               <br />
               with solid backing can get under way with these 
               <br />
               negotiations the better. There is very shortly

               Before closing, Mr. Chairman, I would like to

               <br />
               tion for receipt of this white paper. His address

               was more or less a repetition of some made over 
               <br />
               the radio for months prior to the Convention, and 
               <br />
               I fancy that they amused a great many people and 
               <br />
               perhaps even were helpful in arousing public 
               <br />
               interests in the political situation, but it was not 
               <br />
               the kind of address that should have been 
               <br />
               delivered at this Convention, and I fancy that

               every delegate here will agree with this viewpoint
