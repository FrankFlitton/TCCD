               Mr. Chairman, a party handed me this clipping 
               <br />
               this morning. We are talking furs now, and this 
               <br />
               comes from Ottawa, January 3. “Canada today 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood Point of order. I have barrels of

               clippings from magazines which I would like to 
               <br />

               Mr. Cashin All right. Mr. Starkes asked me 
               <br />
               yesterday what the duty on furs was now. Restric- 
               <br />
               tions have been placed on furs coming in from 
               <br />
               the United States and Canada, and would it be 
               <br />
               information for him to know that there was $10.5 
               <br />
               million worth of fur imported into Canada last 
               <br />
               year from the United States? 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Higgins What is the tax? 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Cashin 10-15% I think. Now in addition to 
               <br />
               that there is a special 25% excise tax on the list. 
               <br />
               These taxes are paid on the wholesale prices, so 
               <br />
               that the consumer pays not only the 8%, but the 
               <br />
               proﬁts that the wholesaler and retailer adds to the 
               <br />
               cost of the goods. The provinces of Saskatchewan 
               <br />
               and Quebec have a provincial sales tax. Now 
               <br />
               there is another tax, in addition to the 8%. For 
               <br />
               example, in Montreal the purchase of a suit of 
               <br />
               clothes involves 8% federal tax, and 4% provin- 
               <br />
               cial tax, and the purchase of a ﬁsherman’s net — 
               <br />
               Ihave been in this house and heard it all over the 
               <br />
               country: “Lines and twines should be free", and 
               <br />
               they are, in this country, but in Canada it involves 
               <br />
               8% and 4% tax.... We were going to have no 
               <br />
               taxes; it would make you sick! 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now another matter was brought to my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">atten«</span> 
               <br />
               tion since I left this chamber yesterday afternoon, 
               <br />
               and I am not permitted to read the document, so 
               <br />
               I will give it to you to the best of my knowledge. 
               <br />
               When I was talking in connection with the 
               <br />
               balance of our surplus, I referred to the fact that 
               <br />
               if the government has disbursed sterling because 
               <br />
               of the sale of codﬁsh this year, they would have 
               <br />
               $4 million or $5 million left. I had the privilege 
               <br />
               of a drive down to Bonavista, and I must say it is 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
         </div>
         
         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_9" title="bbox 778 188 1317 1878">
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               beautiful country, the people are wonderful, and 
               <br />
               along the way I ﬁnd squid hanging up to dry. 
               <br />
               Squid are sold to the Chinese market, and these 
               <br />
               people were led to believe that the squid would 
               <br />
               be bought from them, but the Chinese buyers 
               <br />
               were unable to ﬁnd the necessary dollars to do so. 
               <br />
               The point I want to make is this: if we have got 
               <br />
               to go into business to convert sterling to buy 
               <br />
               codﬁsh, those people are just as much entitled to 
               <br />
               be able to sell their squid, and the government 
               <br />
               should convert the Chinese money into dollars. 
               <br />
               But they did not, and there are instances in that 
               <br />
               section of the country today where people are 
               <br />
               very badly off, and I just bring that matter up this 
               <br />
               afternoon, not that it means much in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con»</span> 
               <br />
               federation issue. But I think it should be drawn to 
               <br />
               the attention of the country and the government, 
               <br />
               that if they are going to slap our money right and 
               <br />
               left to help out one industry, they have got to do 
               <br />
               it for the others. ,

               This morning I took up the Daily News and 
               <br />
               read the statement made by Mr. Abbott, the 
               <br />
               Finance Minister of Canada, and I read that 
               <br />
               Canada has, at the present time, an adverse 
               <br />
               balance of nearly $9 million, and they anticipate 
               <br />
               that soon it will be $1 billion. What does it mean? 
               <br />
               I pointed out yesterday that this $300 million, that 
               <br />
               they got as a part loan from the United States the 
               <br />

               <br />
               balance of that money has to be found in gold, or 
               <br />
               else they have to restrict their trade with the 
               <br />
               United States, and they are doing that and slap- 
               <br />
               ping embargoes on all kinds of goods to come in 
               <br />
               from the United States, and here’s the country we 
               <br />
               are asked to go into partnership with. In other

               <br />

               permitted to import a fur coat from the United
