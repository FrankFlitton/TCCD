               l %?

               Mr. Hollett I am not a broker; ifI were I would

               Mr. Job It is a lot more that 1/8th of 1%.

               Mr. Smallwood The loss has been more than 
               <br />
               1/8th of 1%, since 1862. That may be so if you 
               <br />
               take the four disasters when 323 lives were lost 
               <br />
               and divide that into 250,000 men, that gives you

               1/8th of 1%. But you can double that since 1862

               Mr. Hollett I feel strongly about this insurance.

               For a good many years I lived in Burin. I was born 
               <br />
               there. That is where men go out to ﬁsh in all
