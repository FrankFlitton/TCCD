               The ﬁgures given are an estimate... 0n the

               average to spend $15,138,000 a year for the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               four years... Now we come to the second four 
               <br />
               years. We start off with $15,138,000, and I add 
               <br />
               to that another $500,000 a year to cover increased 
               <br />
               expenditure and new services, so that on existing 
               <br />
               ordinary expenditures of the government, on 
               <br />
               things that would be provincial if we became a 
               <br />
               province, I have added for the eight years 
               <br />
               $1,258,000, added on per year for the ﬁrst eight 
               <br />

               So that’s the first half of the story, and the 
               <br />
               longest part I may say. The government of the 
               <br />
               Province of Newfoundland would spend, that is 
               <br />
               the money it’s got to get to break even, for the 
               <br />
               first four years of union, average $15,138,000 a 
               <br />
               year, and for the second four years of union it has 
               <br />
               to get $15,600,000 a year, and if it does not get 
               <br />
               it, it cannot balance its budget, it cannot break 
               <br />
               even.... I don’t need to remind you of why I have 
               <br />
               taken eight years, because within eight years of 
               <br />
               union there is to be a complete reassessment, a 
               <br />
               financial review, to see if the subsidies are, or are 
               <br />
               not, enough to enable Newfoundland to pay her 
               <br />
               own way.

               So now we come to the revenue side, to see if 
               <br />
               it is possible and practicable to get that much 
               <br />

               <br />
               $71,600 if we become a province. These items 
               <br />
               are: no. 1, inland revenue stamps $60,000, but 1 
               <br />
