               <br />
               ing with any remarks. I concluded my remarks at 
               <br />
               the time we rose the committee yesterday after- 
               <br />
               noon. One thing I would like to say now: during 
               <br />
               the debate a number of questions came before the 
               <br />
               committee and were directed to the Government 
               <br />
               of Canada. A number of replies arrived yesterday 
               <br />
               and these replies were read. It seems to be 
               <br />
               desirable that these be dealt with in somewhat 
               <br />
               greater detail in committee of the whole than was 
               <br />
               possible in formal session. Two of these were of 
               <br />
               the utmost importance and need to be explained. 
               <br />
               You will remember in the Grey Book, the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada gave its estimate of what 
               <br />
               revenue it would collect, and what money it 
               <br />
               would spend in Newfoundland. Two questions 
               <br />
               were directed to the Government of Canada on 
               <br />
               that estimate: Major Cashin, feeling the Canadian 
               <br />
               government had been conservative on the wrong 
               <br />
               side, they would collect more, and on the other 
               <br />
               hand Mr. Hollett, being dissatisﬁed with one item 
               <br />
               showing what they would spend. We listed the 
               <br />
               various headings under which they would expect 
               <br />
               to spend money here. One of these headings was 
               <br />
               departmental expenditures, $9.4 million. No 
               <br />
               detail was given. Mr. Hollett asked for a break- 
               <br />
               down. They gave it. He read it yesterday after- 
               <br />
               noon. I fear few of us had the opportunity of 
               <br />
               getting the details. I asked them to show us how 
               <br />
               they arrive at the estimate of $20 million a year 
               <br />
               they would expect to collect from the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. In their reply to me, which I read 
               <br />
               out without comment, they gave details. While 
               <br />
               the debate is on, it is highly desirable that both 
               <br />
               answers be repeated, and something done by us 
               <br />
               here to analyse and explain the meaning of the 
               <br />
               two answers. I do not propose to do it at this

               moment.

               <br />
               Mr. Fogwill Since Christmas recess, I have con— 
               <br />
               cemed myself quite a lot with federal taxation, in 
               <br />
               the event of Newfoundland embracing union 
               <br />
               with Canada. We have had quite a debate on 
               <br />
               probable revenues and expenditures. I am not 
               <br />
               concerned with that, although I realise in that 
               <br />
               event we shall have to collect from the people 
               <br />
               probably $6-7 million. WhatI am concerned with 
               <br />
               is the different taxes imposed by the federal 
               <br />
               government. It was laid down in the Black Books, 
               <br />
               on which I received communications and 
               <br />
               answers to questions making inquiry as to the list 
               <br />
               of all the items coming under federal sales tax; 
               <br />
               also regulations in respect of transportation tax. I 
               <br />
               got the information and I have been informed 
               <br />
               what items are covered by the excise tax of 1947. 
               <br />
               During the Christmas recess, I applied the 
               <br />
               general sales tax to all imports coming into New— 
               <br />
               foundland in the ﬁscal year 1946-47. I may be in 
               <br />
               error, if so I will gladly admit it; if I am right, I 
               <br />
               ask members to admit it. I am not intending to 
               <br />
               quote all these taxes. Hams, salt beef, etc., sales 
               <br />
               tax would be $369,000. You have canned beef 
               <br />
               and other products, sales tax $65,458. Tea, sales 
               <br />
               tax $81,366. On confectionery, $52,000. All 
               <br />
               these are federal taxes; they go up the river. 
               <br />
               Boots, clothing, rubber boots, etc., $78,000. 
               <br />
               Tobacco, cigarettes, plug or pipe tobacco, 
               <br />
               $102,000. And so on the sad story goes. The total 
               <br />
               I arrived at, based on ourimports of last year, was 
               <br />
               $3,818,000. That does not take in local manufac- 
               <br />
               turing, which I shall come to by and by.
