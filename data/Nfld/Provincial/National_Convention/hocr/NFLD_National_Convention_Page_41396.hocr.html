               Mr. Bradley My suggestion to Mr. Higgins is

               this, that he alter it to read “That Commission

               <br />

               Mr. Chairman Frankly, I was worried. Mr.

               <br />

               circumstances, it appears now that if I accepted

               <br />

               Mr. Cashin If I might interject a word We met 
               <br />
               in private session and decided all this. I do not 
               <br />
               think there was any intention in Mr. Higgins’ 
               <br />
               motion to preclude any other form of government 
               <br />
               whatever. As a matter of fact, we decided at the 
               <br />
               private meeting we were going to end this tonight 
               <br />
               and the other one was going to start right away. 
               <br />
               You cannot say that there was any scheming or 
               <br />
               any skulduggery intended. I am quite behind the 
               <br />
               idea that we should discuss other forms, and I 
               <br />
               suppose I am probably the most ardent one-form— 
               <br />
               government man in here. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Imust say, frankly, that it never 
               <br />
               occurred to me. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett I want it to be clearly understood, 
               <br />
               as far as this motion is concerned, I never 
               <br />
               bothered about the form until last night when I 
               <br />
               got inquiring into it, and I came to the conclusion 
               <br />
               that if it was passed as such, the introduction of 
               <br />
               any motion on any other form would be ultra 
               <br />
               vires. I tried to explain that to the best of my 
               <br />
               ability. I do not want anyone to insinuate that I or 
               <br />
               anyone else was trying to keep this, that and the 
               <br />
               other form off the ballot paper. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman On the contrary, you went out of 
               <br />
               your way to bring it to my attention. Frankly you 
               <br />
               did me a very great service As a result of what 
               <br />
               was decided last Friday, it did not occur to me 
               <br />
               that there was anything wrong. I was not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bother~</span> 
               <br />
               ing with it at all until Mr. Bradley first drew it to 
               <br />
               my attention and he was followed by you. Since 
               <br />
               that time I have been thinking about it. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins The motion now is, “Be it resolved 
               <br />
               that the National Convention desires to recom- 
               <br />
               mend to the United Kingdom government that the 
               <br />
               following forms of government be placed before 
               <br />
               the people at the proposed referendum, namely: 
               <br />
               1. Responsible government as it existed 
               <br />
               prior to 1934; 
               <br />
               2. Commission of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government,”</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Hickman Do we have to debate that all over 
               <br />
               again? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman No. It is not an amendment, it is 
               <br />
               a substitution. 
               <br />
               Mr. Bradley It is a substitution with the assent 
               <br />
               of the whole House. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Members who have already 
               <br />
               spoken on this motion (with the exception of Mr. 
               <br />
               Higgins who has the right to reply) have no 
               <br />
               further right to speak on the motion. 
               <br />
