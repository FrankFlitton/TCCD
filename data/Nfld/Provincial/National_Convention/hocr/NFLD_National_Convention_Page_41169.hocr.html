               <br />
               but much to create apprehension. Sir, it is not by

               the conditions of 1948 that we must pass judge-

               it as it was, and as they saw it almost 80 years 
               <br />
               ago, and be not too sweeping in our judgement, 
               <br />
               and endeavour to see the present situation from 
               <br />
               every angle, including the question of dollars and

               <br />
               tion to some, but there is more at stake than that. 
               <br />
               I have pointed out the anxiety with which the 
               <br />
               British government pressed for the confederation 
               <br />
               of the North American colonies, and it is obvious 
               <br />
               that this desire was prompted far more by im— 
               <br />
               perial than colonial interests. The opposition in 
               <br />
               the House of Assembly here after the 1869 elec— 
               <br />
               tions expressed it as their main opinion that con- 
               <br />
               federation had been prevented by ﬁrst the studied 
               <br />
               determination of some persons of inﬂuence to 
               <br />
               oppose the desires of Her Majesty’ 5 Government, 
               <br />
               and secondly by the active dissemination of 
               <br />
               Britain, which entirely ignored the true merits of 
               <br />
               the question. And if you want ﬁnal proof that this 
               <br />
               1869 election was principally brought about by 
               <br />
               imperial planning, listen to what Governor Hill 
               <br />
               said at the closing session of the House of As- 
               <br />
               sembly in May, 1870: “Her Majesty’s Govem- 
               <br />
               ment,” he said, ”ever awaits the welfare and 
               <br />
               prosperity of her people, and not only approves 
               <br />
               Confederation of Newfoundland with the 
               <br />
               Dominion, but is anxious for its speedy comple- 
               <br />
               tion”; and I, in the light of all the circumstances 
               <br />
               of our history in the 19th century, say that was 
               <br />
               the main rock on which confederation foundered 
               <br />
               —— the feeling of coercion that was behind the 
               <br />
               whole movement, the deﬁnite pressure that was 
               <br />
               exerted by the Queen’s representative in many 
               <br />
               pronouncements, and while the matter of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enter«</span> 
               <br />
               ing confederation was in theory a matter of 
               <br />
               choice, it was in fact something of a pressure 
               <br />
               movement, with the realisation that while it was 
               <br />
               being arranged for the colony’s protection, it was 
               <br />
               still an end that must be achieved willy nilly.... 
               <br />
               That, Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, was the 
               <br />
               real position as I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">see‘it</span> at the close of the 1869 
               <br />
               election, And confederation slept until 1888, 
               <br />
               when due to the efforts of Alfred Marine, a Nova 
               <br />
               Scotian who had adopted Newfoundland as his 
               <br />
               country and gained a reputation here as a lawyer 
               <br />
               as well as a politician, an attempt was made to 
               <br />
               reopen the negotiations, but it fell through, and

               Mr. Harrington When the House rose this 
               <br />
               afternoon I had been speaking on the country’s 
               <br />
               history from 1869 to 1895, and I had come to a 
               <br />
               consideration of the present day situation. 
               <br />
               Newfoundland’s position has greatly changed 
               <br />
               since 1869, and since 1895. In 1927, New- 
               <br />
               foundland gained a possession, the Labrador, 
               <br />
               three times as large as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">itself.</span> Hitherto, she had 
               <br />
               been a small island colony whose strategic posi- 
               <br />
               tion, as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Higgins has pointed out, was ignored 
               <br />
               until the second World War. Up to that time too, 
               <br />
               the United States had not come into its own as a 
               <br />
               number one world power. Now the US has as- 
               <br />
               sumed Britain’s traditional role in world affairs, 
               <br />
               and the US has bases in Newfoundland. Hence it 
               <br />
               is now more imperative than ever to get New— 
               <br />
               foundland into confederation. Hence the state~ 
               <br />
               ment that if Newfoundland enters confederation, 
               <br />
               Canada will replace Britain as the other party in 
               <br />
               the base agreement. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               It might well seem that the pressure is on 
               <br />
               Britain this time —— pressure from Canada. When 
               <br />
               Britain made the surrender of self~govemment in 
               <br />
