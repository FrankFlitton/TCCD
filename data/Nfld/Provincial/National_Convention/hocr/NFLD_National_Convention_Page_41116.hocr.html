               Now Mr. Chairman, in rising to make a few 
               <br />
               remarks on this confederation issue now before 
               <br />
               the Convention, I must confess that I do so with 
               <br />
               a sense of some discouragement and even disap- 
               <br />
               pointment. For when I consider the political 
               <br />
               situation which exists in Newfoundland today, 
               <br />
               the bewilderment which has been created in the 
               <br />
               minds of some of our people, the disgust and even 
               <br />
               the bitterness in others, it proves to me beyond all 
               <br />
               doubt that far more harm has come out of this 
               <br />
               Convention than good. It tells me that neither 
               <br />
               myself nor any other delegate can take any great 
               <br />
               pride in the position we have helped to create. It 
               <br />
               is said that sometimes good comes out of evil, but 
               <br />
               such has not been the case of this Convention. 
               <br />
               When I look back over the long period that we 
               <br />
               have spent in fruitless discussion, wasting our 
               <br />
               own time and the people’s money, in trying to do 
               <br />
               something which we should not have been asked 
               <br />
               to do —-— in allowing ourselves to be diverted into 
               <br />
               this political cul-de—sac -—I honestly feel that we, 
               <br />
               all of us, owe an apology to the people who sent 
               <br />
               us here. For months, I think about 16 months, we 
               <br />
               have been engaged in what I regard as a wasteful 
               <br />
               task of ﬁnding out the economic condition of this 
               <br />
               country, when the truth is that we could have been 
               <br />
               told every last detail concerning our ﬁnancial and 
               <br />
               economic condition on the very ﬁrst day this 
               <br />
               Convention opened its doors. 
               <br />

               For months we have been squabbling over

               useless friction and bad feeling which has been

               <br />
               This mock parliament, it is obvious, has spread

               its harmful inﬂuence of political controversy to 
               <br />
               every town and settlement in Newfoundland.

               tive of whether they understand what they are 
               <br />
               talking about or not. I say, Mr. Chairman, that this 
               <br />
               was the preconceived idea of the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom government and the Commission 
               <br />

               Convention idea.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now Mr. Chairman, this setting of our people 
               <br />
               at one another’s throats is one of the things for 
               <br />
               which those who have set up this stupid Conven— 
               <br />
               tion should never be forgiven. There is no excuse 
               <br />
               for it. But what makes this even worse is the fact 
               <br />
               that there are indications, strong indications, that 
               <br />
               the whole thing was deliberately planned to cre— 
               <br />
               ate political disorder in our country, to muddle 
               <br />
               the people’s minds with a hotch-potch of ideas. 
               <br />
               And this, remember, in the case of a people which 
               <br />
               has been kept in political ignorance for 14 years. 
               <br />
               To expect them, the average man or woman in 
               <br />
               this country, to understand and separate the 
               <br />

               <br />
               derstand the multitude of debatable issues which 
               <br />
               go with them, to be able to say to what extent we 
               <br />
               would beneﬁt or suffer by attaching themselves 
               <br />
               to any one of them—I say, to set this Convention 
               <br />
               and the people of the country to such a task, I 
               <br />
               regard as being inspired either by a sense of 
               <br />
               stupity or with the deliberate desire of injuring us. 
               <br />
               To repeat what I have so often stated before: was 
               <br />
               there ever such a farce perpetrated on an innocent 
               <br />
               people? It is my personal opinion that it is all 
               <br />
               simply the working out of a shrewdly conceived 
               <br />
               plan. First Newfoundland would be divided 
               <br />
               politically, and then it would be destroyed politi—
