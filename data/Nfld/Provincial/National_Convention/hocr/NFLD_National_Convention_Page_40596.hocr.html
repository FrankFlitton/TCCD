               Mr. Chairman I will answer that question, Mr. 
               <br />
               Reddy. When the discussions began, it was 
               <br />
               drawn to our attention by Lord Addison that there 
               <br />
               were two courses open. One, to have a free <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis“</span> 
               <br />
               cussion at which every member of both <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delega»</span> 
               <br />
               tions, if I may use that term, could, as it were, let 
               <br />
               his hair down, to use a more or less feminine 
               <br />
               expression, and talk freely. There would be no 
               <br />
               necessity to pick and choose one’s words. That 
               <br />
               was one course. If that course were adopted, 
               <br />
               obviously it would be necessary that the actual 
               <br />
               proceedings should be regarded as confidential 
               <br />
               and only the formal documents be for public use. 
               <br />
               The other was to stick strictly to formal debate, 
               <br />
               which naturally would make free discussion 
               <br />
               very, very difﬁcult. It was decided that we should 
               <br />
               adopt the former course; that we should talk 
               <br />
               freely, and that whatever was said, and which was 
               <br />
               reported of course in full, should be regarded as 
               <br />
               conﬁdential, and the transcript of the reporter’s 
               <br />
               notes should be for use only by the delegates 
               <br />
               themselves. Consequently, the actual speeches or 
               <br />
               statements made by the different delegates can- 
               <br />
               not be disclosed to the public.

               <br />
               raised... If my memory serves me right, when the 
               <br />
               delegation went to Government House in 
               <br />
               February, I think it was, that particular section 
               <br />
               which brought in the name of the United States, 
               <br />
               we were quietly calmed down by being reassured 
               <br />
               that when the delegation went to England, they 
               <br />
               could take up these matters. Now that was more 
               <br />
               or less a promise. Was there any reference made 
               <br />
               to the annexation of the United States to New- 
               <br />
               foundland? Not that I would be one to propose it, 
               <br />
               Sir, but I do want to know for the beneﬁt of this 
               <br />
               house and for the beneﬁt of the country, since 
               <br />
               people here this afternoon are talking to the

               <br />
               not to talk to the country, not to make a political
