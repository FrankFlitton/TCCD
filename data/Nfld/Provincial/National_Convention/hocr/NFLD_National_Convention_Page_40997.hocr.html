               Mr. Smallwood We asked the Government of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland to furnish us, as a delegation going 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               reply of the government was, in their opinion we 
               <br />
               did not need those men; that any information we 
               <br />
               wanted we could get before we went; after we got 
               <br />
               up there, if there was still information we needed, 
               <br />
               or the Government of Canada needed, the 
               <br />
               Government would be very happy to furnish that. 
               <br />
               All we had to do was write or cable. In common 
               <br />
               fairness, I would say that any information we 
               <br />
               sought before we went was given us. Any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">infor«</span>

               Mr. Hickman I am not quite sure where we are

               getting. I have been somewhat confused myself 
               <br />
               this evening. I do not know ifthe people listening 
               <br />
               in feel any better. I think we ought to get down 
               <br />
               to some basis of clarifying the procedure on a 
               <br />
               particular question or questions. I think it invol- 
               <br />
               ves two questions. We have been discussing 
               <br />
               federal revenue. Now, are we straight on that? As 
               <br />
               Major Cashin said earlier this evening, these 
               <br />
               figures here may have been guesses or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not.</span> He 
               <br />
               does not agree with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them.</span> I agree with him. He 
               <br />
               made a suggestion with regard to page 15 of the 
               <br />
               Grey Book. I think we ought to get those ﬁgures 
               <br />
               straightened out; get as near as possible a more 
               <br />
               accurate corroboration either from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Allen of 
               <br />
               the Assessor’s Department or from Mr. Howell 
               <br />
               of the Customs, ifit is possible to do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">so.</span> We have 
               <br />
               been kind of wandering around from taxes to 
               <br />
               taxes. That isjust the federal end. We have to get 
               <br />
               into the provincial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">end.</span> On income tax we seem 
               <br />
               to have skipped over a lot. 1 note in Canada in 
               <br />
               1945 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> l daresay it was higher in 1946 and 1947 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—-</span> the total income tax collected was $650 mil- 
               <br />
               lion. Out of that, people earning under $1,000 
               <br />
               paid $18 million; between $1,000 and $2,000, 
               <br />
               $139 million and $140 million. That is not the 
               <br />
               high income tax people. The high income tax for 
               <br />
               1945 is on page 232 of the book you <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have.</span> These 
               <br />
               things have to be brought out a little better. In 
               <br />
               addition there is sales tax of 8%. We read the list 
               <br />
               of goods that are exempt. but the list it is on are 
               <br />
               not in the Black Book. There is a whole lot of 
               <br />
               taxes goes on before the sales tax of 8%. 1 am not 
               <br />
               going to read them. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Smallwood just <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">men»</span>

               tioned the indirect taxation which he does not 
               <br />
               like. In Canada they have a lot of that too. For 
               <br />
               example, on a pair of shoes there are 126 taxes; 
               <br />
               on a loaf of bread 52 taxes; on a suit of clothes 
               <br />
               105 taxes before it gets to the consumer in
