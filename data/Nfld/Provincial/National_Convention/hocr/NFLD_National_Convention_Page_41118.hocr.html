               <br />
               $3,375,000 or slightly over $10 per head, as 
               <br />
               against Canada’ s $35 per head. Therefore we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that the difference between the national debt of 
               <br />
               Canada and that of Newfoundland on a per capita 
               <br />
               basis is approximately $1,200 in excess of ours, 
               <br />
               which means that if Newfoundland were to be- 
               <br />
               come a Canadian province upon the terms offered 
               <br />
               us, our country would have to become respon- 
               <br />
               sible for this extra debt, which would amount to, 
               <br />
               in all, nearly $400 million as Newfoundland’s 
               <br />
               proportionate share of the entire debt of the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada. It would mean that every 
               <br />
               man, woman and child in Newfoundland would 
               <br />
               pay in annual taxes, directly and indirectly, about 
               <br />
               $230 instead of $120 which is our present per 
               <br />
               capita tax annually. In all, the people of New— 
               <br />
               foundland would have to pay an additional $38— 
               <br />
               40 million each year in taxation.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               But that is not the worst of it. Canada, we are 
               <br />
               told, in the event of confederation will be gen- 
               <br />
               erous enough to take over our sterling debt, which 
               <br />
               amounts to approximately $64 million. On the 
               <br />
               face of it, this would look like Canada was giving 
               <br />
               us something for nothing, but in actuality it is 
               <br />
               nothing like <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that,</span> It means that for this $64 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mile</span> 
               <br />
               lion Canada will buy Newfoundland —— our rail— 
               <br />
               ways, public buildings, wharves, lighthouses, 
               <br />
               telegraph system, docks, steamers and harbours, 
               <br />
               everything for a paltry $64 million. Why, Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood himself gives the Canadian govern- 
               <br />
               ment the valuation of our railways and its sub- 
               <br />
               sidiaries, just one item, as being $72 million. If 
               <br />
               ever there was a one-sided bargain, this is it. If 
               <br />
               ever there was a pig—in-a~bag transaction, this is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> - 
               <br />
               And speaking again of our railroad, these 
               <br />
               Canadian proposals make much of the deficits 
               <br />
               incurred by our Newfoundland Railway. But they 
               <br />
               say nothing about the losses incurred by the 
               <br />
               Canadian National Railway system. Now, 
               <br />
               anyone who knows anything about the history of 
               <br />
               the Canadian National Railway system, operated 
               <br />
               by the Canadian government, knows that they 
               <br />
               have been a continual political headache. They 
               <br />
               have lost and cost Canada not millions, but bil- 
               <br />
               lions of dollars. True, the Newfoundland Railway 
               <br />
               has cost the country a deﬁcit each year since it 
               <br />
               was taken over by the government in 1923 at a 
               <br />
               cost of $2 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million.</span> Now, when the Ottawa delega- 
               <br />
               tion were discussing this railway matter with the 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Canadian government, it would appear that they 
               <br />
               did not ask any embarrassing questions about the 
               <br />
               Canadian National Railways — what they had 
               <br />
               cost the taxpayers of Canada, or what was the 
               <br />
               average annual loss sustained. Although we have 
               <br />
               not this information officially, it is general 
               <br />
               knowledge that the Canadian National Railways 
               <br />
               originally cost the Canadian government in the 
               <br />
               vicinity of $1 billion and they have cost the 
               <br />
               Canadian taxpayer uncounted millions since it 
               <br />
               came under government control. Indeed, it is a 
               <br />
               matter of record that the Canadian government 
               <br />
               actually defaulted on the preferred stock <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out.</span> 
               <br />
               standing by the Grand Trunk Railway system 
               <br />
               when the government took it over — which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">acv</span> 
               <br />
               tion, by the way, caused great concern and dis— 
               <br />
               pleasure to the English investors holding these 
               <br />
               securities amounting to millions and millions of 
               <br />
               dollars. Incidentally, with regard to the CNR and 
               <br />
               CPR, it was a story of graft from beginning to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">end,</span> The directors looted the Bank of Montreal 
               <br />
               in order to ﬁnance the CPR and then went to the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister and asked him to keep them out 
               <br />
               of jail. They told him the story of what they had 
               <br />
               done to complete the transcontinental <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">railway,</span> 
               <br />
               The CNR was taken over in 1919 or 1920. 
               <br />
               Originally, a great portion of this system was 
               <br />
               called the Canadian Northem Railway, the con- 
               <br />
               struction of which was begun by two Toronto 
               <br />
               ﬁnanciers, Mackenzie and Mann (Bill and Dan), 
               <br />
               who received vast concessions from the 
               <br />
               Canadian government for the purpose of building 
               <br />
               another line across Canada. They operated this 
               <br />
               system for a short period and then got into ﬁnan- 
               <br />
               cial difﬁculties. In addition, the Grand Trunk 
               <br />
               Railway and the ICR got into difﬁculties. These 
               <br />
               two systems were operating in the eastern part of 
               <br />
               Canada. Why I mention this, sir, is because we 
               <br />
               have been told by Mr. Smallwood that the New- 
               <br />
               foundland Railway is nothing more or less than a 
               <br />
               heap of scrap. Well, I wonder what Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood and the Ottawa delegation thought of 
               <br />
               that part of the Canadian National system that 
               <br />
               runs from Sydney to Truro. I tell you, that from 
               <br />
               what little knowledge I have of railroading, that 
               <br />
               this particular part of the system is a disgrace to 
               <br />
               Canada. I will go further, its rolling stock, its 
               <br />
               roadbed and its general administration are most 
               <br />
               inefﬁcient. I have travelled from one end of 
               <br />
               Canada to the other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> take the Prime Minister’s
