               <br />
               Smallwood’s provincial budget has set down a 
               <br />
               sum of $200,000 to cover these expenses, but has 
               <br />
               it been made abundantly clear to many of our 
               <br />
               people what that sum represents? I am under the 
               <br />
               impression that a considerable number of our 
               <br />
               people believe that under confederation they will 
               <br />
               be governed from Ottawa only, just as they are 
               <br />
               governed now from London. They have not the 
               <br />
               faintest idea that there will be a legislature in 
               <br />

               <br />
               the days of responsible government. Some folk 
               <br />
               may not credit this, but it is true. Many of our 
               <br />
               people think that by voting for confederation they 
               <br />
               are going to eliminate the necessity of having a 
               <br />
               local House of Assembly in St. John’s. That 
               <br />
               explains, for the most part, why we hear so many 
               <br />
               people say. “Where are we going to get the men 
               <br />
               under responsible government?” Let them 
               <br />
               ponder where, then, they are going to get them 
               <br />
               under confederation! If we are not ready for 
               <br />
               responsible, we are not ready for confederation.

               Here we have the same stumbling block over 
               <br />
               which the confederate plan of 1895 tripped and 
               <br />
               came a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cropper,</span> In 1895 Canada could not as- 
               <br />
               sume the entire debt of Newfoundland. When 
               <br />
               Britain was asked to bridge the gap, she would 
               <br />
               not do so. The negotiations fell through. That is 
               <br />
               why confederation was never put to the people of 
               <br />
               a bankrupt country in 1895 —— the terms were not 
               <br />
               generous enough. Yet 50 years after, Canada 
               <br />
               expects the National Convention to consider put-

               after us. And yet at every turn we are confronted 
               <br />
               with headlines about the generous terms that 
               <br />
               Canada has offered Newfoundland. The con— 
               <br />
               federates said they will be so generous that we 
               <br />
               won‘t be able to turn them down. Now I ask, 
               <br />
               where are the special concessions for New- 
               <br />
               foundland? They are certainly not in the ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               arrangements, and as far as I can see, they are not 
               <br />
               in any of the others. All the Grey Book represents 
               <br />
               is a mere application of the main features of the 
               <br />
               Canadian confederation to Newfoundland. No 
               <br />
               more, no less. Of course there’s margarine, but 
               <br />
               more of that later.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Let me put it this way, Mr. Chairman. Suppose 
               <br />
               Alaska was a British colony, a British dominion 
               <br />
               like Newfoundland. And suppose Alaska wanted 
               <br />
               to enter the Canadian confederation. Like New- 
               <br />
               foundland, there would be provision in the RNA 
               <br />
               Act. Canada would have all the same services 
               <br />
               extended to Alaska as are offered to New— 
               <br />
               foundland. She would get all the promises we are 
               <br />
               getting. Canada would also take over all her 
               <br />
               assets, her railways, steamships, etc., just as in 
               <br />
               clause 8. But Alaska’s government, presuming 
               <br />
               she had self-govemment as a British dominion, 
               <br />
               would say to Canada, “We are a big country; 
               <br />
               we’re rich; you will have to do better than that. 
               <br />
               We want some special concessions.” And if 
               <br />
               Canada wanted Alaska as badly as she seems to 
               <br />
               want Newfoundland, then Alaska would get spe- 
               <br />
               cial concessions. But our delegation could not act 
               <br />
               in that way because they had no authority to act 
               <br />
               as a government, no authority to bargain, to 
               <br />
               negotiate, They just had to take whatever Canada 
               <br />
               was prepared to offer. Even if they went beyond 
               <br />
               their powers and secured margarine, that was not 
               <br />
               a concession for it is in the cards that all Canada 
               <br />
               may soon have that particular freedom to 
               <br />
               manufacture and sell margarine. That is why the 
               <br />
               terms -— the so-called terms <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«-</span> do not say we will 
               <br />
               get a standard gauge railway, which would be a 
               <br />
               special <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">concession,</span> It is left to Mr. Smallwood to 
               <br />
               read between the lines and suggest we will get it 
               <br />
               some day. That is why Canada will maintain only 
               <br />
               a steamship service no better or worse than the 
               <br />
               present one on the Gulf. And when the motor 
               <br />
               highway is completed, if it is completed and if the 
               <br />
               province can afford to complete it, it will include 
               <br />
               suitable provision for motor vehicles. Whereas a 
               <br />
               special concession would have said, Canada will 
               <br />
               complete that road and build a transinsular high-
