               foundlander having any experience in provincial 
               <br />

               <br />
               for it in those provinces that have had it for nearly 
               <br />
               100 years, and no doubt through trial and error 
               <br />
               have found out the best way to apply it in the way 
               <br />
               that will cost the taxpayer the least <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taxes.</span> So in 
               <br />
               looking through the assessment I ﬁnd that in 
               <br />
               many provinces their social service is on a much 
               <br />
               higher scale than ours, and the provinces are 
               <br />
               paying twice the amount of money which Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood is budgeting for, and it does not make 
               <br />
               sense to me, for we must face this question in the 
               <br />
               Grey Book which says that within eight years a 
               <br />
               royal commission will be set up, and the question 
               <br />
               will be gone into.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I think before we consider the question of 
               <br />
               confederation at all we should have gone into this 
               <br />
               and thrashed it out thoroughly. That would have 
               <br />
               been the first step, to get the laws of Canada, their 
               <br />
               assessment, their taxation, and it should have 
               <br />
               been gone into so that we would know what is 
               <br />
               before us in the future. One thing we should have 
               <br />
               had was this information, and before our people 
               <br />
               vote they too should have it, but it is the last thing 
               <br />
               that the powers that be intend that we should 
               <br />
               have, so we are faltering along without it. Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood made great capital out of belittling 
               <br />
               the assistance of the municipal councils in those 
               <br />
               provinces, but to look at it from a common sense 
               <br />
               point of view, and see what part they play in the 
               <br />
               everyday life of our Canadian neighbours, I want 
               <br />
               the people to know that in the provinces they play 
               <br />
               a leading <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">part,</span> They are well governed, and 
               <br />
               without this form we cannot have good <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern»</span> 
               <br />
               ment, I only wish our economic system could 
               <br />
               stand it, and if I were a praying man I would pray 
               <br />
               that day would soon come when we could go into 
               <br />
               it in a big way and benefit from it.

               delegations at Ottawa, on June 25, 1947. I want

               to quote:

               It was a great dream that the founders of 
               <br />
               this Canadian union had 80 years ago, when 
               <br />
               they foresaw on the northern half of this 
               <br />
               continent a vast British nation stretching 
               <br />
               from St. John’s to Victoria. Two of our own 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders shared that dream and did 
               <br />
               what they could to give it birth — Sir Frederic 
               <br />
               Carter and Sir Ambrose Shea, who will go 
               <br />
               down in history as two of the Fathers of 
               <br />
               Confederation. Newfoundland did not elect 
               <br />
               to enter the new union at that time, but when 
               <br />
               we remember that the union itself was very 
               <br />
               new, and was not all understood by our 
               <br />
               people, and the more important fact that 
               <br />
               Newfoundland did not then enjoy a 
               <br />
               democratic franchise or the secret ballot, it is 
               <br />
               easy to understand why that ﬁrst invitation to 
               <br />
               Newfoundland to enter the partnership was 
               <br />
               rejected. The other rejection was not made by 
               <br />
               the Newfoundland people, for it was not sub— 
               <br />
               mitted to them. That was the occasion, in 
               <br />
               1895, when your Dominion was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ad«</span>

               ministered by the government headed by Sir

               Mackenzie Bowell. The failure of that at—

               tempt at federal union of the two countries 
               <br />
               was due largely to the hurried nature of the
