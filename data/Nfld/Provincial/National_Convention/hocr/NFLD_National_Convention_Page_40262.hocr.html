               On the Railway, there was some question as 
               <br />
               to the amount of money paid out in claims. The 
               <br />
               Manager informed the Transportation Commit- 
               <br />
               tee in a meeting this forenoon that in the year 
               <br />
               ending March 31, l946, the total amount of 
               <br />
               claims paid out by the Railway was $36,982 and 
               <br />
               in the previous year $26,000. The amount paid 
               <br />
               out in claims runs from $25,000 to $30,000 a 
               <br />
               year. We asked for some explanation of even that 
               <br />
               relatively small amount —— only 1% of the freight 
               <br />
               handled by the Railway in the course of the year 
               <br />
               — and two explanations were given. The first is 
               <br />
               that, since the war especially, shippers have not 
               <br />
               been using wooden containers but paper cartons 
               <br />
               instead. These get broken and the contents are 
               <br />
               strewn around or are pilfered. In the second place, 
               <br />
               the amount includes compensation paid to 
               <br />
               owners of cattle and horses killed along the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rail&lt;</span> 
               <br />
               way. Another matter is that of free passes issued 
               <br />
               to persons on the Newfoundland Railway.

               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. Starkes Does that mean that Canadian rail-

               roaders coming to this country can travel on a 
               <br />
               pass? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Yes, for employees of the rail- 
               <br />
               ways who have that arrangement with the New- 
               <br />
               foundland Railway... The General Manager told 
               <br />
               us that very few Americans or Canadians travel 
               <br />
               to Newfoundland on passes; many more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New«</span> 
               <br />
               foundlanders go up there than Canadians or 
               <br />
               Americans come down here... All applications 
               <br />
               for passes go to the head of the department and 
               <br />
               from him to the General Manager, and he must 
               <br />
               sign them before they are any good. In that way 
               <br />
               they keep a record and the General Manager 
               <br />
               knows exactly what is happening with regard to 
               <br />
               the issuing of free passes on the Railway. 
               <br />
               Mr. Crummey Could you tell us the number of 
               <br />
               passes in 1946 and the mileage covered? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Neither I nor any member of 
               <br />
               the Committee nor any member of the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion present thought of enquiring as to the actual 
               <br />
               number of passes issued. The issuing of railway 
               <br />
               passes is so commonplace throughout the world 
               <br />
               that mere details as to the number of passes is 
               <br />
               relatively unimportant. I ought to say that these 
               <br />
               free passes are merely for travelling. They do not 
               <br />
               include meals on the train or sleepers. In fact, if 
               <br />
               a railroader travelling on a pass wants a sleeper, 
               <br />
               he must buy an upper; he is not permitted to buy 
               <br />
               a lower berth.
