               Britain could not give us an understanding to do 
               <br />

               “understanding” not “undertaking”, for the

               negotiate any trade agreements. The hard fact is 
               <br />

               not expecting exactly the answer received was 
               <br />
               not a realist. He was building castles in Spain

               grants~in-aid. The answer does emphasise a point 
               <br />
               I have always tried to make — that any people to 
               <br />
               be sovereign unto themselves, must ﬁrst be suf~

               guarantee in the credit markets of the world. For 
               <br />
               it to be anything else would be not to be really 
               <br />
               responsible, since its sovereignty would be open

               where we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stand,</span> Yesterday Major Cashin made 
               <br />
               another one of those speeches. He said some 
               <br />
               things with which I agreed. Those were the things 
               <br />
               that had reference to the actual facts in the case 
               <br />
               of the London mission. He said some other things 
               <br />
               with which I did not agree. Those had to do with 
               <br />
               his constructions, interpretations and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opinions.</span> 
               <br />
               Indeed, he said so many things with which I 
               <br />
               disagree as would take a considerable period of 
               <br />
