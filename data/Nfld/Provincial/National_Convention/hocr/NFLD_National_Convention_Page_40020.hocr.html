               Mr. Chairman Apropos of that, His Excellency 
               <br />
               is not in town at the moment. In the old days the

               <br />

               <br />
               lency the address in reply. Similar procedure 
               <br />
               might be followed in regard to the address of 
               <br />
               loyalty and the address of thanks; but as the 
               <br />
               Governor will not return for a fortnight, do you 
               <br />
               wish that the delegation should go to Government 
               <br />
