               <br />
               as draggers or dory ﬁshermen. It’s balderdash

               that a man cannot change to another kind of

               <br />

               on the auction block. If he has the will and is 
               <br />
               willing to learn, of course; then perhaps in a few 
               <br />
               years he can look back and say those three bad

               much of the past, it holds too much to the old 
               <br />

               <br />
               dragging her chains behind her. She has broken 
               <br />
               out her anchors, but the Finance Committee for- 
               <br />
               got to heave them in. Let us stow the chain in the

               In referring to the merchant marine, the genial 
               <br />
               delegate from Bonavista Centre spoke about the 
               <br />
               difference of opinion between myself and the 
               <br />
               Hon. Mr. Job about the powering of ships. I wish 
               <br />
               to congratulate Mr. Job and-his associates on the 
               <br />
               pioneer step they have taken, and I’m sure they 
               <br />
               are setting an example that will vindicate both 
               <br />
               myself and Mr. Crosbie in our opinions. I refer to 
               <br />
               the installing of diesel engines in the Sable 15- 
               <br />
               land. I’ll make a guess this innovation alone will 
               <br />
               mean a long step forward in the coming maritime 
               <br />
               age of this country, and it will mean that Water 
               <br />
               Street will once again be seen at its best, from a 
               <br />
               launch that is, and not from a taxi. The trade of 
               <br />
               this country will be carried in our own bottoms. 
               <br />
               The ﬁrms along the streets will once again be 
               <br />
               mercantile ﬁrms and not calico vendors. Had the 
               <br />
               government done what the firm of Job Brothers 
               <br />
               and Company is doing today, with the ﬂeet of 
               <br />
               ships it had, with the services of a diesel electrical 
               <br />
               engineer, plus their new shipping, both the docks 
               <br />
               and the coastal services would be in the black 
               <br />
               now. This could have been done during the last 
               <br />
               25 years.

               before me, I can only come to the opinion that 
               <br />
               this country is not only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self'supporting</span> now, but 
               <br />
               was always self—supporting. The only reason for 
               <br />
               the hard straits we have been in has been the 
               <br />
               human element, which reflects on all of us from 
               <br />
               the government down to the last citizen. We‘ve 
               <br />
               had the brawn, the capital and the resources, but 
               <br />
               seem to have been lacking in the brains or the 
               <br />
               vision. After my extensive study of the natural 
               <br />
               resources of our country, in my comparison with 
               <br />
               those of other lands, particularly Iceland and 
               <br />
               Norway, 1 can only come to the conclusion that 
               <br />
               in view of the way our affairs and resources have 
               <br />
               been mishandled so far, its a wonder to me not 
               <br />
               that she survived, but how she survived. As I said 
               <br />
               before, the Finance Committee has only broken 
               <br />
               the anchors from the ground. Let’s haul in the 
               <br />
               chains and full speed ahead.
