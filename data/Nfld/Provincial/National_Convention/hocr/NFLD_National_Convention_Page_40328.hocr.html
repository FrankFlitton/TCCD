               I cannot agree with this attitude. There are 
               <br />
               some very worthwhile local industries which are 
               <br />
               great assets to our country. I am a shareholder in

               mind admitting it — some local dividends which,

               to face. As far as local industries are concerned, 
               <br />
               I would suggest to our present government, and 
               <br />
               to whatever form of government we will have in 
               <br />

               <br />
               local companies receiving high tariff protection, 
               <br />
               and if they are not operated in the best interest of 
               <br />
               the people, remove this protection.

               no matter what form of government you favour,

               got the materials. Any time you are in Boston if 
               <br />
               you go down to the station, you will pass through 
               <br />
               a section of the city which is nothing but wool 
               <br />

               ested in the Riverside wool...l Here is an industry 
               <br />
               which is worth building up. I came to know about 
               <br />
               this during the war, I was in New York and one 
               <br />
               of our women, who originally belonged to New- 
               <br />
               foundland, happened to go to her closet and take 
               <br />
               out a white blanket and spread it over the bed. An 
               <br />
               American woman who was there said, “Where in 
               <br />
               the world did you get a blanket like that?” She 
               <br />
               said, “That’s a Newfoundland product, the wool 
               <br />
               is grown there, and the blanket made <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there”...</span> 
               <br />
               These are industries which can be expanded. If in ' 
               <br />
               the future we can get machines to utilise cotton 
               <br />
               with the wool, and if we get wool direct from 
               <br />
               Australia, without passing through American and 
               <br />
               Canadian brokers, here is an industry 
               <br />
               worthwhile. I can‘t see why in the future all our 
               <br />
               clothes cannot be made in this country. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now here is another industry. I was in Costa 
               <br />
               Rica during a time of famine and I was talking to 
               <br />
               a man about what our country is doing as regards 
               <br />
               fruit, and he happened to say, “We were fortunate 
               <br />
               to get 800 barrels of loganberries, I wish we could 
               <br />
               get 8,000." He said, “You have a wonderful fruit 
               <br />
               in panridgeberries.” I know one of our women 
               <br />
               went to the States to join her son, and because she 
               <br />
               was not satisﬁed to lie around and do nothing, her 
               <br />
               son opened a Newfoundland store up <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there.</span> She 
               <br />
               got the berries and started putting up so much jam 
               <br />
               in the kitchen. It went from one to another, and 
               <br />
               she could not make as much as she could <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sell...</span> 
               <br />
               There is something that can be made worthwhile 
               <br />
               if it was looked into. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Jones I was going to refer to the blueberry

               Development Board: “A report of blueberry

               <br />
               industry has decreased alarmingly over the past 
               <br />
               few years." I wonder if anything has been done 
               <br />
               to revive this industry, which means so much to 
               <br />
               the people, especially the people of the Avalon
