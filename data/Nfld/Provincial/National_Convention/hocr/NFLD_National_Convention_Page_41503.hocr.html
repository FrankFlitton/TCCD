               Old age pensions. I have in mind an old couple 
               <br />
               nearly 80 years of age each, living alone, getting 
               <br />
               very little help from relatives, trying to live on 
               <br />
               their old age pension. That man still has to go in 
               <br />
               the ﬁshing boat to try and earn a few dollars to 
               <br />
               augment his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pension.</span> What a help it would be to 
               <br />
               receive $60 a month instead of the $10 they 
               <br />
               receive today. His property would not exceed 
               <br />
               $1,500, and even if it did exceed $2,000 and 
               <br />
               under Canadian rule the government did take it, 
               <br />
               would not they be entitled to it after his family 
               <br />
               had forsaken them and let the government look 
               <br />
               after them? I think they would have a perfect right 
               <br />
               to it, and I feel sure the old couple would think so 
               <br />
               too. The old age pensioners of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               need not worry about the government taking their 
               <br />
               property. Very few of them whom I have seen in 
               <br />
               the outports have property over $2,000, and if 
               <br />
               they have, they would not receive old age pen- 
               <br />
               sions. I have made out quite a number of applica- 
               <br />
               tions the past 20 years. I have a good idea of their 
               <br />
               property value. I am not going to touch on other 
               <br />
               taxations, this has been ably and thoroughly gone 
               <br />
               into by other speakers.

               There will, no doubt, be many changes and 
               <br />
               adjustments in the event of union, especially in 
               <br />
               the business world. But my thought about all that 
               <br />
               is, if our business men cannot adjust themselves 
               <br />
               to competition, they are not the men I take them 
               <br />

               fold up. But don’t worry, Water Street of St.

               <br />
               300,000 people. That has not been the history of 
               <br />
               the democratic government of Canada. In my 
               <br />
               opinion Newfoundland has nothing to lose and 
               <br />
               very much to gain by closer contact with our 
               <br />
               neighbour, Canada, which fact will strengthen 
               <br />
               our bargaining power which members like to talk 
               <br />
               so much about. In union is strength..So let’s hope

               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, I have had 
               <br />
               many of my statements taken and twisted; I have 
               <br />
               been frequently attacked, my motives questioned 
               <br />
               and my whole attitude subjected to such mis— 
               <br />
               representation and innuendo; and I have been 
               <br />
               called so many names ———- from Quisling to Judas 
               <br />
               Iscariot, from traitor to fool — that I suppose I 
               <br />
               would be justified if I were to take offence and 
               <br />
               become quite angry; but Lord bless you, sir, I do 
               <br />
               not. Instead, I take refuge in the words of the 
               <br />
