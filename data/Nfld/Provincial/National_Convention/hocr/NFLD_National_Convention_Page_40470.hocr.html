               approximately 12%. I would like the Committee

               Mr. Smallwood I rise to explain how that error 
               <br />
               occurred, that we were discussing this afternoon. 
               <br />
               You will remember the infant mortality rates as 
               <br />
               compared with other countries. This is a copy of 
               <br />
               the ofﬁcial year book of the Commonwealth of 
               <br />
               Australia. This chapter on vital statistics gives 
               <br />
               their statistics and also statistics for other 
               <br />
               countries. On page 339, there is a table showing 
               <br />
               the infant mortality of many countries. Any 
               <br />
               gentleman who wishes to look at it can see that 
               <br />
               the ﬁgure is 21.4 in Canada; in South Africa <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">25.3;</span> 
               <br />
               in the United States 17.9; Great Britain 15; 
               <br />
               Australia 15; New Zealand 22.6. 1 copied those 
               <br />
               ﬁgures from the Australia year book 1942-43. ln 
               <br />
               doing so the mistake is made. Although the head- 
               <br />
               line is ‘Infant Mortality’ there is also ‘Crude Birth 
               <br />
               Rate.’ I discovered it and made some corrections 
               <br />
               in ink. I was in the right table but in the wrong 
               <br />
               column of that table. If there is any impression in 
               <br />
               anyone’s mind that that was done deliberately, I 
               <br />
               am most anxious to convince the whole House 
               <br />
               that it was an honest mistake that any gentleman 
               <br />
               would have made if he were copying from that 
               <br />
               same table.
