               I shall modify that statement, sir. I said “clean, 
               <br />
               clear” proﬁts. I take back the word “clean”. Their 
               <br />
               proﬁts were clear, but they were not always 
               <br />
               clean. I wish to choose my words carefully. I want 
               <br />
               my words to express exactly what I mean. I say 
               <br />
               that never in history, in this or any country, was

               our people have been since this late war broke 
               <br />
               out. It was in many cases cold, calculated 
               <br />
               plunder. If Major Cashin would talk about the

               <br />
               the plunder of the public chest, he would do more 
               <br />
               good for the people of Newfoundland. They took 
               <br />
               all the proﬁts the traffic would hear, and all the 
               <br />
               government would let them take, and in many 
               <br />
               cases a lot more than the government would 
               <br />
               allow them to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">take.</span> I have never heard or read of 
               <br />
               a handful of people whose pockets were so 
               <br />
               shamelessly looted as were the pockets of our 
               <br />
               Newfoundland people during this war. While 
               <br />

               <br />
               selves were attacked by a looting, monopolistic 
               <br />
               plutocracy here in Newfoundland.

               I will tell you what this late war has done to 
               <br />
               our country. It has strengthened and solidiﬁed our 
               <br />
               new rich. It has put great fortunes into the hands 
               <br />
               of some who did not have them before the war, 
               <br />
               and it has doubled the fortunes of those who did 
               <br />
               have them before the war. It has drawn the reins 
               <br />
               of monopoly closer, it has fastened the chains of 
               <br />
               class domination more securely upon the masses 
               <br />
               of our people. Our struggling masses have 
               <br />
               managed to renew the wallpaper in their homes; 
               <br />
               they have managed to get together a bit more 
               <br />
               furniture and hbusehold utensils, to paint their 
               <br />
               houses, and generally to do a bit of replenishing. 
               <br />
               Those of them whose families were not large, and 
               <br />
               who were not quite so far down when the war 
               <br />
               broke out, have even managed to lay aside a little 
               <br />
               modest savings. But the great majority of our 
               <br />
               people are fast falling back to where they were 
               <br />
               before the war broke out, back into the same 
               <br />
               shameful old rut of poverty and insecurity. It has 
               <br />
               widened the gulf between the people and their 
               <br />
               economic masters. If the poor have not become 
               <br />
               absolutely poorer, it certainly cannot be said that 
               <br />
               the rich have not become richer, for they have 
               <br />
               become <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">richer.</span> The gulf between them has 
               <br />
               widened and deepened. And of few countries in

               of their blood, bone of their bone, soul of their 
               <br />
               soul. I am descended from a family that has lived 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland for over 150 years. My <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ances«</span> 
               <br />
               tors were ﬁshermen, farmers, shop-keepers, 
               <br />
               manufacturers, skilled workmen and artisans. I 
               <br />
               have dug deep into my country’s history, and in 
               <br />
               so doing I have paid special attention to the story 
               <br />
               of our people’s labours, their battles against na- 
               <br />
               ture and against injustice, the story of their end- 
               <br />
               less search for a square deal. I have travelled my 
               <br />
               country, north, east, south and west, into a 
               <br />
               thousand of the 1,300 settlements in it. I have 
               <br />
               been closely and intimately associated with our 
               <br />
               people. I have ﬁshed with the ﬁshermen, logged 
               <br />
               with the loggers; I have gone down underground 
               <br />
               with the miners; held trade union meetings right 
               <br />
               inside the paper mills. I was never so close to our 
               <br />
               toilers as during those years of the dole, and 
               <br />
               always, so long as I live, I will remember those 
               <br />
               years of the dole, and always, so long as I live, I 
               <br />
               will remember those friends of mine, those toilers 
               <br />
               who were stricken down by beri-beri, those 
               <br />
               children who felt the pinch of hunger. I saw the 
               <br />
               heartbreak in the eyes of patient mothers who had 
               <br />
               not enough to give their little ones. I saw the 
               <br />
               bafﬂed, sullen rage of fishermen whose greatest 
               <br />
               toil and endurance could not provide their 
               <br />
               families with enough to eat or wear. I attended 
               <br />
               meetings of the unemployed here in St. John’s, 
               <br />
               but who was I to refuse their invitation to go and 
               <br />
               speak to them? I saw them in their despairing 
               <br />
               hundreds waiting around the street corners, wait- 
               <br />
               ing for the jobs that never turned up, and around 
               <br />
               the dole ofﬁce, and helped to gather second-hand 
               <br />
               clothes to distribute to those who were half- 
               <br />
               naked, not for a day or a week or a year, but all 
               <br />
               through the depression. I saw them, and I swore 
               <br />
               an oath to myself that never would I be a party to 
               <br />
               allowing such things to come back to our people 
               <br />
               again. I would never be a party to any form of 
               <br />
               government that would make us know that thing 
               <br />
               again, and that’s why I became a confederate. I 
               <br />
               became a confederate and discovered that con- 
               <br />
               federation would give our people a half-decent 
               <br />
