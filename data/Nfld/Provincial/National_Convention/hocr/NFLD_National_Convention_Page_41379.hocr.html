               Mr. Smallwood Point of order. My point of 
               <br />
               order is that every word uttered by Mr. Hollett to 
               <br />
               this moment is ultra vires under the Act. He is not 
               <br />
               entitled to argue at all in this matter, except upon 
               <br />
               the basis of the National Convention Act which 
               <br />
               is the only authority we have in this Convention. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I rule now as a matter of law, 
               <br />
               and from which any member is entitled to seek a 
               <br />
               declaratory judgement in the Supreme Court if he 
               <br />
               likes that this Convention has absolutely no right, 
               <br />
               no jurisdiction, no power to review the Letters 
               <br />
               Patent. The legislation passed by the Commis- 
               <br />
               sion of Government does not come within the 
               <br />
               purview of this Act. By accepting election and 
               <br />
               serving under the National Convention Act you 
               <br />
               are precluded and estopped by your conduct from 
               <br />
               raising anything outside the Act. What you are

               Mr. Hollett I hope someone is taking account of 
               <br />
               the time. When I set out to speak I told you I was 
               <br />
               about to try and prove that if Mr. Higgins’ motion 
               <br />
               had contained any more than two forms of 
               <br />
               government, then the Convention Act would 
               <br />
               have been ultra vires to the Letters Patent, 1934. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman There is no connection between 
               <br />
               the two. I am not concerned with your interpreta~ 
               <br />
               tion of the Letters Patent of 1934, I have nothing 
               <br />
               to do with it. I am concerned with the carrying 
               <br />
               out of the Convention Act. Anything else is com- 
               <br />
               pletely irrelevant to my purpose. You are not 
               <br />
               going to review the Letters Patent, and as far as I 
               <br />
               am concerned you are not going to review the

               conduct of the British Parliament. What you
