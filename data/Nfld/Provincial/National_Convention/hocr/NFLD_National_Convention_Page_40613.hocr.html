               <br />
               Institute was made up of Lord Somebody and the 
               <br />
               deputy minister of mines for each dominion.

               There is one deputy minister of mines on the

               <br />
               There are no other ofﬁcials on the board. I in-

               quired about the I944 act and the 1938 act.3 They 
               <br />
               knew nothing whatsoever. Neither act had been
