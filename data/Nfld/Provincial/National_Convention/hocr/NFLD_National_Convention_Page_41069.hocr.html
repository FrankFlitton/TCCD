               fresh approach to the problem of Dominion- 
               <br />
               provincial relations. The agenda was to em-

               phasise full employment and high national <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in‘</span>

               come. If, it said, employment and income can be 
               <br />
               maintained at a high level all our problems are 
               <br />
               manageable: if we fall seriously short they may 
               <br />
               be overwhelming. Previous Dominion-provin- 
               <br />
               cial conferences had been called when most of 
               <br />
               the provinces were in ﬁnancial difﬁculties. The 
               <br />
               1945-46 conference, however, was assembled 
               <br />
               when each and all could balance their budgets. 
               <br />
               The Dominion government, however, was carry— 
               <br />
               ing a staggering burden of debt. In 1940 its na- 
               <br />
               tional debt was only $4 billion. in 1945 it was $13 
               <br />
               billion and mounting; the interest on the national 
               <br />
               debt would exceed the entire current expenditure 
               <br />
               on all services before the war. On top of this there 
               <br />
               was the matter of civil re-establishment of her 
               <br />
               soldiers, which would run into many billions. I 
               <br />
               want to point out now the disunity between the 
               <br />
               provinces, because I think Newfoundland should

               The conference of Dominion and provincial

               <br />
               would seem clear that the provincial govern-

               what he termed “the fundamental weakness of 
               <br />

               regarded the British North America Act as a 
               <br />
