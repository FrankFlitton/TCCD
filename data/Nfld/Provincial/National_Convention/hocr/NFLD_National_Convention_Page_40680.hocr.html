               Wilfred, every word that you say to me is going 
               <br />
               down in this interview.” And it did, every word. 
               <br />
               I said, “It is believed in this country that the 
               <br />
               Commission of Government were the means of 
               <br />
               keeping the wages down, is that true?” He said, 
               <br />
               “I know nothing about it.” I said, “It is believed 
               <br />
               that you personally, as Commissioner for Public 
               <br />
               Utilities, are particularly and personally respon— 
               <br />
               sible for having done it.” He said, “I know noth- 
               <br />
               ing about it.” And so I pressed him, one question 
               <br />
               after the other, until ﬁnally the interview was 
               <br />
               published, and it was approved by him. Because 
               <br />
               before I left he said, “I see you’re not making any 
               <br />
               notes." I said, “Why should 1?” “Well," he said, 
               <br />
               “you’re going to write this up and you’re not 
               <br />
               writing shorthand.” I said, “I have shorthand in 
               <br />
               my mind. I remember, I photograph on my mind 
               <br />
               every word you’re saying. I don’t need to take 
               <br />
               any notes.” And neither did I. “Well,” he said, “in 
               <br />
               that case, before you print it in the paper, I think 
               <br />
               you should bring it to me and let me read it.” I 
               <br />
               said, “I’ll be glad to do that, but not on condition 
               <br />
               that you’ll change anything." So I went back to 
               <br />
               the office immediately and wrote it, and came 
               <br />
               back to him, and I said, “Here’s my story.” He 
               <br />
               read it. He didn’t change a word. He remarked 
               <br />
               afterwards that it was one of the most remarkable 
               <br />
               memories and so on and so on that he’d ever come 
               <br />
               across. All right! What did he say in the inter- 
               <br />
               view? He said this, not freely and openly and 
               <br />
               without hesitation, it was squeezed out of him, 
               <br />
               every question I put and every answer he gave, 
               <br />
               trying to dodge it, trying to evade it, all the 
               <br />
               answers are down in the interview in print. But I 
               <br />
               ﬁnally squeezed this out of him. I said, “Did you 
               <br />
               write for example to Argentia, to the command— 
               <br />
               ing ofﬁcer and tell them to pay only certain rates 
               <br />
               of pay that are paid in the Highroads <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Depart</span> 
               <br />
               ment?” He said, “I did not." “Did you write to the 
               <br />
               assistant commanding office to that effect?” “I 
               <br />
               did not.” “Did you write to any ofﬁcer of the 
               <br />
               American army or navy in Argentia to that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">efv</span> 
               <br />
               feet?" “I did not.” “Did you write to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Amer</span> 
               <br />
               ican contractors in Argentia to mat effect?” “I did 
               <br />
               not.” I said, “Well maybe I’m on the wrong 
               <br />
               track.” “Did you write to the President of the 
               <br />
               United States?” “No.” “Did you write to the 
               <br />
               Secretary of State?” “No." “Did you write to the 
               <br />
               Secretary of War?" “No." “Did you write to 
               <br />
               anyone in the American government?” He said, 
               <br />
               “No.” I said, “Did you write to anyone? 
               <br />

               here today, I bluffed him. 1 made him think I

               knew something that I did not know. And he

               admitted that he had written to the magistrate at 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood He had written to Magistrate 
               <br />
               Linegar. He admitted it. It’s in the printed inter- 
               <br />
               view, passed by Sir Wilfred himself before it was 
               <br />
               printed. He had written to Magistrate Linegar in 
               <br />
               Placentia, giving him a list of the rates of pay 
               <br />
               which the Highroads Commission were paying to 
               <br />
               their employees, blacksmiths and carpenters and 
               <br />
               electricians and plumbers and truck drivers and 
               <br />
               bulldozer drivers and tractor drivers and 
               <br />
               labourers, all the different classiﬁcations. He had 
               <br />
               sent this list to Magistrate Linegar requesting him 
               <br />
               to take it to the authorities in Argentia, to draw it 
               <br />
               to their attention and let them know that these 
               <br />
               were the scales of pay that the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               government was paying. Now, if Mr. Harmon 
               <br />
               were in a position to do it, I think that possibly he 
               <br />
               would tell you that’s how it happened in Gander. 
               <br />
               I know that’s how it happened in Gander. They 
               <br />
               did not go to Sydney Dawes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">directly...</span> They 
               <br />
               didn’t go to McNamara Construction. They went 
               <br />
               to them through a government official with a list 
               <br />
               of the wages that they were paying in the High— 
               <br />
               roads Department to their own employees. And 
               <br />
               they told them, if you pay more than this, you’re 
               <br />
               going to upset our economy because if you pay 
               <br />
               more then we’ll have to pay more to our highroad 
               <br />
               employees. And if the trade unions had not been 
               <br />

               <br />
               driven the wages up this very day the rates that 
               <br />
               would be paid would be the rates that were paid 
               <br />
               in the early stages of the game. It’s no thanks to 
               <br />
               the Commission of Government.
