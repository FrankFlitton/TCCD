               the House of Assembly passed the second Bait 
               <br />

               this delegation and its conference was the 
               <br />

               ment, and the weakening of French inﬂuence, 
               <br />
               leading to their ﬁnal withdrawal in 1904 after two 
               <br />
               and a half centuries. And as recently as 1927, a 
               <br />
               Newfoundland delegation to London, headed by 
               <br />
               Prime Minister Walter Monroe, presented a case 
               <br />
               prepared in Newfoundland that won for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New«</span> 
               <br />
               foundland 110,000 square miles of Labrador, the 
               <br />
               greatest asset this country has, and which, come 
               <br />
               what may, we mean to hold. These are a few 
               <br />
               outstanding examples of what other New- 
               <br />
               foundland delegations to London accomplished. 
               <br />
               Their accomplishments are no reﬂection on the 
               <br />
               calibre of the members of the delegation from this 
               <br />
               Convention. But it is certainly pertinent to point 
               <br />
               out to the country the great difference between 
               <br />
               these delegations of earlier days and that delega- 
               <br />
               tion of recent date. From 1857 to 1927, every 
               <br />
               delegation that went from this house to London 
               <br />
               went with authority -— the authority that is vested 
               <br />
               in members of a responsible government, elected 
               <br />
               by the people to represent, talk and act for them 
               <br />
               in matters of the gravest and most far-reaching 
               <br />
               concern. That is a fact we should not lose sight of 
               <br />
               -— it is the most signiﬁcant fact of the London 
               <br />
               delegation's visit. It sticks out like a sore thumb.

               Won’t we recognise it? Can’t we get it into our 
               <br />
               heads as a people that the thing that makes all the 
               <br />
               difference is authority? I repeat it — the authority 
               <br />
               that goes with being a government of the people. 
               <br />
               True, the delegates to the National Convention 
               <br />
               were elected by the people. True, the delegates to 
               <br />
               London - not counting the Chairman — were 
               <br />
               elected by the Convention, but we have no 
               <br />
               authority, they have no authority, to deal, bargain 
               <br />
               or otherwise engage in the legitimate functions of 
               <br />
               a government. Not so long ago we were told 
               <br />
               indirectly by members of the Bar and the Bench 
               <br />
               that we were what Mr. Bailey referred to as a 
               <br />
               “gloriﬁed debating society" —— and our delega- 
               <br />

               I am not surprised that Lord Addison said what

               same, that as real Newfoundlanders they made 
               <br />
               the most of their opportunity, when face to face 
               <br />

               our much—quoted and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">widelyvmisunderstood</span> 
               <br />
               terms of reference. At least ﬁve of them believed 
               <br />
               they were doing the right thing for their country, 
               <br />
               and were not to be hidebound by rules and regula-

               tions. I would have done the same had I been 
               <br />
               there. I have read their memorandum to the 
               <br />
               Secretary of State; and I see nothing in it that 
               <br />
               could be objected to by any Newfoundlander. To 
               <br />
               my mind the split in the ranks of the delegation 
               <br />
               is the most disappointing feature of the visit to 
               <br />
               London.

               And yet even without the authority of a 
               <br />
               government, and despite disagreement in their 
               <br />

               speed up certain acts of the Commission of

               <br />
               was already contemplating, and which, no doubt 
               <br />
               when accomplished, the said Commission will 
               <br />
               take the credit for, such as in all likelihood the 
               <br />
               reduction of the public debt by the application of

               The delegation was quite justified in arguing

               the case they did argue, even though they may not 
               <br />
               have had the authority. As Mr. Crosbie said, they 
               <br />
               asked for nothing that was not fair and

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reasonable,</span> No one in this Convention was look-

               cemed, we’ve had enough of that kind of talk and 
               <br />
               attitude of mind in this country ~— too much.
