               Mining Co. will have a production of 10 million 
               <br />
               tons a year. I am sorry we did not know of the 
               <br />
               1944 act.1 I claim that is taking $1 million 
               <br />
               revenue away from Newfoundland. Under the 
               <br />
               1938 act they were getting 10 cents a ton royalty 
               <br />
               plus 3% on the gross value of other materials. 
               <br />
               Now under the 1944 act that is changed, and we 
               <br />
               get 5% on the net proﬁts. I say we will get 
               <br />
               nothing. I am not giving the legal interpretation 
               <br />
               of the act, but I say 15 cents per hp is nothing. 
               <br />
               Here we have the greatest water-power in the 
               <br />
               world and the Commission of Government gave 
               <br />

               <br />
               foundland and 40% is in Canada. Three million 
               <br />
               tons would be our share. What does it mean in 
               <br />
               earning power? There will be no proﬁts tax. They 
               <br />
               will say they made no proﬁts. We had a job 
               <br />
               getting it out of Dominion Iron and Steel. Add it 
               <br />
               on to our present economy and it means $60 
               <br />
               million to $70 million a year; ten years from now 
               <br />
               the timber area and the Labrador Mining Co. will 
               <br />
               be instrumental in creating in Newfoundland a 
               <br />
               great asset. Do you know that they have to pay 
               <br />
               30% on mining machinery coming into Quebec? 
               <br />
               And in Newfoundland they get it free. We hold a 
               <br />
               trump card in getting it here instead of in Quebec. 
               <br />
               I have that from one of the officials of the 
               <br />
               Labrador Mining Co. The export of power should 
               <br />
               be given particular attention, and I am glad the 
               <br />
               Finance Committee has been instrumental in

               matter of water-power, I would like to point out 
               <br />
               that the company is given permission to develop 
               <br />
               power only in the area of Labrador. That is the 
               <br />
               only interest the Labrador Exploration Co. has. I 
               <br />
               am of the opinion that if and when negotiations 
               <br />
               are made to develop, no government of New- 
               <br />
               foundland would permit the power to be exported 
               <br />
               on conditions not advantageous to the country. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Why change the 1938 act to the 
               <br />
               1944 act, wherein it was changed from 10 cents 
               <br />
               a ton to 5% of net proﬁts? We were told that they 
               <br />
               were not mining men at all, but a bunch of fools 
               <br />
               to consent to 10 cents on iron ore; that it was an 
               <br />
               unfair tax. Bell Island has been paying 10 cents a 
               <br />
               ton royalty for a number of years. We were also 
               <br />
               informed on no less an authority than Mr. Tim- 
               <br />
               mins that possibly 10 million tons would be 
               <br />
               produced; at 10 cents a ton that would mean $1
