               Mr. Fowler Mr. Chairman, I contend that the 
               <br />
               amendment to the amendment was a political 
               <br />
               move to further confuse the issue, split the vote 
               <br />
               and thus assure a majority in favour of the 
               <br />
               original motion. 1 therefore reaffirm my former 
               <br />
               intention to support the amendment, and I would 
               <br />
               exhort all members to stick to their original 
               <br />
               decision to support the amendment proposed by 
               <br />
               Mr. Penney, and not to be swayed by the confus— 
               <br />
               ing amendment more confusingly presented by 
               <br />
               the learned member for Bonavista East... I am 
               <br />
               pleased to see that Mr. Bradley conﬁrms my 
               <br />
               opinion as expressed on Thursday last, when he 
               <br />
               says it would be ridiculous to conceive of a 
               <br />
               delegation proceeding to Canada without ﬁrst 
               <br />
               being informed of our own financial and eco— 
               <br />
               nomic position, a statement which should only 
               <br />
               further strengthen the argument in favour of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mri</span> Penney’s amendment, which in short just 
               <br />
               means waiting until such time as this Convention 
               <br />
               may chose to send a delegation. I contend that 
               <br />
               this resolution should not have been brought in at 
               <br />
               this time, ﬁrstly because it has sown the seed of 
               <br />
               distrust and misunderstanding among the mem- 
               <br />
               bers of this Convention at a time when they 
               <br />
               should be working in harmony towards the com- 
               <br />
               pletion of the ﬁrst and most vital task, the reports 
               <br />
               of the various committees, and secondly because 
               <br />
               in the ears and eyes of the public it will eclipse 
               <br />
               the facts that should be given careful study at this 
               <br />
               time. I feel, that if there are people in this country 
               <br />
               interested in confederation, and if we believe in 
               <br />
               democracy, we must at the proper time give them 
               <br />
               the opportunity to express their desires, and I 
               <br />
               think that had Mr. Smallwood awaited a more 
               <br />
               opportune time and introduced his resolution in 
               <br />
               a different spirit there could be little reasonable 
               <br />
               opposition. I must confess that I was not invited 
               <br />
               to the alleged confederate conferences, nor did 
               <br />
               Mr. Smailwood as yet make any overture to me. 
               <br />
               Probably I was considered too insignificant, or 
               <br />
               more likely he was aware of my attitude towards 
               <br />
               the whole scheme. I feel sure there is still some 
               <br />
               honour left, even at this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Convention</span> I suggest
