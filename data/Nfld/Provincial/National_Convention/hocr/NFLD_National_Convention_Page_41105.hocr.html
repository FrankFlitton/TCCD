               <br />
               had to provide all the ordinary services that New- 
               <br />
               foundland needed. That ﬁgure is a bit more than

               Mr. Wild, the Commissioner for Finance, es-

               timated when he appeared before us in a private

               session. I think he estimated something like $23

               <br />
               mated by Mr. James, the present Commissioner. 
               <br />
               I think Mr. James has it around $26 million, but 
               <br />
               what the Economic Report has done is to take the 
               <br />
               $23 million estimated by Mr. Wild and add a 
               <br />

               I am going to accept that $25 million, at least

               going to cost the government of the Province of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, if we went into confederation, 
               <br />
               the thing to do is this: take that $25 million, and 
               <br />
               take off from it those items of expense which, if 
               <br />
               we became a province, the provincial govem—

               ment would not have to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pay.</span> That is reasonable... 
               <br />
               Under confederation the provincial government 
               <br />
               has far fewer things to do.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The provincial government would not have a 
               <br />
               railway to pay any losses on. The provincial 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               pay any deﬁcit on the Postal Telegraph Depart- 
               <br />
               ment, and I remind you that between 1920 and 
               <br />
               1940, that department of ours dropped on an 
               <br />
               average of half a million dollars a year loss. The 
               <br />
               provincial government of Newfoundland would 
               <br />
               not have to pay the expenses of the Fishery 
               <br />

               <br />
               generally what we call ﬁshery matters, because 
               <br />
               these would be done by the federal government, 
               <br />
               and also the provincial government would not 
               <br />
               have to pay any interest on that part of our public 
               <br />
               debt which is known as the 3% guaranteed stock 
               <br />
               — $60 million odd ——- because the Government 
               <br />
               of Canada would take over that public debt, and 
               <br />
               therefore the provincial government would not
