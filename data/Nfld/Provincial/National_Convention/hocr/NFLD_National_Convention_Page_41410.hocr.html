               I am not one of those who consider that 
               <br />
               the particular form of government at any 
               <br />
               given time makes much difference of a fun— 
               <br />
               damental nature in the process I have here 
               <br />
               sought to indicate. Newfoundland has known 
               <br />
               many forms of government. We were ruled 
               <br />
               by ignorant, illiterate “ﬁshing admirals” 
               <br />
               from the decks of visiting ﬁshing schooners; 
               <br />
               by itinerant governors who were sent here for 
               <br />
               a few months each summer; by a much abler 
               <br />
               class of naval governors who used to remain 
               <br />
               throughout the year; by a form of repre- 
               <br />
               sentative government; then by a form of 
               <br />
               government which was a formless amal- 
               <br />
               gamation of representative and responsible 
               <br />
               government; by full responsible government. 
               <br />
               Now it is government by Commission. 
               <br />

               Governments come and governments go, 
               <br />
               but the people live on forever, their ex- 
               <br />
               perience becoming ever more enriched by 
               <br />
               vicissitudes, failures and successes. The 
               <br />
               natural resources remain. Governments are 
               <br />
               artiﬁcial and superﬁcial things at best. It is 
               <br />
               the genius of a people that counts. What will 
               <br />
               make Newfoundland great and prosperous is 
               <br />
               not this or that government, this or that form
