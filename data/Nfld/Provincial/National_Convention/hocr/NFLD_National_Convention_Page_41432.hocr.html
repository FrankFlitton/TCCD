               seemed to me that a foreign inﬂuence was loose: 
               <br />
               the spirit of Trotsky, the virulent harangue of the 
               <br />
               soapbox orator playing on the discontent of an 
               <br />
               unthinking and innocent people. If patriotism, it 
               <br />
               has been said, is the last refuge of a scoundrel, 
               <br />
               then it seems to me to be equally true that the 
               <br />
               setting of class against class is the last refuge of 
               <br />
               the political demagogue. When all else fails, 
               <br />
               when his case can’t be won on its merits, there is 
               <br />
               always available the red banner with the words 
               <br />
               inscribed upon it, “Down with the rich.”

               Political history shows that there is only one 
               <br />
               worse thing, and that is the setting of creed 
               <br />
               against creed. Let us hope that such a foul thing 
               <br />
               will never be allowed, as I am sure it will not be, 
               <br />
               to raise its ugly head in this country. The people 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland, in spite of Mr. Smallwood’s 
               <br />
               words, were always ready to put their trust in our 
               <br />
               businessmen. It has always been so in the past and 
               <br />
               it is just as true today, for have we not here in this 
               <br />
               very chamber many of them —— prominent and 
               <br />
               well-known businessmen, some of them even 
               <br />
               representing Mr. Smallwood’s hated corpora- 
               <br />
               tions? These men were selected by the people to 
               <br />
               represent them and to protect their interests, and 
               <br />
               I know, and our people themselves know, that 
               <br />
               these men will do their jobs as best they know 
               <br />
               how. Certainly, I admit that our businessmen and 
               <br />
               our Newfoundland corporations have made 
               <br />
               money, just as similar businessmen all over the 
               <br />
               North American continent have made money, 
               <br />
               and this applies, as I will show later on, even in 
               <br />
               that place of perfection, the Dominion of Canada. 
               <br />
               Many Newfoundlandcrs are well aware of that 
               <br />
               because we send them each year some $40 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mil»</span> 
               <br />
               lion. But let us be fair about this matter. Let us 
               <br />
               see if our wealthy men are the evil characters that 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood would have us believe. Is it not 
               <br />
               to these same individuals that a great portion of 
               <br />
               our people must look for wages? Union wages, 
               <br />
               sir, based on a mutual agreement between the 
               <br />
               worker and employer. Must we not also give 
               <br />
               them credit for keeping money in this country, 
               <br />
               circulating amongst our people instead of it being 
               <br />
               drained off by foreign corporations?

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I admit that in some cases the prices charged 
               <br />
               our people are too high, but whose fault is that? 
               <br />
               Is it not the fault of the present Commission of

               <br />
               glance, sir, for a moment, at some of the things 
               <br />
               he said. He went to great pains, and probably 
               <br />
               thought he was scoring a point, when he said that 
               <br />
               in 1945, 105 business concerns in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               made a total proﬁt of $ 1 5 million (and [think paid 
               <br />
               taxation of $5 million out of that), but did he also 
               <br />
               tell you, this Convention and the country, that of 
               <br />
               these concerns by far and away the greatest in- 
               <br />
               dividual proﬁts were made by the local branches 
               <br />
               of Canadian corporations and other foreign cor- 
               <br />
               porations, and that it follows that the greater part 
               <br />
               of these profits were shipped out of the country 
               <br />
               to Canada and other places? And did he tell you, 
               <br />
               or did he conveniently forget to tell us, that in that 
               <br />
               same year of 1945, 29 companies doing business 
               <br />
               in Canada — 29 -— made a total proﬁt of what? 
               <br />
               $250 million.

               Canada cannot afford to dissipate her re—

               venues much longer. I have already told you that 
               <br />
               Canada is in an unhealthy financial position, and 
               <br />
               that the time is not too far distant when a general

               cutting down of expenditures will take place if 
               <br />
               Canada hopes to remain solvent and continue its

               debate on this confederation issue, in committee 
               <br />

               that it should not have gone to Ottawa when it 
               <br />
               did, that it was interfering, so to speak, with the 
               <br />
               political mood of the Canadian government at 
               <br />
               that time, and that it had been intimated that the

               delegation should return to Newfoundland and 
               <br />
               come back to Ottawa again in September? What
