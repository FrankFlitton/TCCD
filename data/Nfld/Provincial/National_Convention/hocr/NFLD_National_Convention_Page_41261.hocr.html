               <br />
               believe that they may possibly be taking our 
               <br />
               Board as a pattern. I believe the Fisheries Board 
               <br />
               has done a good job, and taking that as a pattern, 
               <br />
               there will be evolved everything necessary for the 
               <br />
               orderly marketing of the ﬁsh catches of Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia and the other provinces. This, as I would 
               <br />
               like to explain, is an act which was drawn up in 
               <br />
               order to stabilise prices if the need arose, and to 
               <br />
               give the primary producer reasonable and proper 
               <br />
               return for his ﬁshery product. If on account of 
               <br />
               conditions in the markets the catch couldn’t be 
               <br />
               disposed of, they would see that the ﬁshermen 
               <br />
               did not suffer. The Board has the power to go in 
               <br />
               and buy the fish and then dispose of it and if 
               <br />
               necessary deﬁcits can be paid out of the Con- 
               <br />
               solidated Revenue Fund. Someone asked me a 
               <br />
               question, Mr. Chairman. I believe that the 
               <br />
               Canadian government marketed the apple crop 
               <br />
               from Canada and put certain prices on it at which 
               <br />
               they paid the man who got the apples. And then 
               <br />
               they went and they marketed them, and I believe 
               <br />
               gave some of them to England.

               suffer. That is the idea behind this Fisheries Sup-

               1944 and it became operative I believe in Sep-

               I feel that there are a lot of Newfoundlanders 
               <br />
               living in Canada who would like to see us join up 
               <br />
               with Canada. That was the sentiment that was 
               <br />
               expressed to me by quite a few thatl met during 
               <br />
               the past summer. We realise that if we go into 
               <br />
               Canada we shall have those social beneﬁts which 
               <br />
               Canada is giving her people — the family a1- 
               <br />
               lowances, which to my mind are good and very 
               <br />
               beneficial. It puts the money right in the hands of 
               <br />
               the people who need it most, and I certainly can’t 
               <br />
               see anything wrong about that. It would give our 
               <br />
               aged people, to whom Newfoundland doesn’t 
               <br />
               give the old age pension now until they get 75 
               <br />
               the pension at the age of 70. We would be able to 
               <br />
               participate in these beneﬁts.

               next tax to be out. At present it is 8%. We realise 
               <br />
               that at the present time prices are inﬂated. A few 
               <br />
               years ago, when I had the honour to have a seat 
               <br />
               in the Assembly, we were trying to run the 
               <br />
               country on about $9 million and of course it 
               <br />
               couldn’t be done. We just had to go out and 
               <br />
               borrow money, year after year. There were a 
               <br />
               good many deﬁcits, and after a while, when our 
               <br />
               credit gave out and we couldn’t borrow anymore, 
               <br />
               we lost our government. These family allowan—
