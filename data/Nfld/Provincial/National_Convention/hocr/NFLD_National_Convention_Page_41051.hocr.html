               Yesterday Mr. Hollett drew to my attention 
               <br />
               the fact that in the government’s estimate there 
               <br />
               appears an item which does not appear in this 
               <br />
               estimate of mine. It is in respect of the 3.5% 
               <br />
               loan, 1950. £569,796, and the 3.5% loan, 1952, 
               <br />
               £302,731, interest £30,539, or $123,378. I did not 
               <br />
               include that in my estimate of provincial govem- 
               <br />
               merit expenditure, and Mr. Hollett wanted to 
               <br />
               know why I had not done so. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I said yesterday that it might turn out that I had 
               <br />
               been wrong in not including it, and if 1 was wrong 
               <br />
               I would confess so frankly, and I do now confess 
               <br />
               thatI ought to have included that amount on the 
               <br />
               expenditure side, and I thank Mr. Hollett for 
               <br />
               drawing my attention to it. It is not an extremely 
               <br />
               important item. The interest on the one is 
               <br />
               £10,596, or $42,000 a year, and the interest on 
               <br />
               the other is £19,943, or $79,770 a year. Now one 
               <br />
               of them comes due in 1950 and the other in 1952, 
               <br />
               so therefore, if you have my estimate of provin- 
               <br />
               cial government expenditure by you, you might 
               <br />
               add in respect of the first two years of union 
               <br />
               $123,378 a year. And in respect of the next two 
               <br />
               years of union, $42,808. You see, after the first 
               <br />
               two years of union the ﬁrst loan would have been 
               <br />
               paid off, and there would be no further interest to 
               <br />
               pay on it, and we would still have two years to go 
               <br />
               on the small loan, which is $42,000 a year inter- 
               <br />
               est, and in two years that would disappear; so that 
               <br />
               averaged over the eight years, that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would,</span> be 
               <br />
               $41,000 a year average, or averaged for the first 
               <br />
               four years it would be $83,000. So as I have done 
               <br />
               it by averages, you might add to the expenditure 
               <br />
               for the first four years of union $83,172 a year. 
               <br />
               Mr. Fogwill Mr. Chairman, I want to ask

               <br />
               would be employed by the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada if and when we become a province, and 
               <br />
               in relation to their employment, to their years of 
               <br />
               service in the Government of Newfoundland.
