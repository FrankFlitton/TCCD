               and according to a reply which I received in 
               <br />
               answer to a question, I gather that as there is no 
               <br />
               statute governing these pensions, and as railway 
               <br />
               pensions are a charge on operating account, these 
               <br />
               payments would not be a charge on New— 
               <br />
               foundland as a province. In any case, Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood has not made any provision for it in 
               <br />
               his proposed budget. Under clause 17 of the terms 
               <br />
               it is deﬁnite, in my opinion, that the CNR and/or 
               <br />
               the Canadian government disclaim any respon— 
               <br />
               sibility for these payments. Therefore, sir, I must 
               <br />
               conclude that as from the date of union, those 
               <br />
               who are now retired and receiving pensions 
               <br />
               would be cut off; and all other employees, 3,000 
               <br />
               of them, would lose all the years of service which 
               <br />
               every one of them thought would be credited to 
               <br />
               them upon reaching retirement age —— 3,000 
               <br />
               employees with about ten years average service 
               <br />
               each, 30,000 years of pensionable service gone 
               <br />
               up the creek. It may be argued that under any 
               <br />
               form of government pensions might become too 
               <br />
               expensive and therefore could be reduced or cut 
               <br />
               out; in my opinion, under confederation they 
               <br />
               would cease immediately; but under a form of 
               <br />
               government national in character, I believe an 
               <br />
               opportunity could be had of setting up a pension 
               <br />
               plan which would be contributory. In fact some 
               <br />
               steps have already been taken by the railway 
               <br />
               unions in this respect, a plan to which the 
               <br />
               employees could contribute and therefore have 
               <br />
               some assurance of a retiring allowance or pension 
               <br />
               when they become too old to work.

               I have little more to say, Mr. Chairman. In the 
               <br />
               ﬁeld of agriculture, however, I think that our 
               <br />
               farmers are well aware of the implications of 
               <br />
               confederation and the effect that this form of 
               <br />
               government will have on their livelihood; they 
               <br />
               know much better than I do of the handicaps that 
               <br />
               this form of government would impose upon 
               <br />
               Newfoundland’s farm economy, and they will no 
               <br />
               doubt decide accordingly.

               In conclusion, I want to repeat that in my 
               <br />
               opinion if we federate, the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada will collect no less than $35 million a

               Mr. Chairman, I believe the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland are going to take note of the way we 
               <br />
               vote on this motion now before us; and I think 
               <br />
               every one of us is on trial in the eyes of the people, 
               <br />
               They are going to judge us by the way we cast 
               <br />
               our votes on this resolution. There are those who 
               <br />
               will cast their votes against the motion because 
               <br />
               they do not like the form of government it men- 
               <br />
               tions. There are those who will let their own 
               <br />
               personal wishes come first, ahead of the public 
               <br />
               interest. Big men will show their bigness by 
               <br />
               voting for the motion, even though the motion 
               <br />
               recommends a form of government that they do 
               <br />
               not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">like,</span> They will vote to give the people their 
               <br />
               chance to decide on this question. It is easy for a 
               <br />
               member of this Convention to vote in favour of a 
               <br />
               form of government he agrees with; but it takes 
               <br />
               a big man to vote in favour of a form of govem- 
               <br />
               ment that he disagrees with. When the vote is 
               <br />
               taken on the motion we will see how many big 
               <br />
               men we have here amongst us.

               I admit that it is fairly easy to think up excuses 
               <br />
               for voting against letting the people decide 
               <br />
               whether they want confederation or not. I could 
               <br />
               think up half a dozen excuses myself for not 
               <br />
               letting the people decide, and other members can 
               <br />
               also think up excuses. But excuses are one thing; 
               <br />
               reason is something else. I cannot think of one 
               <br />
               reason for voting against the motion, and I am 
               <br />
               still listening to hear any member give one real 
               <br />
               reason against the motion.

               The motion itself is very plain and simple. It 
               <br />
               simply asks us to recommend that confederation 
               <br />
               be placed before the people for their decision, 
               <br />
               simply that and nothing more. It does not ask 
               <br />
               members to be in favour of confederation, but 
               <br />
               only to place it before the people, Even the 
               <br />
               strongest enemy of confederation can vote to let 
               <br />
               the people decide on the question. If I were an 
               <br />
               anticonfcderate I would stand up here and say 
               <br />
               something like this: “I don’t like confederation. 
               <br />
               In the referendum I will vote against it. But I will
