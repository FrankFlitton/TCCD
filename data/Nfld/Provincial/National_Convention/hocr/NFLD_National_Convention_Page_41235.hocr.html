               one great part of Newfoundland, namely 
               <br />
               Labrador, than any man who ever sat in this

               <br />
               He has had a long and honourable record as a 
               <br />
               trade union leader. He was the second president 
               <br />
               of the Newfoundland Federation of Labour. He 
               <br />
               has represented Newfoundland at several inter~

               national trade union conventions in Canada and 
               <br />
               the United States. His own international union 
               <br />
               selected him to represent Newfoundland on a tour 
               <br />
               of the principal paper mills of Europe just before 
               <br />
               the late war broke out, and he travelled widely on 
               <br />
               that continent. Would it make Mr. Ballam a better 
               <br />
               man than he is just to make him a member of a 
               <br />
               cabinet? Mr. Crummey is a businessman, a 
               <br />
               former teacher and a former inspector of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schools.</span>

               He is just as good a man now as he would be 
               <br />
               merely by entering a government. Well, there you 
               <br />
               have the Ottawa delegation and in intelligence, 
               <br />
               ability, integrity, that Ottawa delegation would 
               <br />
               be the equal of any delegation that a government 
               <br />
               would send up <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there.</span> They were absolutely as 
               <br />
               competent to ascertain the terms of union as any 
               <br />
               cabinet committee or delegation. There’s nothing 
               <br />
               very special about a cabinet or a government. 
               <br />
               Men do not become smarter or abler or more 
               <br />
               intelligent just by entering a government. And 
               <br />
               what real difference would it have been made in 
               <br />
               our talks with the Canadian government if we had 
               <br />
               had some of the government ofﬁcials along with 
               <br />
               us? We have some able men in our civil service. 
               <br />
               But all they would have been able to do, if they 
               <br />
               had gone with us, was to supply information to 
               <br />
               the Canadian government. Well, we supplied 
               <br />
               them with all they needed. Is it suggested that the 
               <br />
               permanent ofﬁcials would have been better able 
               <br />
               to understand and assess these terms then we are? 
               <br />
               If the ofﬁcials were not needed for the purpose 
               <br />
               of giving information to the Canadian govem- 
               <br />
               ment, and if they are no better ﬁtted to understand 
               <br />
               and explain these terms than we are ourselves, 
               <br />
               what purpose would there have been in taking 
               <br />
               them along, or what did we lose by not having 
               <br />
               them? There were seven of us on the Ottawa 
               <br />
               delegation. If we had an elected government, and 
               <br />
               that government sent a delegation to Ottawa, then 
               <br />
               that government delegation would not have num- 
               <br />
               bered more than seven. And I have never known

               produced a seven-man delegation possessing a

               self down all he likes. Let him dismiss himself, if 
               <br />
               he desires, as being less intelligent or knowledge-

               sure he doesn’t. They not only did a good job, as 
               <br />
               he himself has told us, but they did as good a job 
               <br />
               as any cabinet or elected government could do 
               <br />
               any day. We got the very best terms that the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offer.</span> No Canadian 
               <br />
               government could possibly offer Newfoundland 
               <br />
               better terms, not even if an elected government 
               <br />
               fought for it. It may be smart tactics to say as Mr. 
               <br />
               Higgins has said, “Yes, the terms appear to be 
               <br />
               fair, but an elected government would get better 
               <br />
               terms.” That may be smart tactics, it may even be 
               <br />
               smart politics, but it has this serious point against 
               <br />
               it, It just is not true. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               And then I ﬁnd that Mr. Higgins said that it’s 
               <br />
               often used as an argument against responsible 
               <br />
               government, where do you get the men? Where 
               <br />
               do you get the men to run the country? But I think 
               <br />
               that Mr. Higgins was merely putting up a man of 
               <br />
               straw to knock him <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">down.</span> Nobody thatI ever met 
               <br />
               has used that argument. I know that we’re told 
               <br />
               that the argument is used, but nobody ever tells 
               <br />
               us who uses it. Newfoundland has the men all 
               <br />
               right. She has the men to run Newfoundland and 
               <br />
               she has men who could run Canada herself. It’s 
               <br />
               not any lack of men that’s in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">way.</span> It’s a lack 
               <br />
               of means. That’s what Newfoundland lacks —— 
               <br />
               not men, but the means to do the things that those 
               <br />
               men would like to do. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               And now I turn to Mr. Hzmington. I have 
               <br />
               already privately complimented Mr. Harrington 
               <br />
               on his speech. To me it was the best speech that 
               <br />
               he has delivered in this chamber.... I don’t agree 
               <br />
               with all of it, I don’t need to do that, but I can still 
               <br />
               think it was a ﬁne speech. I don’t know if Mr. 
               <br />
               Harrington was aware of the fact, but at one point 
               <br />
               in his remarks he put his ﬁnger right on the nub 
               <br />
               of this whole question... He said this: the Grey
