               Mr. Starkes ....I would like to make it plain to 
               <br />
               the people of this country about the old age 
               <br />
               pension of ﬁshermen. They are entitled to an old 
               <br />
               ‘ age pension when they get to 75 years even if they 
               <br />
               are earning up to $25 a month, and even if they 
               <br />
               have up to $400 in the bank. That is something I 
               <br />
               don’t think the majority of the people in this 
               <br />
               country realised before, at least in our region. I 
               <br />
               am speaking from experience because there are 
               <br />
               several in that district who applied for the pension 
               <br />
               and have been turned down on that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">account.</span> I 
               <br />
               would like them to understand that they can legal- 
               <br />
               ly get it. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hillier I am in the same boat as Mr. Starkes. 
               <br />
               I mentioned quite recently that I had a letter from 
               <br />
               my district — Lamaline — on the old age pen- 
               <br />
               sions, and by reason of the fact that this man had 
               <br />
               a small amount of money through selling some 
               <br />
               property he was denied that pension. 
               <br />
               Mr. Vincent I would refer you for a moment to 
               <br />
               page 22 of the report: “To be eligible for the 
               <br />
               pension a man must have passed the age of 75. 
               <br />
               On his death his widow receives $18 per quarter 
               <br />
               if she has reached the age of 65 years." I submit 
               <br />
               that this old age pension scheme needs revision. 
               <br />
               I regret that no practical recommendations to this 
               <br />
               effect are to be found in this odterwise very ﬁne 
               <br />
               report. It seems just tragic that so little considera- 
               <br />
               tion is given the honest, hard—working fisherman 
               <br />
               and his wife, who for years have toiled and slaved 
               <br />
               at their calling to give us this heritage of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New:</span> 
               <br />
               foundland. I am not proud, I feel ashamed that 
               <br />
               these ﬁshermen who have spent 30 or 40 years at 
               <br />
               the cod ﬁshery, and somenmes years at the seal 
               <br />
               ﬁshery as well, should derive so little from their 
               <br />
               labour. Something is wrong, something should be 
               <br />
               done by the people that legislate in this country. 
               <br />
               I submit that your Committee would have been 
               <br />
               justiﬁed in bringing in, and I am sure this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Con»</span>

               dation to lower the age limit to 65 or at least 70 
               <br />
               years, and augment the pension, or double it from 
               <br />
               the amount it is now. My friends have no bank

               <br />

               It was stated here yesterday that a man in need 
               <br />
               did not have as much trouble in some districts as 
               <br />
               he did in others to get relief. I wonder why? In 
               <br />
               speaking of relieving ofﬁcers I know they have 
               <br />
               instructions from the Department of Public 
               <br />
               Health and Welfare to keep down expenses, and 
               <br />
               I also know they have instructions to see that no 
               <br />
               man starves. I wonder how far on that road of 
               <br />
               starvation does a man have to go before he can 
               <br />
               get a note from the ofﬁcer to relieve him from 
               <br />
               that starvation? I think that there should be some- 
               <br />
               thing definite about it. All relieving officers 
               <br />
               should have their instructions and should treat the 
               <br />
               people in the same way. I know there are people 
               <br />
               here who are fasting since this is the Lenten 
               <br />
               season, but they are not fasting because the 
               <br />
               Church tells them it is right, but because they 
               <br />
               have not the food. I know instances of that, and I 
               <br />
               think there should be something tangible in order 
               <br />
               that people may get relief.

               In speaking of sick people, I wonder what a 
               <br />
               man has to do when he is sick before he can get 
               <br />
               relief? I suppose he has to get a note from the 
               <br />
               doctor, and then when that man recovers how is 
               <br />
               the relieving officer to know that he is ﬁt to work 
               <br />
               to cut off the funds?
