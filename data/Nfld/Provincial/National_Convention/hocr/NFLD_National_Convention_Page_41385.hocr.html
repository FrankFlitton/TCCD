               Come back with me now to the year 1855. 
               <br />
               Well, you know your history. Two hundred 
               <br />
               thousand people, and no industry except ﬁsh and 
               <br />
               sealing. No railway, few schools, but withal a few 
               <br />
               gallant gentlemen wrestling, by force almost, 
               <br />
               from Great Britain the right of self-govemment. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, I ask you, could these men see the 
               <br />
               frenzied efforts of some men in this House for the 
               <br />
               past few months, would they not cry out in scom, 
               <br />
               “Oh ye of little faith”? 
               <br />

               Yes, there can be only one form of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govemv</span> 
               <br />
               ment for this country, and that is self~govem- 
               <br />
               ment. For 15 years we have been politically dead. 
               <br />
               Men and women of 35 and under have never 
               <br />
               voted and it is for these I worry. They not only 
               <br />
               have not had political experience, but their minds 
               <br />
               have been poisoned by vicious stories. Was it 
               <br />
               done deliberately, I wonder? Their votes now 
               <br />
               will decide the issue. Will they snap out of their 
               <br />
               political apathy and jump into the breach and 
               <br />
               hold fast to their heritage, or will they allow 
               <br />
               themselves to be hoodwinked and lose it? 
               <br />

               Never before in the history of this country was 
               <br />
               there such a chance for us to sell our products to 
               <br />
               a nation who can afford to buy them —— I mean 
               <br />
               the United States of America. All history is tied 
               <br />
               up with economic strings. The destinies of 
               <br />
               peoples depend on what they have for sale and to 
               <br />
               whom they sell it, and I think an American dollar 
               <br />
               is still on a par with a Canadian dollar. Are we to 
               <br />
               get that American dollar, or must it go elsewhere? 
               <br />
               There is only one way we can get that American 
               <br />
               dollar, and that is by demanding by popular vote 
               <br />
               the return to our former status, by adopting the 
               <br />
               Statute of Westminster, and thereafter by doing 
               <br />
               business with people who will treat us fairly.

               just two or three words from Robert Burns. It’s 
               <br />
               Burns Night tomorrow. Burns was a common 
               <br />
               man like the rest of us here in this assembly, but 
               <br />
               he was a great mart, and loved his country as I 
               <br />
               hope every one of you gentlemen loves yours. 
               <br />
               And with apologies to the spirit of Burns, and 
               <br />
               with the changing of but one word in his brief
