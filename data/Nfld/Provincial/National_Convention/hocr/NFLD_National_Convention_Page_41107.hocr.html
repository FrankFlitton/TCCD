               Mr. Higgins <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Chairman, before we go into 
               <br />
               committee of the whole this afternoon, there is a 
               <br />
               matter that I want to raise, and I think this is the 
               <br />
               time to do it. Yesterday afternoon I had occasion 
               <br />
               to interject on two occasions when <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Small- 
               <br />
               wood was replying to Mr. Hollett; on both of 
               <br />
               these occasions I used the term “tedious repeti- 
               <br />
               tion of irrelevant matters”. On the second oc- 
               <br />
               casion Mr. Smallwood made a statement, of which 
               <br />
               I have not all the words, but I have sufﬁcient that 
               <br />
               I want to repeat them today. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Smallwood said, 
               <br />
               “I don’t want to turn on Mr. Higgins, but if I do 
               <br />
               someone will be hurt, and I won’t be the one that 
               <br />
               will be hurt. I am holding myself in.” As far as I 
               <br />
               am concerned that was a reflection on me, both 
               <br />
               offensive and unbecoming, and many of the 
               <br />
               members here today think that Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               has something on me. That is the general tenor of 
               <br />
               the remarks, and the impression they got. That’s 
               <br />
               not only here, but outside of the Convention, and 
               <br />
               I want a ruling on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that.</span> If <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Smallwood has any 
               <br />
               reflection to give on me, now is the time and place 
               <br />
               for him to say it. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Chairman I think I am in duty bound to 
               <br />
               hold that Mr. Smallwood was out of order, under 
               <br />
               standing order 31, which provides: “No member 
               <br />
               may use offensive or unbecoming words in ref- 
               <br />
               erence to any member of the Convention”. It is a 
               <br />
               fair inference to draw that the words were offen- 
               <br />
               sive, but if there should be any doubt, I think it is 
               <br />
               clear that the words were unbecoming, and if the 
               <br />
               words are either offensive or unbecoming, the 
               <br />
               member using the words is entirely out of order. 
               <br />
               I personally feel that the words were both offen- 
               <br />
               sive and unbecoming, and it might well be that 
               <br />
               there was a serious innuendo contained in the 
               <br />
               words. I am asked to decide whether or not stand- 
               <br />
               ing order 31 was violated by Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               when he employed the language to which my

               attention has been drawn by Mr. Higgins. I hold 
               <br />
               and rule that the language employed, while <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">per»</span>

               <br />
               which is laid on my shoulders. I feel that the 
               <br />
               dignity, and perhaps the integrity of the member 
               <br />
               for St. John’s East has been perhaps seriously 
               <br />
               affected by the language employed. Before going 
               <br />
               any further with the matter, if there is anything 
               <br />
               that Mr. Smallwood would want to say I would 
               <br />
               be very glad to hear from him. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, if it will please 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins, or reassure him, let me say that what 
               <br />
               I had in mind when I Spoke as I did yesterday, 
               <br />
               was nothing secret, nothing conﬁdential. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oer!</span> 
               <br />
               tainly had no thought that I had anything on him. 
               <br />
               What I had in mind, sir, was rather something that 
               <br />
               was extremely public, that all the members of this 
               <br />
               Convention and most of the people in this country 
               <br />
               know all about. That’s what I had in mind. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Well, if you don’t mind... 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Sir, I am making an explana- 
               <br />
               tion. So far as I am concerned no member of this 
               <br />
               Convention has had as much to take and contend 
               <br />
               with as I have. I suppose I am the only member 
               <br />
               here who has been called a “Quisling” and a 
               <br />
               “Judas Iscariot”. I did not object. I have been in 
               <br />
               this chamber in one capacity or another since 
               <br />
               1915, and I have learned to let things of that 
               <br />
               nature be as water on a duck’s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">back.</span> The man who 
               <br />
               called me a “Quisling” and a “Judas Iscariot” is 
               <br />
               perfectly well accustomed to calling and being 
               <br />
               called names in the past 25 years, and he rarely 
               <br />
               objects when anyone says anything to him, and I 
               <br />
               rarely object. What I had in mind yesterday was 
               <br />
               the continual process of being nagged at by Mr. 
               <br />
               Higgins. That’s what I had in mind, and so I said 
               <br />
               that if I turned on him somebody would be sorry, 
               <br />
               and it would not be me. Perhaps I would have 
               <br />
               been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sorry,</span> but! would not be the only one. What 
               <br />
               I meant was that I would turn loose on him a 
               <br />
               verbal barrage. I have nothing on Mr. Higgins 
               <br />
               except that since we returned from Ottawa I have 
               <br />
               been continually nagged at by him — in a very 
               <br />
               polite and mild way, but nevertheless nagged at, 
               <br />
               and I resent that. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
