               Mr. Smallwood They could certainly try to get

               horse of another colour. I would suggest that

               anything of that nature now come from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Con</span>

               vention as a whole. Major Cashin is chairman of 
               <br />
               the Finance Committee and he might be able to 
               <br />
               dig up a lot of that stuff better than we could. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Chairman, I move that the

               committee receive this report now, and take up 
               <br />
               the other one to—morrow. I think we have gone 
               <br />
               pretty thoroughly into it, there is a lot of informa~ 
               <br />

               <br />
               later when the Finance Report comes in. 
               <br />
               Mr. Neill will certainly have to come before us 
               <br />
               again. We can’t let him get away with the fact 
               <br />
               that we can’t get the cost of operating up to date.

               Mr. Ashboume Well, I would like to make a 
               <br />
               few remarks. I feel, sir, that too frequently con- 
               <br />
               cessions have been made to outside companies, 
               <br />
               and also too sweeping concessions. I believe that 
               <br />
               the vast majority of the people of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               have thought that the airports on our soil would 
               <br />
               have been real assets to this country, and not, as 
               <br />
               we find out today, a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">liability,</span> I rather regret that 
               <br />
               I see no reference in this report to Goose airport, 
               <br />
               because I believe that when the lease of that was 
               <br />
               made to Canada there was quite a spirited com- 
               <br />
               ment in the public press. The government should 
               <br />
               certainly have asked the people of this country 
               <br />
               for their views through the press before these 
               <br />
               terms were agreed upon. I would like to know 
               <br />
               whether these agreements are covered by leases, 
               <br />
               and how long these leases run? I would also like 
               <br />
               to have a copy of these leases if we could secure 
               <br />
               them. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I also note that between the estimate of the 
               <br />
               Hon. Commissioner of Public Utilities and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Pattison there is half a million dollars <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis»</span> 
               <br />
               parity, and furthermore I would like to see these 
               <br />
               figures broken down in both cases, so that we 
               <br />
               may know why there should be this disparity. 
               <br />
               Regarding a point that has already been men— 
               <br />
               tioned I would like to see the corresponding 
               <br />
               scales of landing charges elsewhere I think 
               <br />

               <br />
               important matterlike this through. I feel that there 
               <br />
               is quite a bit more information this Convention 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, I don’t want to

               delay the House, but I am glad Mr. Ashboume 
               <br />
               referred to the estimates. I remember the excite-

               ment in Gander the night that Mr. Wild delivered 
               <br />
               his last budget. It was generally believed in 
               <br />
               Gander that Britain was footing the bills on the 
               <br />
               operating losses of the airport, so on the night that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Wild delivered his budget, it was broadcast 
               <br />
               and everyone who could get to a radio was there, - 
               <br />
               and I remember very vividly the sentence that 
               <br />
               Mr. Wild used. It was this: “Newfoundland is 
               <br />
               primarily responsible for the operation of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gander’i</span> The word “primarily” struck me <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be«</span> 
               <br />
               tween the eyes. Why did he not say “New- 
               <br />
               foundland is responsible”, why “primarily 
               <br />
               responsible”? I knew the government did not
