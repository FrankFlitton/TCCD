               tremendous difference in the word “terms” and 
               <br />
               the word “arrangements”. And this Grey Book is 
               <br />
               called “arrangements”. Nowhere in the whole 
               <br />
               business does the Canadian government call it 
               <br />
               “terms”, nowhere. The Prime Minister’s letter 
               <br />
               takes great care on this point.

               Besides the Grey Book, which is not “terms", 
               <br />

               what else do we have to go on? In the debate, 
               <br />
               especially before Christmas, explaining these ar- 
               <br />
               rangements, much stress was laid by the pilot of 
               <br />
               the report on what so-and—so had said, suggested, 
               <br />
               hinted or alluded to at various meetings and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ap.</span> 
               <br />
               parently on other occasions. For instance, in con- 
               <br />
               nection with the Housing Corporation and the 
               <br />
               National Housing Act, it was said that the head 
               <br />
               of that Canadian organisation had said that some- 
               <br />
               thing might be worked out, but he did not know 
               <br />
               what could be worked out until we were a 
               <br />
               province. Again, on the matter of the service on 
               <br />
               the Cabot Strait and the matter of a super~feny, 
               <br />
               it was stated that on this matter Mr. St. Laurent 
               <br />
               had read something from a memo about details 
               <br />
               of such a ship, and in this connection Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood had asked Mr. Ballam to tell the 
               <br />
               house what he knew or had heard about the car 
               <br />
               ferry on the Straits. And Mr. Ballam had risen in 
               <br />
               his place to say that he had nothing to say on this 
               <br />
               matter, that it was purely an off the record con- 
               <br />
               versation between himself and the high Canadian 
               <br />
               ofﬁcial while walking along the street, and that 
               <br />
               he did not think it right to make any pronounce- 
               <br />
               ment under the circumstances. And he was quite 
               <br />
               right; for if the decision of our people in this 
               <br />
               matter of confederation is to be swayed by con- 
               <br />
               jectures made or heard in a conversation on the 
               <br />
               streets of Ottawa, then the whole affair has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in«</span> 
               <br />
               deed come to a sorry pass. It would seem to me, 
               <br />
               from the personal allusions made by Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood about what will happen when we are 
               <br />
               a province, that the Canadian officials were 
               <br />
               prepared to promise anything and everything, but 
               <br />
               to put nothing very much in writing. There were 
               <br />
               many other occasions when similar statements 
               <br />
               were made that could be quoted, but I have al— 
               <br />
               ready taken up far more of the time of this house 
               <br />

               than I ever intended at the outset; but the whole 
               <br />
               matter is so complicated that the further one 
               <br />
               proceeds, the further one is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">involved.</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Only one other aspect of the debate remains to 
               <br />
               be cemented on. It is in reference to the multi- 
               <br />
               tude of taxes that the Canadian people pay in all 
               <br />
               the provinces -— to their municipal government, 
               <br />
               to their provincial government, and to their 
               <br />
               federal government. Mr. Smallwood had 
               <br />
               reiterated over and over again that it does not 
               <br />
               follow because Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Is- 
               <br />
               land or any other province has certain taxes that 
               <br />
               we have not now, that under confederation we 
               <br />
               will still not have them. In other words, we will 
               <br />
               be the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tonal</span> and last province and we will be a 
               <br />
               law unto ourselves. There is an old saying, 
               <br />
               whether you do what the Romans do, when 
               <br />
               you’re in Rome, is a matter of choice. But when 
               <br />
               in confederation, you will do as the Canadians do 
               <br />
               and it won’t be a matter of choice, I can assure 
               <br />
               you. Not that the federal government will compel 
               <br />
               us to do certain things, raise certain taxes, but we 
               <br />
               ourselves will be compelled, we will have to 
               <br />
               compel ourselves to raise additional taxation to 
               <br />
               try and provide the services that the province 
               <br />
               under confederation is required to provide. Yes, 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, the CNR may take over the Rail- 
               <br />
               way, but the Province of Newfoundland will not 
               <br />
               be permitted to run on a separate track. It will 
               <br />
               have to shunt onto the main line on which the 
               <br />
               other nine provinces run; and where there is no 
               <br />
               precedent in our set-up we will have to take 
               <br />
               leaves from their books. To advance the argu- 
               <br />
               ment that Newfoundland and her people will 
               <br />
               remain tax-free to the same extent as they are now 
               <br />
               under confederation, is the height of false reason— 
               <br />
               ing. It is absurd. Even if we were to take the 
               <br />
               ﬁgures of Mr. Smallwood’ s provincial budget we 
               <br />
               would still have to raise more than $1.25 million 
               <br />
               in additional provincial taxation, besides that 
               <br />
               provided for, in addition to the great amounts that 
               <br />
               would ﬁnd their way from our pockets to the 
               <br />
               federal treasury at Ottawa. But other speakers 
               <br />
               have proved to my satisfaction at any rate, that 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood’s budget is set at too low a ﬁgure 
               <br />
               to run the province successfully and make both 
               <br />
               ends meet. 
               <br />

               In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I wish to refer 
               <br />
               to certain other aspects of this whole question 
               <br />
               which as yet I have not touched upon in any great
