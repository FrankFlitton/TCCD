               ing the general nature of it. What I proposed 
               <br />
               doing was this: to take the period from 1920 to 
               <br />
               1934 and deal only with the question of deﬁcits 
               <br />
               and surpluses. But I wanted to make it clear, and 
               <br />
               if I’m not interrupted by Major Cashin on Mon- 
               <br />
               day, I would undertake to complete it in 15 or 20 
               <br />
               minutes.

               Mr. Chairman I would like to remind members

               <br />

               <br />

               There is a deﬁnitely described period. And that

               is why, Mr. Smallwood, in reply to Mr. Hollett, 
               <br />
               in View of the fact that you proposed the dealing 
               <br />
               with the period 20-24? 34?

               happened in 1810 or 1762. There must be some
