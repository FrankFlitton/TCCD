               Mr. Ashbourne We know that the Commis—

               sioner for Finance, Mr. Wild, appeared before the 
               <br />
               Convention before he left and seemed quite ready 
               <br />
               to answer any questions put to him by the mem- 
               <br />
               bers. If the Commissioner did not have all the 
               <br />
               information available at the time, he could submit 
               <br />
               it at a later date. That would do away with the

               York a prominent member of the Republican

               table is given to show the possibilities that exist, 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland, at least in theory, of getting 
               <br />
               revenue from roads. We have therefore shown 
               <br />
               what the actual revenue is in such nearby places 
               <br />
               as Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and New 
               <br />
               Brunswick. Road revenue in Canada and the 
               <br />
               United States is a clearly defined thing. In New-

               foundland it is not. You cannot say exactly how 
               <br />
               much revenue Newfoundland is now getting 
               <br />
               from roads. You can only add up what they get 
               <br />
               from motor car and drivers’ licenses. That 
               <br />
               revenue would not exist if there were no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">roads,</span>

               What we have done is add in the customs duties 
               <br />
               received on gasoline. Unfortunately, there is no 
               <br />
               separation made between the revenue received 
               <br />
               from gasoline used by motor cars on the one 
               <br />
               hand, and customs duties received on gasoline 
               <br />
               used by ﬁshermen, mills, farms, on the other

               gasoline; added that to what was received on
