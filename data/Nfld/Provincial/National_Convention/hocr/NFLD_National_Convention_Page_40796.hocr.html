               Now, making every allowance for the 
               <br />
               momentum of war expenditures carrying on 
               <br />
               after the close of hostilities, and allowing for 
               <br />
               the gradual recession of this boom period, it 
               <br />
               is yet an obvious fact that our present revenues

               cannot be something dependent on war 
               <br />
               boom. There must be some other cause, and 
               <br />
               on examining the matter further we found 
               <br />
               that a great portion of our present revenue is 
               <br />
               coming to us because of the growth of our 
               <br />
               main industries. Now, these industries are 
               <br />
               wholly peace industries and are not depend-

               <br />
               is clear therefore that we can properly regard 
               <br />
               our present revenues as being anything but a 
               <br />
               result of war <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">boomi</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Their whole point is admirably stated in that 
               <br />
               final sentence: “It is clear therefore that we can 
               <br />
               properly regard our present revenues as being 
               <br />
               anything but a result of war boom.” That is what 
               <br />
               they ask this Convention and the people of this 
               <br />
               country to believe. There is nothing exceptional, 
               <br />
               nothing abnormal about these swollen revenues, 
               <br />
               they tell us. They are normal and ordinary, war 
               <br />
               or no war. And that being the case, as they are 
               <br />
               based upon a solid foundation of the normal 
               <br />
               growth of our basic industries, they may conﬁ~

               dently be expected to continue. The future is 
               <br />
               assured. Such is the burden of this report’s song, 
               <br />
               and we are told that it is unpatriotic to question 
               <br />
               their conclusion.

               Now it is worth spending a few minutes of our

               position. This so-called balance sheet is based 
               <br />
               upon a set of ﬁgures for a span of 50 years of our

               just a month ago in 1947. We are told that in those 
               <br />
               50 years our government spent a total of $500 
               <br />
               million and had a total revenue of $496 million. 
               <br />
               This left them short $4 million. But paltry as that 
               <br />
               deﬁcit amounts to, it is even less than that; for a 
               <br />
               sum of $20 million must be taken off that total 
               <br />
               expenditure of $500 million. This is $20 million 
               <br />
               of capital expenditure made by the Commission 
               <br />
               government since 1934, and deducting this from 
               <br />
               the half—billion dollar expenditure, it reduces the 
               <br />
               amount to $480 million for the 50 years. And that 
               <br />
               means, for the 50 years, a total surplus of $15 
               <br />
               million, instead of a deﬁcit of $4 million. And 
               <br />
               $15 million works out at an average surplus of 
               <br />
               $300,000 a year for the 50 year period.

               Such is the encouraging picture painted by the 
               <br />
               report. This favourable and solvent position, we 
               <br />
               are told, is really a normal growth — that the 
               <br />
               swollen revenues of the government are not at all 
               <br />
               due to the war, that they are the result of anything 
               <br />
               but the war. The war, they tell us, has little or 
               <br />
               nothing to do with it, and we can therefore leave 
               <br />
               the war out of it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">altogether.</span>

               Well, that is exactly what I propose to do —-— 
               <br />
               to leave the war out of the picture. I’m going to 
               <br />
               accept the figures and follow the ideas and 
               <br />
               methods used in the report itself, and draw up a 
               <br />
               balance sheet for 50 years of our govemment‘s 
               <br />
               life, exactly as the report does it. But so that I can 
               <br />
               leave the war out of it altogether, I’m going to 
               <br />
               take the report’s 50 years and push them back 
               <br />
               exactly eight years. That is to say, I’m going to 
               <br />
               take eight years off the latter end of the report’s 
               <br />
               50 years, and put on eight years at the beginning 
               <br />
               of the period. In short, I’m going to look at the 50 
               <br />
               years which began not in 1897, but in 1890; and 
               <br />
               ending, not in 1947, but in 1939. Thus we avoid 
               <br />
               the war altogether; and thus we can get a clear 
               <br />
               picture of our govemment’s balance sheet as it 
               <br />
               existed without being inﬂuenced by the war at all. 
               <br />
               Thus we shall see whether our present condition 
               <br />
               has been affected by the war.
