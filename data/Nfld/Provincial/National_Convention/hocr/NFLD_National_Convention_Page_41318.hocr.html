               That, Mr. Chairman, was 1934. I had a lack of 
               <br />
               understanding then. But to resume my case his- 
               <br />
               tory. Failing a job that year, I got the opportunity 
               <br />
               of attending the Memorial College, and a new 
               <br />
               phase in the education of a Newfoundlander 
               <br />
               began. I studied economics and political science 
               <br />
               amongst other things, and for the ﬁrst time in my 
               <br />
               17 years I began to develop an interest in the 
               <br />
               history of my own country and the story of our 
               <br />
               people. I read books which I did not know had 
               <br />
               been written, and learned of men whom I did not 
               <br />
               know had existed, and of deeds and events I was 
               <br />
               not aware had ever occurred in the very city I had 
               <br />
               grown up in, and the many places that were 
               <br />
               familiar only on the map during the day’s lesson 
               <br />
               in geography. And there grew in me, Mr. Chair- 
               <br />
               man, a slow, impotent rage; to realise that what I 
               <br />
               witnessed and read of February 22, 1934, was not 
               <br />
               something that had occurred to meet an emergen- 
               <br />
               cy of a moment, but was in actual historical fact 
               <br />
               the culmination of a process that covered cen- 
               <br />
               turies, and was as calculated and as ruthless as it 
               <br />
               could be, having regard to the various periods of 
               <br />
               history, and the sense of values that each genera-

               they left indelible traces of their genius on the

               place. During the next century a few small 
               <br />
               groups of settlers arrived who were imbued 
               <br />
               with the ideas of permanence, home and 
               <br />

               <br />
               annuals but to the perennials. The proof was 
               <br />
               given at the close of the second century, but 
               <br />
               the whole of the third century the visitors 
               <br />
               became so unimportant, and the settlers so 
               <br />
               numerous, that it was at last unanimously 
               <br />
               recognised that Newfoundland, instead of 
               <br />
               being half colony and half ﬁshing bank, was 
               <br />
               a whole colony like other colonies, and with 
               <br />
               a destiny of its own. The ﬁnal recognition of 
               <br />
               this fact ushered in the fourth century of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. The wheels of the chariot of 
               <br />

               <br />
               toises were in the shafts, and it took three 
               <br />
               centuries to arrive at the starting point of 
               <br />
               other colonies’ histories. 
               <br />
               There in a nutshell, in the words of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1D.</span> Rogers,

               In the records the history of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               began in 1497, when the history of North Amer— 
               <br />
               ica also began. But in the actual fact, the history

               of Newfoundland as a country beginning to go 
               <br />
               somewhere of its own, made its first feeble steps 
               <br />
               with the granting of representative government in 
               <br />
               1832, and its first real strides after the granting of 
               <br />
               responsible govenment in 1855. It cannot be

               no roads, no communications of any kind. Its

               <br />
