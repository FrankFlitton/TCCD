               My mind goes back to 1932—33 when, as it 
               <br />
               were, our backs were up against the wall due to 
               <br />
               the scarcity of dollars to run the country. Cannot 
               <br />
               the same be said of many countries of the world 
               <br />
               at that time? And did not a great many nations 
               <br />
               default? If we had gotten a little help at that time 
               <br />
               from om so-called good neighbours, there would 
               <br />
               have been no need of the National Convention 
               <br />
               today and Newfoundland would still have 
               <br />
               retained responsible government, and l have not 
               <br />
               the least shadow of a doubt but that our country 
               <br />
               would have been very prosperous and happy 
               <br />
               today. However, since 1933 a lot of water has 
               <br />
               gone under the bridge. We have had many ups 
               <br />
               and downs, many broken hearts and homes due 
               <br />
               to the world war; but thanks be to God we are still 
               <br />
               a great people and a great country; and, sir, under

               our government, shall I say, faded out. The

               terrible times we were then passing through. 
               <br />
               They have made much progress. It is true they

               have made many mistakes — what government 
               <br />
               doesn’t? But we should be ever grateful for their
