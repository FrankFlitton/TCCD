               I have to insist upon relating any conclusion 
               <br />
               as to the sound and satisfactory character of our 
               <br />
               economy to the minimum that I am prepared to 
               <br />
               be satisﬁed with. I have made the point before 
               <br />
               that we are a western people, a North American 
               <br />
               people. We have but to look across the Gulf to 
               <br />
               the North American mainland to observe the 
               <br />
               standard of civilisation that such a people are 
               <br />
               entitled to enjoy in this day and generation. If 
               <br />
               there are any means that we can employ to come 
               <br />
               by such standard, then we have every right to use 
               <br />
               those means, provided they are not in conflict 
               <br />
               with Christian principles and the democratic 
               <br />
               tradition. For a little while I had almost become 
               <br />
               uncertain of that. So much emphasis had come to 
               <br />
               be put upon our duty not to sell that rather amor- 
               <br />
               phous something called “our sacred heritage” for 
               <br />
               a mess of pottage, that I had almost come to think 
               <br />
               that a mess of pottage was something intrinsically 
               <br />
               evil. However, in the meantime I have had the 
               <br />
               opportunity of talking again with people to whom 
               <br />
               a mess of pottage has meant the difference almost 
               <br />
               between life and death at times <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> and I have 
               <br />
               consequently been conﬁrmed in my belief that in 
               <br />
               its rightful place a mess of pottage is something 
               <br />
               of considerable moment.

               In the most recent years we have come upon 
               <br />
               a new ability to supply ourselves with some of 
               <br />
               the public and social services of a western people. 
               <br />
               It is but little enough we have come by — and 
               <br />
               what we have come by we have come upon the 
               <br />
               hard way. We have been a long time in this island. 
               <br />
               Our history is as long as the history of any others 
               <br />
               who live in this hemisphere. We are as old in the

               <br />
               worked hard in this island - we and our fathers

               before us, and their fathers before them. The men 
               <br />
               who pushed around the capstans to stump the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               ﬁelds, and their sons after them who laboured so 
               <br />
               mightily to make those ﬁelds produce the little 
               <br />
               that they have; the men who decade after decade 
               <br />
               have wrenched from the ice ﬂoes their wealth of 
               <br />
               seals and from the surrounding sea its wealth of 
               <br />
               fish; the men who have trapped and logged and 
               <br />
               mined and done all such others things as men 
               <br />
               have done in this island to make a living; they

               In June past we came to the end of 450 years 
               <br />
               of history — for the most part years of grim 
               <br />
               endeavour to make both ends meet, years of just 
               <br />
               managing to keep body and soul together, years 
               <br />
               of doing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">without.</span> And at the end of four and a half 
               <br />
               centuries we have not very much to show for all 
               <br />
               our years and all our efforts. Three or four 
               <br />
               cathedrals, a few hundred churches, a thousand 
               <br />
               or so schools, a narrow gauge railroad that swirls 
               <br />
               across the island in a reiteration of fantastic 
               <br />
               scrolls, a few ribbons of road and an airport at 
               <br />
               Gander and in the red. Once upon a time we even 
               <br />
               had a house of parliament and a museum. These 
               <br />
               latter years, it is true, many more of our people 
               <br />
               have come to know the beneﬁts of what are called 
               <br />
               modern conveniences. But as far as a great many 
               <br />
               are concerned, the intimate institutions of their 
               <br />
               daily lives still are outdoor latrines, wood stoves, 
               <br />
               kerosene oil lamps, and carry in your drinking 
               <br />
               water from the well back of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">house.</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I have often wondered why it is that after four 
               <br />
               and a half centuries we have so little to show for 
               <br />
               all our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">efforts.</span> It is true we live in a gaunt land 
               <br />
               that maybe has not had the capacity to produce a 
               <br />
               higher standard of living than we have known. 
               <br />
               But I have often wondered if that is not too simple 
               <br />
               an explanation. There is a saying that they built 
               <br />
               New England out of hard times and codﬁsh. 
               <br />
               Well, we too have had the codfish. It will also be 
               <br />
               conceded that we have had the hard times. There 
               <br />
               is another saying about the fault being not in our 
               <br />
               stars but in ourselves. But there again the ex~ 
               <br />
               planation is too simple. There have been things 
               <br />
               in our history that have been beyond ourselves to 
               <br />
               effect, that have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contributed,</span> 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               In any case, it would appear that we have 
               <br />
               lately come to enjoy a somewhat greater portion 
               <br />
               than has been our historic portion... Some of us 
               <br />
               have come to be a bit better off than ever before. 
               <br />
               As a people, we have come to be able to supply 
               <br />
               ourselves with a few of the public amenities and 
               <br />
               social services of a North American civilisation. 
               <br />
               I am not prepared to accept as conclusive 
               <br />
               evidence of a condition of self-support less than 
               <br />
               reason to believe that we shall be able to maintain 
               <br />
               such personal and national standards for the nor-
