               Newfoundland, and it is natural that we ask our—

               selves what progress we have made through the 
               <br />
               centuries. A country may be judged by the nature 
               <br />
               of its educational institutions, for from these will 
               <br />
               come forth the men and women of tomorrow, and 
               <br />
               if we wish to do anything permanent for our 
               <br />
               country’s welfare we must be concerned about 
               <br />
               our schools. Our Department of Education has 
               <br />
               done and is continuing to do a good job. Our 
               <br />
               teachers are giving invaluable service for small 
               <br />
               pay. Our system of education is good, but it does 
               <br />
               not go far enough as our young men and women 
               <br />
               have to leave the country to pursue higher studies 
               <br />
               in arts and sciences. The time has come for the 
               <br />
               Memorial College to be raised to university 
               <br />
               status... At present comparatively few can afford 
               <br />
               to continue their studies, particularly students 
               <br />
               from the outports who, after paying their way at 
               <br />
               St. John’s for two or three years, ﬁnd it financial-

               <br />
               good. Our men and women attending foreign 
               <br />
               universities cannot get a Newfoundland outlook, 
               <br />
               and in many instances are attracted away from the 
               <br />
               country, whereas if they studied at a New- 
               <br />
               foundland university, they would become more 
               <br />
               keenly aware of the country’s problems and pos— 
               <br />
               sibilities, and they would remain to devote their 
               <br />
               energies to building a better Newfoundland. A 
               <br />
               university could also be of great value to count- 
               <br />
               less people, other than those seeking degrees, 
               <br />
               through extension courses... The granting of a 
               <br />
               charter to the Memorial College would be the 
               <br />
               most acceptable way of recognizing the 450th 
               <br />
               anniversary of our country’s discovery. 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne Newfoundland should have a 
               <br />
               university of its own.... We realise that there are 
               <br />
               those who can afford to travel to other cities and 
               <br />
               study at the universities of their choice; but there 
               <br />
               are some who have done this at no little incon- 
               <br />
               venience to themselves, and even at considerable 
               <br />
               expense. If there is a university in our midst, and 
               <br />
               should there be those who prefer to study <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">else</span> 
               <br />
               where, there would be nothing to restrict them. 
               <br />
               With a university here I believe there would be 
               <br />
               many who could be afforded an opportunity for 
               <br />
               studying for a degree...
