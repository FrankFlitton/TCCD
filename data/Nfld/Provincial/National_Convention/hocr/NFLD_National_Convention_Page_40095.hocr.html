               Mr. Hollett Before I can vote for the adoption 
               <br />
               of this report, I want to know why requests are

               made for action to be taken to get tariff conces- 
               <br />
               sions from the United States? I want to know 
               <br />
               why. Is it that the fresh fish industry cannot carry 
               <br />
               on longer at the present rates? If that is so, I would 
               <br />
               say adopt the report. But surely it must have some 
               <br />
               facts and ﬁgures to show that the fresh ﬁsh in- 
               <br />
               dustry is in danger of extinction by reason of 
               <br />
               tariffs placed on it by the United States. They 
               <br />
               must bring figures to show that. We are told that 
               <br />
               Canada, who has hitherto blocked our efforts, is 
               <br />
               anxious to help, the United States is anxious to 
               <br />
               help, other countries are anxious to help, but 
               <br />
               these things have to be debated before I am 
               <br />
               prepared to adopt this report. I am not in favour
