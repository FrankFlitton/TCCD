               were equal to the land Those great have walked 
               <br />
               among us who wrought some monumental works 
               <br />
               in their time. There were Newfoundlanders who 
               <br />
               were indeed giants in their day and generation. 
               <br />
               And they have bequeathed to us many things of 
               <br />
               which we may well be proud — a tradition of 
               <br />
               great endeavour to make the most come of the 
               <br />
               land’s meagreness; a native culture which the 
               <br />
               philistine may dismiss as a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘ﬁsh«and-brewis’</span> cul- 
               <br />
               ture, but which is of considerable consequence 
               <br />
               and meaning to us; and a structure, and a way of 
               <br />
               life, Christian to the core. Because our fathers 
               <br />
               were what they were, we are still secure in this 
               <br />
               island in the realms of the mind and spirit. We are 
               <br />
               still convinced that two and two make four. We 
               <br />
               are still cenain that there is but one God. In this 
               <br />
               island we still live in the presence of eternal laws 
               <br />
               and great truths that are true unto eternity. We 
               <br />
               have certain institutions that we revere; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">certain</span> 
               <br />
               principles that we would live by. We have tested 
               <br />
               them and have found them good —— as have all 
               <br />
               men who have tested them. We are jealous of 
               <br />
               their presence amongst us and we will not have 
               <br />
               them altered or removed. And, may I say in 
               <br />
               passing, that it has been a cause of much concern 
               <br />
               to me to learn that because I have laid much 
               <br />
               emphasis upon the economic in this Convention, 
               <br />
               that I have been misunderstood or misconstrued 
               <br />
               to mean that the economic is all that matters. It is 
               <br />
               rather amazing how intently some people listen 
               <br />
               on the bias. I am quite aware that there are values 
               <br />
               that are prior to economic values. I do believe, as 
               <br />
               do all men of reason, that not by bread alone doth 
               <br />
               man live. But I do believe also that the bread is 
               <br />
               nevertheless important.

               <br />

               for the advent of a national university. Because I 
               <br />
               hope that from such an institution there will come 
               <br />
               forth a new economic leadership that will achieve

               that from such an institution there will come forth 
               <br />
               too a new political leadership that will restore our

               faith in our own ability to conduct ourselves in

               <br />
               dignity. Finally, because I believe that from a 
               <br />
               national university there will come forth a greater 
               <br />
               company of scholarship than we could otherwise 
               <br />
               come by — a company who will deal competent- 
               <br />
               ly with this greatest challenge of our times, and 
               <br />
               yet contribute the full measure of its scholarship 
               <br />
               to the preservation of that Christian culture and 
               <br />
               way of life that are ours. For there are things in 
               <br />
               this island, Mr. Chairman, that do deserve to 
               <br />
               endure — things that are part and parcel of the 
               <br />
               good, the true, and the beautiful. And their value 
               <br />
               is beyond all time.

               that in the debate on the report of the Education

               Committee, I covered the ground thoroughly in 
               <br />
               connection with the further extension of the 
               <br />

               Mr. Ashboume gave his support to my remarks. 
               <br />
               There is no need to repeat what I said. The whole 
               <br />
               country is in full accord with the project. I think 
               <br />
               one of the darkest spots in the history of New- 
               <br />
               foundland has been our dire lack of education, 
               <br />
               and the fact that so many ofour youth who could
