               <br />

               far too critical of Commission of Government. In 
               <br />

               Mr. Harrington Before the report is received, I 
               <br />
               would like to make a few comments. I have been 
               <br />
               broadcasting quite a while and I feel I would be 
               <br />
               remiss if I had not something to say. I have no 
               <br />
               quarrel with the Broadcasting Corporation. 1 
               <br />
               have said a few hard things about Commission of 
               <br />
               Government and I have not been rapped over the 
               <br />
               knuckles The comments I would like to make are 
               <br />
               in connection with the staff. On page 1 —~ I chief 
               <br />
               operator; 1 operator. These are employed at the 
               <br />
               studio, and as far as I know they are at Mount 
               <br />
               Pearl. It had struck me for quite a while that the 
               <br />
               Corporation is understaffed. A broadcasting <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sta»</span> 
               <br />
               tion is not like a government department where 
               <br />
               you go in and see a lot of staff. Some people get 
               <br />
               the idea there is not much work to be done. Take, 
               <br />
               for instance, Mr. House, he is chief operator and 
               <br />
               is at this moment recording this broadcast. When 
               <br />
               it is all worked out on the basis of time, they really 
               <br />
               have a lot of work to do. We should particularly 
               <br />
               pay tribute for the way in which it is covering the 
               <br />
               Convention and it takes a lot of their time, par— 
               <br />
               ticularly the operators.

               <br />
               a little tribute to the Broadcasting Corporation. I

               Mr. Smallwood The first thing we did was to 
               <br />
               ask Mr. Butler to appear. He stated his case 
               <br />
               before the Broadcasting Corporation stated 
               <br />
               theirs. We knew nowhere else to go. We would 
               <br />
               need technical information in order to be able to

               <br />
               possibly have otherwise. Tens of thousands who 
               <br />
               have to vote on the kind of government they want, 
               <br />
               would have no way of knowing the facts upon 
               <br />
               which we are basing our recommendations, and 
               <br />
               upon which they perhaps will base their voting 
               <br />
               for the referendum. The Corporation should 
               <br />
               know how grateful we feel to them and I am

               disappointed we have not been hearing it from all 
               <br />
               sides of the house... A feeling has grown up that 
               <br />
               the Convention is lying on its oars and loafing. 
               <br />
               There are nine committees; three of them have so 
               <br />
               far reported; six others have yet to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">report,</span> Here is

               one of 143 pages foolscap and I am sure the

               Finance Committee will bring in 200 to 300 
               <br />
               pages. That is not done without hard work... 
               <br />
               Mr. Butt I wonder if the Committee asked the 
               <br />
               Broadcasting Corporation how far they were 
               <br />
               prepared to go in cutting commercial advertising 
               <br />
               in order to arrange their time to give individuals 
               <br />
               or other bodies the opportunity to broadcast. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood The answer is simple. A broad- 
               <br />
               casting station arranges some of its programmes 
               <br />
               as much as a year in advance... In connection
