               <br />
               will spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on 
               <br />
               the protection and encouragement of our 
               <br />
               ﬁsheries, and that in place of our present unfair, 
               <br />
               unjust, and oppressive system of taxation, which 
               <br />
               crushes the life out of our producers, we’d have 
               <br />
               the very much fairer taxation system of Canada, 
               <br />
               which places the greatest burden on the people 
               <br />
               best able to bear it. That is, in place of taxation 
               <br />
               which puts a terrible burden on our basic in- 
               <br />
               dustry, we‘d get one in its place that would lift a 
               <br />
               great portion of that burden off our producers. 
               <br />
               Mr. Butt is welcome to the belief that this would 
               <br />
               be bad for Newfoundland I believe that it would 
               <br />
               be the best thing that ever happened to our 
               <br />
               country.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Then Mr. Butt gave us a homily on the subject 
               <br />
               of morale — of faith in ourselves, pride in our 
               <br />
               country. I listened with a great deal of interest to 
               <br />
               this dissertation because he was expressing the 
               <br />
               view that I happen to share. Is it too much for me 
               <br />
               to say that more perhaps than any other man in 
               <br />
               this country, I have pointed to the desirability, 
               <br />
               indeed the need, for pride in one’s country? I was 
               <br />
               on the air every weeknight for nearly seven years, 
               <br />
               and I don’t think I ever tired of driving home the 
               <br />
               importance of taking legitimate pride in every- 
               <br />
               thing that’s good about our country and about 
               <br />
               ourselves. I delved into our country’s history to 
               <br />
               bring out examples of the ﬁne things our people 
               <br />
               have done. I roamed all around the world in my 
               <br />
               mind to find examples of Newfoundlanders who 
               <br />
               had made good in other lands. As Florenz Zieg- 
               <br />
               feld was said to glorify the American girl in his 
               <br />
               famous follies, so I tried to glorify Newfoundland 
               <br />
               and Newfoundlandcrs nearly every night for 
               <br />
               seven years. I take back none of that. I still think 
               <br />
               we are a ﬁne people and we can hold our heads 
               <br />
               up with the best of them. I still think we have very 
               <br />
               real possibilites of greatness within us. But here 
               <br />
               in this Convention we are not theorists, we are 
               <br />
               not here to spin fine theories, however true and 
               <br />
               however <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">beautiful.</span> We are here as elected repre-

               ticular purpose...1 A practical purpose. We 
               <br />
               would be false to our people if we allowed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">our‘</span>

               keep our feet planted ﬁrmly on the ground. I like 
               <br />
               to think of the remark Major Cashin made to Mr. 
               <br />
               Neill, the Commissioner for Public Utilities, 
               <br />
               when, a committee interviewed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Neill about 
               <br />
               Gander. When we tried to ﬁnd out deﬁnitely who 
               <br />
               was going to pay the operating loss on the airport, 
               <br />
               Mr. Neill made the remark, “I have faith, I have 
               <br />
               faith”. “Yes,” said Major Cashin, “we all have 
               <br />
               faith, but you can’t balance a budget on faith.” 
               <br />
               I’ ve never forgotten that. Neither, sir, can you put 
               <br />
               food in your childrens’ stomachs, or clothes on 
               <br />
               their backs, just by faith in a theory of national 
               <br />
               pride. What good would national pride have been 
               <br />
               to the 90,000 men, women, and children who 
               <br />
               suffered and starved on the dole in this country? 
               <br />
               When the icy blasts of world depression strike us 
               <br />
               again, when our ﬁsh is once more a drag on the 
               <br />
               market as it will be, when our income dwindles 
               <br />
               to a shadow of what it is today, our people will 
               <br />
               want something more substantial than pride of 
               <br />
               country. This very winter there are thousands of 
               <br />
               our men who can’t ﬁnd a day’s work, many 
               <br />
               hundreds of them veterans of this late war, who 
               <br />
               risked their lives for the brave new world they 
               <br />
               were promised. They demonstrated their pride of 
               <br />
               country but they can’t live on it this winter. They 
               <br />
               can’t balance their family budgets on it. Let’s be 
               <br />
               practical about this thing, Mr. Chairman. We all 
               <br />
               know our Newfoundland people are as ﬁne a race 
               <br />
               of men as you’ll ﬁnd in Canada or the United 
               <br />
               States or any other country in this world. They 
               <br />
               have magniﬁcent qualities of heart and mind. 
               <br />
               They have courage and endurance. They know 
               <br />
               how to work and they’re not lazy. The thing that’ 5 
               <br />
               wrong with this country is not our people; but 
               <br />
               there is something seriously wrong. 
               <br />

               The thing that’ s most wrong about our country 
               <br />
               is that there just are not enough of us. We’re only 
               <br />
               a handful of people, 327,000 souls scattered 
               <br />
               about the island living in 1,300 separate little 
               <br />
               towns, settled villages ~ the population of only 
               <br />
               one small city, if we were all put together. A 
               <br />
               mutual friend of Mr. Butt’s and mine said that if 
               <br />
               he took a week off, and practised hard, he could 
               <br />
               learn off by heart the names of our entire popula- 
               <br />
               tion —— if not their Christian names, then certainly 
               <br />
               their surnames. It’s a hard country to govern, for 
               <br />
               which to provide all the varied public services 
               <br />
               that are needed, because we’re so small in num- 
               <br />
               her and so scattered, scattered. And we have
