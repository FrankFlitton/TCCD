               surprised if I did, but nevertheless this is a report 
               <br />
               brought in by his Committee, and the intimation 
               <br />
               that we have from anything brought in is that it 
               <br />
               is public, I take <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it...</span> We gather that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> 
               <br />
               Smallwood, or his Committee, were advised by 
               <br />
               some person, maybe Mr. Pattison, that he advised 
               <br />
               the government that the fee for landing should be 
               <br />
               $300.... Do you know if that is a fact or not, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> 
               <br />
               Smallwood? It is very important. Did the Direc- 
               <br />
               tor say that we should get $300 for a landing fee? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I would like very much indeed 
               <br />
               to be able to answer Mr. Higgins frankly; how- 
               <br />
               ever, I can do no more than repeat what is in this 
               <br />
               last page of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">report.</span> I asked if $300 for landing 
               <br />
               should be charged, and he said, “I am not going 
               <br />
               to answer that question because it might interfere 
               <br />
               with Pattison.” I thought he meant Squadron 
               <br />
               Leader Pattison, who is the Director of Civil 
               <br />
               Aviation. Then I said, “Would you say whether 
               <br />
               or not that it is the opinion of the Director and 
               <br />
               other ofﬁcials of the Department of Civil Avia~ 
               <br />
               tion that it ought to be $300 per landing?", and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Neill, said “I certainly will not." Mr. Job said, 
               <br />
               “Would you say they expressed that opinion?” 
               <br />
               He said, “Minutes between Gander and myself 
               <br />
               are privileged.” That’s all I can say to Mr. Hig- 
               <br />
               gins. I will, however, say this, that a man who is 
               <br />
               an outstanding authority on aviation, and I do not 
               <br />
               refer to Squadron Leader Pattison now, stated to 
               <br />
               me that any amount up to $1 ,000 per landing, that 
               <br />
               is $2,000 per round trip, would be still an 
               <br />
               economic figure to charge the international air 
               <br />

               <br />
               statement, and I delivered it to a Commissioner 
               <br />
               who delivered it to Mr. Neill, or at least he told 
               <br />
               me he did. Anything up to $1,000 per landing 
               <br />
               would be an economic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">figurel</span> Now when I asked

               him if he had been advised by the Director of

               Civil Aviation, or anyone, if a figure of $300 
               <br />
               would be all right, he would not reply.

               <br />
               million a year operating loss, the first question is 
               <br />
               who is to pay that loss. It was to find that out , if

               we could, that this delegation was appointed to 
               <br />
               go and interview the Commissioner for Public 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Utilities.</span> We did not exactly find out, but I think 
               <br />
               that we are satisfied that whoever does pay, it will 
               <br />

               tion and Communications Committee in connec- 
               <br />
               tion with Gander, wherein it states as follows: 
               <br />
               “Mr. Neill, the Commissioner for Public 
               <br />
               Utilities, was asked why the Commission of 
               <br />
               Government had made this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">decision.</span> His reply 
               <br />
               was that it was because Newfoundland was a 
               <br />
               member of the Provisional International Civil 
               <br />
               Aviation Organisation (PICAO) which organisa- 
               <br />
               tion decided that Gander should be kept upon by 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland."</span> On that point you will remem- 
               <br />
               ber that I tabled a question to the Hon. Mr. Neill, 
               <br />
               and he writes me to say that he is in doubt as to 
               <br />
               exactly what I meant by that question, which I 
               <br />
               thought was obvious and clear to any person, but 
               <br />
               he said, “I have my office copy of the minutes of 
               <br />
               the meeting of PICAO. I cannot recollect any 
               <br />
               reference to Gander.” He goes on to say they 
               <br />
               attended as part of the British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegation.</span> In the 
               <br />
               sixth paragraph he says, “I do not understand the 
               <br />
               reference to PICAO -— that Gander should be left 
               <br />
               open." This report is excellent but this definitely 
               <br />
               must be an error. It is important that we have this 
               <br />
               definitely decided, because Mr. Neill said he does 
               <br />
