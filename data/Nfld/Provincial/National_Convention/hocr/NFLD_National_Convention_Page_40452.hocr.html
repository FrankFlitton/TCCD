               Mr. Spencer ....We are all agreed that the 
               <br />
               ﬁshery is likely to remain for many years the 
               <br />
               main industry of this country, and in the past we 
               <br />
               have invariably thought of the salt codﬁsh in- 
               <br />
               dustry. In this respect our thinking was wrong, 
               <br />
               but there is no need for me to enlarge on this as 
               <br />
               it has been dealt with very thoroughly. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               My experience of the ﬁshery has been that the 
               <br />
               ﬁsherman who got most out of ﬁshing, who made 
               <br />
               the most comfortable living, was without excep— 
               <br />
               tion the man who was equipped to go after and 
               <br />
               catch different types of ﬁsh. If a man was 
               <br />
               equipped to go after halibut, he went after them 
               <br />
               in the early spring, or one who had enough her- 
               <br />
               ring nets would go after them when they were 
               <br />
               plentiful, and in recent years he could sell them 
               <br />
               to the government bait depot or the local herring 
               <br />
               packets. Unfortunately, the bait depots have not 
               <br />
               the refrigeration or storage capacity to handle all 
               <br />
               the herring that can be caught. Then when the 
               <br />
               time of the year came for salmon he went after 
               <br />
               them; the same is true of lobster and mackerel, 
               <br />
               and if he had a harpoon aboard of his boat, and 
               <br />
               was lucky, he might add a swordﬁsh to his catch; 
               <br />
               and he only went after cod when none of the other 
               <br />
               ﬁsh were available. In this way if the price was 
               <br />
               low for any one type of ﬁsh, he very likely made 
               <br />
               up for it on the other types. For this reason I 
               <br />
               cannot quite agree with the table in Appendix B, 
               <br />
               which draws a comparison between the catches 
               <br />
               of the inshore and deep-sea ﬁsherman.1 l have no 
               <br />
               doubt it is accurate as far as codﬁsh is concerned, 
               <br />
               but it does not give the true picture, as many of 
               <br />
               those who are classed as inshore ﬁshermen catch 
               <br />
               other ﬁsh besides cod. This may not apply to all 
               <br />
               parts of our coast, as there may be sections where 
               <br />
               they catch only cod.

               need for new industries, but to me our greatest

               enumerate the ills and shortcomings that have

               Newfoundlander — whether layman or ﬁsher- 
               <br />
               man —— should have a chance to study and closely

               follow this report. The government should put it 
               <br />
               out in pamphlet form and send a copy to every 
               <br />

               <br />
               room for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thought,</span> I was forcibly struck with the 
               <br />
               great differences in the export of our ﬁsh during 
               <br />
               the past and at present. We find, for example, in 
               <br />
               1908-09 the export of salt cod was 1,732,387 
               <br />
               quintals. Whilst I know that two of our markets 
               <br />
               - Italy and Greece — are in the doldrums today, 
               <br />
               yet we ﬁnd that in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1945</span> the export of our saltfish 
               <br />
               was 1,058,933, a decrease of 673,454 quintals, or 
               <br />
               a loss of over $10 million at 1945 prices. Was 
               <br />
               there a market for that ﬁsh, and we did have the 
               <br />
               ﬁsh to supply it, or have we lost the markets 
               <br />
               where we marketed that extra 700,000 quintals of 
               <br />
               ﬁsh? I think the time for stocktaking in our 
               <br />
               primary industry was long overdue. Another 40 
               <br />
               years at the rate we are going will find us without 
               <br />
               any markets...
