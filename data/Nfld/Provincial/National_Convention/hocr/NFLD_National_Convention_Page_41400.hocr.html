               Mr. Spencer Mr. Chairman, in rising to speak

               on the motion of Mr. Higgins now before the 
               <br />
               Chair, let me say at the outset that I intend to 
               <br />
               support the motion, but it does not necessarily 
               <br />
               follow that I think either of the forms of govern- 
               <br />
               ment now before the House the best form for this 
               <br />
               country.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I do not think responsible government, as it 
               <br />
               existed prior to 1934, would be the best form for 
               <br />
               this country. First, because I do not see how 
               <br />
               320,000 people scattered over 150,000 square 
               <br />
               miles of territory can be expected to raise revenue 
               <br />
               enough to give them the public and social <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ser*</span> 
               <br />
               vices they need and will demand, and still allow 
               <br />
               them enough to attain the standard of living en- 
               <br />
               joyed by the peoples of the North American 
               <br />
               continent. And secondly, if we return to self- 
               <br />
               government, we shall still have to raise the bulk 
               <br />
               of our revenue by the system of indirect taxation, 
               <br />
               which to me is unsound and unfair. Thirdly, with 
               <br />
               our small population, I fail to see how we can 
               <br />
               expect to have any large internal industries. Let 
               <br />
               me explain what I mean When I worked on the 
               <br />
               Agriculture Committee of this Convention, we 
               <br />
               took up with the departmental heads concerned 
               <br />
               the question of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fertilisers.</span> We inquired if it was 
               <br />
               possible to manufacture fertilisers in this country 
               <br />
               cheaper than we could import them; we were 
               <br />
               informed that most of the ingredients would have 
               <br />
               to be imported, but that the real drawback to their 
               <br />
               manufacture in this country was the fact that the 
               <br />
               amount of fertilisers consumed in this country 
               <br />
               was not large enough to warrant their manufac- 
               <br />
               ture on such a scale as would make it proﬁtable. 
               <br />
               Also the Mining Committee advises us that we 
               <br />
               have on the west coast all the ingredients that go 
               <br />
               into the making of cement in close proximity to 
               <br />
               each other, and the only reason I can see why we 
               <br />
               do not have a cement manufacturing plant is 
               <br />
               because the comparatively small amount of ce— 
               <br />
               ment that would be consumed in the country 
               <br />
               yearly would not be great enough to allow it to 
               <br />
               be worked <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proﬁtably,</span> Neither do I consider the
