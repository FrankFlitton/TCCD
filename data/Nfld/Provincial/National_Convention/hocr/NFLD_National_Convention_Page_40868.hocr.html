               I am representing men from St. Brendan’s in

               baby bonus they do not tax the poor; they take it 
               <br />
               out of the rich. I would like to ask Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood, who make the rich rich? Is it not the 
               <br />
               miners down in the mines in Buchans? Is it not 
               <br />
               the ﬁsherman on the Labrador? Is it not the men 
               <br />
               who fell the trees? Are not these the men who 
               <br />
               make rich men rich? If you increase taxation to a 
               <br />
               certain point, beyond saturation point, you are 
               <br />
               making the poor man a darn sight poorer. That is 
               <br />
               what you are trying to ram down into our throats, 
               <br />
               that false doctrine, Mr. Smallwood. I move the

               rich are made by the poor, and family allowances 
               <br />

               the matter which Mr. Hollett brought up, we had 
               <br />
               a frenzied oration from Mr. Smallwood about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">St.</span> 
               <br />
               Brendan‘s the other day. I believe actually while 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood was reading that letter, a 
               <br />
               gentleman was coming to town from St. 
               <br />
               Brendan’ 5 having made a purchase of squid down 
               <br />
               there; he paid on account of the squid he pur- 
               <br />
               chased $4,500; he had not paid the full amount. I 
               <br />
               do not know if Mr. Smallwood was deliberately 
               <br />
               misleading, or whether Mrs. White was pulling 
               <br />
               his leg. Someone was in error. When you refused 
               <br />
               to allow him to read the letter, he then gave it as

               <br />
