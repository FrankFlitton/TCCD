               Mr. Northcott would be able to pay a pretty good 
               <br />
               baby bonus in the district of Lewisporte. Now I 
               <br />
               think I’ve come to the end ofwhat I’ve got to say. 
               <br />
               And I believe that we should not pass these terms. 
               <br />
               There’s been a lot of talk about them, and I think 
               <br />
               the time has come for our people to know just 
               <br />
               what they are. And I believe that we should 
               <br />
               debate them in every way, bit by bit, even if we’re 
               <br />
               here till Tib’s Eve, and thrash it out so that our 
               <br />
               people can understand what it’s all about. I know 
               <br />
               that our people today are looking for a promised 
               <br />
               land. It’s something they’ve heard so much 
               <br />
               about, a land of lower taxes; but, what is it going 
               <br />
               to gain as tomorrow if we take off the customs 
               <br />
               tax, put on a sales tax and a superduper excise 
               <br />
               tax? We can easily have a family allowance in 
               <br />
               this country and old age pensions if we wish to 
               <br />
               take 8% out of every dollar that goes around, no 
               <br />
               odds how many times it goes around in this 
               <br />
               country. I’m afraid when you come to weigh up 
               <br />
               the 117,000 children and weigh up what money 
               <br />
               they’re taking, we have no way to ﬁnd out. One 
               <br />
               record we couldn’t ﬁnd in this country as we’ve 
               <br />
               been going through our work, is the amount of 
               <br />
               business that’s done in the country. Because you 
               <br />
               can’t gauge the money in a country by looking at 
               <br />
               what it sends out and brings in. You have to have 
               <br />
               a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bird’sveye</span> view of how many times that dollar 
               <br />
               goes around, when you’re paying taxes on the 
               <br />
               dollar that’s moving around. So Mr. Chairman 
               <br />
               and gentlemen, I believe that we’re going to learn 
               <br />
               a lot from this Ottawa vacation. So let’s have

               <br />

               <br />
               day, we debated family allowances. The next 
               <br />
               item is old age pensions and pensions for the 
               <br />
               blind. The item after that is unemployment in-
