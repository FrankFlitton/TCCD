               Mr. Ashbourne It was very enlightening, and as 
               <br />
               far as I am concerned I realise that some of the 
               <br />
               assets of Newfoundland have been put on the 
               <br />
               other side to look after the debt. It is a small 
               <br />
               country with a small debt and small assets, 
               <br />
               whereas in a big country like Canada it would 
               <br />
               naturally be expected that they have big assets. 
               <br />
               There are other countries contiguous to Canada 
               <br />
               that have a bigger debt than Canada has, and on 
               <br />
               the other side as well, but that does not debar 
               <br />
               them from raising money. If they are in a liquid 
               <br />
               position, it is the assets they have that you have 
               <br />
               to look upon.... Furthermore, I would like to ask 
               <br />
               Major Cashin, since he gave us the ﬁgures of the 
               <br />
               per capita debt that we would be called upon to 
               <br />
               pay, if he would kindly give us the amount of 
               <br />
               interest at 21/2% that is on that money over in the 
               <br />
               Bank of England.
