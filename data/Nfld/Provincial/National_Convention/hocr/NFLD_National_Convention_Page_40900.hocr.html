               with ﬁsh for many years now, I feel convinced 
               <br />
               that our system here in Newfoundland has been 
               <br />
               better than the Canadian system of marketing. To 
               <br />
               bear that out, there was a delegation this summer 
               <br />
               from Nova Scotia to endeavour to ﬁnd out the 
               <br />
               basis of our set—up so that they could set one up 
               <br />
               in Canada. Since then we have gone further; we 
               <br />
               have now the Codﬁsh Exporters Limited,l or 
               <br />
               some such name, and instead of various groups 
               <br />
               or committees, we have now one marketing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or«</span>

               <br />
               interference with Newfoundland. We may derive 
               <br />
               beneﬁts! We are away ahead of them so far. And 
               <br />
               as long as it cannot be interfered with, that is

               Mr. Bailey I wonder if Mr. Smallwood would 
               <br />
               read page 115 — Quebec, New Brunswick and

               Quebec: The Canadian Fisheries Act and

               regulations made thereunder apply to all 
               <br />
               ﬁsheries. There is also certain provincial 
               <br />
               legislation. By an arrangement made in 1922, 
               <br />
               the administration of all such legislation and 
               <br />

               <br />
               May I say that is what is known as a gentlemen’s

               agreement between Quebec and the federal 
               <br />
               government made in 1922 under which the 
               <br />
               Province of Quebec was permitted by the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada to administer its own 
               <br />
               ﬁsheries at its own expense. It did not want any 
               <br />
               money from the federal government -—~ they did 
               <br />
               not want anyone to administer their ﬁsheries but 
               <br />
               themselves.

               Mr. Bailey You all know we may go into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cons</span> 
               <br />
               federation. I do not say I will have anything to do 
               <br />
               with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> I may be ﬁshing at the time, but whoever 
               <br />
               has to do with the negotiating of it will have to be 
               <br />
               very careful with our ﬁsheries. I refer here again 
               <br />
               to British Columbia. On the coast of Vancouver 
               <br />
               Island in 1935 certain capitalistic concerns got 
               <br />
               control from the Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government.</span> I was not 
               <br />
               able to get the whole story; but I found out that 
               <br />
               these trapmen had gotten control of the waters 
               <br />
               within the three mile limit and all the handline 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen were not allowed inside it. I was told 
               <br />
               that RCMP were patrolling the coast. We have 
               <br />
               full control over our fisheries, something I 
               <br />
               believe we always had. I know something of the 
               <br />
               rows between the trawlers and the handline men. 
               <br />
               I was told how the trawlers had to get outside the 
               <br />
               three mile limit and stay outside. Some of them 
               <br />
               had been trawling since l905-06. Should the 
               <br />
               people vote for confederation, I want them to 
               <br />
               keep this in mind. There should be a clause 
               <br />
               whereby the federal government will not be able 
               <br />
               to lease any part of our waters to the detriment of 
               <br />
               the ﬁshermen. I want our people, in negotiating 
               <br />
               for Newfoundland, whatever they do, not to turn 
               <br />
               our ﬁsheries over to remote control. We wzmt to 
               <br />
               see that the rights we have always fought for are 
               <br />
               kept for us 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood That is very good advice for the 
               <br />
               future government of Newfoundland or someone 
               <br />
               in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">future,</span> I may say, the practice in the Depart- 
               <br />
               ment of Fisheries of Canada is this: any regula- 
               <br />
               tions they make governing the ﬁsheries all the 
               <br />
               practical details of ﬁshery, that is left entirely 
               <br />
               completely and absolutely to the province. It is 
               <br />
               only in other ﬁelds that the federal department 
               <br />
               exercises its jurisdiction. For instance, you will 
               <br />
               ﬁnd in Quebec and the three Maritime Provinces 
               <br />
               it is their practice to regulate the seasons of the 
               <br />
               year you may ﬁsh and the distance each ﬁshing 
               <br />
               gear must be apart from the other; but that is upon 
               <br />
               the advice of the local authorities in the provin- 
               <br />
               ces, the local interests concerned. So that if ever
