               Mr. Higgins Mr. Chairman, following the 
               <br />
               remarks a few moments ago by Mr. Smallwood, 
               <br />
               I wonder if you would enlighten the Convention, 
               <br />
               as well as myself, on that part of the memoran- 
               <br />
               dum in which the British authorities were asked 
               <br />
               as to forms of government, and the answer you 
               <br />
               brought back that forms of government other than 
               <br />
               responsible government and retention of Com- 
               <br />
               mission could be recommended. What I want to 
               <br />
               know is, were federal unions discussed, and did 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">you.</span> get permission, or were you advised that 
               <br />
               federal union is a proper form of government that 
               <br />
               this Convention could recommend?

               Mr. Chairman I am not certain whether the 
               <br />
               term “federal union” was mentioned at all.

               Mr. Hollett The point raised by Mr. Higgins 
               <br />
               was definitely dealt with by the delegation in the 
               <br />
               conversations, and that is one of the points which 
               <br />
               I made yesterday, that you cannot get a true 
               <br />
               perspective on that report without knowing ex- 
               <br />
               actly what was said. It is all very well for Lord 
               <br />
               Addison to sit down and write an answer to a 
               <br />
               question. It is quite another thing when that per- 
               <br />
               son is asking questions thereon and getting 
               <br />
               replies. I still maintain that the Convention 
               <br />
               which sent us over there should have the right of 
               <br />
               access to the conversations which took place 
               <br />
               between the delegates and Lord Addison and 
               <br />
               Dominions Ofﬁce. I say that with due regard to 
               <br />
               the rule made by you yesterday, and I have a right 
               <br />
               to disagree with any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rule.</span> I trust we are still 
               <br />
               democratic in this country.

               Mr. Chairman The simplest way is to ask

               There has been an impression given by some

               <br />
               Great Britain can, within the last two years, give

               out freely, and without any hope of ever getting

               <br />
               we got in 1933 to 1940. That is not the treatment 
               <br />
               of the English or Irish or Scotch people. It was 
               <br />
               the treatment of the people in Dominions Ofﬁce, 
               <br />
               who know no more about this country than they 
               <br />
               know about Burma, India and other countries that 
               <br />
               have been under British rule. One man in that 
               <br />
               Dominions Ofﬁce wanted to know where we sent 
               <br />
               our saltﬁsh — was it to Belgium or Holland? 
               <br />
               There’s nothing wrong with the English, Irish or 
               <br />
               Scotch people. They know nothing whatever 
               <br />
               about the political position in this country. We 
               <br />
               have never publicised it enough ourselves. We
