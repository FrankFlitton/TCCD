               In 1933 the Amulree report was concealed 
               <br />
               from the people until within a few days of the 
               <br />
               opening of the legislature which destroyed their

               <br />
               delay enough. In the final analysis, even if our 
               <br />
               present ﬁnancial position is found to be fairly 
               <br />
               satisfactory, is that the last word? Is it suggested 
               <br />
               that in such case no inquiries are to be made of 
               <br />
               Canada, or of the United Kingdom or of anyone? 
               <br />

               <br />
               alone? Are the people to have no choice? That 
               <br />
               would be a repetition of the vicious scheme of 
               <br />
               1933. It would be a clear breach of fundamental 
               <br />
               political morality. It would violate, nay, it would 
               <br />
               defeat both the spirit and the letter of the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion Act of 1946. It would be an arrogant deter- 
               <br />
               mination of the people’s destinies in the dark, a 
               <br />
               determination which would be bitterly resented 
               <br />
               by them, for the supporters of responsible 
               <br />
               government are not in an overwhelming majority
