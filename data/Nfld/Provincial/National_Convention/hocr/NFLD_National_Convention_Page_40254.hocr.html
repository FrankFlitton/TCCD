               Mr. Starkes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,...I</span> understand that I do not enjoy 
               <br />
               the ancient rights and privileges that I once did 
               <br />
               when I was an elected representative during 
               <br />
               responsible government. I know I can be sued for 
               <br />
               making statements contrary to the law of the land, 
               <br />
               but my ﬁrst statement on roads in this country is 
               <br />
               this. It is my ﬁrm opinion that practically all roads 
               <br />
               built so far have been undertaken through pull 
               <br />
               with the government in power at the time. The 
               <br />
               report should make the head of every member of 
               <br />
               this Convention hang in shame, to see how such 
               <br />
               large sums collected from all over the country 
               <br />
               have been spent on such small territory as the 
               <br />
               Avalon Peninsula. I feel ashamed after reading 
               <br />
               this report, and seeing how and where the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hard</span> 
               <br />
               earned revenue collected from the actual 
               <br />
               producers of this country has been spent; and in 
               <br />
               the same spirit I feel that the men sent here by 
               <br />
               other districts, including the men representing the 
               <br />
               districts that have received such great beneﬁts, 
               <br />
               actually do feel ashamed, when they see how 
               <br />
               unfairly the majority of them has been treated I 
               <br />
               must refer to a statement made yesterday by Mr. 
               <br />
               Gordon Higgins... His statement hit me hard, and 
               <br />
               I am compelled to take exception to it. He said, 
               <br />
               when talking on roads, “Avalon first and the rest 
               <br />
               of the country after. We bow the knee to nobody 
               <br />
               as far as that is concerned.” I certainly give Mr. 
               <br />
               Higgins great credit for making that statement. Is 
               <br />
               there anything he could say that would make him 
               <br />
               more popular on the Avalon Peninsula? But are 
               <br />
               we, the representatives sent here by the actual 
               <br />
               producers, the actual salt of the earth (and we all 
               <br />
               know what that means) from the districts where 
               <br />
               roads are unknown, are we going to come here 
               <br />
               and still allow that thing to go on - “Avalon first 
               <br />
               and the rest of the country afterwards”? 
               <br />
               Gentlemen, if all were of my mind, we would see 
               <br />
               that it would be equal rights for all, and not 
               <br />
               special rights for the Avalon.

               I am surprised that the remarks of Mr. Higgins 
               <br />
               did not provoke some discussion... Mr. Higgins 
               <br />
               said that the St. John’s members were not hang- 
               <br />
               ing their heads in shame over the tremendous 
               <br />

               from a district where there are more people with 
               <br />

               <br />

               productive industries in this country? You ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that the great bulk of these industries are in those 
               <br />
               parts of the country that have got practically no 
               <br />
               roads. It is not in St. John’s that you ﬁnd the bulk 
               <br />
               of our great fisheries. It’s not in St. John’s that 
               <br />
               you find the great bulk of our forests, or of our 
               <br />
               other productive industries. It’s out around the 
               <br />
               country, where little or no government money is 
               <br />
               being spent on roads. Where would St. John’s be 
               <br />
               and what roads would they have, if we took the 
               <br />
               ﬁsheries away from them? If we took the great 
               <br />
               Buchans mine away from them? If we took the 
               <br />
               great Grand Falls industry away from them? If 
               <br />
               they didn’t have the great Comer Brook and 
               <br />
               Humber Valley to depend on? These are the 
               <br />
               things that keep St. John’s going. Suppose we 
               <br />
               divided Newfoundland into two separate 
               <br />
               countries — the Avalon Peninsula forming one 
               <br />
               country, and the rest of Newfoundland and 
               <br />
               Labrador forming another. Where would the 
               <br />
               Avalon Peninsula be then? Who would have most 
               <br />
               of the roads in that case? It wouldn’t be the 
               <br />
               Avalon Peninsula. If you took a photograph of 
               <br />
               the Avalon from the air, what you’d get would be 
               <br />
               a big web with a spider in the middle of it -— and 
               <br />
               the spider would be St. John‘s. I am not advocat- 
               <br />
               ing that Newfoundland be separated into two 
               <br />
               countries. I am advocating that the rest of the 
               <br />
               country should get a good share of whatever 
               <br />
               money is going for roads and other public im- 
               <br />
               provements.... Before they build more beautiful 
               <br />
               paved roads around Conception Bay they should 
               <br />
               first see that the people of the rest of the island 
               <br />
               get <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">halfvdecent</span> roads to travel over and transport 
               <br />
               their produce. I hope Mr. Higgins won’t think 
               <br />
               that I am making an attack upon him or upon his 
               <br />
               St. John’s colleagues, or upon the members who 
               <br />
               come here from Avalon Peninsula districts. All I 
               <br />
               am trying to do is to put in a claim for the rest of 
               <br />
               the island...

               <br />
               having no comment on his report. He has harped 
               <br />
               on the fact that the Avalon was getting so much 
               <br />
               money, and because of that suggestion, l suppose
