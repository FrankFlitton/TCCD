               Mr. Burry Mr. Chairman, I would like to call 
               <br />
               the attention of the members to the fact that there 
               <br />
               is one unfortunate omission in the first page in the

               <br />
               of the Hon. Mr. Quinton. The Committee feels 
               <br />
               that your predecessor, Mr. Justice Fox, in the 
               <br />
               selection of the convenor for this Committee 
               <br />
               made a very wise choice. Mr. Ashbourne, with

               his thoroughness and good spirit and persistent 
               <br />
               energy, kept us plugging at this work since last 
               <br />
               fall until 5 o’clock on Saturday last. We were able 
               <br />
               to have 48 main committee meetings, besides 
               <br />
               several subcommittee meetings, which meant at 
               <br />
               least 103 hours work on this report. 1 would also 
               <br />
               point out that the few references and quotations 
               <br />
               in this report coming from the interviews are not

               an indication of the value we have placed upon 
               <br />
               the interviews. We feel that the interviews with 
               <br />
               the various doctors, heads of departments, etc., 
               <br />
