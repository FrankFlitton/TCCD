               Now, of course, it is no good in our looking in 
               <br />
               the Grey Book or the Black Books for this infor- 
               <br />
               mation. But there are other places we can look, 
               <br />
               fortunately, and what we see there is not so good. 
               <br />
               For instance, we ﬁnd that in 1931 Newfoundland 
               <br />
               had to go off the gold standard in order to save 
               <br />
               the Canadian chartered banks from bankruptcy. 
               <br />
               We know that Newfoundland depositors in these 
               <br />
               banks lost some $20 million through the raising 
               <br />
               of the price of gold in 1933, and that the central 
               <br />
               bank of Canada made this large proﬁt at the 
               <br />
               expense of Newfoundland depositors. We know 
               <br />
               that during World War Two, the same Bank of 
               <br />
               Canada had the advantage of having the use of 
               <br />
               hundreds of millions of American dollars spent 
               <br />
               in this country, and though the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland made nothing, it is estimated that the 
               <br />
               Bank of Canada made upwards of $150 million 
               <br />
               from such sources. We know that this same 
               <br />
               Canada is at this very moment sending an SOS to 
               <br />
               Uncle Sam for financial help, and that the 
               <br />
               Canadian people are being forced to take the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               steps on the hard road of austerity, that road 
               <br />
               which the people of Great Britain have travelled 
               <br />
               so long. Is it any wonder then, that in view of 
               <br />
               these things we fail to be able to see Canada as a 
               <br />
               land of milk and honey, which Mr. Smallwood so 
               <br />
               enthusiastically described and to which he wants 
               <br />
               us to come? Is it strange that we feel like asking 
               <br />
               such questions now, as what is the exact ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               position of the central bank of Canada? What is 
               <br />
               the total of Bank of Canada notes now in circula- 
               <br />
               tion? What amount of gold is in reserve as 
               <br />
               security against this paper currency? In short, we 
               <br />
               want to know, and I say we are entitled to know, 
               <br />
               what is the actual financial position of this 
               <br />
               country that wants us to go into partnership. We 
               <br />
               want to know and we must know if Canada today 
               <br />
               is a solvent country. Is she financially sound? 
               <br />
               And we also want to know before we consider 
               <br />
               union with Canada, what would become of the 
               <br />
               $110 million in our local Canadian banks? What 
               <br />
               would happen to the Newfoundland Savings 
               <br />
               Bank and to the money of our Newfoundland

               Incidentally, speaking of Canadian bonds, when

               I took up the morning paper today, the first thing

               These are vital questions, Mr. Chairman. They

               should be known to this Convention, to the

               vention, but as yet I have received no reply. 
               <br />
               Yesterday I received an evasive answer, 
               <br />
               deliberately evasive. Mr. Smallwood has not told 
               <br />
               us. No member of the Ottawa delegation has told 
               <br />
               us anything about them. To all appearances, Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, the Ottawa delegation has absolutely 
               <br />
               failed in its duty, in not getting this information 
               <br />
               for us while in Canada. Do they think, does 
               <br />
               anybody think, that we Newfoundlanders are 
               <br />
               going to allow ourselves to be dragged into this 
               <br />
               sort of a transaction and buy a pig in a bag?

               At the present time Canada is all out trying to 
               <br />
               bank itself to the future on the Marshall Plan. If 
               <br />
               the Plan does go through, it will mean expendi- 
               <br />
               tures by the United States for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$67</span> billion worth

               of these purchases will be made in Canada and 
               <br />
               will be paid for in American funds to Canada. If 
               <br />
               the Plan does not go through, none of us knows
