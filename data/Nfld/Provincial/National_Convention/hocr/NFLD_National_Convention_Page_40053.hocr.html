               ing of information and save valuable time. You 
               <br />
               will notice that there has been considerable over-

               lapping in connection with the asking of ques- 
               <br />
               tions. In order that this may be avoided it is 
               <br />
               proposed to set up a ‘Questions Committee’ to 
               <br />
               which all questions will first be handed. It is not 
               <br />
               intended to restrict rights to ask questions. We 
               <br />
               may advise you as to how to change the questions 
               <br />
               and there may be questions eliminated where 
               <br />
               there is overlapping, and your questions 
               <br />
               ampliﬁed in order to get the information with 
               <br />
               greater exactitude. The Commission has agreed 
               <br />
               and is anxious to facilitate us in every way. I

               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, in 1934 the 
               <br />
               Commission of Government system came into 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, and since then in this country 
               <br />
               there has been no political action of any kind 
               <br />
               whatsoever until the holding of the National Con- 
               <br />
               vention election. For 12 or 13 years there hap- 
               <br />
               pened in this country exactly what Mr. Bradley, 
               <br />
               sitting in this House at the time as leader of the 
               <br />
               Opposition, forecast would happen. I remember 
               <br />
               his forecast that one effect of Commission 
               <br />
               government would be the death of whatever 
               <br />
               public opinion had existed. For 12 or 13 years in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland there has been no political action, 
               <br />
               no political agitation, no political propaganda. 
               <br />
               That has been a grand thing. At that time I dis- 
               <br />
               agreed with Mr. Bradley in private conversation 
               <br />
               and in my own mind. I thought that what we 
               <br />
               needed was a political holiday or armistice. We 
               <br />
               have had it, but we have also had what he forecast 
               <br />
               — the death of public sentiment. Now that was 
               <br />
               reﬂected very considerably in the number of our 
               <br />
               citizens throughout the island who did not bother 
               <br />
               to vote on the 21st of June. Sir, this Convention 
               <br />
               opened on Wednesday a week ago, and I have 
               <br />
               followed, as I am sure we have all done, the 
               <br />

               reports appearing in the daily newspapers and the 
               <br />
               weeklies, and the nightly broadcasts on the two 
               <br />
               stations, of the meetings of this Convention; and, 
               <br />
               as others have done, I have tried to visualise what 
               <br />
               was happening throughout the island. I was 
               <br />
               trying to picture in my mind hundreds of families 
               <br />
               around the island sitting in their homes listening 
               <br />
               to the broadcasts of the events of the Convention 
               <br />
               of that day. That has gone on now for a week and 
               <br />
               two days, and it has been good stuff, it has been 
               <br />
               suggestive and informative, but it has all had to 
               <br />
               do with public affairs and that is to the good. 
               <br />
               What is needed in this country is a great revival 
               <br />
               of interest in public affairs, and I do not mean 
               <br />
               politics. God forbid. This section 5 would have 
               <br />
               the effect of closing down the general assembly 
               <br />
               of the Convention, and setting up as its only 
               <br />
               substitute very valuable work on the part of nine 
               <br />
               committees. A practical idea, a useful idea, and a 
               <br />
               necessary idea that these nine committees should 
               <br />
               be'set up, entirely right that these practical topics 
               <br />
               should be tackled in that way, and I agree com— 
               <br />
               pletely; but it seems to me, and it means no more 
               <br />
               to me than it does to the members of the Steering 
               <br />
               Committee or to any member of the Convention, 
               <br />
               a pity that after seven <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or'</span> eight nights only of 
               <br />
               practical, informative and even brilliant broad— 
               <br />
               casts, reaching perhaps 200,000 of our people 
               <br />
               nightly for eight nights, arousing the public inter— 
               <br />
               est in public affairs, that after eight nights it 
               <br />
               should thus be abruptly cut off and for three or 
               <br />
               four weeks they should hear no more about the 
               <br />
               National Convention. The suggestion was made, 
               <br />
               but I don’t see it in this section, I think, sir, by 
               <br />
               you, the thought of meeting once a week in 
               <br />
               general assembly. That is not mentioned here. It 
               <br />
               is intended that the Cenvention should adjourn 
               <br />
               until called together by the Chairman at the in-

               <br />
               Tuesday we do meet in private session to meet 
               <br />
               the commissioner.

               Mr. Chairman I think you rather misapprehend
