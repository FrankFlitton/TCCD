               senior member of what was once the House of

               us to select and recommend our own Chairman, 
               <br />
               I felt you would be the logical person for such a 
               <br />
               position, and at our informal meeting held at that 
               <br />
               time, I took the opportunity of nominating you 
               <br />
               for this important post, to which you were elected 
               <br />
               unanimously by your fellow delegates. I realise 
               <br />
               that you have taken upon yourself a most difﬁcult

               <br />
               times to make important and possibly far-reach- 
               <br />

               <br />
               equal to the task, and I am equally conﬁdent that 
               <br />
               any decisions you make will be fair and just. You 
               <br />
               are like all of us. a man of the people, and having 
               <br />
               known you for over 20 years in the political life 
               <br />
               of this country, I am sure you have the necessary 
               <br />
               parliamentary and legal knowledge to perform 
               <br />
               the duties of this important office with dignity 
               <br />
               and honour. Again, Mr. Chairman, I extend to 
               <br />
               you our most sincere congratulations.

               Mr. Chairman Gentlemen of the Convention,I 
               <br />
               appreciate very deeply the very laudatory

               <br />
               conferred in elevating me to the Chair of this 
               <br />
               Convention. I am all the more appreciative of it 
               <br />
               when I realise that it has arisen out of the wish of 
               <br />
               the members of the Convention, they being the

               out of mere good will towards myself. I feel it is 
               <br />
               based upon some conﬁdence you have in my

               Some of you are aware that Mr. Brown, who

               There are one or two things that I wish to draw 
               <br />
               to the attention of the members. The first is that 
               <br />
               before the members leave town for the Christmas 
               <br />
               vacation I would like to see each individually; the 
               <br />
               second is in connection with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">debates.</span> I have 
               <br />
               heard complaints from the public that at times 
               <br />
               they do not know who is speaking. That, I fear, 
               <br />
               has been to some extent our own fault. I believe 
               <br />
               I have been an offender myself. When a member 
               <br />
               rises to speak I suggest that he should address the 
               <br />
               Chair and then remain silent until he is named by 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Chairman.</span> That immediately places the 
               <br />
               public in possession of the name of the man 
               <br />
               speaking. Otherwise they will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confused.</span> If you 
               <br />
               will follow my instructions in this respect it will 
               <br />
               be better for the members themselves and for the 
               <br />
               public.
