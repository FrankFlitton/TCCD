               Last night I listened to Mr. Gushue’s address 
               <br />
               and I listened very carefully and I am sure other 
               <br />
               members here must have done the same. If it is 
               <br />
               Mr. Gushue’s opinion there is danger to our 
               <br />
               ﬁsheries under confederation. well I, for one, 
               <br />
               believe what he had to say, and I will take his 
               <br />
               word before the word of anyone else, and certain- 
               <br />
               ly before any members of the ﬁshery committee 
               <br />
               on the Ottawa delegation. There is a very great 
               <br />
               danger to our ﬁsheries, there is danger that they 
               <br />
               might be in difﬁculties overnight, there is a 
               <br />
               danger that we will not be able to sell to the 
               <br />
               European markets and this, gentlemen, is a very 
               <br />
               serious matter for Newfoundland. In fact, gentle— 
               <br />
               men, it is so very serious that it leaves me no other 
               <br />
               course except to vote against confederation going 
               <br />

               I am not an anticonfederate, if the terms are

               properly negotiated and if sufﬁcient guarantees 
               <br />
               are given Newfoundland to protect her against 
               <br />
               any upheaval that may take place. I am convinced 
               <br />
               that Newfoundland’s necessity to export in order 
               <br />
               to live requires that she should have the right to 
               <br />
               make her own trade agreements without refer— 
               <br />
               ence to the over—riding authority and interests of 
               <br />
               the Dominion government.

               I think in the ﬁrst place that we should have 
               <br />
               an agreement with Canada to whom we export 
               <br />
               six times as much as she buys from us. I do 
               <br />
               believe that a means may be worked out for a 
               <br />
               closer relationship with Canada short of federal 
               <br />
               union, which would be good for both countries; 
               <br />
               but on the question of political union, I am from 
               <br />
               Missouri. Canada has not been too liberal with us 
               <br />
               in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">past,</span> I have yet to be convinced that she can 
               <br />
               do more for us that we can do forourselves. I have 
               <br />
               the friendliest sentiments towards Canada and 
               <br />
               Canadians, but it would take a good deal to 
               <br />
               convince me from my study of the situation that 
               <br />
               a federal union would not be the worst decision

               best interests at heart. An issue of such impor-

               <br />
               all the answers. I am of the opinion that we can 
               <br />
               unite in many ways with Canada without sur- 
               <br />
               rendering our political sovereignty. We can form 
               <br />
               associations and share problems to our mutual

               advantage.

               I would remind you that social services and

               Gentlemen, most people will admit that the 
               <br />
               federal government must collect more from the 
               <br />

               <br />
               not continue its services. We are not naive

               enough to think that Canada is going to give us 
               <br />
               something for nothing, and we can be prepared 
               <br />
               to pay additional taxation if we are to receive 
               <br />
               additional beneﬁts or services.
