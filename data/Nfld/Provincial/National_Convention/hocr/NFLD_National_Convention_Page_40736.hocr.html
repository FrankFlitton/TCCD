               very careful and govern ourselves accordingly. 
               <br />
               Let us look at the revenue... I would like to ask 
               <br />
               every member, in their opinion do they think this 
               <br />
               extremely high revenue was brought about by the 
               <br />
               hundreds of millions of dollars ﬂowing into this 
               <br />
               country during the war period from America, 
               <br />
               Canada and the United Kingdom, or was it 
               <br />
               brought about by new industries started during 
               <br />
               the same period? If it was brought about by the 
               <br />
               influx of foreign money into the country on ac— 
               <br />
               count of war, I think I feel justiﬁed in estimating 
               <br />
               our revenue under normal conditions, that would 
               <br />
               be 1939-40, 1938-39 and farther back. The 
               <br />
               highest revenue then was $12.5 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million</span> At the 
               <br />
               present time we are receiving a revenue of around 
               <br />
               $10 million coming into the Assessor’s Depart- 
               <br />
               ment. 1 can well remember the time when the 
               <br />
               earning power of this country under normal con- 
               <br />
               ditions would not bring in near this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁgure.</span> In this 
               <br />
               report, on page 33, this Committee estimates the 
               <br />
               revenue as $9 million per year from the 
               <br />
               Assessor’s Department for the next three years. 
               <br />
               In my opinion it might average half that amount, 
               <br />
               and I say this because the people who are the 
               <br />
               producers, the ﬁshermen and the loggers, with 
               <br />
               others, find their earning power reduced, and in 
               <br />
               lots of cases to a minimum I can’t agree with this 
               <br />
               estimated revenue for the next three years. There 
               <br />
               was a time during the war when ﬁshermen, with 
               <br />
               their representatives, could sit around a table with 
               <br />
               the ﬁsh exporters, talk over and mutually agree 
               <br />
               on a reasonable price of ﬁsh to be paid to the 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen, before the fishermen would think of 
               <br />
               catching a quintal from the water. That privilege 
               <br />
               we enjoyed during the war years. In my opinion 
               <br />
               it has lately <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disappeared.“</span> I am also given to 
               <br />
               understand that there are considerable quantities 
               <br />
               of ﬁsh to which nobody can give a correct es- 
               <br />
               timate of value. There are quantities of ﬁsh sent 
               <br />
               in here to be stored pending prospects of selling 
               <br />
               it sometime and at a price which nobody 
               <br />
               knows... It not only applies to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">codﬁsh.</span> Last year 
               <br />
               lobster sold for as high as $58, and in some cases 
               <br />
               $60 per case What do we ﬁnd this year? Why, it 
               <br />
               is being retailed right here in St. John‘s for less 
               <br />
               than 60 cents per pound tin, while last year it was 
               <br />
               retailed for as high as $1.20 per tin. In other words 
               <br />
               the value is less than half.

               how this can be done when we all feel sure that 
               <br />
               there is very little hope. It is true that at the present

               remember the conditions and world affairs at the

               <br />
               today. Six months ago one could sell rough lum- 
               <br />
               her for as high as $60, and in some cases $70 per

               <br />
               should make us <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">think.</span> Last year there was a 
               <br />
               shortage of wood. What caused that shortage to 
               <br />
               some extent was the scarcity of men. The scarcity 
               <br />
               of men for the woods was due to the ﬁsh last year 
               <br />
               being a fair price, but this year there is a different 
               <br />
               side to the picture, and I understand that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">practi»</span> 
               <br />
               cally all the camps are filled. But very soon quite 
               <br />
               a few of the camps will have their quota of wood 
               <br />
               for the season, and the men will be returning to 
               <br />
               their homes with very little work to do. In view 
               <br />
               of the fact that last year we paid out over $1 
               <br />
               million in relief, this year I am afraid there will 
               <br />
               be considerably more needed to supply the 
               <br />
               demand.
