               Mr. Smallwood The answer in reply, Mr. Chair~ 
               <br />
               man, is simply this. As you may know, 1 have 
               <br />
               spent possibly the last 20 years of my life doing 
               <br />
               research, historical research in this country. If I 
               <br />
               had been a member of the Finance Committee I 
               <br />
               could have told the committee where to get all 
               <br />
               kinds of figures and statistics about New- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">foundland...</span> These I got, number one, in the 
               <br />
               public library, which is a government institution; 
               <br />
               number two, in the vault of the Home Affairs 
               <br />
               department; number three, in the Department of 
               <br />
               Finance and Customs where I have spent many 
               <br />
               days in the last ten or twelve months; number 
               <br />
               four, in my own personal library; number ﬁve, in 
               <br />
               the files of the newspapers which are on ﬁle 
               <br />
               running back for 100 years. It is possible, not very 
               <br />
               likely, that in copying them off I could be wrong. 
               <br />
               But I hope to show before this debate is over, that
