               <br />
               purely fact-ﬁnding. The delegation had no man-

               date to advise as to policy. It had no power to 
               <br />

               has no such powers itself. When a position was

               taken to the contrary, the Chairman and I had no

               The dissension within the delegation arose in 
               <br />
               this way. At the ﬁnal meeting but one with the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom representatives, there was 
               <br />
               handed to us a paper setting forth the considered 
               <br />
               replies of the United Kingdom government to the 
               <br />
               questions we had put. Subsequently there began 
               <br />
               the preparation of a memorandum that would set 
               <br />
               forth the case as advanced by the delegation. The 
               <br />
               delegation considered the first draft of the 
               <br />
               proposed memorandum at a meeting held on the 
               <br />
               morning of Monday, May 5. We did not make 
               <br />
               much progress, as disagreement occurred almost 
               <br />
               immediately on the speciﬁc point of recommend- 
               <br />
               ing the application of the balance of interest-free 
               <br />
               loans to the reduction of the public debt. The 
               <br />
               specific sentences with which issue was taken 
               <br />
               were: “In addition to the above the New- 
               <br />
               foundland Delegation are of opinion that the 
               <br />
               balance standing to the credit of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               in the way of interest-free loans to Great Britain, 
               <br />
               and which is now lying idle, should be devoted 
               <br />
               to the further reduction of Newfoundland’s ster- 
               <br />
               ling debt.” Also: “We cannot understand the at- 
               <br />
               titude of Commission of Government when they 
               <br />
               advise you that, in their opinion, it would not be 
               <br />
               prudent to adopt this last-named procedure in 
               <br />
               reference to interest-free loans, which procedure 
               <br />
               as we have just pointed out will mean a saving to 
               <br />
               the Newfoundland Treasury of some $400,000 
               <br />
               annually.” And, “... there lies to the credit of the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland Treasury in the Bank of Montreal 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland, well over $20 million which in 
               <br />
               our opinion, is ample for any immediate or

               foreseeable construction or development 
               <br />
               programme.” And again, “We strongly urge such 
               <br />
               a policy and we seek some assurance from the

               <br />
               Finally, “Furthermore we consider this proposal

               <br />

               foundland government as might by that time 
               <br />
               materialise. Further, we had no guarantee that a 
               <br />
               mere $20 million would be ample for immediate 
               <br />
               or foreseeable development programmes. After

               <br />

               <br />
               what we need in our ﬁshing industry? A mere 
               <br />
               drop in the bucket! Why, already we have $5

               million invested in fresh fish plants in this 
               <br />

               that it should prove to be not nearly enough, it 
               <br />
               would then appear as decidedly unsound business 
               <br />
               to have eliminated a $9 million loan at 2.5% only 
               <br />
               to have to borrow a like, or perhaps a greater sum

               l. The Public Debt. The truth of the matter is 
               <br />
               that we have no case in absolute justice for the 
               <br />
               cancellation of that debt. it was an honourable 
               <br />
               debt, honourably incurred by honourable men — 
               <br />
               and in honour and injustice should be met. I 
               <br />
               imagine that those men of honour who made 
               <br />
               Newfoundland — those men of the past who 
               <br />
               were giants in their day and generation - would 
               <br />
               disown this day and generation if it sought to 
               <br />
               avoid such an obligation. We have a conditional 
               <br />
               case for the cancellation of the public debt. That 
               <br />
               case is set out in the memorandum submitted to 
               <br />
               the British government by the delegation. The 
               <br />
               condition upon which the case rests is Britain’s 
               <br />
               being in a position to cancel, and being willing
