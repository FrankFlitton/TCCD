               loan. We were told that the Commission of 
               <br />
               Government did not think it prudent, having 
               <br />
               regard for the development requirements of the 
               <br />
               country, to use the balance of the loans for debt 
               <br />
               reduction. The Commission of Government did 
               <br />
               not think it prudent to save this country $400,000 
               <br />
               a year in interest. The Commission is spending 
               <br />
               more money than any government ever dreamed 
               <br />
               of spending on what it calls development. Unfor~ 
               <br />
               tunately, none of it is productive development. 
               <br />
               And this extravagant government does not think 
               <br />
               it prudent to reduce our debt and save us 
               <br />
               $400,000 a year. That, sir, was as far as we could 
               <br />
               get on that issue. The Commission did not think 
               <br />
               it prudent. The Dominions Ofﬁce agreed, and 
               <br />
               that was that. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               What inference can we draw from all this? If 
               <br />
               we used that $10 million to reduce the debt we 
               <br />
               would still have $20 million left on which to draw 
               <br />
               if need should arise. Does this mean that the 
               <br />
               Commission expects to have so much of the 
               <br />
               surplus spent by 1950 that it will have to draw on 
               <br />
               that money in England? If that is the case, then I 
               <br />
               say the quicker we get them out the better, for no 
               <br />
               Newfoundland government would ever think of 
               <br />
               spending money on that scale to so little purpose, 
               <br />
               and have any hope of saving its political neck. 
               <br />
               There is no special cause to be grateful for the 
               <br />
               conversion of the sterling debt coming up next 
               <br />
               January. Money can be borrowed in the open 
               <br />
               market at 2.5% and we should be getting the 
               <br />
               benefit of it. We should also have the debt 
               <br />
               reduced by the amount of the sinking fund. I am 
               <br />
               not particularly grateful for this intention to con- 
               <br />
               vert, because it should be done, it costs nobody 
               <br />
               anything and it saves us something worthwhile. 
               <br />
               It was suggested to Commissioner Wild by the 
               <br />
               Finance Committee sometime before he left for 
               <br />
               England. No doubt the prudent Commission of 
               <br />
               Government will be able to use the saving on debt 
               <br />
               interest to good advantage.

               clear that the quicker we relieved England of our

               But there is one thing that made me more 
               <br />
               angry than anything else, and that was the ques- 
               <br />
               tion of our trade with Britain. I do not have to tell 
               <br />
               the Convention or the country that our problem 
               <br />
               is markets. During the war years we built up our 
               <br />
               frozen ﬁsh industry from about 3 million to 30 
               <br />
               million pounds a year. During these years we 
               <br />
               could have sold most of our output to the United 
               <br />
               States, but Britain‘s urgent needs naturally 
               <br />
               caused the producers to give priority to United 
               <br />
               Kingdom markets at prices below those ob- 
               <br />
               tainable elsewhere. That was the right thing to do, 
               <br />
               nobody can have two opinions on this point. 
               <br />
               When the war was over the demand for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> 
               <br />
               foundland ﬁsh was greatly reduced, not because 
               <br />
               Britain could not use our ﬁsh, but because the 
               <br />
               Ministry of Food had to buy it elsewhere. I intend 
               <br />
               now to give a brief history of the negotiations that 
               <br />
               went on this year for the sale of 20 million pounds 
               <br />
               of frozen ﬁllets to the British market. A price was 
               <br />
               agreed which was lower than fish could be 
               <br />
               bought from other suppliers. Our products met 
               <br />
               difﬁcult conditions relating to shipment. Every- 
               <br />
               thing seemed to be in the bag, and then the 
               <br />
               Ministry of Food reneged, and the news came to 
               <br />
               us from other sources that the order was going to 
               <br />
               Norway. The trouble, it was said, was the scarcity 
               <br />
               of dollars. It was then proposed that Britain 
               <br />
               should take payment for the new Railway 
               <br />
               steamers in fish, but this proposition was 
               <br />
               rejected, presumably because the dollars had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">al»</span> 
               <br />
               ready been transferred, even though the first ship 
               <br />
               would not be ready before July, and the others 
               <br />
               much later. So the last word local suppliers had, 
               <br />
               was that the Dominions Ofﬁce had reported 
               <br />
               having carried the matter to the highest quarters, 
               <br />
               and had been advised to tell the New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders that there was nothing doing. It 
               <br />
               reminds me of the famous remark of a French 
               <br />
               queen who, when told the French peasants had no 
               <br />
               bread, asked, “Why don’t they eat cake?”
