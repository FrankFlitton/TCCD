               National Convention We had hardly begun to get 
               <br />
               those facts concerning Newfoundland when a red 
               <br />
               herring was thrown across our path to divert 
               <br />
               attention and interest from the job we were sent 
               <br />
               here to do. This attempt was made when so far 
               <br />
               we have received only three reports in public 
               <br />
               session; and with regard to these reports, 
               <br />
               whatever may be said of them during discussion, 
               <br />
               insofar as information will allow them, they are 
               <br />
               a great credit to the committees concerned... 
               <br />
               Several members supporting the motion stressed 
               <br />
               the time factor, that is an important point. I may 
               <br />
               say that there is no one in this building more 
               <br />
               anxious to be through with his job and back home 
               <br />
               to his own environment than I, but I submit there 
               <br />
               is a better way of doing this. In view of the 
               <br />
               expense to this country, we should try and hold 
               <br />
               sessions mornings as well as afternoons. 
               <br />
               Moreover, we must remember that Commission 
               <br />
               of Government have been in control of this 
               <br />
               country for 13 years and it is going to take time 
               <br />
               to get acquainted with the problems, and if the 
               <br />
               result of our ﬁndings will have a bearing on the 
               <br />
               future welfare of Newfoundland for generations 
               <br />
               to come, I submit the time factor is not so impor- 
               <br />
               tant as it may appear. Nor does it matter material- 
               <br />
               ly if the Commission continues in office for 
               <br />
               another year or two as long as it keeps within 
               <br />
               budget estimates and does not give away 
               <br />
               Labrador. May I say that there are some weighty 
               <br />
               problems that affect the future and the economy 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland more so than any others, the 
               <br />
               national debt, and the entry of our fishery 
               <br />
               products into the United States under fair trading 
               <br />
               tariff conditions. If we could have concentrated 
               <br />
               study and efforts to even partially solve these 
               <br />
               fundamental things, then I would say emphatical- 
               <br />
               ly any government of good honest men, call it 
               <br />
               what you may, will bring Newfoundland to a 
               <br />
               place of happiness and prosperity for all its 
               <br />
               people to a level yet unknown. God guard thee,

               Mr. Hillier I have been listening to debates 
               <br />
               since last Monday, and I am of the opinion that it 
               <br />
               has gone far enough. We are wasting valuable 
               <br />
               time and getting nowhere. I am confident as far 
               <br />
               as the district which I represent is concerned, that 
               <br />
               they want to learn facts about any government 
               <br />
               and the motion before this House at the present 
               <br />
               time is not a form of government, it is a fact

               Things have been said which were on the

               boisterous side and that is not what we came here 
               <br />
               for. We came to go into the economic conditions 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland and we are doing that to the 
               <br />
               best of our ability. There would be nothing amiss

               <br />

               <br />
               ment to amendment to the motion made by 
               <br />
               Mr. Bradley. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Hickman I would like to refer ﬁrst to the 
               <br />
               question to which Mr. Higgins referred, the time 
               <br />
               of the referendum. There is nobody in the House 
               <br />
               any more anxious than I am to get the job over, 
               <br />
               but I am not worried about spring or fall or any 
               <br />
               referendum at all, until we are ready for it. For 
               <br />
               that reason I feel as I did the other day on the 
               <br />
               amendment made by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Penney. I will not go 
               <br />
               into a repetition as we have been long enough 
               <br />
               here now. I would like to refer to the amendment 
               <br />
               to the amendment made by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Bradley. That can 
               <br />
               be very confusing, lam not suggesting that it was 
               <br />
               meant to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confusing.</span> If I understood the motion 
               <br />
               correctly, the amendment is practically identical 
               <br />
               to the original motion in intent or in effect. The 
               <br />
               delegation when appointed would not leave 
               <br />
               before the 1st of January. I cannot see the 
               <br />
               similarity to the amendment of Mr. Penney’s. 
               <br />
               Mr. Penney’s amendment in part states the ques- 
               <br />
               tion of ascertaining the attitude of Canada be 
               <br />
               deferred for consideration until reports of com- 
               <br />
               mittees are brought in. That is absolutely dif- 
               <br />
               ferent from the amendment to the amendment. 
               <br />
               For that reason I do not see how I can vote for 
               <br />
               anything but the amendment of Mr. Penney. 
               <br />
               Mr. J ackman It makes one feel rather nervous 
               <br />
               because I realise my inability to reply to the 
               <br />
               learned lawyers and learned politicians who have 
               <br />
               spoken, but before this vote is taken I would like 
               <br />
               to say a few words because I am very much 
               <br />
               concerned about the whole matter. As I stated 
               <br />
               here on different occasions, I am here <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">repre</span> 
               <br />
               senting people, the majority of whom are poor, 
               <br />
               and I feel it is my bounden duty to do everything 
               <br />
               in my power to see their interests are best
