               Mr. Harrington There were a few remarks 
               <br />
               made by the member from Bonavista Centre 
               <br />
               which were very interesting. He said that past 
               <br />
               governments had to borrow year after year to pay, 
               <br />
               amongst other things, the operating losses of the 
               <br />
               Railway. Later on he declared, again I think with 
               <br />
               reference to the Railway, that it has cost the 
               <br />
               people millions in taxes, and then, almost in the 
               <br />
               next breath observed that the government never 
               <br />
               did take in enough money in taxes to pay their 
               <br />
               bills —— the government’s bills. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr,</span> Chairman, 
               <br />
               perhaps unwittingly, that delegate struck at the 
               <br />
               very root of Newfoundland’s trouble in the past. 
               <br />
               Governments are run, are ﬁnanced from the taxes 
               <br />
               that are collected from the people. If these taxes 
               <br />
               are inadequate, the government must borrow. 
               <br />
               That is what happened in Newfoundland. People 
               <br />
               do not like to pay taxes in any country. It is said 
               <br />
               that Newfoundlanders are traditionally opposed 
               <br />
               to taxation, even in St. John‘s —— which has had 
               <br />
               local government for nearly 60 years. But espe- 
               <br />
               cially outside St. John’s, in the thousands of 
               <br />
               communities where nearly every man is inde- 
               <br />
               pendent, owns his own house, his own boat, his 
               <br />
               own bit of ground, and where, until recent times, 
               <br />
               there was and still is no local government, and 
               <br />
               where taxes of any kind, that is direct taxes, are 
               <br />
               almost unknown. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Hence, these past governments, whose 
               <br />
               ﬁnance ministers were mentioned by the delegate 
               <br />
               from Bonavista Centre - the last thing they 
               <br />
               dared think of was increased taxation. He knows 
               <br />
               as well as I do that the manifestos of each party 
               <br />
               that strived for election always promised reduced 
               <br />
               taxation. That was the vote-getter in New- 
               <br />
               foundland; it still gets a few votes in other 
               <br />
               countries too. Cut down the taxes. But they 
               <br />
               couldn’t cut them all down. So they had to get as 
               <br />
               much as they could in a way that the people 
               <br />
               wouldn’t feel too much. And that is one of the 
               <br />
               main reasons why we have a customs tariff that 
               <br />
               people say is too high. Local industries may have 
               <br />
               caused some of it by excessive protection, but no 
               <br />
               one will deny that the attempt by former govern- 
               <br />
               ments to extract taxes the painless way, the in— 
               <br />
               direct way, had more to do with it than people 
               <br />

               But there was a limit to what revenue could be 
               <br />
               raised from the customs. And so there were 
               <br />
               deﬁcits and the government had to borrow. And 
               <br />
               this happened time and again. And apart from the 
               <br />
               few instances of local government now in exist— 
               <br />
               ence, the same antipathy to taxation of a direct 
               <br />
               kind exists. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">don’t</span> think I’m a bit off the subject 
               <br />
               when 1 Speak in this strain. For we cannot keep 
               <br />
               our heads in the sand forever. In this world the 
               <br />
               people only get what they pay for, and that ap~ 
               <br />
               plies to governments, and the things that govern- 
               <br />
               ments nowadays are expected to provide —— 
               <br />
               social services, social security and so on.

               Governments will give the people what they 
               <br />
               demand; but they will charge them extra for each 
               <br />
               extra beneﬁt. in this respect, and while taxation 
               <br />
               is the topic, I want to refer to the breakdown of 
               <br />
               the Economic Report's statement of revenue — 
               <br />
               that $30 million. We see that the customs returns 
               <br />
               almost double the income tax figures — and that 
               <br />
               is a far cry from the budget of 1923, when cus- 
               <br />
               toms returns were about 15 times as much. So we 
               <br />
               can see the burden is being shifted, and I hope 
               <br />
               there will be a gradual decrease in the indirect 
               <br />
               figures and a gradual increase in the direct tax 
               <br />
               figures.

               But there again, how far can we go? That point 
               <br />
               interested me so much that when we had a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">meet</span> 
               <br />
               ing with Commissioner for Finance Wild, I asked 
               <br />
               him a plain question on it. i asked Mr. Wild, in 
               <br />
               view of the gradual shifting of the tax burden 
               <br />
               from indirect to direct, if it was his opinion that 
               <br />
               the great part of our revenue would or could soon 
               <br />
               be raised from direct taxation. His reply was a 
               <br />
               decided “No.” And every man here knows why, 
               <br />
               even if Mr. Wild hadn’t outlined why. Direct 
               <br />
               taxation can be successfully collected from 
               <br />
               people with ﬁxed incomes, week by week, month
