               Mr. Smallwood I am not suggesting legal ac- 
               <br />
               tion, I am suggesting this: Major Cashin made the 
               <br />
               statement in public session that Newfoundland 
               <br />
               has been plundered of $1.75 million in our sink— 
               <br />
               ing fund — a most serious, grave, shocking state- 
               <br />
               ment, calculated if not disproved, if accepted as 
               <br />
               truth, to undermine all conﬁdence and all faith in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. Therefore what I suggest is either 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin should proceed to prove his statement 
               <br />
               or withdraw it.

               Mr. Vardy I see absolutely no reason whatever

               for Major Cashin to prove his statement. Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood has not proven that Major Cashin was 
               <br />
               incorrect. He has not shown us how much of the

               whether or not we lost money. Mr. Smallwood

               Mr. Chairman Again I want to remind mem-

               <br />
               proprieties of debate are observed, no member is 
               <br />
               going to be placed in a position where he has to 
               <br />
               defend his opinions. Major Cashin has expressed 
               <br />
               an opinion. If he chooses to defend that opinion, 
               <br />
               that is a matter for his discretion. Certainly as far 
               <br />
               as I am concerned, the question as to whether or 
               <br />
               not he proves it or disproves it is entirely up to 
               <br />

               statement made here, libellous or otherwise, is a

               matter with which I have no concern as a Chair-

               Mr. Miller I wonder if each member will be

               <br />
               answer? I would much prefer to read it myself. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I will have them tomorrow. I am 
               <br />
               assuming that Major Cashin will wind up the 
               <br />
               debate by dealing with questions directed to him 
               <br />
               during the course of the debate. Therefore I 
               <br />
               would like it to be understood that if no member 
               <br />
               occupies the floor, I will assume that no member 
               <br />
               desires to address himself further on the 
               <br />
               Economic Report. I will thereupon call upon 
               <br />
               Major Cashin to wind the matter up. If any mem- 
               <br />
               ber has anything to say on the Economic Report, 
               <br />
