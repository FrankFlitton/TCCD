               Act. It is the act which gives us the powers we

               have, whatever they may be. Unless I can find

               words in that Convention Act which will enable

               given considerable thought to the matter, and I 
               <br />
               am unable to read into that Convention Act any 
               <br />
               power to deal with matters of trade or matters of 
               <br />
               tariffs. We are a fact—ﬁnding body, our activities 
               <br />
               being confined to ascertaining the present posi-

               tion of the country, estimating her future 
               <br />
               prospects, and discussing forms of government,

               of the members of this Convention feel very 
               <br />
               strongly on this subject, and in view of the fact

               that this Convention is a rather extraordinary 
               <br />
