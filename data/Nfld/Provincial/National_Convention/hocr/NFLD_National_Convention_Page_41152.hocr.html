               Now in this particular instance. and I refer to

               the work of the delegation that went to Ottawa, I 
               <br />
               and my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ctr-delegates</span> were retained by this Con-

               vention to discuss with the Canadian government 
               <br />
               the matter of the basis of union between New— 
               <br />
               foundland and Canada. I can say quite truthfully 
               <br />
               that no matter what has been said in or what has 
               <br />
               been said out of the House, and no matter what

               <br />
               of jokes than any other single member, I can say 
               <br />
               quite truthfully that we did as good a job as any 
               <br />
               delegation from Newfoundland under the cir~ 
               <br />
               cumstances could have done. I can say to you 
               <br />
               quite truthfully that we had no officials of any 
               <br />
               kind to help us, no ofﬁcials from the government, 
               <br />
               or the civil service to help us. We were six men 
               <br />
               appointed by this Convention. I don’t even say 
               <br />
               the six best men that you have. A great number 
               <br />
               of you did not even choose to be part of that 
               <br />
               delegation, probably some of you better than the 
               <br />
               men who did go up. But, even with the lack of 
               <br />
               assistance that we had, we did do as good a job 
               <br />
               as we possibly could and I trust that you will 
               <br />
               understand me when now I take a different stand. 
               <br />
               Being a lawyer, as I explained to you, and doing 
               <br />
               cases for people that we don’t like, and preparing 
               <br />
               cases that we don’t like to do, nevertheless when 
               <br />
               we agree to do a job we do it to the best of our 
               <br />
               ability. I am stressing that point because I hope 
               <br />
               you will judge that I am competent and fair—

               respect to union between the two countries on the

               casions, but I draw your attention to these words, 
               <br />
               and that is, that the questions to be discussed are 
               <br />
               of such complexity and of such signiﬁcance for 
               <br />
               both countries that it is essential to have a com~

               <br />
               again, at the end of that message: “so that an

               accurate appreciation of the position may be 
               <br />
               gained on each side”. You see how important it 
               <br />
               was to the Canadian government to make their 
               <br />
               position very clear. They recognized the com- 
               <br />
               plexity and the seriousness of this approach. As 
               <br />
               you are aware, and as I said before to you, we had 
               <br />
               no expert assistance of any kind to help us. We 
               <br />
               applied to the Commission of Government to 
               <br />
               assist us in this matter, but the request was 
               <br />
               refused, so we went off with what we had to do

               discussions. In my opinion our delegation was 
               <br />
               not competent to fully discuss such an important 
               <br />
