               We are concerned here with one aspect of the 
               <br />
               entire Atlantic effort— the thrust northeastward, 
               <br />
               particularly as it impinges on Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               This thrust is readily divisible into two arms, that 
               <br />
               along the coast and that coming out of the St. 
               <br />
               Lawrence valley. The Maritime Provinces of 
               <br />
               Canada and Newfoundland are the area in which 
               <br />
               the two thrusts meet. The area of meeting has not 
               <br />
               been stationary but constantly moving. In the 
               <br />
               17th century, French (or St. Lawrence) inﬂuence 
               <br />
               extended well into the present State of Maine. In 
               <br />
               the 18th the Gut of Canso was its extreme south- 
               <br />
               western limit. In the ﬁrst half of the 19th, St. 
               <br />
               Lawrence inﬂuence was still further curtailed 
               <br />
               and was hardly visible beyond Gaspé. Then with 
               <br />
               modern communications came its rapid recovery. 
               <br />
               Confederation extended it throughout the three 
               <br />
               Maritime Provinces, and note the absorption of 
               <br />
               all local banking institutions by the large 
               <br />
               Canadian banks, and the Bank of Nova Scotia’s

               -— and the economic forces of which Confedera— 
               <br />
               tion was a counterpart worked over the political 
               <br />
               boundary into Maine, once more tying a good 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">part</span> of that state into the structure.

               A similar extension went on to the north- 
               <br />
               eastward; with the railway built to Port-aux- 
               <br />
               Basques, the way was open for an assault on the 
               <br />
               last stronghold of maritimism, Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               This assault was delayed, but when it came, the 
               <br />
               main manoeuvre in it was the establishment of 
               <br />
               the steamer route from Sydney to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Port-auto</span> 
               <br />
               Basques, and the building of the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               railway across the island to St. John’s. This of 
               <br />
               course was not the only means by which St. 
               <br />
               Lawrence inﬂuences came in, but it immensely 
               <br />
               facilitated their ingress. The Canadianisation of 
               <br />
               island ﬁnance was a subsidiary movement based 
               <br />
               on this St. Lawrence system of communication, 
               <br />
               as was the Canadianisation of two of our major 
               <br />
               denominations within recent years. Othereviden- 
               <br />
               ces of the St. Lawrence impact will suggest them-

               holds the trump cards of transportation —- <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">steam«</span>

               winter closing, which forces it back to its second

               Since the summer of 1940 political events 
               <br />
               have given renewed vitality to the other arm of 
               <br />
               the thrust. American influence has been vastly 
               <br />
               strengthened by the grant of the bases which has 
               <br />

               and out of curiosity, some on the outlook for 
               <br />
               business. Behind this renewed Atlantic push lies 
               <br />
               the gigantic wealth and power of the United

               <br />
               clearest illustration of the marginal nature of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               section of the two lines of force. To put the point 
               <br />
               another way, it is within the overlapping ﬁelds of 
               <br />
               those two great metropolitan magnets which 
               <br />
               have been battling each other for three centuries 
               <br />
               past, Montreal and New York. Like other Atlan-

               <br />

               <br />
               foundland may be likened to a buoy fast to a long 
               <br />
               mooring chain in water where strong currents 
               <br />
               run; the buoy streams out from its mooring ﬁrst
