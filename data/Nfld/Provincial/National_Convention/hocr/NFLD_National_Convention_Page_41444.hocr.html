               cursed them less than a year after they were 
               <br />

               if seven men can run the country by Commission,

               Mr. Bevin said, “We should not foist our system

               on Soviet Russia and they have no right to foist 
               <br />

               theirs without sacriﬁcing human rights and liber- 
               <br />

               <br />
               was opposed to the Communist conception of 
               <br />
               uniformity. “The essence of democracy is dif- 
               <br />
               ference of opinion, free discussion and tolerance 
               <br />
               of the other people’ 5 point of View. The world We 
               <br />
               want to see is one in which there are a number of 
               <br />
               diverse and different units as compared with the 
               <br />
               Communist world, in which, we might say they 
               <br />
               try to make Newfoundland a copy of Russia.” Mr. 
               <br />
               Churchill supported both Mr. Attlee and Mr. 
               <br />
               Bevin in their views. I wonder what these

               gentlemen will think if they happen to drop in at 
               <br />

               <br />
               proceedings of the National Convention? Will 
               <br />
               Friday’s proceedings not give them serious food 
               <br />
               for thought? I am all for co-operation. I am all for 
               <br />
               democratic socialism; butl am not for installing 
               <br />
               a communistic dictator in our midst; neither will

               labour or capital tolerate such an individual or
