               Mr. Smallwood It would be scandalous if the 
               <br />
               motion were to pass with practically no discus- 
               <br />

               <br />
               would consider that this Convention was taking 
               <br />
               it seriously‘if it went through in a perfunctory 
               <br />
               manner. It is one of the most vital things to come 
               <br />
               before the Convention. The point made by 
               <br />
               Mr. Miller is that it does not go far enough; it 
               <br />
               seems to me, technically, that it goes a little too 
               <br />
               far. I think I know what is in the mind of the 
               <br />
               mover and those who seconded it; they have in 
               <br />
               mind the public domain, the natural resources, 
               <br />
               waterpowers, timber and territorial areas; but 
               <br />
               what is mentioned there is the word “assets” 
               <br />
               which goes way beyond physical assets. As

               Mr. Smallwood According to the motion there 
               <br />
               should be no further negotiations in connection 
               <br />
               with any assets of Newfoundland, even to in- 
               <br />
               crease those assets. I know Mr. Crosbie means 
               <br />
               the natural resources of this country that might 
               <br />
               still be bartered away, and that is what we all have 
               <br />
               in mind. If some of the rumours are true — what 
               <br />
               about this business of further bases? Mr. lob has 
               <br />
               been concerned that we have leased those bases 
               <br />
               for 99 years in return for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nothing..Even</span> the land 
               <br />
               they built on, the Americans did not pay for — 
               <br />
               not a single cent. It was paid for by the British 
               <br />
               government. First the Newfoundland govem— 
               <br />
               ment paid for it and the British government paid 
               <br />
               them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">back,</span> One thing I will say for Mr. Crosbie, 
               <br />
               if anything is to happen, he is the first to hear of 
               <br />
               it. If our territory is to be further <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">battered</span> away, 
               <br />
               if we do get our own government back again in 
               <br />

               <br />
               Maybe Mr. Crosbie would tell us about the 20
