               concerned, I am going to see that that does not

               happen again, that before this country goes into

               <br />
               with any other country we want to know the state 
               <br />
               of their affairs, just the same as they know ours. 
               <br />
               We were told here this afternoon by 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood that the Canadian government 
               <br />
               knew all about our affairs. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Our trade, our business. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin Well our trade, our business, how 
               <br />
               do they know all about it? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood They have a High Commis- 
               <br />
               sioner <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">here.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin Yes, and they have had a High 
               <br />
               Commissioner here since 1941, who laid the seed 
               <br />
               to bring Newfoundland into confederation, and 1 
               <br />
               mean former Commissioner Burchell. That was 
               <br />
               his main object, and today he has a continuation 
               <br />
               in his ofﬁce here in Newfoundland, and the only 
               <br />
               regret, Mr. Chairman, that] have is that his ofﬁce 
               <br />
               is located in the house in which I live. He left his 
               <br />
               job and was given a holiday. For what? To go to 
               <br />
               Ottawa to help the Newfoundland delegation. 
               <br />
               Now, Mr. Chairman, I propose to make a further 
               <br />
               speech on this whole affair at some later date, 
               <br />
               particularly when Mr. Smallwood brings in his 
               <br />
               provincial set-up, which I understand from him 
               <br />
               will be on Monday. But in the meantime it is 
               <br />
               immaterial to me whether this House adjourns 
               <br />
               until Monday or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not.</span> As far as the ﬁnancial situa- 
               <br />
               tion is concerned I am prepared to go ahead with 
               <br />
               it now, and in that respect, if Mr. Smallwood is 
               <br />
               not prepared to give us the information, and the 
               <br />
               High Commissioner for Canada comes in here 
               <br />
               and gives us the information, Iam prepared to go 
               <br />
               ahead with the debate with him, and let him tell 
               <br />
               the story of Canada’s present ﬁnancial position. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, 1 got an answer to a question 
               <br />
               yesterday which I placed on the order paper, and 
               <br />
               I am sorry I have not got it here at the moment. I 
               <br />
               asked how much the present austerity program 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, 1 appreciate 
               <br />
               very much what Major Cashin has said, and what

               Mr. Crosbie has said about rising the committee, 
               <br />

               and statistics on Monday, affecting possible and

               have the next couple of days to do that would be 
               <br />
               a great help to me. After all, I don’t know that 
               <br />
               there is much that we could debate between now 
               <br />
               and Monday that would be very profitable, and it
