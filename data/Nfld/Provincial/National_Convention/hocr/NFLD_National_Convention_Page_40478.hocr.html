               Is that the opinion of your Committee?

               course this man would have to qualify for relief

               <br />
               of the Committee, are doing your utmost. In

               getting near the amount stated in this report. It is

               not any fault of yourself or your Committee but 
               <br />
               the fault lies somewhere between the relieving

               officer and the department concerned.

               Mr. Ashbourne I will investigate that.

               341 receiving able-bodied relief in March, 1946? 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne These are the ﬁgures supplied 
               <br />
               us by the department. 
               <br />
               Mr. Starkes And in April 1939, the total on 
               <br />
               relief was 84,659 ~—- that was ﬁve years after 
               <br />
               Commission of Government came here. Would 
               <br />
               that be right?

               Mr. Ashbourne Yes.

               Mr. Vardy In regard to the 341 on able-bodied 
               <br />
               relief in White Bay, I asked the department why 
               <br />
               that was so and they explained it was in a section 
               <br />
               where the ﬁshery was an absolute failure. They 
               <br />
               were compelled to give temporary relief.

               <br />
               to page 18 and I ﬁnd that is wholly for St. John’s. 
               <br />
               There is no able-bodied relief anywhere else?

               practically non-existent.

               <br />
               where there were something like 5,600 on relief 
               <br />
               in Halifax which is another seaport town. It is 
               <br />
               something which is not the general condition of
