               Mr. Hillier Mr. Chairman, I listened with very 
               <br />
               great interest to the different speakers. They have 
               <br />
               shown much enthusiasm for the cause they are 
               <br />
               sponsoring. I do not propose to take up much time 
               <br />
               in connection with the report before us. I merely 
               <br />
               wish to say that I support the idea of placing 
               <br />
               before the people the two forms, if I may call 
               <br />
               them so, which are contained in this resolution, 
               <br />
               because I feel the people have a right to make one 
               <br />
               of these their choice. But I could not wholehear- 
               <br />
               tedly support this resolution, Mr. Chairman, and 
               <br />
               I think that it might so happen that the other form 
               <br />
               of government, if that may be so termed a form 
               <br />
               of government, which is uppermost in the minds 
               <br />
               of many scattered throughout Newfoundland —— 
               <br />
               I would not, I say, support that motion if I thought 
               <br />
               by any chance this other form, namely confedera-

               Mr. Chairman, we have in the motion before 
               <br />
               us two forms of government, responsible as it 
               <br />
               existed prior to its suspension in 1934, or that the 
               <br />
               present form of government he continued. Let us 
               <br />
               consider both in the light of the opinions of some 
               <br />
               of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people.</span> First, responsible as prior to 1934. 
               <br />
               We had this type of government for about, I think, 
               <br />
               80 years. During this time, we had what might be 
               <br />
               described as good, bad, and indifferent govern- 
               <br />
               ments — it all depends on our own political 
               <br />
               leanings. We had leaders who were statesmen, 
               <br />
               not politicians; others who were politicians, not 
               <br />
               statesmen. It has been said that the difference 
               <br />
               between a statesman and a politician is that the 
               <br />
               former thinks he belongs to the state, and the 
               <br />
               latter that the state belongs to him. I am afraid we 
               <br />
               have had a few of the latter. In my own recollec— 
               <br />
               tion of governments, going back about 50 years 
               <br />
               or so, I have seen some of our public men practi- 
               <br />
               cally ruin themselves in their businesses, owing 
               <br />
               to the interest which they took in their public 
               <br />
               duties, as Mr. Higgins intimated. I have also heard 
               <br />
               others accused of gross incompetency and worse; I 
               <br />
               suppose it’s all in this game they call politics. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               During the period that Mr. Higgins refers to, 
               <br />
               when revenues were low and we carried on, he 
               <br />
               must concede the fact that the expenses of 
               <br />
               government were correspondingly low, and cer- 
               <br />
               tainly it is no argument to compare responsible 
               <br />
               government with Commission of Government, 
               <br />
               who, while having exceedingly high revenues, 
               <br />
               also had to face exceedingly high costs of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">main-</span>
