               May I now comment on our work in connec-

               <br />
               is of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">particular</span> interest to me, which has not been 
               <br />
               sufﬁciently brought out. I put a blunt question to 
               <br />
               the General Manager like this: “From the point 
               <br />
               of view of lessened maintenance costs in the 
               <br />
               future have you got today a better outﬁt to give 
               <br />
               service than you have ever had?” His reply was, 
               <br />
               and I ask the other members of the Committee to 
               <br />
               hear me out, an unqualiﬁed “yes”. He went into 
               <br />
               details on the subject which I am not going to do. 
               <br />
               Further he was expecting a number of things to 
               <br />
               “break” favourably over the next few years of 
               <br />
               operating, so that the costs of our service may be 
               <br />
               lessened. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> As Mr. Smallwood said yesterday, the 
               <br />
               General Manager hopes to see a gradual reduc- 
               <br />
               tion of the ordinary deﬁcit over the next ten years 
               <br />
               after we have passed the present period of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terrifi»</span> 
               <br />
               cally high and abnormal costs, particularly 
               <br />
               materials. To me, looking at the probable costs of 
               <br />
               government in the forseeable future, this is of the 
               <br />
               utmost importance. During the next few years, 
               <br />
               when we have money, we will be able to carry on 
               <br />
               and pay the high <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deﬁcits,</span> But after that period 
               <br />
               when things get back more nearly to normal, 
               <br />
               there will be a corresponding relief in the form of 
               <br />
               reduced railway deﬁcit.

               I turn for a moment to roads, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Chairman,</span> It 
               <br />
               is to my mind quite proper that we should have 
               <br />
               debated the relative merits of trunk versus com- 
               <br />
               munity roads. As a result of our work I feel that 
               <br />
               the country has been reminded that there is a 
               <br />
               direct relationship between the development of 
               <br />
               the economy, or to repeat Mr. Newell’s words, 
               <br />
               the economic potential of the country and the 
               <br />
               development of all necessary means of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com</span>

               munication and transportation. One point here 
               <br />
               did not appear to me to be sufﬁciently brought 
               <br />
               out. It is the fact that roads themselves, their 
               <br />
               location, their standard, the method of building 
               <br />
               them, is of tremendous importance. And further, 
               <br />
               that there is or should be an economic basis for 
               <br />
               the standard, the location, and the method of 
               <br />
               building. For example, if it has been decided that 
               <br />
               a base depot should be established in a certain 
               <br />
               locality, it may be proper economy to build a

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rebuild</span> a road to a necessary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">standard.</span> Finally,

               <br />
               ready reduced my thoughts to writing in an article 
               <br />
               in the Atlantic Guardian, wherein I stated we 
               <br />
               should have an overall design of a transinsular 
               <br />
               road but that it should be constructed in sections 
               <br />
               paralleling the development of these sections. 
               <br />
               The sections to be developed ﬁrst should be based 
               <br />
               on the criterion of their adding to the development 
               <br />
               of our economy or our total production.

               Mr. Chairman, at the moment I have not

               comments to a later date I wish also to say that 
               <br />
               the time taken by me today has a twofold purpose: 
               <br />
               to be helpful to the Convention; and to report 
               <br />
               particularly to that part of Newfoundland which 
               <br />
               is responsible for my being in the Convention. 1 
               <br />
