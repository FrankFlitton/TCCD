               dently brought to bear to secure an amendment 
               <br />
               of this legislation. This particular legislation and

               its object was published in the daily papers at that

               time but no objections were made by an apathetic 
               <br />

               <br />
               mission government releasing this $2.5 million, 
               <br />
               and then we ﬁnd that in August, 1944, Bowaters 
               <br />
               pay dividends to their parent company in 
               <br />
               England, and have continued to pay dividends 
               <br />
               since, and according to their annual report for 
               <br />
               September 30, 1945, they had paid a total in 
               <br />
               dividends to the parent company of some 
               <br />
               $1,676,250 or around 6% per annum. This divid- 
               <br />
               end could not have been paid without releasing 
               <br />
               this security. Furthermore, Mr. Chairman, I want 
               <br />
               to draw the attention of this Convention to the fact 
               <br />
               that the original legislation which was passed in 
               <br />
               1923, and again in 1927, provided for two New— 
               <br />
               foundland directors on the board of this company 
               <br />
               for the purpose of guarding the ﬁnancial interests 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland. At the present time there is no 
               <br />
               Newfoundlander on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">directorate.</span> The two 
               <br />
               directors are the Commissioner for Finance and 
               <br />
               a Montreal lawyer. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Under the provisions of the Gander deal in 
               <br />
               1938, the Corner Brook company was permitted 
               <br />
               to export some 133,000 cords of wood annually, 
               <br />
               but it is compelled to export at least 50,000 cords 
               <br />
               on which they pay the treasury 30 cents per cord. 
               <br />
               Our report draws attention to the fact that during 
               <br />
               the present season 50,000 cords are being <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex“</span> 
               <br />
               ported, whilst the sulphite mill at Corner Brook 
               <br />
               has been closed down for months because of a 
               <br />
               shortage of wood, and recently we are informed 
               <br />
               that owing to a “dry season” and because of 
               <br />
               insufﬁcient wood from the western end of the 
               <br />
               island, the mill may have to go on short shift, thus 
               <br />
               depriving our men of much needed work. We 
               <br />
               show that at least 250 working days have been 
               <br />
               lost to the workers at Comer Brook, and that the 
               <br />
               total earning power will be reduced by at least 
               <br />
               $100,000. If the mill is forced into curtailing its 
               <br />
               operations because of shortage of wood, it will 
               <br />
               mean further reduction in earning power.

               fellow delegate Mr. Brown, and also you, 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman. In viewing this Comer Brook 
               <br />
               development, it must be ever borne in mind that 
               <br />
               the treasury of Newfoundland, the assets of the 
               <br />
               people, is behind this proposition to the extent of 
               <br />
               some $8 million and until such time as that con- 
               <br />
               tingent liability is redeemed, the people of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> 
               <br />
               foundland have a prior right as against those who 
               <br />
               have, in this instance, sacriﬁced our security.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               We find as the result of our investigations that 
               <br />
               the Commission government is also open to cen- 
               <br />
               sure in connection with this policy governing the 
               <br />
               export of raw pulpwood. It should not be neces- 
               <br />
               sary to emphasise that if we are to receive the 
               <br />
               beneﬁt of our forestry resources, we must con- 
               <br />
               serve them. As the report will show you, the 
               <br />
               Bowater people were given the right under the 
               <br />
               Gander deal to export up to 130,000 cords of raw 
               <br />
               pulpwood annually. I regard this as a reckless 
               <br />
               sacriﬁce of our resources and a deliberate depriv- 
               <br />
               ing of our people of labour and earnings. As has 
               <br />
               been stated in this report, the sulphite mill at 
               <br />
               Corner Brook has been idle for several months 
               <br />
               and even the main plant has been forced to curtail 
               <br />
               operations because of shortage of wood. In the 
               <br />
               face of such a situation, which deprives our 
               <br />
               people of their normal earnings, it is tragic to 
               <br />
               lmow that at the same time the government is 
               <br />
               permitting thousands of cords of pulpwood to be 
               <br />
               exported out of the country to keep outsiders 
               <br />
               working, whilst our own men are forced to 
               <br />
               remain idle. I ﬁgure that we have exported out of 
               <br />
               the country during the present season sufficient 
               <br />
               raw wood to keep the Bowater sulphite mill in 
               <br />
               operation for 250 days, which would mean a 
               <br />
               resultant loss in labour to our own people of 
               <br />
               around $100,000. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               In addition, I believe it high time that the 
               <br />
               government should introduce a comprehensive 
               <br />
