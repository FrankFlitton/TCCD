               day afternoon. There are, a couple of

               observations I would like to make now, however, 
               <br />
               relative to the co-operative movement. When Mr. 
               <br />
               Newell was speaking yesterday he stated that 
               <br />
               there was no money put into the co-operative 
               <br />
               movement by the government. Mr. Keough how- 
               <br />
               ever did inform us that the government did have 
               <br />
               money in several of the co-operative movements, 
               <br />
               especially land settlements. Then aquestion from 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett elicited an answer from Mr. Newell, 
               <br />
               that the government had advanced them $50,000 
               <br />
               annually for salaries and travelling <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expenses,</span> I 
               <br />
               contend that any committee bringing in a report 
               <br />
               on any department or institution in which govem- 
               <br />
               ment monies are involved should show what that 
               <br />
               department is costing and is likely to cost in the 
               <br />
               future. I feel that in order to arrive at the cost of 
               <br />
               government these are the facts we must have. 
               <br />
               They are more important than the price of some 
               <br />
               ﬁshery products ten years ago.

               <br />
               ment is concerned. I might say that the land

               settlements (at the present time there are two or 
               <br />

               government, and when they were wound up there 
               <br />
               was a certain amount of stock, buildings, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">etc.</span> left 
               <br />
               over, and an inventory was taken. and in the case 
               <br />
               of Lourdes it amounted to $8,000. Some people 
               <br />
               think that $8,000 was passed over as a gift but 
               <br />
               that is not correct. We have not yet paid off the 
               <br />
               full amount, but we have it down to about $2,000 
               <br />
               and will pay it off practically at any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">time.</span> It is not
