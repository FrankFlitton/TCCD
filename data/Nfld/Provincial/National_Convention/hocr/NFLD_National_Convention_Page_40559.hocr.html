               Mr. Reddy Mr. Chairman, there seems to be 
               <br />
               little doubt left in the minds of the delegates here 
               <br />
               that Newfoundland has been again handed a raw 
               <br />
               deal in respect to the agreement made by the 
               <br />
               government with the Labrador Mining and Ex- 
               <br />
               ploration Co., Ltd. The very fact that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern:</span> 
               <br />
               ment, on request from the company, changed the 
               <br />
               original agreement from a 10 cents per ton royal- 
               <br />
               ty to 5% on the net proﬁts has tended to create 
               <br />
               suspicion. It appears to be an established practice 
               <br />
               for such companies to be associated with sub- 
               <br />
               sidiary companies, and it usually turns out that 
               <br />
               the original company shows little or no proﬁt on 
               <br />
               its operations. Therefore the 5% on proﬁts could 
               <br />
               mean nothing if there is no proﬁt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shown...</span>

               I must disagree with the remarks of Mr. Butt 
               <br />
               yesterday that we should look upon such a 
               <br />
               development from a labour point of view. 1 am 
               <br />
               fully aware that we must encourage labour for our 
               <br />
               own people from every available source. But, 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, for the past 50 years, 
               <br />
               Newfoundland’s most valuable assets have been 
               <br />
               sacriﬁced to labour. In every big development in 
               <br />
               this country, the ship hand of resulting employ- 
               <br />
               ment has been held over the heads of past govern- 
               <br />
               ments to extract concessions unheard of in other 
               <br />
               lands. I feel it is time for us to demand something 
               <br />
               more than labour in return for parting with the 
               <br />
               assets of this country. Today the world supplies 
               <br />
               of iron ore are being depleted, and the eyes of the 
               <br />
               mining world have turned to Labrador, where 
               <br />
               there apparently exists an unlimited quantity of 
               <br />
               this much sought after metal, which I hope can 
               <br />
               yet be mined for the beneﬁt of our land...

               <br />
               characters immortalised in Lewis Carroll’s 
               <br />
               famous poem, who, ﬁnding themselves in a very 
               <br />
               awkward position, said: 
               <br />
               They wept like anything to see such quan- 
               <br />
               tities of sand. 
               <br />
               If this were only cleared away, they said, it 
               <br />
               would be grand.

               It seems that the chief architect responsible for 
               <br />
               the compiling of this report and his worthy as- 
               <br />
               sociates did not entirely agree on the question as 
               <br />
               to whether the legislation incorporating this 
               <br />
               Labrador Mining and Exploration Company was 
               <br />
               the best that might have been enacted at the time 
               <br />
               or not, but all were agreed that if a few vexing 
               <br />
               matters could be cleared up, it would be grand 
               <br />
               indeed. If, for instance, that Grand Falls water—

               <br />
               Committee said it would be grand. Of course, it’s 
               <br />
               just talking in platitudes to say if it were thus. or 
               <br />
               if we had gotten that, all would be well, and it’s 
               <br />
               not helping matters when we set up a whine and 
               <br />
               assert, “Oh well, it’s just what we expected, our
