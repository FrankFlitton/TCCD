               Mr. Crosbie Mr. Chairman, I am not going to 
               <br />
               enter into any petty discussions or sandbag 
               <br />
               anyone. I have heard too much of this; have 
               <br />
               listened to too much doom and disaster and 
               <br />
               sundry roaring and reckon our listeners suffered 
               <br />
               the same, although not at the same time. 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders are not infallible, neither 
               <br />
               are other people, and to prove this I would like to 
               <br />
               take you back to the time Japan declared war on 
               <br />
               China. We were told by the political economists 
               <br />
               of the United States and other countries, includ- 
               <br />
               ing Great Britain, that Japan could not carry on 
               <br />
               war with China without going ﬁnancially broke, 
               <br />
               yet she did continue this war for several <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years.</span> 
               <br />
               Then in March 1933, we were told by the political 
               <br />
               economists of Great Britain and the United States 
               <br />
               that Hitler, who had come to power in Germany, 
               <br />
               could not last six months, yet in fact he lasted 
               <br />
               until 1939 when he declared war on Great Britain 
               <br />
               and later the United States, and for six years he 
               <br />
               waged war against these two great nations and 
               <br />
               their allies. Japan later attacked the United States 
               <br />
               and helped Hitler for at least two or three years 
               <br />
               of war against these two great countries. Hitler 
               <br />
               lasted long enough to bring untold hardship and 
               <br />
               starvation to millions, and millions are still suf- 
               <br />
               fering, yet we are told here in this chamber that 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders are foolish, because they bring 
               <br />
               in a report and make estimates that may not 
               <br />
               finally turn out. I have seen budgets and estimates 
               <br />
               made of other countries with the same result. It is 
               <br />
               true that the report of your Committee may be 
               <br />
               changed in places, that is why it is brought in 
               <br />
               here; to be treated the same as other reports ——-

               I would like to review once more our ﬁsheries. 
               <br />
               As we know it is from our fisheries that the 
               <br />
               greatest number of our people obtain their 
               <br />
               livelihood. If our ﬁsheries are prosperous, our 
               <br />
               country is prosperous... It may come as a surprise 
               <br />
               to some of you to know that we are the second 
               <br />
               largest exporter of frozen fish and fishery 
               <br />
               products to the United States. Canada comes ﬁrst, 
               <br />
               but some day I hope we will come ﬁrst. You 
               <br />
               know that there has been a meeting of many 
               <br />
               countries to discuss the reduction of tariffs and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intervtrade;</span> it may be possible there will be a 
               <br />
               reduction on certain tariffs and then New- 
               <br />
               foundland will beneﬁt, we cannot expect better 
               <br />
               treatment than other countries, but at least we 
               <br />
               may expect the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">same.</span> We have been told that this 
               <br />
               country is in a very strategic position. This is 
               <br />
               perfectly true. But I do not mean a strategic 
               <br />
               position with regard to war, but with regard to our 
               <br />
               ﬁshing banks, the water around and near our 
               <br />
               shores. We are known to have one of the largest 
               <br />
               continental ﬁshing ledges in the world, one of the 
               <br />
               best. I have been told by presidents of large 
               <br />
               ﬁshing companies of the United States that some 
               <br />
               day in the near future they will have to come to 
               <br />
               Newfoundland for their raw materials. This 
               <br />
               paints a nice picture in my mind of what our 
               <br />
               ﬁsheries may be in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">future.</span> In 1934-35 we
