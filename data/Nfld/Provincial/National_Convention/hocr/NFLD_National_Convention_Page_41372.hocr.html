               detemiined by economic factors beyond our con-

               trol? One delegate speaking a few days ago 
               <br />
               pleaded for a government that would provide 
               <br />
               those elusive peaks of attainment called 
               <br />
               economic security and political stability. Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, I very much doubt if any government 
               <br />
               in the world can provide such blessings, and 
               <br />
               although I am inclined to agree with that 
               <br />
               gentleman that there is a form of government that 
               <br />
               might go a long way toward such an attainment, 
               <br />
               yet in the main, the responsibility for our future 
               <br />
               prosperity as a people and for our stability of 
               <br />
               government will rest entirely with us. For 
               <br />
               whatever form of government we adopt, there 
               <br />
               will still be those strong westerlies dashing the 
               <br />
               cold Atlantic spray in the face of the industrious 
               <br />
               ﬁsherman as his boat navigates the stormy waters 
               <br />
               of Cape Freels. There will still remain those long 
               <br />
               and weary nights as fearless schooner fishermen 
               <br />
               keep their watch and hope for daylight, as their

               <br />

               <br />
               elements to contend with, the vagaries of the

               Mr. Chairman, I believe I am right in saying 
               <br />
               that there is not a man or woman of voting age in 
               <br />
               this country who does not believe in the concept 
               <br />
               of self-government. That almost legendary ﬁg— 
               <br />
               ure, honest Abe Lincoln, talked of a government 
               <br />
               of the people, by the people and for the people. 
               <br />
               Maybe such a government never did exist. 
               <br />
               Maybe it is like Sir Thomas More’s Utopia, a 
               <br />
               myth, a daydream, which for its author meant 
               <br />
               having his head cut off by order of an un- 
               <br />
               scrupulous monarch whose only philosophy was 
               <br />
               a blind belief in the divine right of kings.

               In addressing myself to this motion, I am 
               <br />
               placed in a rather awkward position. As a mem- 
               <br />
               ber of this Convention, I ask myself what is 
               <br />
               expected of me at this juncture. A <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great~uncle</span> of 
               <br />
               mine at the turn of the century contested a section 
               <br />
               of the district which I have the honour to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">repre«</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sent,</span> Unfortunately he was defeated. Asked some 
               <br />
               years later what caused his defeat, he said his 
               <br />
               defeat was the result of his having the courage of 
               <br />
               his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">convictions,</span> At the risk of suffering alike fate, 
               <br />
               should I at some future date decide to follow 
               <br />
               Major Cashin‘s career as a politician, I am going 
               <br />
               to frankly state my convictions, although in order 
               <br />
               to be fair, I must ﬁrst say that I support the idea 
               <br />
               of placing both forms on the ballot paper in the 
               <br />
               referendum. I would explain here, sir, that I am 
               <br />
               merely supporting the putting of responsible and 
               <br />
               commission forms of government on the ballot; 
               <br />
               I cannot and will not recommend them. 
               <br />
               Moreover, I want to make it unmistakably clear 
               <br />
               that in supporting them, I am not trying to place 
               <br />
               any restriction or limitation in the way of the 
               <br />
               people in their exercising a choice of a form of
