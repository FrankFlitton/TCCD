               keep a tight reign on any great expectations with 
               <br />
               regard to our forests and our mines. The most we 
               <br />
               can ever hope to see come of their exploitation is 
               <br />
               that a few will do pretty well and a few more will 
               <br />
               manage to get along. But the number of New-

               livelihood is decidedly limited. Today, as ever,

               depend upon ﬁsh and what can be made from its

               island is compounded of much more than what 
               <br />
               comes of the export of ﬁsh. But the ﬁshing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in»</span>

               dustry is the only significant point of contact that

               <br />
               share in it at all signiﬁcantly; and if there is no

               The most signiﬁcant development within the 
               <br />
               structure of our economy since the days of Cabot 
               <br />
               came during the war with the great diversion to 
               <br />
               frozen fish processing on a large scale. This was 
               <br />
               a more signiﬁcant development even than the 
               <br />
               coming of the paper mills. It touched with a 
               <br />
               golden touch the lives of more people and 
               <br />
               released many man hours for productive work. 
               <br />
               We have had high hopes that this diversiﬁcation 
               <br />
               within the structure of our chief industry would 
               <br />
               lead to greater stability of our economy, since it 
               <br />
               would mean that we would have one more basket 
               <br />
               into which to put our eggs. This year our frozen 
               <br />
               ﬁsh trade has received a set-back at the hands of 
               <br />
               our ancient enemy the foreign market, and we 
               <br />
               have been salting away our ﬁsh almost as franti- 
               <br />
               cally as at any time since the beginning. Yet there 
               <br />
               is the decided difference that, in all the years 
               <br />
               since the beginning, there is a greater measure of 
               <br />
               centralisation. Even if we have had to salt much

               we have any longer any grounds to hope for a 
               <br />
               more spacious destiny there. In a little while, 
               <br />
               perhaps the time is even now, world production 
               <br />
               of salt cod is going to be in excess of a world

               demand which those best qualiﬁed to judge admit 
               <br />
               cannot be increased. I grant you that we shall 
               <br />
               always be able to sell some salt cod provided we 
               <br />
               are prepared to sell at a low enough price. In any

               Another important respect in which our
