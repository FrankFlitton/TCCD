               So that I have lived long enough, being born in 
               <br />
               1900, to see the cost of government in New- 
               <br />
               foundland rise from $8.50 a head of our popula- 
               <br />
               tion up to $113 a head last year. In the same 47 
               <br />
               years, I have lived to see the government expen- 
               <br />
               diture rise from 21% of the country’s exports up 
               <br />
               to 60%. Although it’s true that the figure of the 
               <br />
               value of our exports in any given year is not a tme 
               <br />
               value of the wealth produced in the country, 
               <br />
               nevertheless it does represent the money that 
               <br />
               comes back into Newfoundland. The only money 
               <br />
               that comes back into Newfoundland in any year, 
               <br />
               with exception of a few dollars, is the money for 
               <br />
               the ﬁsh, the iron ore, the paper and the pulp, and 
               <br />
               the pit props we ship out, and the oils and the 
               <br />
               other products of the country — our exports. And 
               <br />
               we have come to the day when 61% of the total 
               <br />
               value of all our country’s exports is being taken 
               <br />
               by the Newfoundland government and spent on 
               <br />
               public services.

               Sir, I’m sorry the Major was absent for a 
               <br />
               couple of minutes while I was making that bit of 
               <br />
               a speech. I‘d like him to have heard it. However, 
               <br />
               I guess he’s heard it before. Let me take these four 
               <br />
               decades and describe the condition of the country 
               <br />
               for each of them. For the ﬁrst ten years, from 
               <br />
               1900—09, the condition of Newfoundland was 
               <br />
               fair. I think Major Cashin would agree with that. 
               <br />
               In those ten years, the average taken from our 
               <br />
               exports by the government was 22%. The average 
               <br />
               taken from the people was $10.50 a head. Our 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
         </div>
         
         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_8" title="bbox 775 188 1313 1881">
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               condition was fair. Now let’s take the next ten 
               <br />
               years, 1910-1919, what was our condition then? 
               <br />
               Fair plus, fair and better than fair. Why is it?.... 
               <br />
               Here’s why. Number one, they built the branch 
               <br />
               railways; number two, they started Grand Falls, 
               <br />
               so there was construction work in two directions; 
               <br />
               number three, the war. Now these three things in 
               <br />
               that decade made the condition of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               a bit better than fair, fair plus. Now come down 
               <br />
               to the next ten years, from 1920-1929, what was 
               <br />
               the condition of Newfoundland? Bad, and then 
               <br />
               fair. We all remember it. I remember the rock 
               <br />
               sheds, I remember the unemployment, I remem- 
               <br />
               ber the riots, I remember the dole, I remember the 
               <br />
               hard times here in Newfoundland from 1920- 
               <br />
               1929. It began bad and it ended up fair. Why? 
               <br />
               Bad, because the post-war depression hit us in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">192021.</span> 1922, 1923, Humber started, the con- 
               <br />
               struction out on the Humber, and they spent, ifI 
               <br />
               remember rightly, $45 million on the project. 
               <br />
               Men worked, they poured out there from all pans 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland. There was a tremendous 
               <br />
               change and turnover of men, thousands got jobs 
               <br />
               out on the Humber. So it began to be fair. Then 
               <br />
               the Buchans mine started — and that made those 
               <br />
               ten years not so bad — began bad but ended fair. 
               <br />
               Now we take the next ten years, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">19304939,</span> what 
               <br />
               have you got, the worst period in the whole 
               <br />
               history of Newfoundland. And when I say that 
               <br />
               I’m not forgetting the years of “injun” meal and 
               <br />
               molasses. I’m not forgetting some of the hard 
               <br />
               times in the 1850s and 18603 and 18703 in New- 
               <br />
               foundland. But I still say that 1930- 1939 were the 
               <br />
               worst in the history of this country. Why? Of 
               <br />
               course the world depression, we all know that. 
               <br />
               But, I suggest to you, mainly because in those ten 
               <br />
               years there were no windfalls. Now what were 
               <br />
               the windfalls? From 1910-1919 we had three 
               <br />
               windfalls. The starting of Grand Falls, the start- 
               <br />
               ing of the branch railways, the starting of the war 
               <br />
               —— these were the three windfalls that came to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland...</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1910‘1919,</span> three windfalls. 
               <br />
               1920-1929, two windfalls ~— the Humber and 
               <br />
               Buchans. In 1930-39, no windfalls and the worst 
               <br />
               times that Newfoundland has ever seen. But from 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">19404947,</span> 3 lot of windfalls. The war, the base 
               <br />
               construction which poured, what, $400 — 500 
               <br />
               million into Newfoundland, in all these military 
               <br />
               bases, Canadian and American and British — and 
               <br />
               increased prices for our ﬁsh. You could sell <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> 
               <br />
               thing, the only trouble was to be a little fair to
