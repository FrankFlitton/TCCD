               In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I think that 
               <br />
               money spent on education is money well spent, 
               <br />
               because the better a community is educated the 
               <br />
               better it can manage its own affairs, and this 
               <br />
               applies to the government of a country as well. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman With regard to your motion, 
               <br />
               Mr. J ackman, I have discussed it with Professor 
               <br />
               Wheare and we feel we cannot pass a motion 
               <br />
               making a recommendation to the government; 
               <br />
               but you can make a recommendation to the 
               <br />
               Education Committee as to the possibility of 
               <br />
               approaching the appropriate authorities to the 
               <br />
               basic wages of teachers being raised. You cannot 
               <br />
               go straight to the Education Committee and ask 
               <br />
               them to make a recommendation to the govern- 
               <br />
               ment; you can ask that an amendment be put in 
               <br />
               the report condemning the low wages of teachers. 
               <br />
               In those circumstances I am afraid I cannot accept 
               <br />
               your motion as it is now.

               splendid college has served a useful purpose to a 
               <br />
               point; but after 21 years as a junior college, that 
               <br />
               is, a college giving the first two years of arts and 
               <br />
               science, (three years for engineering), students 
               <br />
               who desire further education must go abroad to 
               <br />
               Canada or the USA and spend about two years to 
               <br />
               complete their studies for a degree in arts and 
               <br />
               science. Canadian colleges and universities have 
               <br />
               a very high regard for the quality of the work done 
               <br />
               by our students. This is good proof that the col— 
               <br />
               lege has so far justified its existence as a junior 
               <br />
               college. It is likely now that after 21 years of 
               <br />
               existence the college has probably reached the 
               <br />
               limit of its possibilities as a junior college. The 
               <br />
               next step should be the development to a degree- 
               <br />
               giving college. This appears an appropriate time, 
               <br />
               as the present college was a memorial to those 
               <br />
               who served, and more particularly those who 
               <br />
               died, in the cause of freedom during the great war, 
               <br />
               19l4-l918. What more fitting memorial could 
               <br />
               there be to those who died during the second great 
               <br />
               war than the inaugurating of a degree-conferring 
               <br />
               college? Newfoundland is probably the only 
               <br />
               dominion which cannot boast of such an institu- 
               <br />
               tion of higher learning. For reasons of prestige, 
               <br />
               therefore, this step is highly desirable. 
               <br />

               The beneﬁts from the present college have 
               <br />
               been felt throughout the whole island, since the 
               <br />
               students come from every part of Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               and after their studies return for the most part to 
               <br />
               their towns and villages. With degree status the

               tion in raising the general standard or level of 
               <br />
               education in this country. It is likely that over a

               period of ten years the enrollment would rise 
               <br />
               considerably. At present the normal enrollment 
               <br />
               would appear to be about 380. With degree status 
               <br />
               the enrollment would soon rise to an average each
