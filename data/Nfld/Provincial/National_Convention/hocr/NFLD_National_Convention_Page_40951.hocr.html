               Ottawa and Australia, between the members of

               the Cabinet in Ottawa and Mr. Claxton in 
               <br />
               Australia. But then Mr. Claxton came back to 
               <br />
               Canada before we left, and Italked with him, and 
               <br />
               he said that they would not only establish these

               <br />
               be made to enlist Newfoundland ofﬁcers in the 
               <br />
               units, but above all in the Newfoundland Regi- 
               <br />
               ment; I think the idea would be that quite a 
               <br />
               number of Newfoundlanders with military ex- 
               <br />
               perience of ofﬁcer material, would be offered the 
               <br />
               opportunity to serve in these defence units that 
               <br />
               the Government of Canada would establish in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hickman Those reserve units, they would 
               <br />
               be something similar to what they have in 
               <br />
               Canada? They would not be permanent units, but 
               <br />
               they would just meet one or two nights a week, 
               <br />
               and have two or three weeks in camp, or some— 
               <br />
               thing along that line. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Yes. It’s like a territorial army, 
               <br />
               something like the National Guard in the United 
               <br />
               States where men go once or twice a week in their 
               <br />
               off-time to drill, and are given their uniforms; 
               <br />
               they are not on seven days pay in other words. I 
               <br />
               suppose its something like a gloriﬁed CLB and 
               <br />
               in the summer they have manoeuvres and go into

               free trade between Newfoundland and Canada, 
               <br />

               <br />
               apply. Oleomargan’ne, although manufactured 
               <br />
               and sold in Newfoundland, would not be per- 
               <br />
               mitted to go into the rest of Canada while the 
               <br />
               Dairy Industry Act forbids it. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Thank you Mr. Smallwood, 
               <br />
               that’s the point. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood There is a very great and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con»</span> 
               <br />
               tinuing pressure from the public of Canada, going 
               <br />
               on for many many months past and still going on 
               <br />
               stronger than ever, to permit the manufacture and 
               <br />
               sale and importation of margarine into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada.“</span> 
               <br />
               Anyway, sir, the point is whatever is the case in 
               <br />
               Canada, whether or not Canada will ever permit 
               <br />
               margarine to be sold, in Newfoundland it will be 
               <br />
               permitted not only to be sold, but to he manufac- 
               <br />
               tured, and to be exported if we can find a market 
               <br />
               for margarine in any other country except 
               <br />
               Canada. I ﬁrmly believe that the Parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada is going to remove the present restriction 
               <br />
               for all Canada just as they offer in these terms, in 
               <br />
               this clause; just as they offer to remove that 
               <br />
               restriction for Newfoundland alone, so they are 
               <br />
               going to do it for all Canada, perhaps. If they do 
               <br />
               sir, it seems at least possible that Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               possessing as she does one of the ﬁnest factories 
               <br />
               in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">world'making</span> margarine, and I refer of 
               <br />
               course to the Newfoundland Butter Company 
               <br />
               that the minute Canada removes the restriction, 
               <br />
               then the Maritime Provinces could, and I believe 
               <br />
               would, become at once a natural market for mar- 
               <br />
               garine manufactured in Newfoundland... 
               <br />
               Mr. Fogwill I wonder if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Smallwood could 
               <br />
               tell us if the general sales tax of 8% will be 
               <br />
               imposed on the oleomargarine? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood As there is no margarine in 
               <br />
               Canada it is a little difﬁcult to say whether the 
               <br />
               sales tax does apply or not... 
               <br />
               Mr. Fogwill Well, according to this, if we are 
               <br />
               allowed to manufacture it in Newfoundland it 
               <br />
               will be legal. Therefore I wish to ask Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood if he would ﬁnd out that information 
               <br />
               It would amount to quite a tidy sum going to 
               <br />
               Ottawa each year, somewhere around $190,000. 
               <br />
               Mr. Bailey I don’t think a sales tax would apply 
               <br />
               in Canada, as it does not apply to butter. While 
               <br />
               butter in Canada is brought down here you will 
               <br />
