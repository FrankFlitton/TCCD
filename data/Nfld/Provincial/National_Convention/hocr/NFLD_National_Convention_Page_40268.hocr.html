               The war came, and during the war, although 
               <br />
               they began to make money and had a surplus, it 
               <br />
               was impossible to get the material necessary to 
               <br />
               put the telegraph system into operation. It is true 
               <br />
               they had the radio~telegraph system before the 
               <br />
               war began, but that is now worn out because it 
               <br />
               was bought when radio was comparatively new 
               <br />
               and the materials are now antiquated. Before the 
               <br />
               war they had no money. For the 21 years between 
               <br />
               the two wars, they lost an average of $350,000 a 
               <br />
               year; or, taking out the war years, they lost 
               <br />
               $500,000 a year in that department. Now that the 
               <br />
               material is to be had, when they can they want to 
               <br />
               buy new material for an entirely new telegraph 
               <br />
               and land line system. The new system will cost 
               <br />
               $1 million.

               Mr. Higgins I am not averse to slamming the

               Mr. Higgins I do think it might have been in-

               cluded in the Committee’s report rather than 
               <br />
               coming from the Secretary. On the other matter, 
               <br />
               that of salaries, I think it is a disgraceful thing, in 
               <br />
               what we call a civilised country, to have a person 
               <br />
               with the gloriﬁed title of postmaster receiving 
               <br />
               $4.80 a week. We either should cut out the 
               <br />
               gloriﬁed title, cut out the job, or give the person 
               <br />
               a salary consistent with the responsibility it en- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tails,</span> Like Mr. Hollett I have dealt with certain 
               <br />
               cases of defaulting. I certainly can ﬁnd a lot of 
               <br />
               excuses for postmasters and postmistresses who 
               <br />
               have had to dip into the till to support their 
               <br />
               families. You are practically driving the person 
               <br />
               to peculation in some form or other. We have to 
               <br />
               remember that this man or woman receiving 
               <br />
               $4.80 a week has money orders for thousands of 
               <br />
               dollars going through his or her ofﬁce. The whole 
               <br />
               system is entirely wrong. You get a person to 
               <br />
               spend his or her time and energy, and the use of

               <br />

               <br />
               each and every resident of this island for putting 
               <br />
               up with that form of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">slavery,</span> For that’s all it is. I 
               <br />
               think you were proper to bring out the salaries as 
               <br />
               you did, and I believe that the general assembly 
               <br />
               here today agrees with the idea set forth by Mr. 
               <br />
               Hollett, that that $4.80 is the worst badge of 
               <br />
               slavery imposed by any government of the 
               <br />
               civilised world on their fellow citizens. 
               <br />
               Mr. Burry <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">...,Now</span> just why a department can 
               <br />
               show such a ﬁne surplus without giving better 
               <br />
               service is beyond my ability to understand. Of 
               <br />
               course I do know the conditions that exist in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, but 1 know the conditions in 
               <br />
               Labrador better. They have not been given very 
               <br />
               clearly in the report, although mention has been 
               <br />
               made of them. $12 per person was what the 38 
               <br />
               postmasters in Labrador received, and this is just 
               <br />
               one clear case for members getting up to say that 
               <br />
               the ﬁgures are ridiculous. But the services of the 
               <br />
               mail system, for instance in Labrador, are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> 
               <br />
               thing but a credit to any government or any 
               <br />
               department. It is an isolated region, and we do not 
               <br />
               expect the public service that we would like to 
               <br />
               have, but there are some things that could be 
               <br />
               improved, and the mail system is one of them. 
               <br />
               Just a few days ago I was talking to Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">JD,</span> 
               <br />
               Williams of the Labrador Development Com- 
               <br />
               pany,1 and he is worried about his people down 
               <br />
               there on Labrador getting no mail for all these 
               <br />
               months. He has a right to be distressed about it, 
               <br />
               and something could be done about getting some 
               <br />
               mail into that coast. Where I come from, in the 
               <br />
               Hamilton Inlet area, they are still waiting for their 
               <br />
               ﬁrst mail since the first of October, and they will 
               <br />
               have to wait yet. We do get our mail by air now, 
               <br />
               because planes are going in from Halifax three 
               <br />
               times a week to Goose Bay, and distributed along 
               <br />
               that immediate vicinity; but regularly it is done 
               <br />
               by dog team, and that is a very poor system, and 
               <br />
               the eight carriers are very poorly paid I can assure 
               <br />
               you. They have long distances to go, over <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dif~</span> 
               <br />
               ﬁcult and rough terrain, and I know because I 
               <br />
               have travelled with them time and again. I have 
               <br />
               helped them over the hills and have known the 
               <br />
               hardships that they have to go <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">through.</span> I am able 
               <br />
