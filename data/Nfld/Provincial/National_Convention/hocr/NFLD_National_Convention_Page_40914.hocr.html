               committee sir, and, to the best of my recollection 
               <br />
               we only met them once, but information that we

               time was to do with the steamship part of it. We 
               <br />
               met the railway part only once. I think that’s so.

               <br />
               anything with them, and again I am going by 
               <br />
               memory, except give them what information they 
               <br />
               required. All that we had with us, and all that they 
               <br />
               wanted that we had to acquire from New- 
               <br />
               foundland, we gave them that. As a result they 
               <br />
               made a report to, I presume, the committee that
