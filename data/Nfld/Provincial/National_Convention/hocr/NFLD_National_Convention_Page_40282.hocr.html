               There is one other matter to which I would like 
               <br />
               to refer. Mr. Smallwood replied to a question in 
               <br />
               connection with duty on plates for the repair of 
               <br />
               ships. The duty is refundable on foreign ships, but 
               <br />
               it is not refundable on our own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ships.</span> I take it that 
               <br />
               applies to the Railway ~— the ships run by the 
               <br />
               Railway?

               Mr. Job They presumably pay duty and it con- 
               <br />
               sequently increases the cost of operation. It is the 
               <br />
               same with our local mercantile marine. I do not 
               <br />
               know how we are going to expect to compete 
               <br />
               with other people in working up a mercantile 
               <br />
               marine when that condition exists. The Railway 
               <br />
               itself is the largest employer of mercantile marine 
               <br />
               at the present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">time.</span> I suppose one of these days 
               <br />
               we will again be sending all our produce abroad 
               <br />
               in foreign <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ships,</span> because they are operating more 
               <br />
               cheaply, and it is not right that these duties are 
               <br />
               charged against our own ships when they have to 
               <br />
               compete with these ships. Ninety percent of our 
               <br />
               fish was shipped, in previous <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years,</span> in Norwegian 
               <br />
               ships and they gave very good service. It is a sad 
               <br />
               thing being a naval people that we cannot work 
               <br />
               up a good mercantile marine of our own and run 
               <br />
               our own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ships.</span> Things like this question of duty 
               <br />
               have something to do with it.

               Mr. Smallwood It is a pleasure indeed to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               myself in such complete agreement with Mr. Job. 
               <br />
               Anything charged in the repair of local vessels on 
               <br />
               the Newfoundland Dock is an imposition, a bur~ 
               <br />
               den on local shipping. As a free trader, an anti- 
               <br />
               protectionist I would say that all our productive 
               <br />
               industries should be exempted from customs 
               <br />
               duty.... I would say sweep out the customs duty, 
               <br />
               have free trade, and do away with this protection. 
               <br />
               If our local mercantile marine has got to compete 
               <br />
               with any other merchant marine, then it is neces- 
               <br />
               sary to reduce the costs of operation. The same

               <br />
               the ﬁshing industry is paying customs duty. Let’s

               Mr. Ashbourne 1 don’t see why these ships 
               <br />
               coming into Newfoundland and using our dock 
               <br />
               should not pay the duty on the stuff that goes into 
               <br />
               them. Does anybody think these ships would ever 
               <br />
               come here if they did not have to pay? Why 
               <br />
               should our own ships have to pay it, and foreign 
               <br />
               ships get a rebate of duty? 1 must say I feel very 
               <br />
               strongly about the matter, and while discussing 
               <br />
               the dockyard I would like to ask Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               the number of people on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">payroll....</span> Now it

               may be that you have not that at hand, butI would 
               <br />
               certainly like to know how many people are on 
               <br />
               that payroll with over $1 million...

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Smallwood I could give the ofﬁcial ex- 
               <br />
               planation, not meaning that I agree with it all, If 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashboume had a vessel and she needed 
               <br />
               repairs, and he decided to repair her down in 
               <br />
               Twillingate and he had to use materials for those 
               <br />
               repairs he would get no rebate of the duty on the 
               <br />
               material, and the government takes the stand that 
               <br />
               whether that is done by himself in Twillingate or 
               <br />
               done for him at the docks in St. John’s, it is the 
               <br />
               same situation as far as customs duty is con- 
               <br />
               cerned. In other words, all the local merchant 
               <br />
               marine pays duty on certain things used in the 
               <br />
               repair and operation of their ships. Now why 
               <br />
               should any difference be made for foreign ships 
               <br />
               going on the dock? Their answer is that by charg- 
               <br />
               ing duty on material used to repair a local vessel 
               <br />
               on the dock they are only doing what that vessel 
               <br />
               has to do if it is repaired anywhere else in the 
               <br />
               country, but in getting a ship from outside they 
               <br />
               are getting something new, and they have to be 
               <br />
               in a position to compete with other docks, and for 
               <br />
               that reason the duty is paid back. That‘s clear to 
               <br />
               me, not saying that I agree with it, but I can 
               <br />
               certainly see that if you going to have duty on the 
               <br />
               local you must have it off on the foreign or you 
               <br />
               will not get any foreign ships to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do.</span> It’s probably 
               <br />
               a bit cheaper for a man having a local ship 
               <br />
               repaired on the dock, because it reduces the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">over»</span> 
               <br />
               head, therefore making it a little cheaper for local 
               <br />
               vessels.
