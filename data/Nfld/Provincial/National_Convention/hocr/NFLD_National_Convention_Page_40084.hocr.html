               <br />
               long run, give the fishermen much better returns 
               <br />
               than those from saltﬁsh.” I wonder how long that 
               <br />
               run is going to be? We are trying to think of some 
               <br />
               way by which we can raise the standard of the 
               <br />
               people, and the only way is to raise the standard 
               <br />
               of the primary producer. I am afraid the price for 
               <br />
               fresh fish paid to the man who goes out in the 
               <br />
               morning and comes back in the evening, will 
               <br />
               largely depend on the amount of money that that 
               <br />
               man would get if he had salted the ﬁsh, provided 
               <br />
               there was no ﬁsh plant there. I have all honour 
               <br />
               and respect for the men who have been building 
               <br />
               up this fresh fish industry. The progress made 
               <br />
               over the last few years is marvellous — tremen- 
               <br />
               dous.... But the point is this: if the fresh fish 
               <br />
               industry is going to be of real beneﬁt to this 
               <br />
               country, it must, primarily, be of a real beneﬁt to 
               <br />
               the primary producer — the man who goes out 
               <br />
               and risks his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">life...</span> At the moment a man goes out 
               <br />
               and catches fish and comes in hoping to sell in 
               <br />
               cold storage. He may be unable to do that; there— 
               <br />
               fore he has to salt it, make it and dry it. How are 
               <br />
               we going to prevent some unscrupulous fresh ﬁsh 
               <br />
               man from taking advantage of that situation? He 
               <br />
               has, in a real sense, a gun which he can put to that 
               <br />
               man’s head by saying, “All right, go salt your 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fish,</span> you will get only $5 or $10. You do not have 
               <br />
               to work; you do not have to run the risk of 
               <br />
               weather.” How are we going to prevent this? If 
               <br />
               this Convention is going to back the fresh fish 
               <br />
               industry, we have to be careful about that point. 
               <br />
               Fresh ﬁsh is all right — a lot of fortunes have 
               <br />
               been made out of it. You may say, “How am I 
               <br />
               going to gain by it? I will not have to get down 
               <br />
               on the ﬂake and spread <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> How much more is it 
               <br />
               going to raise the standard of living?” The answer 
               <br />
               to that is to unite. Unless the fresh fish trade 
               <br />
               endeavours to work up some sort of co—operation 
               <br />
               between themselves, the fishermen and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pack“</span> 
               <br />
               ers, then I am afraid the fresh fish industry will 
               <br />
               go the way of saltﬁsh. I put it through you to the 
               <br />
               Fisheries Board that is something that has to be 
               <br />
               taken into account. We have first to raise the 
               <br />
               standard of living of the people; from the fresh 
               <br />
               ﬁsh industry as well as the lumbering industries 
               <br />
               and everything else, and I suggest that one of the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst things the promoters of the fresh fish <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in‘</span> 
               <br />
               dustry have to do is to gain the confidence of the 
               <br />
               men who produce the raw material. How it is

               it is done, the fresh fish industry is ruined from

               <br />

               Mr. Job In replying to that, it is stated in the

               <br />

               <br />
               money invested and unless the operator can do 
               <br />
               well in the first few years of the industry, it is

               Mr. Newell I was going to make somewhat the

               evidence the Fisheries Committee has at its dis-

               Mr. Job We have no evidence other than the 
               <br />
               statements of the cold storage <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">plants.</span> You could

               the operators of all commercial concerns are after 
               <br />
               one thing. In my experience the merchants have

               accept the statement as it stood. I want to have as 
               <br />
               little to say as possible on the subject, but I am in

               Mr. Northcott On page 5, paragraph 51 it says,
