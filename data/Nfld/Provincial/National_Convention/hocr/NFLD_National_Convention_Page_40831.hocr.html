               Mr. Cranford ...Being a member of the 
               <br />
               Finance Committee, I had no intention of speak- 
               <br />
               ing on this Economic Report as I had given it 
               <br />
               every consideration before endorsing it. But the 
               <br />
               critics of this report have not even given the 
               <br />
               Committee the credit of admitting that some 
               <br />
               points of our report have been made by surmise 
               <br />
               or even conjecture. One member has shouted, 
               <br />
               “Let us be honest with ourselves <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~—</span> let us face the 
               <br />
               brutal facts”. I cannot help but accept that chal- 
               <br />
               lenge, and will not forget it while this Convention 
               <br />
               lasts, as it rings in my ears day and night; not 
               <br />
               because I am afraid of being charged with 
               <br />
               dishonesty, but because I wonder if the people 
               <br />
               who are listening in will take it in the same spirit 
               <br />
               of why it was said as I do, and that it was nothing 
               <br />
               more or less than playing politics; I am sure that 
               <br />
               the person who shouted such words would not 
               <br />
               attempt to accuse any member of the Finance

               <br />
               my own products. How well I remember 18 years 
               <br />
               ago when I began shipping fresh salmon to the 
               <br />
               Boston market on commission basis, salmon I 
               <br />
               had caught and bought. The largest shipment for 
               <br />

               <br />
               noon, too late for that day’s consumption. It was

               the only salmon that my agent had for that day, 
               <br />
               and would have fetched a fair price but for the

               So you see, ﬁshermen are going to meet rever-

               ses through bad voyages and poor markets. But 
               <br />
               the point I want to make is this: the critics of the 
               <br />
               Economic Report who bring in the misfortune of 
               <br />
               our hard-working ﬁshermen and throw it at the 
               <br />
               writers of the report, are only doing it for the 
               <br />
               purpose of political propaganda and playing 
               <br />
               upon the misfortunes of our fishermen for their 
               <br />
               own political ends. My sympathy goes out to 
               <br />
               those ﬁshermen who have toiled all season with 
               <br />
               practically no returns; and only fishermen like

               myself who have had the same experience know 
               <br />
               the feeling of it. And I, as a fisherman, dare any 
               <br />
               person to say that I have not used all my energy 
               <br />
               and inﬂuence in the interest of the fishermen

               while at this Convention. Many members have 
               <br />
               heard me say that the only industry that should 
               <br />
               have any protection, particularly customs tariff 
               <br />
               protection, is the ﬁshermen. Also I have said, 
               <br />
               “Never mind the businessmen, protect the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fisher</span>
