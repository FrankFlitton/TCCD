               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">circumstances...</span> Now to summarise the posi- 
               <br />
               tion regarding Newfoundland, let it be made 
               <br />
               clear, that it’s not our people, our economy, or 
               <br />
               both, which interests that group, or any member 
               <br />
               of it, but rather our clearly deﬁned geographical 
               <br />
               or strategieal position, the Gibraltar of the west. 
               <br />
               It is from this angle rather than our intrinsic value 
               <br />
               as the possessor or producer of wealth that we 
               <br />
               should lay a special emphasis on, stressing our 
               <br />
               real worth as a proposed partner with any mem- 
               <br />
               ber of that group. Notwithstanding the fact that 
               <br />
               our virgin territory in the Labrador may possess 
               <br />
               much valuable wealth, I am of the very deﬁnite 
               <br />
               opinion that Newfoundland is controlled and will 
               <br />
               be more fully controlled in the future by an inter- 
               <br />
               national body in which Great Britain, the USA 
               <br />
               and Canada will be represented. The unfortunate, 
               <br />
               unsettled and troubled conditions in the world 
               <br />
               today makes this impossible to avoid. But the 
               <br />
               interest of our population and Newfoundland as 
               <br />
               a whole could best be served by a revised form 
               <br />
               of self-government for our country. And I would 
               <br />
               not agree to more than 15 members serving on 
               <br />
               that body. The basis of terms may have appeared 
               <br />
               at ﬁrst sight to be generally fair to Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               But the more we examine them the more we are 
               <br />
               reminded of a huge iceberg which starts to sway 
               <br />
               toward the sea... Mr. Chairman, unless our 
               <br />
               Canadian friends are prepared to equalise our 
               <br />
               national debt, putting aside the difference to be 
               <br />
               spent for the development of this country, and 
               <br />
               accept us as equal partners and prove we are to 
               <br />
               be treated as such, I fail to see how any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fair.</span> 
               <br />
               minded Newfoundlander can vote for confedera- 
               <br />
               tion. We have all heard sufﬁcient proof from both 
               <br />
               sides since the day it started. We should know by 
               <br />
               now what is fair and what is not fair in these 
               <br />
               terms. There must of necessity be inherent in 
               <br />
               every man such a thing as reason. And regardless 
               <br />
               of how they vote I’ll give to every man the credit 
               <br />
               of possessing a fair and equal proportion of this 
               <br />
               gift. Mr. Chairman, I feel compelled to appeal to 
               <br />
               every member of this Convention to put both 
               <br />
               conscience and reason to the test. This is not a 
               <br />
               matter that we should take lightly. It is very, very 
               <br />
               serious. And it would be nothing short of an act 
               <br />
               of betrayal of your people’s trust, to ask them to 
               <br />
               vote for a form of government which has not been 
               <br />

               <br />
               these terms, we were all anxious to give New- 
               <br />
               foundland the best form of government possible,

               <br />
               We are undeveloped solely because our progress 
               <br />
               has been incessantly retarded ever since 1497 by 
               <br />
               the ancient and worn-out colonial policy of the 
               <br />
               mother country, and by the constant fear and 
               <br />
               dread in the minds of our past governments of 
               <br />
               creating too great a national debt. Spend $13

               economic structures will be above what Canada’ 5 
               <br />
               are today; and we would still have a much lower 
               <br />
               per capita debt. This debt must be breached, in 
               <br />
               addition to receiving sufficient back from the

               <br />
               and I decide we’re going into partnership. We’re 
               <br />
               going to buy a schooner together. We put $1,000 
               <br />
               each in the deal. Now let us say that Mr. Ballam 
               <br />
               owes Mr. Hickman on my left $200, and I owe 
               <br />
               him $1,400, just the same proportion as we have 
               <br />
               between Canada’s and Newfoundland’s debt 
               <br />
               today. Would it look fair to Mr. Ballam or the 
               <br />
               public for the partnership to pay the two bills? 
               <br />
               Someone may say, but this is different, this is a 
               <br />
               country, a piece of land. All right, we will call it 
               <br />
               a piece of land. Now Mr. Ballam’s land is un- 
               <br />
               cleared, undeveloped and he owes only $200. 
               <br />
               Mine is cleared, has a nice farmhouse on it, a 
               <br />
               good road through it, hothouse, machinery to do 
               <br />
               the work, but I owe for it all. Would it be right for 
               <br />
               Mr. Ballam to assume my bills unless lpaid into 
               <br />
               a trust fund sufficient cash to develop my 
               <br />
               partner’s property to the level of my own? That’s 
               <br />
               exactly the picture as I see it, and I'm trying to 
               <br />
               make it plain to the people. That’s about as plain 
               <br />
               as I can go and that is exactly how I View the plans 
               <br />
               before us. I am not really prejudiced. I want what 
               <br />
               is best for our people but no outside partnership 
               <br />
