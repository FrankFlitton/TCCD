               request for VOCM to enlarge its broadcasting 
               <br />
               facilities. It is an excuse for dictatorship. VOCM 
               <br />
               today is the most popular radio station in New- 
               <br />
               foundland. If we could take a poll we would ﬁnd 
               <br />
               90% of our people listen in to VOCM more so 
               <br />
               than VONF, and in the report it says the govem— 
               <br />
               ment is not going to give VOCM a chance to 
               <br />
               expand. I do not think it is right. It is about all we 
               <br />
               have left in our country —- the air. Now they are 
               <br />
               trying to take that away. They are going to set up 
               <br />
               a station in Grand Falls, and possibly one in Bell 
               <br />
               Island. What sort of propaganda are they going 
               <br />
               to give us? This country owes a tribute to VOCM; 
               <br />
               if we did not have VOCM, we would not have 
               <br />
               this National Convention today. I think this Con- 
               <br />
               vention should protest against the dictatorial at- 
               <br />
               titude of the government in trying to take all we 
               <br />
               have left. There should be some public policy to 
               <br />
               make the government give VOCM a chance to 
               <br />

               <br />
               where we rarely hear VOCM and it is only since 
               <br />
               I have been in St. John’s I have been privileged 
               <br />
               to listen in to it, and I am thoroughly in accord 
               <br />
               with Mr. Jackrnan. I cannot swallow the excuse 
               <br />
               given by the Broadcasting Corporation for not 
               <br />
               allowing VOCM to increase power from 250 to 
               <br />
               1000 watts in view of the fact that the Broadcast- 
               <br />
               ing Corporation are planning to increase the 
               <br />
               power of their station here in St. John’s and erect

               <br />
               another in Corner Brook (1000 watts). I believe 
               <br />
               there is something more in this refusal than ﬁrst 
               <br />
               strikes the eye. I would ask Mr. Smallwood if the 
               <br />
               Committee enquired as to what manner this in— 
               <br />
               creasing of VOCM from 250 to 1000 watts would 
               <br />
               contaminate or obliterate the air waves over this 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood The report says the Committee

               felt considerable sympathy for VOCM and for 
               <br />
               Mr. Butler. Whether strict observance of that

               has come to get the broadcasting station back 
               <br />

               he explained the whole thing to me and I followed

               closely. The Broadcasting Corporation is all 
               <br />
               right.... The only thing we have to do is get

               Mr. Ashbourne I would like to pay tribute to

               preciated in the city of St. John’s and especially 
               <br />
               in those outports where no daily newspapers are 
               <br />
               immediately available. I mention the Gerald

               S. Doyle news bulletin1 and the bulletin supplied 
               <br />
               by Messrs Harvey and Co.2 VOCM is not very 
               <br />
               much heard in Twillingate, probably on account 
               <br />
               of lower power. I see no reason why they should

               <br />
               ment to the people who live in the outports. In

               St. John’s we can buy a newspaper twice a day 
               <br />
               and see when various steamers are accepting

               <br />
               early in the morning and go out it is a great 
               <br />
               satisfaction to have some idea as to what the 
               <br />
               weather is likely to be on the following day. I 
               <br />
               would like to bring to the attention of the govem- 
               <br />
               ment, the matter of considering that radio bat- 
               <br />
               teries be admitted into Newfoundland duty free. 
               <br />
               All you have to do in St. John’s is plug in the 
               <br />
               socket by which the electric light is given. Very 
               <br />
               few people in the outports enjoy that privilege.
