               were going to get before they went ﬁshing at all. 
               <br />
               And they were very thankful to the Commission 
               <br />
               of Government for that, a wonderful government

               <br />

               <br />
               would like someone who knows to tell us how 
               <br />
               true that is. Was it the Commission of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern»</span> 
               <br />
               ment? This needs to be known. Mr. Job may take 
               <br />
               it very lightly, but it is far from being ajoke.... 
               <br />
               Mr. Job I think it largely happened by the help 
               <br />
               of our friend Mr. Brown He was greatly inter- 
               <br />
               ested in it at that time, and he was able to get the 
               <br />
               trade together, and it was easy enough in those 
               <br />
               days when the demand exceeded the supply; but 
               <br />
               when you are doubtful whether the supply will 
               <br />
               exceed the demand you can’t fix it. I don’t think 
               <br />
               you could. You ask whether the Commission of 
               <br />
               Government should get the credit for it — not any 
               <br />
               more than the trade and Mr. Brown and the 
               <br />
