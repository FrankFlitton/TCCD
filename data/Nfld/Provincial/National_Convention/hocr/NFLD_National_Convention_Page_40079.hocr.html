               <br />
               what the Convention has to say, I am sure the

               good judgment and the strong commonsense of 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders will guide them to make a wise

               Mr. Harrington Mr. Chairman, I have not as 
               <br />
               yet spoken to this motion on the Chadwick and 
               <br />
               Jones report. When this report was brought in 
               <br />
               ﬁrst the Convention was more or less feeling 
               <br />
               around, trying to get its feet, and I imagine that 
               <br />
               this discussion was initiated to get things started 
               <br />
               here. We had the Chadwick and Jones report, and 
               <br />
               since then we have had the reconstruction plans 
               <br />
               of the Commission of Government, the ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               report, etc., and now we have enough extraneous 
               <br />
               matter. We have the Fisheries Report now, the 
               <br />
               ﬁrstreal work that has been done by this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion. The Education Committee, I understand, 
               <br />
               will have its report completed very soon, and 
               <br />
               other committees are ready to come forward too, 
               <br />
               so I would suggest that, if it meets with the 
               <br />
               approval of the Convention, we give the Chad— 
               <br />
               wick and Jones report the six months hoist, and 
               <br />
               get down to our own work as soon as possible. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman If the Convention wishes we 
               <br />
               could have a motion to have this report accepted. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin I think it was in fact “to receive”. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Then is the house ready for the 
               <br />

               thing prepared to say in regards to this report, but 
               <br />
               what I say now is just the way I feel about it. I 
               <br />
               would say, sir, there is nothing in it we don’t 
               <br />
               already know, and therefore I would say here 
               <br />
               that, as an individual, I am very much disap- 
               <br />
               pointed in the report. I remember when the Com- 
               <br />
               mission of Government was instituted in this 
               <br />
               country it promised two things — political <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">educa»</span> 
               <br />
               tion and economic development. There is no 
               <br />
               question about it this Convention is a political 
               <br />
               education, not only for us assembled here but for 
               <br />
               the country as a whole. In regards to the economic 
               <br />
               development of this country the Commission of 
               <br />
               Government has failed utterly. There has not 
               <br />
               been one major industry established in our 
               <br />
               country. There has not been one which was 
               <br />
               plugged. As regards the report I am against it 
               <br />
               because I see nothing in it that is of importance 
               <br />
               to us as a people — that is the economic develop- 
               <br />
               ment of our country. I would not vote in favour 
               <br />
