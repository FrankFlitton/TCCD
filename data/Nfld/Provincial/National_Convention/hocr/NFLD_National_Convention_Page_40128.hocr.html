               Mr. Cashin Returning to the original motion, of 
               <br />
               whether or not we send a delegation to Ottawa to 
               <br />
               get the terms of confederation, I am going to 
               <br />
               support Mr. Penney’s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amendment,</span> We started off 
               <br />
               getting various particulars regarding the ad- 
               <br />
               ministration of government during the past 
               <br />
               several years. We arrived at a point where we 
               <br />
               were making fair progress, and the main reports 
               <br />
               have got to come in here yet.... In view of this I 
               <br />
               consider that the present resolution now before 
               <br />
               the house, regarding sending a delegation to Ot- 
               <br />
               tawa, comes at a most inopportune moment... Let 
               <br />
               us get our facts ready. Supposing the Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Canada telegraphed tonight that he would 
               <br />
               receive a delegation of the Convention (and I 
               <br />
               doubt it very much), what are you going to take 
               <br />
               up there with you? You have no facts and figures 
               <br />
               to take. Surely if this thing is going to be one of 
               <br />
               the forms of government that are going to be put 
               <br />
               to the people, then the least they might do is wait 
               <br />
               until these reports are completed. That’s not un— 
               <br />
               reasonable to ask, its only logical.... I don’t intend 
               <br />
               to hold up this but I want to register my support 
               <br />
               in favour of the amendment by Mr. Penney that 
               <br />
               this resolution be deferred until such time as all 
               <br />
               reports are submitted to the House and the Con-

               <br />
               might be prepared to give any delegation. I have 
               <br />

               tion, or even a senatorship. However, I realise the 
               <br />
               matter of confederation can hardly be discussed 
               <br />
               intelligently unless we have these terms. I fur— 
               <br />
               thermore understand that it is the policy of the 
               <br />
               present Government of Canada to give these 
               <br />
               terms on request, but not unless they are re- 
               <br />
               quested... I am going to vote on the motion; I am 
               <br />
               going to vote that the facts be given to this House 
               <br />
               — the terms; because it is up to us to get the terms. 
               <br />
               I have spent some time in Canada. I happen to be 
               <br />
               a graduate of the University of Toronto, one of 
               <br />
               the biggest in the British Empire. While I have an 
               <br />
               open mind about the matter of confederation, yet 
               <br />
               I consider thatI would like to know something of 
               <br />
               the terms which Canada is prepared to give to 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. I realise there have been great 
               <br />
               peoples who have come together in union, and 
               <br />
               our very flag is emblematic of that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">union,</span> The 
               <br />
               question as to whether or not Newfoundland 
               <br />
               might perhaps join up with the United Kingdom 
               <br />
               has also been mentioned in my hearing. I, to a 
               <br />
               certain extent, agree with the arguments which 
               <br />
               have been advanced by those who have spoken 
               <br />
               in favour of the amendment and I can appreciate 
               <br />
               their point of view. However, in the desire to get 
               <br />
               on with the business and to get through with it as 
               <br />
               quickly as possible. I feel that delays are 
               <br />
               dangerous. However, I feel that when the facts of 
               <br />
               our economic position are known they may 
               <br />
               reveal the ability to paddle our own canoe. How- 
               <br />
               ever, I am conscious of the fact that there is a 
               <br />
               desire on the part of a lot of people to study the 
               <br />
               matter of confederation. Unless there are further 
               <br />
               arguments advanced by other members, I intend 
               <br />
               at the present time to support it and I further 
               <br />
               believe we cannot decide about the matter of 
               <br />
               confederation until we have these terms. I hope 
               <br />
               no one thinks I am a confederate, but I am 
               <br />
               prepared to study the terms, if they are given to 
               <br />
               us. However, unless we are blessed with the right 
               <br />
               kind of statesmen who are dedicated to their task 
               <br />
               of conducting the government of our country in 
               <br />
               the interests of Newfoundland, I fear very much 
               <br />
               that the time may come when we may have to go 
               <br />
               to some other country, to Canada or perhaps to 
               <br />
               the old country and, maybe, with our ﬁnger in our
