               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">factory.</span> These Black Books do give a good

               <br />
               properly these services and their application to 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Some time ago, sir, I quoted some ﬁgures in 
               <br />
               respect to probable federal revenues which 
               <br />
               would be collected from the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland as a province. I had taken consid- 
               <br />
               erable time and trouble with this. I arrived at a 
               <br />
               ﬁgure, with the exception of the corporate and 
               <br />
               income tax, of over $10 million in excess of the 
               <br />
               Canadian estimate. Now this total was got by 
               <br />
               actually applying the Canadian taxes to our im— 
               <br />
               ports for the year 1946-47, and also by making a 
               <br />
               reasonable estimate of taxes on local production. 
               <br />
               This ﬁgure of $10 million is in my opinion con— 
               <br />
               servative. Mr. Smallwood, in his summing up of 
               <br />
               the debate in conunittee, showed agreement with 
               <br />
               one source of Canadian taxes, that is in the 
               <br />
               general sales tax, and when doing so he very 
               <br />
               conveniently used the Customs Blue Book for the 
               <br />
               year 1945-46 which showed imports of $9 mil— 
               <br />
               lion less than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1946-47,</span> He also estimated taxable 
               <br />
               local production at only $5 million, which is 
               <br />
               absolutely absurd when it is realised that three 
               <br />
               items only of local manufacture amount to over 
               <br />
               $4 million in 1946—47. Now, sir, there has been

               <br />
               heavily upon the wage earner, but until a better 
               <br />
               method is devised, this system will remain. It is,

               if I may say, inexpensive in operation consider-

               compared with methods used elsewhere. Of 
               <br />
               course, Mr. Chairman, the evils and iniquities of 
               <br />
               this kind of tax has been used by Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               in his argument for confederation; so much so, 
               <br />
               that he apparently forgot all about the Canadian 
               <br />
               taxes. He used the old argument time and again, 
               <br />
               that of computing wholesalers’ and retailers' 
               <br />
               proﬁts on cost of goods plus duty. Is it possible 
               <br />
               that Mr. Smallwood is so innocent that he thinks 
               <br />
               that under confederation the wage earner of New- 
               <br />
               foundland will have any relief from this? Let us 
               <br />
               consider for a moment the Canadian system of 
               <br />
               collecting <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taxes,</span> The Canadian federal govem- 
               <br />
               ment imposes a series of taxes much worse in

               their application to the wage earner than we have 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland; they impose excise duties, ex- 
               <br />
               cise taxes, import taxes and the general sales tax, 
               <br />
               a multitude of taxes for which there seems to be 
               <br />
               no rhyme or reason. All of these taxes are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in-</span> 
               <br />
               direct, the import taxes are imposed on goods at 
               <br />
               the point of entry, excise duties, excise taxes and 
               <br />
               the general sales tax are imposed at the point of 
               <br />
               manufacture, and in their application to 
               <br />
               Newfoundland these taxes will be, in their effect 
               <br />
               on the wage earner, the same as our import taxes. 
               <br />
               The importer, the wholesaler and the retailer will 
               <br />
               make proﬁts on all of these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taxes,</span> In this respect 
               <br />
               the position under federal union will remain un-

               <br />
               worse. On many items of taxable goods in 
               <br />
               Canada there are two, three and sometimes four 
               <br />
               separate federal taxes before the goods reach the 
               <br />
               consumer.

               Mr. Chairman, it is the double and sometimes

               treble taxation which bears so heavily upon the

               <br />
               these taxes, sir, will be applied, with very few

               exceptions, to everything we use if this country 
               <br />
               enters federal union with Canada. I have com- 
               <br />
               puted the Canadian import taxes on a per capita

               <br />
               period ending in 1946. I have done the same in
