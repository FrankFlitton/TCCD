               Major Cashin professed to scoff at them, but 
               <br />
               I tell you frankly that when it comes to choosing 
               <br />
               between the estimates of Major Cashin and the 
               <br />
               very able ﬁnancial ofﬁcials of the Government 
               <br />
               of Canada I do not hesitate a moment. However, 
               <br />
               when Major Cashin ﬁrst tried to throw doubt on 
               <br />
               the Canadian govemment’s own estimates I ad- 
               <br />
               dressed a question to the Canadian government 
               <br />
               asking them to give us an idea of how they made 
               <br />
               their estimates, and what they based them upon. 
               <br />
               They came back with a detailed reply which 
               <br />
               satisﬁed every reasonable minded man in this 
               <br />
               Convention, everybody whose mind is not 
               <br />
               blinded against confederation and all its works.

               Now the next point is what the provincial 
               <br />
               government, our own government should we be— 
               <br />
               come a province, would collect from us. You will 
               <br />
               remember that I brought in my estimate of what 
               <br />
               that would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~—</span> $15 million a year from the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               four years, and over $15.5 million a year for the 
               <br />
               second four years, and also you will remember 
               <br />
               that my estimate was for eight years, because 
               <br />
               within eight years there is to be a royal commis- 
               <br />
               sion to go into our ﬁnancial position to see what 
               <br />
               additional subsidies, if any, we would need from 
               <br />
               the federal government. Mr. Hickman said my 
               <br />
               estimate is too low, it should be $17 million a 
               <br />
               year. Mr. Hollett said it should be $19 million a 
               <br />
               year. Almost like an auction, sir, and Major 
               <br />
               Cashin goes them one better, and drives it up to 
               <br />
               $19.2 million a year. “In my view”, says Major 
               <br />
               Cashin, “this is the least possible." That is the 
               <br />
               lowest that the provincial government can get 
               <br />
               along on. I wonder, sir, if Major Cashin realised 
               <br />
               —- I’m sorry he is not here just now, I would like 
               <br />
               him to hear this —— what that did to his own 
               <br />
               proposed budget? You will remember under this 
               <br />
               budget, $25 million a year is what it would take, 
               <br />
               he estimated, for Newfoundland to carry on 
               <br />
               under Commission or responsible government- 
               <br />
               $25 million a year to pay all the ordinary costs of 
               <br />
               government, including interest on our public 
               <br />
               debt, sinking fund, operating losses on the Rail- 
               <br />

               million, but Major Cashin’s budget of $25 mil— 
               <br />
               lion included the losses on Gander, and the cost 
               <br />
               of the Fisheries Department, and a large number 
               <br />
               of other services and expenditures which would 
               <br />
               not appear at all in the provincial government 
               <br />
               budget under confederation. Remember, his $25 
               <br />
               million a year is supposed to cover all ordinary 
               <br />
               expenditures, including these items I have just 
               <br />
               mentioned. If his guess of $19.2 million a year 
               <br />
               for all ordinary expenses of the provincial 
               <br />
               government is correct,if that is what it would cost 
               <br />
               to operate Newfoundland’s government under 
               <br />
               confederation, then without confederation the 
               <br />
               cost would be $11 million higher than the ﬁgure 
               <br />
               of $25 million he gives us in his budget. As the 
               <br />
               old saying goes, he is on the horns of a dilemma; 
               <br />
               either he has to agree with my estimate of $15 
               <br />
               million or $15.5 million for the province, or else 
               <br />
               he has to stick another $11 million on his own 
               <br />
               estimate, and raise it from $25 million to $36 
               <br />
               million a year. He can take his choice.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I hope I have made myself clear on that, it is 
               <br />
               simple enough, really. The danger of trying to 
               <br />
               make a thing simple is trying too hard to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mzﬂte</span> it 
               <br />
               simple, but here are two budgets, one that I bring 
               <br />
               in and one Major Cashin brings in. The one that 
               <br />
               I bring in shows what the provincial government 
               <br />
               would have to spend each year, and Major Cashin 
               <br />
               shows what the Government of Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               if we do not have confederation, would have to 
               <br />
               spend each year. My estimate is $15.5 million a 
               <br />
               year, and his is $25 million a year. Now, if, if he 
               <br />
               will not allow me to take off from his $25 million 
               <br />
               those expenses which we would not have to pay 
               <br />
               under confederation, if he won’t allow me to take 
               <br />
               that off his $25 million and bring it down to $14 
               <br />
               million, then he has got to add $11 million on to 
               <br />
               his $25 million. He can take his choice, but 
               <br />
               whichever Major Cashin may choose, the result 
               <br />
               is clear and simple: under confederation the 
               <br />
               federal government of Canada will handle and 
               <br />
               pay for quite a number of costly public services 
               <br />
