               may think I am talking wildly, but I would ask 
               <br />
               them to remember that long before this I made 
               <br />
               statements in this house which were regarded at 
               <br />
               the time as wild prophecies, but time proved that 
               <br />
               I was right. All I ask you then to do in the present 
               <br />

               ing two months, then pass your judgement on the

               statements I make today. Watch in particular the 
               <br />
               attractive bait which will be held out to lure our 
               <br />
               country into the Canadian mouse-trap. Listen to 
               <br />
               the flowery sales talk which will be offered you, 
               <br />
               telling Newfoundlanders they are a lost people, 
               <br />
               that our only hope, our only salvation, lies in 
               <br />
               following a new Moses into the promised land 
               <br />
               across the Cabot Strait. By the way, I note by 
               <br />
               recent papers, that there are 30,000 men un— 
               <br />
               employed in the Maritimes alone. Can it be that 
               <br />
               things are so wonderful in this Paradise that men 
               <br />
               don’t need to work? Gentlemen, before leaving 
               <br />

               <br />
               amongst us who would take ourselves and our

               But let me again return to my comments on 
               <br />
               the delegation to England. Now, as I mentioned 
               <br />
               in the beginning, there are some people who had 
               <br />
               the impression that we went to England looking 
               <br />
               for favours and handouts from a starving and 
               <br />
               depressed people. Such is emphatically not the 
               <br />
               case. We went to investigate and discuss <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New»</span> 
               <br />
               foundland affairs. We wanted to know what they 
               <br />
               were doing with our money. We wanted to know 
               <br />
               why they had given away parts of our sovereign 
               <br />
               territory, and we wanted to know above all else 
               <br />
               what they intended to do about our rights as a 
               <br />
               politically free people. For ten years we have 
               <br />
               been trying to get this information out of the local 
               <br />
               Commission, but in vain. And after our trip we 
               <br />
               are little wiser than we were before. But as for 
               <br />
               wanting to get any handouts from Britain -—- why 
               <br />
               nothing could be further from the truth. We did 
               <br />
               not ask for anything from Britain ~— not a dollar 
               <br />
               of her wealth, an ounce of her food, an inch of 
               <br />
               her territory. And I think the other members of 
               <br />
               the delegation will agree with me when I say that 
               <br />
               in the person of Viscount Addison we had to deal 
               <br />
               with a man who was quite competent in protect- 
               <br />
               ing his country’s assets. Talk of giving — why 
               <br />
               he would not even give us an answer to many of 
               <br />
               our questions. And in the two weeks we were in 
               <br />
               England we were only granted three meetings. To 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               my mind, Viscount Addison gave an example of 
               <br />
               political economy of the highest order. He was 
               <br />
               the soul of economy and political tact. Of course 
               <br />
               it would not be fair to place all the blame on the 
               <br />
               shoulders of the noble lord, because it was quite 
               <br />
               obvious that he was acting under strict orders, and 
               <br />
               these orders seemed to be, as regards the delega- 
               <br />
               tion, “Tell them nothing and give them nothing". 
               <br />
               We asked him plenty of questions. We showered 
               <br />
               him with them, but he shed them like a duck. He 
               <br />
               had his orders not to go beyond a certain point, 
               <br />
               and beyond that point he refused to budge. Some— 
               <br />
               times we thought we had him tied up, but he 
               <br />
               wiggled out with the ease of a Houdini. However, 
               <br />
               there were one or two occasions when he found 
               <br />
               himself out on a limb. I remember in particular 
               <br />
               when he was trying to justify the base deals. He 
               <br />
               put up his defence, that the British government 
               <br />
               were forced to give the United States these bases 
               <br />
               because they were in a hole and Great Britain 
               <br />
               desperately needed destroyers. He elaborated on 
               <br />
               this point and made much of it, saying that “lives 
               <br />
               had to be saved." 
               <br />

               I could go on at great length, Mr. Chairman, 
               <br />
               commenting on the many phases of this visit of 
               <br />
               ours, but I believe it is best summed up in the 
               <br />
               London newspaper which refers to it as follows: 
               <br />
               “How cold, graceless, ungenerous and chuck— 
               <br />
               Ieheaded is the attitude of the Government 
               <br />
               towards Newfoundlanders.” It goes on to say: “It 
               <br />
               could not, it dare not go back on Britain’s pledge 
               <br />
               of 1934, that as soon as the Island's difﬁculties 
               <br />
               had been overcome, Responsible Government on 
               <br />
               the request of the people of Newfoundland would 
               <br />
               be restored. Yet today it talks of special difﬁcul- 
               <br />
               ties of our ﬁnancial position and tells the New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders harshly that, if they vote away the 
               <br />
               present Commission, Britain will no longer 
               <br />
               guarantee the interest on Newfoundland’s loan of 
               <br />
               $71 million. Is this the way to talk to our kith and 
               <br />
               kin? When Newfoundland made Britain an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inter»</span>
