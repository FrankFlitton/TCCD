               your telegram of the llth February has been

               carefully considered by Her Majesty’s

               The general principle of responsible govem- 
               <br />
               ment is plain and simple. If a British colony is 
               <br />
               self—supporting, then it’s entitled to responsible 
               <br />
               government if it wants it. But the very fact that a 
               <br />
               British colony has responsible government is 
               <br />
               taken as meaning that it is not entitled to ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               help from the British government. If the colony 
               <br />
               gets ﬁnancial help from the British government 
               <br />
               it has to give up responsible government, because 
               <br />
               no colony is supposed to have responsible 
               <br />
               government unless and until it is fully self-sup- 
               <br />
               porting: and if it is fully self-supporting then it 
               <br />
               does not need ﬁnancial help from the British 
               <br />
               government. Financial help and responsible 
               <br />
               government are like oil and water — they just 
               <br />
               don’t mix, and so it is not surprising that the 
               <br />
               British government tells us that you can have 
               <br />
               responsible government if the people vote for it,

               And now there is one ﬁnal piece of informa~ 
               <br />
               tion that the British government gave our London 
               <br />
               delegation: if the Newfoundland people decide to 
               <br />
               stay under Commission government, then the 
               <br />
               British government will go on being responsible 
               <br />
               for our Country’s ﬁnances. They’ll be responsible 
               <br />
               for us if we stay under Commission government. 
               <br />
               That, Mr. Chairman, is a gallant offer by the 
               <br />
               mother country — a very gallant offer indeed. It 
               <br />
               is an offer that stirs our emotion. The very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gal«</span> 
               <br />
               lantry of it brings the tears to our eyes. The old 
               <br />
               mother country is on the broad of her back. Men 
               <br />
               around the world are wondering privately if 
               <br />
               Britain is headed for a financial smash. She has 
               <br />
               just come through the worst calamity in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">history.</span> 
               <br />
               She has been blitzed and smashed almost to 
               <br />
               pieces — millions of her homes and buildings 
               <br />
               levelled to the ground by bombs. Her industries 
               <br />
               have been drained of their vitality, her factories 
               <br />
               and mills have fallen into decay, her shipping has 
               <br />
               been sent to the bottom in millions of tons. She 
               <br />
               opened her very veins and poured out her blood 
               <br />

               public debt of $100,000 million — over $10,000 
               <br />
               for every family. The British people have the 
               <br />
               highest public debt in the whole world. Britain is

               in debt to her very eyes ~— you could almost say 
               <br />
               she’s mortgaged up to the hilt, to the very limit,

               The whole world is aware of Britain’s plight. 
               <br />
               She’s being kept alive today by blood plasma in 
               <br />
               the form of American and Canadian dollars 
               <br />
               loaned to her. And we are given to understand 
               <br />
               that shortly she is coming to Canada to ask for 
               <br />
               another loan of $500 million on top of the $2,000 
               <br />
               million that the Canadian government loaned her 
               <br />
               last year. Australia the other day gave Britain a 
               <br />
               gift of $80 million. New Zealand on the same day 
               <br />
               gave her a gift of $40 million. Those were not 
               <br />
               cash gifts, those two British countries simply 
               <br />
               reduced by those amounts the debts that Britain 
               <br />
               owed them. It was a gesture of goodwill to the old 
               <br />
               mother country in her calamity, something like 
               <br />
               the bowl of hot broth that a neighbour in New-
