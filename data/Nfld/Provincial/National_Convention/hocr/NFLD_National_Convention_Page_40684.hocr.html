               Americans over at Stephenville or Harmon Field 
               <br />

               <br />
               that this year. It’s true there’s no organisation 
               <br />
               here (as I pointed to over in England), that our 
               <br />
               hands were tied in that deal, the 99-year lease, 
               <br />
               wherein we were not permitted to organise in 
               <br />

               <br />
               land. However, the pointI want to get at is that 
               <br />
               while we try to ridicule the Commission of 
               <br />
               Government, 1 don’t think the time is right. I’ve 
               <br />
               had to deal with a lot of people who were not 
               <br />
               connected with the Commission of Government. 
               <br />
               And I also have an order, a letter written by the 
               <br />
               late Sir Wilfred Woods who did say that he was 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prepared,</span> his department was prepared, to pay the 
               <br />
               prevailing rate in any particular area in which 
               <br />
               they operated. Mr. Chairman, I put it straight that 
               <br />
               there are places in Newfoundland today paying 
               <br />
               from 28 to 35 cents per hour while the govem— 
               <br />
               ment is paying 40. Who is to be blamed? That I 
               <br />
               think is fair. Let’s give every man his just due. 
               <br />
               There are people in this country today who are 
               <br />
               not connected with Commission of Government 
               <br />
               but they are paying from 28 to 35 cents while the 
               <br />
               government is paying 40. That doesn’t sound like 
               <br />
               the Commission of Government’s fault. It’s 
               <br />
               about time that some of those people awoke. I’ve 
               <br />
               heard a lot of crying about the poor people, the 
               <br />
               poor ﬁsherman, the poor labourer, yet if you want 
               <br />
               to do anything for them, give them a fair day’s 
               <br />
               pay, which you can surely pay out of the price of 
               <br />
               ﬁsh and all the rest of it, this last four or ﬁve years. 
               <br />
               I’m not going to keep us any longer because I 
               <br />
               feel, as I’ve said before, the time has not come to 
               <br />
               criticise this form of governmentor the other. But 
               <br />
               I would remind those of you who are likely to take 
               <br />
               the tar brush, remember home ﬁrst. Set the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex»</span>

               ample at your own door and then the Commission 
               <br />
               of Government may come up a little bit higher.

               Mr. Miller This matter has come home so much 
               <br />
               that I feel I too have to offer an opinion. When 
               <br />
               the base contractors came to Argentia there was 
               <br />
               something more than a question of pay. A base 
               <br />
               was to be built. They wanted labourers, car- 
               <br />
               penters, electricians, every classification of 
               <br />
               labour. We have had sizeable jobs in New- 
               <br />
               foundland before: the Humber deal, Corner

               effect? And who was responsible for it? Now that 
               <br />
               is the big question. And it would well be to lay 
               <br />
               the blame in the right <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">place.</span> Is Commission of 
               <br />
               Government really to blame for that situation or 
               <br />
               was the American authority in Newfoundland? If 
               <br />
               Commission of Government is to blame, blame 
               <br />
               them and thereby we get the correction. But if the 
               <br />
               American authorities in Newfoundland are to 
               <br />
               blame, let’s not go on blindfolding ourselves by 
               <br />
               blaming Commission of Government and getting 
               <br />
               farther away from the issue. That seems to me to 
               <br />
               be just what is happening. I spoke of the housing 
               <br />
               conditions. When the ﬁrst cookhouses were 
               <br />
               opened up at Argentia, I had personal knowledge 
               <br />
               of what took place. The purpose of that contractor 
               <br />
               at that date was to bring contractors, who were 
               <br />
               used to catering the lumber woods camps, into 
               <br />
               Argentia to cater and serve the meals to all our 
               <br />
               different classiﬁcations of labour. Now, there 
               <br />
               were among the workmen there men who wanted 
               <br />
               meals for 50 cents a day, and men who were 
               <br />
               content, according to their classiﬁcation of work, 
               <br />
               to pay more. But you are all a bunch of New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders, and here you are gentlemen, take 
               <br />
               it or leave it. That's the situation right from the 
               <br />
               actual scene of operations. I say it because I saw 
               <br />
               it. I believe that we can lay more blame on the 
               <br />
               American authorities for all that has gone on than 
               <br />
               on Commission of Government. And I don’t 
               <br />
               believe in blufﬁng about it either. Now about this 
               <br />
               letter. I too have heard about that letter, it really 
               <br />
               did exist. The American authorities were well 
               <br />
               established and had many a pay-day over in Ar- 
               <br />
               gentia on low scale wages and, by the way, I’m 
               <br />
               informed that the hiring rate of labourers over 
               <br />
               there is still only 39.5 cents per hour. But they 
               <br />
               had probably a year or two in over there before 
               <br />
               Commission of Government forwarded <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> 
               <br />
               thing. That is my opinion on the matter. But I 
               <br />
               believe that if we’re to ﬁnd a remedy, we must 
               <br />
               first ﬁnd who’s to blame.
