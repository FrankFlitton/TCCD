               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, I listened with 
               <br />
               very great interest indeed to what Major Cashin 
               <br />
               had to say, and nothing would give me more 
               <br />
               pleasure than to be in a position at this moment 
               <br />
               to take up in discussion some of the matters he 
               <br />
               discussed. I am positively itching to discuss the 
               <br />
               matters touched on by Major Cashin. Perhaps the 
               <br />
               opportunity will come my way to do that before 
               <br />
               the Convention ends. Unfortunately, however, I 
               <br />
               have a duty this afternoon that I must perform, 
               <br />
               namely to deal brieﬂy with this supplementary 
               <br />
               report on the operation of Gander <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">airport“,</span> Now, 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, when the original report on 
               <br />
               Gander was brought in, I said as plainly as I could 
               <br />
               — well, perhaps I did not exactly say, but I 
               <br />
               certainly hinted very broadly — that in my 
               <br />
               opinion the people and Government of New- 
               <br />
               foundland would not have to pay a dollar of the 
               <br />
               losses that would be run up in operating Gander. 
               <br />
               I was the only one, I believe, who did say that, 
               <br />
               because I had information, gathered at Gander 
               <br />
               and here, that led me strongly to believe it.... Now 
               <br />
               today we have a little more knowledge about it, 
               <br />
               given to the Committee by Mr. Neill, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Com</span> 
               <br />
               missioner for Public Utilities, who is the final 
               <br />
               boss, in Newfoundland at any rate, over Gander. 
               <br />
               I am convinced that this interview that we had 
               <br />
               with Mr. Neill is very strong evidence that my 
               <br />
               original contention was correct. Major Cashin 
               <br />
               put this question to Mr. Neill. Major Cashin said, 
               <br />
               “The government agreed to operate, knowing 
               <br />
               there was going to be a loss, primarily for the 
               <br />
               purpose of helping these air companies?” Mr. 
               <br />
               Neill said, “I go with you except to say that we 
               <br />
               never contemplated there would be a loss on the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland exchequer”. Then Major Cashin 
               <br />
               said to him, “You must have some reason for 
               <br />
               that?”, and Mr. Neill replied, “Yes”. Then Major 
               <br />
               Cashin said, with a question mark in his voice, 
               <br />
               “Great Britain half-indicated they would pay the 
               <br />
               deﬁcit?”, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Neill said, “Well, in brief 
               <br />
               words, we have put up the case to them and they 
               <br />
               have not yet finalised it” (page 3 of the report). 
               <br />
               Major Cashin said again, “Why should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New«</span>

               <br />
               we will rectify that." I said to him, “When you 
               <br />

               <br />
               any knowledge or belief that Newfoundland 
               <br />
               would not have to pay that operating deficit on 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gander7”,</span> and he replied, “We always put up the 
               <br />
               position that we would require assistance for the 
               <br />
               operation of Gander.“ I said, “To whom?", and 
               <br />
               he said, “To the British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government,“</span> Major 
               <br />
               Cashin said, “They did not say ‘yes’ or ‘no‘ they 
               <br />
               would pay this deficit?", and he said “Not yet." I 
               <br />
               said to him, “Is this the position: you took over 
               <br />
               the operation of Gander, believing there would 
               <br />
               be a deﬁcit in its operation, and hoping only that 
               <br />
               the British government might help <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfound»</span> 
               <br />
               land in paying the deﬁcit?" He said, “I would not 
               <br />
               go so far as to say that. We have placed the 
               <br />
               position before the British government, stating 
               <br />
               that we expect assistance in the operation of 
               <br />
               Gander." I asked him, “When did you put that 
               <br />
               before them?", and he said, “Several times.” I 
               <br />
               said, “When was the earliest time? Did you put it 
               <br />
               to them before you decided to take over the 
               <br />
               airport?”, and he replied, “I think it was always 
               <br />
               known.” It was an understood thing between the 
               <br />
               Commission of Government and the British 
               <br />
               government that if Newfoundland were to take 
               <br />
               over the operation of Gander, and if there was to 
               <br />

               someone would have to pay it, but not New-

               foundland.

               <br />

               <br />
