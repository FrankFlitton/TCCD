               Mr. Butt Going into one settlement you take 20

               the government, but by private individuals who 
               <br />
               said, “If we would take ten families and you give

               <br />
               reason was given by the Committee. it says: “To

               <br />

               Mr. Job Just one question, it is at the end of the

               report: “The gross annual value at present of 
               <br />
               agriculture to the country is roughly estimated at 
               <br />
               $12 million. It is probable that this value will 
               <br />
               relatively increase as people get back to their 
               <br />
               normal pursuits. The Committee hesitates to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in»</span> 
               <br />
               dicate what the increased revenue may be as any

               figure is not likely to be more than mere 
               <br />
               guesswork."2 That $12 million is made up at 
               <br />
               today’s high figures, and you cannot expect the 
               <br />
               future to keep up to that $12 million, let alone

               Mr. Butt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">That‘s</span> why we put in "relatively". The

               What we are trying to convey is that people who
