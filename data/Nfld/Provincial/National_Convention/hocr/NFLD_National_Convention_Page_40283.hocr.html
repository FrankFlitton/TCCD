               <br />
               asset to the country, and I always think that one 
               <br />
               of the great assets on our Railway is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">person</span>

               a lot of travelling) where they make people as 
               <br />
               much at home as on our railway, and I think it is 
               <br />
               due to the courtesy of the ofﬁcials from top to 
               <br />
               bottom. I have heard that same expression from

               people outside the country who have travelled on 
               <br />
               the railway. They seem to get a more personal 
               <br />
               touch, and itis an asset with a view to our possible

               Mr. Bailey I think it will be found that in all 
               <br />
               parts of the world outside ships in foreign 
               <br />
               shipyards pay no duty.... A man who goes to sea, 
               <br />
               once he is outside the three mile limit does not 
               <br />
               pay any duty, but when he is in port he pays duty. 
               <br />
               That has been something that has grown up 
               <br />
               throughout maritime <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">history...</span> I took the ques- 
               <br />
               tion up with Mr. Russell, and he says it is impos- 
               <br />
               sible for us to compete with the docks in New 
               <br />
               York and other large docks throughout the world, 
               <br />
               so I don’t think we can censure the government 
               <br />
               for doing what is an old custom... We are not in 
               <br />
               a position, and very few countries in the world 
               <br />
               are in the position, to compete with the United 
               <br />
               States. Ships come from all parts of the world to 
               <br />
               be dry—docked in the United States. If we were in 
               <br />
               a position to have more ships come here, there 
               <br />
               would be more surplus for the docks. But we went 
               <br />
               into itextensively with Mr. Russell and apparent— 
               <br />
               ly we are not able to compete with the large docks 
               <br />
               in the world. The only thing we get here is an 
               <br />
               emergency job or a local job.

               Mr. Vardy I feel the most serious aspect of this 
               <br />
               matter is the fact that by us paying duty on our 
               <br />
               local jobs, and foreign ships getting that duty 
               <br />
               free, it prevents our local ships from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">competing.</span> 
               <br />
               The whole answer is that Newfoundlanders 
               <br />
               usually treat outsiders better than their own. 
               <br />

               <br />
               plating we used at the dry dock, and I don’t think 
               <br />
               any Newfoundland ship could go to any dock in 
               <br />

               foreigners coming to Newfoundland get these

               they are forced here because of weather condi—

               good news. If the railway is in such a deplorable

               condition due to the war, I think, as Mr. Miller 
               <br />
               suggested, that we should ask those foreign 
               <br />
               powers which militarily used Newfoundland for 
               <br />
               some compensation to help us out in making our

               Mr. Hillier Since Mr. Reddy has raised the point 
               <br />
               of deplorable conditions on the Home, I would 
               <br />
               like to say that I agree with him. The ship’s

               commodations, but I can‘t see how it can be 
               <br />
               avoided at the present time. I know I have felt bad 
               <br />
               to have to walk down and say, “We can’t take any 
               <br />
               more, we have no room for them.” It is very

               <br />
               maybe you will see a ray of sunshine which at the
