               members at this time to standing order 39 which 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               It is therefore the duty of this Convention to 
               <br />
               record the opinion of each member of the Con- 
               <br />
               vention on two points: (1) As to the form of 
               <br />
               government which, in his opinion should be put 
               <br />
               before the people of Newfoundland, together 
               <br />
               with (2) any preference he may choose to ex- 
               <br />
               press.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I simply mention the rule at this time because 
               <br />
               there is a double-barreled motion before the 
               <br />
               Chair. The motion covers responsible govem— 
               <br />
               ment and Commission government. It may very 
               <br />
               well be that some members may have a 
               <br />
               preference as between the two forms of govern- 
               <br />
               ment, and therefore would perhaps be hesitant in 
               <br />
               expressing their views by virtue of the fact that 
               <br />
               in supporting the motion, they would be support-_ 
               <br />
               ing one form of government with which he or 
               <br />
               they did not find themselves in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agreement.</span> I want 
               <br />
               to make it clear. I propose by a series of polls or 
               <br />
               divisions on this motion to ﬁnd out, ﬁrst, the 
               <br />
               members voting for or against the motion, and 
               <br />
               secondly it will be my duty to carry out the 
               <br />
               order to have their views recorded on both ques- 
               <br />
               tions. Therefore, any member desiring to support 
               <br />
               this motion will not be precluded from expressing 
               <br />
               his preference as to either of the two forms con- 
               <br />
               tained in the motion. Indeed, it is the other way 
               <br />
               about. It is the duty of the Convention, after and 
               <br />
               when a member votes for the motion, to decide 
               <br />
               whether or not he has any preference for either of 
               <br />
               the two forms of government contained in the
