               I am quite aware that there are a number of 
               <br />
               people in favour of union with Canada; so there 
               <br />
               were in 1867 and in 1895, and I am in no way 
               <br />

               <br />
               has been called “the terms”, but I do contend that 
               <br />
               these terms must be obtained by the proper con- 
               <br />
               stitutional means. I am also aware that there are 
               <br />
               more people who would prefer a closer associa-

               <br />
               means to attain that end. We know, too, that a 
               <br />
               great number of our people are not anxious to get 
               <br />
               farther away from the mother country, and par- 
               <br />
               ticularly so when that mother country, having 
               <br />
               sacriﬁced her resources to save the civilisation 
               <br />

               again registering a continuing opposition to the

               <br />
               no such authority. Second, the people who sent 
               <br />
               us here gave us no such authority. Third, as 
               <br />
               “terms” always envisage bargaining, that bar- 
               <br />
               gaining must be done by duly appointed repre-

               We come now to the question of sending a
