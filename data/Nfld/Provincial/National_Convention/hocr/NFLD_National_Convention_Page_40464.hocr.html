               that the department had to procure a doctor for 
               <br />
               this service. When there has been a shortage of

               doctors even for their stations on the land we can 
               <br />

               of procuring a medical man to go on the ship. I

               feel sure there is great need of a medical man to 
               <br />
               serve that part of the coast and that as soon as the

               has a lot of dependence in a doctor they are used 
               <br />
               to; but we always found out that when a patient 
               <br />
               went into hospital they had to go under another 
               <br />
               doctor, and people often wonder if the medical

               doctors could have had a chance to practice in the

               same hospital. I don’t know if the doctor has the 
               <br />
               same chance to practice, but I know it is not 
               <br />
               possible to get under our own doctor’s care in Old 
               <br />
               Perlican. I don‘t know if this condition exists in

               <br />
               when a case puzzles the doctor he just calls in 
               <br />
               another one. The people are wondering why it

               costs a man in New Melbourne $10 for the doctor 
               <br />

               <br />
               me to ﬁnd this out, whether the doctor is barred 
               <br />
               from practicing in the hospital or whether it‘s his 
               <br />
               own free will or otherwise. It seems strange when 
               <br />
               there is a hospital in the vicinity that all doctors 
               <br />
               should not be allowed to practice in them.
