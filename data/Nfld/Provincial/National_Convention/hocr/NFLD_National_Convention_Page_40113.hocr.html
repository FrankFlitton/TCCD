               vention can turn a deaf ear to this resolution. 
               <br />
               Many of our people believe in it. Many others 
               <br />
               who may not yet believe in it now, if they get the 
               <br />
               terms, may yet believe in it. I am not prepared to 
               <br />
               deny them the chance to get the facts. If con- 
               <br />
               federation is to be a possibility in Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               special terms would doubtless be necessary. If 
               <br />
               the Convention should decide that a delegation 
               <br />
               should be sent to Ottawa, I think in all fairness, 
               <br />
               another delegation should be sent to England.
