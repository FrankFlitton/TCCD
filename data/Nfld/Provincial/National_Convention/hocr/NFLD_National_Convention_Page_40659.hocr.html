               What the report does is this. It reviews each year 
               <br />
               separately. It shows what the revenues and ex- 
               <br />
               penditures were for the Railway but, when it 
               <br />
               comes to telling us what the government spent 
               <br />
               altogether, year by year, from 1898 down to date, 
               <br />
               he leaves out the expenditures on the Railway. I 
               <br />
               was going to raise that very point. It’s not a 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood All right. Let’s turn to 109. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I would like to point out that if 
               <br />
               the ﬁgures given on pages 112 and 113 are in-

               <br />
               they’re incorrect. From Major Cashin’s 
               <br />
               standpoint however, and I must sustain him on 
               <br />
               this point, a very fundamental distinction has to 
               <br />
               be drawn between ordinary current expenditure 
               <br />
               and capital expenditure. Capital expenditures, 
               <br />
               you pay out the money, and the assets in which 
               <br />
               the investment is made are there to be seen. They 
               <br />
               may be ships, railroads, hospitals, cottage hospi- 
               <br />
               tals, or public buildings and other public utilities, 
               <br />
               as opposed to ordinary current expenditure which 
               <br />
               simply means the cost of maintaining govem- 
               <br />
               ment over the period in question. it might very 
               <br />
               well be that the views of the members are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recon«</span> 
               <br />
               cilable, if and when the distinction between ordi-

               nary and capital expenditures is borne in mind.
