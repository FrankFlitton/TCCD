               Mr. Crosbie ....Some five or six weeks ago we 
               <br />
               had the Forestry Report submitted and there was 
               <br />
               considerable debate regarding the value of timber 
               <br />
               on Labrador. I am afraid many people here spoke 
               <br />
               of Labrador not knowing of what they spoke. I 
               <br />
               felt it was rather a pity for us to discuss in public 
               <br />
               something we did not know about. That report 
               <br />
               was passed and sent back to the committee for 
               <br />
               consideration. I have taken some trouble to ascer- 
               <br />
               tain what was the position of timber on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Labrador.</span> 
               <br />
               I had an idea that Bowaters, one of the large paper 
               <br />
               companies, had made surveys there in 1937 and 
               <br />
               1938, both ground and aerial. I have been in 
               <br />
               Comer Brook and asked <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Lewin, and he told 
               <br />
               me that he had no objection to getting the surveys 
               <br />
               and giving them to the Committee. To his 
               <br />
               knowledge, where we said 2 million cords of 
               <br />
               wood, there are 20 million cords of wood easily 
               <br />
               accessible. At that time the cost would have been 
               <br />
               extremely heavy and they had the opportunity of 
               <br />
               making this other deal at Gander, which they 
               <br />
               took. He said it was good timber and there is no 
               <br />
               reason why it should not be made into pulpwood 
               <br />
               or paper. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Beating that in mind I was somewhat worried 
               <br />
               about a letter I received from Saint John, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">N,B.,</span> 
               <br />
               Canada. We did hear rumours on the street about 
               <br />
               certain parties negotiating with the Department 
               <br />
               of Natural Resources for timber <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rights.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood may have had the idea that some 
               <br />
               delegates in the Convention were mixed up in the 
               <br />
               movement. I am sorry I forgot to bring that letter 
               <br />
               here, but that party went on to say that “myself 
               <br />
               and my association can procure ten or eleven 
               <br />
               thousand miles of timber on Labrador and can get 
               <br />
               them for you on favourable terms." It is getting 
               <br />
               pretty rough when a Newfoundlander has to be 
               <br />
               offered part of his own country from an outsider. 
               <br />
               Mr. Flinn told us that negotiations had been com- 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
         </div>
         
         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_10" title="bbox 776 363 1312 1886">
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               menced, and since that nothing had been done. I 
               <br />
               am prepared to believe that, but I believe this 
               <br />
               resolution should go through this Convention. I 
               <br />
               also feel, since yesterday, that it is more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">neces~</span> 
               <br />
               sary. We heard of the Gander agreement, and I 
               <br />
               don’t think any man who had the interest of the 
               <br />
               country at heart would make such an agreement. 
               <br />
               The British government are only trustees of this 
               <br />
               country, and that‘s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all.</span> They have been the last 12 
               <br />
               years, and they feel by setting up this National 
               <br />
               Convention they would like to pass back their 
               <br />
               trust to us. That being so I don’t think Commis- 
               <br />
               sion of Government has any right to bargain away 
               <br />
               any more assets of this country in Labrador. We 
               <br />
               don’t know the value of Labrador. I mentioned 
               <br />
               timber, but in the Magazine Digest of last month 
               <br />
               there is an article that interested me. It said 
               <br />
               “Labrador Iron Ore Saves United States Steel 
               <br />
               Mills”. That staggered me and I read the article. 
               <br />
               It finished up by saying that in the not far distant 
               <br />
               future the United States will be taking from 
               <br />
               Labrador $350 million worth of iron ore a year, 
               <br />
               and that’s not chicken feed. I understand that one 
               <br />
               of the companies is negotiating a power agree- 
               <br />
               ment on Labrador. The British government 
               <br />
               should be very cautious about any further agree- 
               <br />
               ments they make until the people have an oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity to say something about the future of this 
               <br />
               country. With that in mind I beg to move this 
               <br />
               resolution. 
               <br />
