               General in Council under this section. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin What is the idea of clause 19 being 
               <br />
               put in here? If the BNA Act covers it, why inject 
               <br />
               it in these terms? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I am afraid section 93 does not 
               <br />
               cover the points in the clause in our terms. There 
               <br />
               are two points that seemed and seem to be highly 
               <br />
               desirable in this country today. One point is this: 
               <br />
               any denomination that has its own schools must 
               <br />
               be guaranteed the right to have their schools as 
               <br />
               long as ever they want them to be so; all the rights 
               <br />
               they have now must be guaranteed to last forever 
               <br />
               — to have separate denominational schools and 
               <br />
               to have them paid for out of the public chest.... 
               <br />
               On the other hand, if any two denominations who 
               <br />
               want to unite their two systems of schools the 
               <br />
               right to do that is also in these terms, so that all 
               <br />
               rights are protected; to stay as they are or to go 
               <br />
               on to something else. That is left entirely to 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. The Government of Canada does 
               <br />
               not want to interfere in the matter. We all ap- 
               <br />
               preciate why that is. It is a delicate matter, a 
               <br />
               matter of conscience, and the government does 
               <br />
               not want to dicker or interfere or meddle where 
               <br />
               our conscience is at stake. They want to protect 
               <br />
               the rights we have without changing them one 
               <br />
               iota. If there is any change, we Newfoundlanders 
               <br />
               or our school authorities or heads must change 
               <br />
               them. I do not think there is much likelihood of 
               <br />
