               We hear a lot in this debate about going up to 
               <br />
               Ottawa and negotiating better terms. The man 
               <br />
               who put forth that argument about negotiating 
               <br />
               showed plainly that he just doesn’t understand. 
               <br />
               He doesn’t even begin to understand confedera- 
               <br />
               tion. Such a man probably has in his mind a 
               <br />
               picture of confederation something like this——— of 
               <br />
               a couple of shrewd bargainers meeting and hag- 
               <br />
               gling and dickering and bargaining, each trying 
               <br />
               to get the best of the bargain — each trying to get 
               <br />
               the better of the other. And somehow, for such a 
               <br />
               man it seems likely that an elected government 
               <br />
               would get better terms. But nothing, nothing 
               <br />
               could be further from the truth. Whoever the 
               <br />
               Canadian government are, and whoever it is that 
               <br />
               they may be dealing with, the Canadian govem- 
               <br />
               ment is tied hand and foot in this matter. They 
               <br />
               cannot go outside the British North America Act 
               <br />
               or outside of any special regional ﬁnancial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arran~</span> 
               <br />
               gement made with a group of provinces. And 
               <br />
               even any such regional arrangement must have 
               <br />
               its basis in the BNA Act. That’s the hard fact that 
               <br />
               knocks on the head the idea of an elected govem- 
               <br />
               ment going up there and negotiating better terms. 
               <br />
               To start with, it’s not a matter of negotiating at 
               <br />
               all. It’s a simple matter of going up there and 
               <br />
               ascertaining, learning, ﬁnding out what the terms 
               <br />
               are. In the second place, the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada are bound by the constitution of Canada 
               <br />
               known as the British North America Act. So, 
               <br />
               when Mr. Harrington complains about our not 
               <br />
               having been offered special terms, he put his 
               <br />
               ﬁnger right on it. We had not been offered special 
               <br />
               terms because no Government of Canada can 
               <br />
               offer special terms. And drat’s why all this talk 
               <br />
               about an elected government going up there and 
               <br />
               getting better terms is completely beside the 
               <br />
               mark. It’s off the track altogether. Here are the 
               <br />
               terms, and on the ﬁnancial side, as the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister tells us in his letter, they go as far as 
               <br />
               Canada can go under the circumstances. What 
               <br />
               circumstances? The circumstances that I have 
               <br />
               just mentioned. They are bound by precedent, 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
         </div>
         
         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_6" title="bbox 792 189 1354 1885">
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               bound by what is done for other provinces. 
               <br />
               They’d soon hear from the other provinces if 
               <br />
               Newfoundland were offered special ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               terms that they hadn’t been offered themselves. 
               <br />
               In 1864 we were not offered special terms; in 
               <br />
               1895 we were not offered special terms; although 
               <br />
               on both occasions an elected government went up 
               <br />
               there seeking better terms, or special terms, terms 
               <br />
               better then any other provinces had been given. 
               <br />
               We’ve already had two elected governments that 
               <br />
               went to Ottawa looking for terms. And what did 
               <br />
               they get? The same terms as the other provinces. 
               <br />
               And now we’re told if we’ll send an elected 
               <br />
               government up there, that elected government 
               <br />
               will get better terms. That’s the ﬁnal, the un— 
               <br />
               answerable answer to those who tell us that an 
               <br />
               elected government would get better terms: the 
               <br />
               fact that already two elected Newfoundland 
               <br />
               governments have gone to Ottawa and neither 
               <br />
               government got them. If, instead of the Ottawa 
               <br />
               delegation that went from this Convention, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mem»</span> 
               <br />
               bers of a government had gone up to Ottawa, the 
               <br />
               terms they’d have brought back to Newfoundland 
               <br />
               would be what? They would be exactly these 
               <br />
               terms that we have before us today. I thank Mr. 
               <br />
               Harrington for bringing this matter to our atten— 
               <br />
               tion. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now Mr. Harrington told us that old age pen- 
               <br />
               sions were introduced into Canada in 1927, 
               <br />
               which he says was years after old age pensions 
               <br />
               were introduced here in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland.</span> I’m 
               <br />
               sorry, but Mr. Harrington is all astray there, all 
               <br />
               astray. Old age pensions were introduced into 
               <br />
               Canada 20 or 25 years before 1927. What hap- 
               <br />
               pened in 1927 was merely this, that the federal 
               <br />
               government began to pay part of the costs of old 
               <br />
               age pensions. Up to 1927 each provincial govern- 
               <br />
               ment paid its own old age pensions. The federal 
               <br />
               government paid nothing towards the costs. The 
               <br />
               trouble with that arrangement was that the richer 
               <br />
               provinces could and did pay bigger old age <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pen»</span> 
               <br />
               sions than the other provinces could afford to pay. 
               <br />
               So in 1927 the federal government stepped in 
               <br />
               with a plan to pay part of the amount. What they 
               <br />
               did was to pay half the cost of old age pensions, 
               <br />
               leaving it to the provincial governments to pay 
               <br />
               the other half. Then around 1934 the federal 
               <br />
               government stepped up its contribution and 
               <br />
               began to pay three-quarters of the full amount. 
               <br />
               The full amount was then $25 a month. Last 
               <br />
               summer the Canadian government raised the pen-
