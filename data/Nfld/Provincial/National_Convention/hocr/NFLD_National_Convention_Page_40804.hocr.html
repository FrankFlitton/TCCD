               Mr. Chairman There is altogether too much

               Mr. Starkes That’s a big difference in my eyes, 
               <br />
               and it tells us a lot, for had we exported as much 
               <br />
               fresh frozen ﬁsh this year as we did last year we 
               <br />
               would have that much less salted ﬁsh to try to get 
               <br />
               rid of now.

               Again, take our herring. From January I to the 
               <br />
               end of October last year we exported over <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">5141/2</span> 
               <br />
               million worth of herring; but what do we ﬁnd for 
               <br />
               the same period this year? Our herring exports are 
               <br />
               only $2 million, that is over <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">321/2</span> million less that 
               <br />
               last year. Take lobsters. Our expert of lobsters 
               <br />
               this year is $150,000 less than last year. Look at 
               <br />
               dried squid. Out of 10,000 barrels packed this 
               <br />
               year only 2,000 barrels have been sold, leaving 
               <br />
               8,000 barrels still in the country, mostly in the 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen’s hands and practically unsaleable. 
               <br />
               Look at the salmon. Last year salmon exported in 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst ten months came to $800,000. In the 
               <br />
               same period this year it is only $550,000, that is 
               <br />
               $250,000 less. And if you look at the pulpwood 
               <br />
               industry, what do you ﬁnd? Practically all the 
               <br />
               camps cutting pulpwood had their quota reduced 
               <br />
               this year, and speaking of the district I represent, 
               <br />
               a very large pulpwood operation at Springdale 
               <br />
               has its camps at present all closed, while at 
               <br />
               Roberts Arm, where there is another large opera- 
               <br />
               tion, they expect to close this week.

               With all these facts staring them in the face,

               Mr. Chairman, I can tell you that thousands of our 
               <br />
               producers are today up against conditions worse 
               <br />

               any notes or preparation, to take issue with two 
               <br />
               matters that Mr. Bradley brought out in his ex- 
               <br />
               tended talk. One of them is that he used a lot of 
               <br />
               “ifs” in his arguments about getting into the 
               <br />
               United States market. “If", and the result of it was 
               <br />
               there was no possible chance for Newfoundland 
               <br />
               to do anything <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there.</span> Well, I want to say to him, 
               <br />
               although he is not in the House at this time, and 
               <br />
               to the delegates, that if we had the chance to send 
               <br />
               an ofﬁcial delegation to Washington, and spent 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one»third</span> of the time there that the delegates did 
               <br />
               in Ottawa, then we would see and then we would

               know what could be done.

               Another matter that Mr. Bradley stressed was 
               <br />
               speculation. There was speculation in our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Eco&lt;</span>

               nomic Report, and speculation in this and that,

               <br />
               were put across this House about the report and 
               <br />
               the personnel of the Committee, we served

               honestly, unmoved by exterior motives of any 
               <br />
               kind, and I claim that the report is a good one. 
               <br />
               Lots of the information contained in that report is 
               <br />
               taken from all the reports of this Convention, 
               <br />
               compiled by all members of the Convention, and 
               <br />
               moreover they were also taken from official sour-

               ces, and I believe they are right; and when one

               member says, “It was not an honest report”, I
