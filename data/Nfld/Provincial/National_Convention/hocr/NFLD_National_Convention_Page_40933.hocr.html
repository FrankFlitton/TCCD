               <br />
               note why that grant is offered. It is in order to

               facilitate the adjustment of Newfoundland to the 
               <br />

               important, because as they say there, it is a dif-

               ﬁcult thing to foretell with enough accuracy just 
               <br />
               what the ﬁnancial consequences would be to 
               <br />
               Newfoundland in adjusting herself to the status 
               <br />
               of a province of Canada. So these subsidies of- 
               <br />
               fered, including the $3.5 million. may or may not

               be enough. Therefore the Government of Canada

               <br />
               province they would appoint a royal commission 
               <br />
               to review our ﬁnancial position as it appeared at 
               <br />
               that time. In doing that, the royal commission 
               <br />
               would be bound to take two things into account 
               <br />
               in deciding whether we need a bigger subsidy or

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               not. It would have to take into account whether 
               <br />
               the province at that time was taking in enough to 
               <br />
               pay its way — taking it in two cases, first, sub— 
               <br />
               sidies from the Government of Canada and taxes 
               <br />

               <br />
               even? Was it paying its way? Was it balancing its 
               <br />
               budget? Was the Government of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               getting enough subsidy to enable it to keep up its 
               <br />
               services to the public? And secondly, they have 
               <br />
               to have a yardstick to measure that by, and the 
               <br />
               yardstick is the rate of provincial taxation in the 
               <br />
               Maritime Provinces, those provinces being most

               nearly similar to the conditions in New— 
               <br />
