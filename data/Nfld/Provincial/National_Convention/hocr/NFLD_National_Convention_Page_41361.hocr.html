               <br />
               end. Somewhere it is said, “Man doth not live by 
               <br />
               bread alone.” There is a call, a challenge born in 
               <br />
               the heart of man to rule, to govern. This must find 
               <br />
               an outlet, or the man, the country, deteriorates. 
               <br />
               This instinct, strong and lasting, is patent; and its 
               <br />
               suppression can but activate more strongly. 
               <br />
               Sometimes it is that suppression that guides it on 
               <br />
               to a predetermined destiny, if such there can be. 
               <br />
               It was suppression that many years ago urged our 
               <br />
               forefathers to seek this new land. It was the 
               <br />
               suppression which followed them here that urged 
               <br />
               them to ﬁght for the freedom and justice and the 
               <br />
               right to govern, which was theirs. They have won 
               <br />
               their cause. They have passed to us the torch. Will 
               <br />
               we fail to hold it high?

               <br />
               upon the head of the late Hon. F. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">C.</span> Alderdice, as 
               <br />
               well as upon those who supported him in accept-

               ing the recommendations of the royal commis—

               Commission of Government, which appeared to 
               <br />
               be the only choice except the one of facing 
               <br />
               default on our bond issues, which was the clear 
               <br />
               alternative. I knew Mr. Alderdice very well, and 
               <br />
               believe that we never had a more sincere or a 
               <br />
               more honourable leader of our government; but 
               <br />
               in my opinion, he did make a mistake in not 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               of his supporters, that there was not the slightest 
               <br />
               doubt that the scheme would be approved by the 
               <br />
               electorate, but as a matter of principle it should 
               <br />
               certainly have been submitted. The urgency of 
               <br />
               the situation, however, had convinced Mr. Alder- 
               <br />
               dice and his government that they were following 
               <br />
               the right course, and as history shows, the 
               <br />
               proposals were carried in the House of Assembly, 
               <br />
               rightly or wrongly, with only one or two dissent- 
               <br />
               ing voices. One of these was that of Mr. Bradley, 
               <br />
               whose efforts to get some revision of the proposal 
               <br />
               are on record, and I fancy that history will say he 
               <br />
               should be given credit for those efforts to im-
