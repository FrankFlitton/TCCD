               creasing the number of kinds of ﬁsh that we can

               so many different ways is an assurance that the

               <br />
               moments of the 1930s. I know that at the moment 
               <br />
               there is an exchange problem that may be 
               <br />
               troublesome. On the other hand, that problem has

               Newfoundland cannot expect to be prosper- 
               <br />
               ous in a world torn by conﬂict or sunk in depres— 
               <br />
               sion. We know, in the words of the member for 
               <br />
               Bonavista Centre, that things looked pretty good 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland while the bread lines were 
               <br />
               forming in the cities of Canada and the United 
               <br />
               States. Just the same, we can’t fool ourselves. If 
               <br />
               the rest of the world is stricken with poverty, we 
               <br />
               can’t expect to have prosperity. That does not 
               <br />
               mean there is anything wrong with our industries 
               <br />
               or their future, and I am as certain as the day that 
               <br />
               everything is going to come right. The world 
               <br />
               cannot go down. In fact, the world is going to 
               <br />
               revive because to have peace we must have 
               <br />
               general prosperity. The United States is going to 
               <br />
               pour its resources into the poor countries that 
               <br />
               have been ravaged by war, and build up their 
               <br />
               economies with its help. As the purchasing power 
               <br />
               of Europe revives, so will the prospects of 
               <br />

               <br />
               catching and processing ﬁsh of all kinds. More 
               <br />

               Now there have been some references to the 
               <br />
               Labrador ﬁshery. In any industry that is control— 
               <br />
               led largely by nature, there will always be black 
               <br />
               spots. We hear of a big wheat crop in Canada, but 
               <br />
               we don't hear anything about the farmers who 
               <br />
               lost millions of bushels because of weather con- 
               <br />
               ditions last summer. Those farmers whose crops 
               <br />
               were wiped out were much like our ﬁshermen 
               <br />
               who didn’tget enough ﬁsh. Everyone is naturally 
               <br />
               sympathetic to these hardy producers who are 
               <br />
               treated badly by nature, and we have to do what 
               <br />
               we can to help them. Just the same, the fact that 
               <br />
               a percentage of people have had bad luck or are 
               <br />
               unemployed for some reason beyond their con— 
               <br />
               trol does not mean that the whole economy is 
               <br />
               depressed. We may have to ﬁnd some means by 
               <br />
               which the producers can be given greater security 
               <br />
               in the future, so that we can eliminate as far as we 
               <br />
               can the gamble of the voyage. In a country like 
               <br />
               this a wise government will try always to keep 
               <br />
               some special public works in hand to meet special 
               <br />
               emergencies where people have had hard luck. I 
               <br />
               do not agree with the principle of spending every 
               <br />
               cent the country has in a time of general 
               <br />
               prosperity and we ought, in my opinion, to be 
               <br />
               adding to our surplus at the present time.

               As to the forest industry, I can only go by what 
               <br />
               the people who know that industry best have said 
               <br />
               about its prospects and what they are doing to 
               <br />
               back up their words. The demand for newsprint 
               <br />
               is so great that the exchange problem does not 
               <br />
               concern it very much. The United States and 
               <br />
               other countries able to pay in dollars can take all 
               <br />
               we produce, and we have the word of people who 
               <br />
               know what they are talking about that prosperity 
               <br />
               seems to be in store for the forest industries for 
               <br />
               several years to come. Anyone can stand up here 
               <br />
               and point to what happened in the thirties. But the 
               <br />
               world would never again survive a depression 
               <br />
               like that of the years between the two wars. Our 
               <br />
               prospects are good because we are selling all our 
               <br />
               produce at good prices, although Britain is not 
               <br />
               able to buy so much and other countries in the 
               <br />
               sterling group are in difficulties. Their condition 
               <br />
               is bound to improve and we shall have better 
               <br />
               markets when it does improve.
