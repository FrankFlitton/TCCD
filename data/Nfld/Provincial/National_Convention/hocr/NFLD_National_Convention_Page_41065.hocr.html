               as defence, come within the jurisdiction of the

               Mr. Hollett is this: how can they abrogate to

               themselves the rights which would pass to the 
               <br />

               <br />
               lease, which would be transferred to the province 
               <br />

               Mr. Butt The logic of it is that it would revert to

               at this whole matter of this information which has

               been brought back to us from Canada by the 
               <br />
               delegation which went from this Convention to 
               <br />
               ﬁnd out if there were any equitable basis for

               <br />
               be wise if we pause for a little while in our 
               <br />
               deliberation and take a look at Canada, relative

               Canadian government is endeavouring to make, 
               <br />
               and which they have made with some of the 
               <br />
               provinces.

               As we know, these tax agreements have not

               been signed by Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia 
               <br />

               <br />
               the delegates a sort of refresher on this business

               <br />
               along a narrow belt of territory from the Atlantic 
               <br />
               to the Paciﬁc. In the centre was the Province of 
               <br />

               <br />
               the St Lawrence River system and the Grand 
               <br />

               <br />
               English, Irish and Scotch settlers, whose chief 
               <br />
               industries were agriculture, lumbering, ship-

               On the Atlantic seaboard there were the colonies 
               <br />
               of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Ed- 
               <br />
               ward Island, as well as Newfoundland, with a 
               <br />
               total population of 800,000 in 1864. Nova Scotia 
               <br />
               was still prosperous, her prosperity based on the 
               <br />
               era of wooden ships and the high prices following 
               <br />
               the American Civil War. It was a colony of 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen, sailors and traders. Nova Scotia had 
               <br />
               enjoyed representative government for 100 
               <br />
               years, and had a culture all her own. She had fish, 
               <br />
               lumber, agriculture and coal, and traded with 
               <br />
               New England, the West Indies, Europe, and in- 
               <br />
               deed the whole world all seasons of the year. New 
               <br />
               Brunswick, the home of United Empire 
               <br />
               Loyalists, had much the same natural resources 
               <br />
               as Nova Scotia. Prince Edward Island had 
               <br />
               agriculture, ﬁshing and shipbuilding. All three 
               <br />
               were prosperous on account of the demand for 
               <br />
               their products by the United States and the high 
               <br />
               prices then existing. Then in the centre was the 
               <br />
               Red River District (now Manitoba), with 10,000 
               <br />
               souls, mostly half-breeds. In the west were two 
               <br />
               separate colonies, one on Vancouver Island, and 
               <br />
               British Columbia on the mainland. They united 
               <br />
               in 1866 to form one colony, but not more than 
               <br />
               10,000 people lived there. Such was British 
               <br />
               North America in 1864, or just before the idea of 
               <br />
               confederation was mooted. Between all these 
               <br />
               colonies there were no commercial dealings 
               <br />
               whatsoever.

               There were various causes for the desire of 
               <br />
               confederation: there were conﬂicting interests, 
               <br />
               personal ambitions of some statesmen, and there 
               <br />
               was the question of commercial greed between 
               <br />
               the various colonies; most of all there was fear of 
               <br />
               the American empire. Confederation as ﬁnally 
               <br />
               consummated was only a compromise, for it was 
               <br />
               the hope and wish of Sir John A. Macdonald and 
               <br />
               most of the Fathers of Confederation that a real 
               <br />
               legislative union could be brought about, and not 
               <br />
               merely a loosely bound number of autonomous 
               <br />
               provinces. “I have always contended”, said Mac- 
               <br />
               donald in one of the debates, “that if we could 
               <br />
               agree to have one government and one parlia- 
               <br />
               merit, it would be the best, the cheapest, the most 
               <br />
               vigorous and the strongest system of government 
               <br />
               we could adopt.” Lower Canada (Quebec), New 
               <br />
               Brunswick and Nova Scotia, however, were 
               <br />
               against such an idea for various reasons, and so 
               <br />
