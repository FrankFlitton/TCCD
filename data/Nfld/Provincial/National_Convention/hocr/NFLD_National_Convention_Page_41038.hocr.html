               in the future, and our government is following the

               exactly opposite course from that adopted by 
               <br />
               most governments around the world. Most 
               <br />
               governments do this: when times are good they 
               <br />
               tax high and collect all they can; and when times

               <br />

               <br />
               be spent out of capital account. We have a capital

               Finally, I want to say this: I don’t want to do 
               <br />
               Mr. Hickman an injustice, but I must say that he 
               <br />
               gives me this impression that the surplus should 
               <br />
               be laid aside and forgotten until we get the bread 
               <br />
               line. He said, “When you get bread lines on the 
               <br />
               mainland of Canada and the United States, you 
               <br />
               will have them in Newfoundland". Now that 
               <br />
               means destitution and unemployment, and he 
               <br />
               says we should save the $28 million or $30 mil- 
               <br />
               lion until that day. The impression I got is, “Don’t 
               <br />
               touch your surplus until your people are destitute 
               <br />
               or nearly so, and then spend it for dole." If I got 
               <br />
               that impression wrongly he will correct me, and 
               <br />
               I will be glad, because i find it hard to believe. 
               <br />
               He is a practical and determined New- 
               <br />
               foundlander, who is old enough to remember 
               <br />
               what we went through from 1930 to 1940, and 
               <br />
               how we spent millions of dollars on dole, and he 
               <br />
               could not welcome that again,just spending it on 
               <br />
               dole. I think he would agree with me the better 
               <br />
               way is to spend the money before the dole days 
               <br />
               come on public works such as road building, the 
               <br />
               construction of buildings, etc., so as to create 
               <br />
               employment. Let‘s all hope and pray to God that 
               <br />
               there will be no need to ladle out dole again in 
               <br />
               this country. The very sound of the name turns 
               <br />
               your blood cold, when you remember the dole 
               <br />
               days from 1930 to 1940. Let’s hope that we will 
               <br />
               spend that capital, timing it right, so that there 
               <br />
               will not be any need to pay dole.

               Mr. Hickman Well, there won’t be enough to 
               <br />
               take it out for eight years, and $9 million is in 
               <br />
               England, and I don‘t know how we can get that 
               <br />
               for a while. ldon‘t want to get into an argument, 
               <br />
               but I will say this: that the Government of New- 
               <br />
               foundland prior to Commission government did 
               <br />
               not throw everything into the one hat. They did 
               <br />
               keep ordinary expenditure separate from capital 
               <br />
               expenditure, and whether the governments today 
               <br />
               do it or not, I still contend that it is the wrong thing 
               <br />
               to do. There would be a lot of governments who 
               <br />
               would be better off if they ran their governments 
               <br />
               like a private business. There would be fewer 
               <br />
               debts. Again, on this question on which 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood spoke, the repayment of the 
               <br />
               money from the Gander and the boats purchased 
               <br />
               in England. After we have spent that for this eight
