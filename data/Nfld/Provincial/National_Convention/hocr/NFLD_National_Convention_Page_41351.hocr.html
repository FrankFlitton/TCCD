               brazen effrontery to our country! Here we are a 
               <br />
               body of men representing all Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               brought here apparently, so we are told, for the 
               <br />
               express purpose of deciding on our country’s 
               <br />
               future form of government; we ask a highly 
               <br />
               relevant and important question about a contract 
               <br />
               to which we ourselves are party, and under which 
               <br />
               we lost our former government, and we are 
               <br />
               politely told, Mr. Chairman, to mind our own 
               <br />
               business. Every intelligent person knows that the 
               <br />
               ballot which by force of law and under the terms 
               <br />
               of the 1933 agreement should be put to our people 
               <br />
               is simply this: “Do you or do you not want the 
               <br />
               return of responsible government?” That is the 
               <br />
               choice. That is the legal and the only option 
               <br />
               which is provided for in this agreement to which 
               <br />
               the British government attached its hand and seal. 
               <br />
               That is the choice they promised us. Under what 
               <br />
               right do they withhold that choice from us? Under 
               <br />
               what law are we deprived of our legal rights? 
               <br />
               What is behind all this international <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">double-deal.</span> 
               <br />
               ing and chicanery anyhow? It is a pity that those 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders who can afford it have not long 
               <br />
               ago taken steps to bring this whole matter before 
               <br />
               the Privy Council, and in this way found out 
               <br />
               whether the contract which Great Britain made 
               <br />
               with Newfoundland in 1933 is a proper and 
               <br />
               decent transaction, or whether it is a worthless 
               <br />
               joke played at the expense of a helpless people. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, I am voting in favour of the 
               <br />
               motion before us because, under the circumstan- 
               <br />
               ces I have outlined, I have no choice to do other- 
               <br />
               wise. Now some may say, “Is not this ballot in 
               <br />
               effect carrying out the terms of the 1933 agree— 
               <br />
               ment?” Does it not give our people the oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity to ask for the return of responsible 
               <br />
               government if they want it?” I tell them it is not. 
               <br />
               There is no reference whatever in this contract 
               <br />
               which asks us to vote on the retention of Com- 
               <br />
               mission government. It is something imported 
               <br />
               and foisted on us. As I said before, the ballot 
               <br />
               which this contract provides for is a simple re- 
               <br />
               quest for the return of one form of government. 
               <br />
               If more than one form of government goes on the 
               <br />
               ballot then I say it goes beyond the powers 
               <br />
               provided in that contract, and to be consistent the 
               <br />
               British government should be ready to put every 
               <br />
               conceivable form of government on the ballot. 
               <br />
               For all we know there may be people in this 
               <br />
               country who may have elected Commission of 
               <br />
               Government, representative government, union 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
         </div>
         
         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_13" title="bbox 934 174 1473 1865">
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               with Great Britain, union with the USA, etc. Yes, 
               <br />
               the whole thing is obviously impracticable, even 
               <br />
               ridiculuous, but as I have observed, we must do 
               <br />
               the best we can in spite of the obstacles which 
               <br />
               have been placed in our path; and as the motion 
               <br />
               before us seems to me to be the only method by 
               <br />
               which our people are to be given the opportunity 
               <br />
               of requesting the restoration of their lost political 
               <br />
               rights, I have no option but to support the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">motion.</span> 
               <br />
               In doing so it is my fervent hope that if such a 
               <br />
               ballot is placed before our people they will regard 
               <br />
               it in its true light. They will see it not as a choice 
               <br />
               of being asked to vote for two equal forms of 
               <br />
               government, but rather as an opportunity for 
               <br />
               demanding that the British government fulﬁll the 
               <br />
               pledge that they gave this country in 1933. Let us 
               <br />
               see to it that we Newfoundlanders live up to our 
               <br />
               solemn contractual obligations, and if the pact of 
               <br />
               1933 is to be broken and made a scrap of paper, 
               <br />
               let us not allow ourselves to be willing parties to 
               <br />
               such a breach of faith. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               In dealing with the matter of forms of govern- 
               <br />
               ment to go on the ballot, I cannot ignore the fact 
               <br />
               that what we recommend, when it reaches Lon— 
               <br />
               don, may be thrown in the waste-paper basket if 
               <br />
               it does not suit the fancies of Mr. Attlee, or be in 
               <br />
               accord with the future which he has planned for 
               <br />
               us. And that reminds me, Mr. Chairman, with 
               <br />
               reference to Mr. Attlee, that when this legislation 
               <br />
               of 1933 was being passed in the British House of 
               <br />
               Commons Mr. Attlee viciously attacked it, and 
               <br />
               when the Commission of Government was ap- 
               <br />
               pointed he called them a bunch of burn bailiffs. 
               <br />
               Somewhat consistent with his attitude today isn’t 
               <br />
               it, Mr. Chairman? In which event all our work 
               <br />
               here will have been for nothing, and we will 
               <br />
               become once again placed in a farcical situation 
               <br />
               which we are helpless to prevent. As for myself 
               <br />
               I am prepared to believe that the Cormnonwealth 
               <br />
               Secretary has our ballot made out long ago and 
               <br />
               poked away in his rolltop desk till the time comes 
               <br />
               to send it on to us. I saw it when I was over there.
