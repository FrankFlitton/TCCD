               Grand Falls... When this Convention opened, 1 
               <br />
               put forward a notice of question concerning our 
               <br />
               national debt and the possible way of financing a 
               <br />
               reconstruction programme. I was not thinking in 
               <br />
               terms of asking Great Britain what she was going 
               <br />
               to do for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us,</span> It came from a mind which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">remem'</span> 
               <br />
               bered how the debt had been built up; which had, 
               <br />
               I hope, a sense of perspective after reading New- 
               <br />
               foundland history; and which remembered a 
               <br />
               statement of an Englishman, who had read 
               <br />
               English and Newfoundland history, and said, “1 
               <br />
               would not like to have to decide whether England 
               <br />
               has been of more beneﬁt to Newfoundland, than 
               <br />
               Newfoundland has been to England."

            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I had a whole series of questions, but older and 
               <br />
               more experienced men in the Convention and out 
               <br />
               of it, seemed to think the questions were of such 
               <br />
               vital importance that they would have to be dealt 
               <br />
               with seriously before the Convention closed and 
               <br />
               that 1 should leave them until a later date. 1 
               <br />
               accepted the position. l think these men were 
               <br />
               right. The time has now come when these ques- 
               <br />
               tions will be put forward. A little later we had a 
               <br />
               discussion on the Interim Report of the Fisheries 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Committee.</span> I said the question of how we should 
               <br />
               go about exploring the possibility of having some 
               <br />
               beneﬁt accrue to Newfoundland, other than came 
               <br />
               from the construction and maintenance of bases, 
               <br />
               should be examined. Later still, I voted against 
               <br />
               sending a delegation to Canada to discuss federal 
               <br />
               union for two main reasons. Every instinct in me 
               <br />
               rebelled against even the possibility of creating 
               <br />
               the impression that this was an indication we had 
               <br />
               once again reverted to the status of supplicants.
