               <br />
               some would try to have us believe. Due to the fact 
               <br />
               that Maj or Cashin is chairman of this Committee, 
               <br />
               he is entrusted with the unenviable duty of steer- 
               <br />
               ing the report through the committee of the 
               <br />
               whole. This, I feel, tends to leave the impression 
               <br />
               that it is his report — in fact I have heard it 
               <br />
               referred to as such. They seem to forget that this 
               <br />
               report is submitted over the signatures of seven 
               <br />
               other gentlemen in addition to Mr. Cashin... 
               <br />
               Now, regardless of to what extent any of these 
               <br />
               gentlemen contributed to the report individually, 
               <br />
               it is the result of their collective effort and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">repre~</span>

               sents the considered opinion of each and every 
               <br />
               one of them. I realise that their judgement is not 
               <br />
               infallible; that their estimates may not, in all 
               <br />
               cases, be accurate; but I submit that if they have 
               <br />
               erred at all, the error is on the conservative side. 
               <br />
               We have heard this report criticised, even 
               <br />
               ridiculed in this House —— this, gentlemen, is the 
               <br />
               easiest thing in the world to do, and no doubt this 
               <br />
               is why some delegates indulge in it so frequently. 
               <br />
               But do they offer any alternative? No! They just 
               <br />
               seek to destroy the signiﬁcance of this report for 
               <br />
               their own selﬁsh purposes.

               Mr. Smallwood Point of order. He says this 
               <br />
               report has been criticised, even ridiculed in this 
               <br />
               House and that those who are doing so seek to 
               <br />
               destroy the signiﬁcance of the report “for their 
               <br />
               own selﬁsh purposes". Now, that is pretty low. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman That is a conclusion. There 
               <br />
               seems to be widespread here, for some reason or 
               <br />
               other, the unfortunate element of dishonesty. I do 
               <br />
               not know why it should be here at all. Why cannot 
               <br />
               there be an honest disagreement on any question? 
               <br />
               If it is the right of one man to view something 
               <br />
               optimistically, then afortiori it is the right of any 
               <br />
               other individual to assume the contrary point of 
               <br />
               view. As far as I am concerned, Major Cashin and 
               <br />
               the members of that Committee, all members 
               <br />
               inside or outside the Convention, as far as I am 
               <br />
               concerned, are honest men.... Remember that 
               <br />
               criticism is a very natural thing. It may be 
               <br />
               favourable or unfavourable, it may be construc- 
               <br />
               tive or destructive; but I wish members would 
               <br />
               refrain from imputing dishonesty or ulterior mo- 
               <br />
               tives simply because they ﬁnd themselves in 
               <br />
               disagreement with opinions expressed by other 
               <br />
               members of the Convention. I do not feel you are 
               <br />
               justiﬁed in drawing that conclusion.

               <br />

               <br />
               present position, and a reasonable estimate of 
               <br />
               what things are likely to be in the foreseeable 
               <br />
               future. The Committee gave us a good review of 
               <br />
               our industries and their future possibilities. They 
               <br />
               tell us that the industries dependent on our forests 
               <br />
               are expanding and that their products are assured 
               <br />
               of a steady market. Our mining industries are in 
               <br />
               full production and further development is even 
               <br />
               now under way. That the great wealth of 
               <br />
               Labrador will be developed in the not far distant 
               <br />
               future is common knowledge We know that the 
               <br />
               timber resources and water—power of that vast 
               <br />
               northern dependency are sources of potential 
               <br />
               wealth which cannot be overlooked. I think that 
               <br />
               our tourist industry is capable of big development 
               <br />
               and that, given the necessary encouragement and 
               <br />
               assistance, may well become one of our chief 
               <br />
               sources of revenue. Our fisheries cannot be 
               <br />
               judged by the result of any one branch of that 
               <br />
               industry in any one season. We must take an 
               <br />
               overall view of the whole industry and if we do, 
               <br />
               we must admit that the ﬁshing industry, as a 
               <br />
               whole, is on a sounder economic basis than ever 
               <br />
               before. It is more diversiﬁed. We are not so 
               <br />

               for the past couple of years, and this is indeed
