               I’ll take the ﬁrst point <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> it’s hardly a sufﬁcient 
               <br />
               period on which to make an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">average...“</span> It seems 
               <br />
               sufﬁcient to say for practical purposes that the 
               <br />
               average amount paid in Nova Scotia is around $1 
               <br />
               million a month or $12 million a year. In <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> 
               <br />
               foundland it ought to be six, make it seven. 
               <br />
               There’s the difference of $1 million. That throws 
               <br />
               some doubt upon this probable estimate of expen—

               Let’s turn now to the old age pensions. 
               <br />
               Remember now the population of Nova Scotia is 
               <br />
               just double that of Newfoundland. I found that 
               <br />
               the contributions for 1945 would be $2,879,000 
               <br />
               - half of that should be $1,400,000 for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> 
               <br />
               foundland. The ﬁgure given in the possible es- 
               <br />
               timate of expenditure is $2 million for 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, $2 to $2.6 million. Now, when 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood talks about the age group, it may 
               <br />
               be quite true that we have more children in New- 
               <br />
               foundland then they have in Nova Scotia <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">propor‘</span> 
               <br />
               tionately. It is also therefore true that we have 
               <br />
               more old people in Newfoundland, on the basis 
               <br />
               of this estimate. Now if one is right the other can’t 
               <br />
               be right, as I see it. To borrow a phrase from you, 
               <br />
               sir, I’m driven to the conclusion that we must be 
               <br />
               a very hardy people to produce more old aged 
               <br />
               people than they do in Nova Scotia, or that this 
               <br />
               estimate is wrong, and that it isn’t true, as we 
               <br />
               heard some years ago, that the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland died before they reached the age of 40. 
               <br />
               I cannot accept the probable expenditure without 
               <br />
               a greater amount of study than I am capable of 
               <br />
               giving it....

               to take care of a better distribution in highly

               industrialised countries. We in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               have not reached that stage yet, and consequently 
               <br />
               when you read in the Black Book the things to

               fact that we are not yet a highly industrialised 
               <br />

               <br />

               Now we come to the sick mariners’ fund... It 
               <br />
               is shown in the Black Book that the expenditure 
               <br />
               per capita boiled down to $3 per seaman treated. 
               <br />
               It is specifically pointed out that it is not a health

               <br />
               lot of loose talk about the building of sanatoria in 
               <br />

               <br />
               is treated, put into hospital if necessary and the 
               <br />
               funds to pay are found, by himself if he can afford 
               <br />

               <br />
               pay anything, by the government. Sir, that 
               <br />
               scheme is actually in effect at the present time.

               For the moment, I am going to pass over 
               <br />
               clauses 4 and 5, which refer to things which 
               <br />
               Canada would take over, and pass on to our debts. 
               <br />
               This creates one of the greatest intellectual dif- 
               <br />
               ﬁculties that I found in this book. In fact, if it 
               <br />
               weren’t serious, I would just slap it down and be 
               <br />
               amused. “Canada will assume and provide for the

               <br />
               ment.” I ask you to listen closely. “This, in the 
               <br />
               opinion of the Canadian government, represents 
               <br />
               a fair estimate of the amount of debt incurred for 
               <br />
               purposes which would presumably have been the

               responsibility of the Government of Canada, had 
               <br />
               Newfoundland been a province when the debt 
               <br />
               was incurred.” On page 253 of the Amulree 
               <br />
               Report is a list of the items upon which the $100

               million debt that was incurred in this country was 
               <br />
               spent. It starts with $34 million for railways, it 
               <br />
               has $13 million for war purposes, it goes on to 
               <br />
               highroads and other roads, and it goes all the way
