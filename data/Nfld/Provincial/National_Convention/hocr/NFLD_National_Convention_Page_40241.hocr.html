               <br />
               far as I can find out there will be a sharp rise 
               <br />
               during the coming year, but after that I have not 
               <br />
               the least doubt that there will be an easing of the 
               <br />
               situation. Of course, while we were with the 
               <br />
               railroad, the negotiations for the increased wages 
               <br />
               were not on, although we were informed that 
               <br />
               there were rumours that it probably would come. 
               <br />
               I could not see myself where they could keep 
               <br />
               within the bounds of what they showed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us....</span> I 
               <br />
               know it is very difficult to arrive at it in dollars 
               <br />
               and cents, but we could not get along without it, 
               <br />
               and from facts and figures we received, I believe 
               <br />
               that if something turned up along the line of 
               <br />
               railroad that would give us another Corner Brook 
               <br />
               or Grand Falls, it would cease being a liability 
               <br />
               and balance its books.... The bulk of the earnings 
               <br />
               are from here to Corner Brook and Grand Falls, 
               <br />
               and from Port-aux-Basques to Corner Brook. The 
               <br />
               rest of the railroad is a liability to the country...

               <br />
               a considerable amount paid in claims, and what 
               <br />
               are the causes of these claims? Is the property

               out of 17,598 other items. We only examined one

               <br />

               pilfering and I think the Railway management 
               <br />

               little that need be said by us about that because 
               <br />
               there is a memorandum which you will ﬁnd on

               your desks, sent to the Committee today by the 
               <br />
               management of the Railway, which I think ex- 
               <br />
               plains it. I would like here to pay tribute to Mr. 
               <br />
               Watton, the Secretary of the Committee, who 
               <br />
               went to enormous trouble and labour to obtain 
               <br />
               these ﬁgures from the Railway. We were in- 
               <br />
               formed that the Buchans Mining Co., the AND 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Co.,</span> Shell Oil and Imperial Oil were getting 
               <br />
               special rates for hauling their wood, paper, ore 
               <br />
               and oil, and we went to special pains to get these 
               <br />
               ﬁgures. We got the special rates, but where we 
               <br />
               did fall into an error was in this respect: they gave 
               <br />
               us the special carload rates, and what we did was 
               <br />
               compare the rates that these companies get with 
               <br />
               the carload rate. What we ought to have done was 
               <br />
               to compare their special rates not with the carload 
               <br />
               rate but with the trainload <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rate.</span> If a man gets 
               <br />
               carload rate, the practice is for him to load and 
               <br />
               unload the car himself, but in the case of a train- 
               <br />
               load you have a different situation altogether. Or 
               <br />
               maybe it is the other way around, anyway the
