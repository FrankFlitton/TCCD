               the Government of Canada stay as they are now; 
               <br />
               then they estimate they would collect

               $20,185,000 a year from Newfoundland. But 
               <br />
               they go on to say that neither assumption is 
               <br />
               realistic. It is not realistic to go on the assumption 
               <br />
               that the present level of economic activity in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland will continue. It is not realistic to 
               <br />
               take it for granted that the rates of taxation in 
               <br />
               Canada will stay as they are now. There is a very 
               <br />
               good reason for that. Three different times since 
               <br />
               the war came to an end the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada has reduced its rates of taxation. And it 
               <br />
               is not realistic to say that their present rates of 
               <br />
               taxation will stay as high as they are now. The 
               <br />
               realistic assumption is they will fall, and also our 
               <br />
               present level of economic activities will fall 
               <br />
               somewhere below where they are now. if they do 
               <br />
               not they estimate they will collect from New— 
               <br />
               foundland $20 million per year in Canadian 
               <br />
               government taxation. I think that is all I want to 
               <br />
               say at this moment. I am sure my friend Major 
               <br />
               Cashin and others will want to make their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conv</span> 
               <br />
               tribution to this particular pan of the debate. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin I suppose it is all right, after hearing 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood tell us about those famous 
               <br />
               people who compiled these estimates, to venture 
               <br />
               an opinion that they are 20% out. The total <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in»</span> 
               <br />
               come taxes, death duties, etc., collected last year 
               <br />
               was $10.5 million. According to these estimates 
               <br />
               the federal government is going to get ap- 
               <br />
               proximately $11 million. Under our income tax 
               <br />
               laws, 3 single man is exempt up to $l,000. He 
               <br />
               does not pay on less than $ 1 ,000. Under Canadian 
               <br />
               law he pays if he earns $750. A man with $1,000 
               <br />
               income in Newfoundland pays income tax on 
               <br />
               $250. How many people will be found in New- 
               <br />
               foundland not paying income tax today, who will 
               <br />
               be paying under federal legislation? The same 
               <br />
               thing applies to married persons. In <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> 
               <br />
               foundland a married man is exempt up to $2,000. 
               <br />
               If I may be allowed to express a view <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~—</span> I take it, 
               <br />
