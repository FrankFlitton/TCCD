               I am not trying to avoid the acute angle when

               Mr. Chairman, the roads section of your report 
               <br />
               is very informative, but I was somewhat amused 
               <br />
               to note, I believe it was on page 2,1 highroads 
               <br />
               from Bonavista Peninsula west to Cape Freels, 
               <br />
               480 miles. Now only last week I covered that 
               <br />
               section of my district, and if this is a statement of 
               <br />
               fact, it is the quickest piece of road construction 
               <br />
               ever done by the utilities department. Actually it 
               <br />
               must have been built since Christmas Day, for 
               <br />
               there is no road of any kind, highroads or low 
               <br />
               roads connecting Cape Freels with anywhere. Of 
               <br />
               course the department meant a district, and we 
               <br />
               must not assume that they plan some expenditure

               thus allow a little trickle of that million to be 
               <br />
               channelled down to Bonavista or to Mr. Watton’s
