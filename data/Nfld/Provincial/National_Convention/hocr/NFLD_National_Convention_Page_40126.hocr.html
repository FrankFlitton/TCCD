               of the members and the country to it... I make the 
               <br />
               statement that only two years ago the Prime <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Min«</span> 
               <br />
               ister of Quebec made a statement in the legisla- 
               <br />
               ture of Quebec that Newfoundland should hand 
               <br />
               over Labrador to Canada; and, incidentally, to the 
               <br />
               Province of Quebec because they had sent 
               <br />
               Canadian troops down here to defend New- 
               <br />
               foundland and the troops, or a lot of them were 
               <br />
               zombies, and our own boys had to be sent to Italy. 
               <br />
               I resent it as a returned soldier of two wars. Big 
               <br />
               corporations in Canada are now making efforts 
               <br />
               to steal the Labrador from Newfoundland. I do 
               <br />
               not know whether these same individuals offered 
               <br />
               senatorships and trips to Ottawa, but I know that 
               <br />
               it is going on. Confederation has been an issue in 
               <br />
               this country since the inception of responsible 
               <br />
               government nearly 100 years ago. We had it in 
               <br />
               1865, again later, and in 1895, and now con~ 
               <br />
               federation is being brought up again. From 1923 
               <br />
               on, someone was up spouting off that the other 
               <br />
               chap was a confederate, and here we have it 
               <br />
               again. Now we are discussing the possibility of 
               <br />
               sending a delegation to Ottawa. The Chairman 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hasvgiven</span> his decision that the Convention has 
               <br />
               power to send a delegation. Certainly the Con- 
               <br />
               vention has power to send a delegation provided 
               <br />
               the Ottawa government receives them. ButI want 
               <br />
               to draw the attention of this assembly to this fact, 
               <br />
               that even if they go to Ottawa, we have no guaran- 
               <br />
               tee that we are going to have even a plebiscite 
               <br />
               under this Convention Act. If there is I want 
               <br />
               someone to show it to me. We are told that we are 
               <br />
               here to dig out facts and figures, and recommend 
               <br />
               certain forms of government to the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom, which will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subrnitted’to</span> the people. 
               <br />
               When? Whenever they feel like it. That’s the 
               <br />
               answer.

               Now what is the actual situation? In 1933 a 
               <br />
               resolution was passed in this House requesting 
               <br />
               the British government to take over Newfound- 
               <br />
               land because of its ﬁnancial situation. I hold that 
               <br />
               our people should have defaulted and not have 
               <br />
               handed over our constitution. But they did make 
               <br />
               one provision, that when this country became 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selﬁsupporting,</span> responsible government would 
               <br />
               be restored at the request of the people. Well, we 
               <br />
               represent the people here this afternoon, and if 
               <br />
               anyone goes to Ottawa tomorrow and brings back 
               <br />
               the terms of confederation, and it is submitted to

               the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom cannot 
               <br />
               amend that original act of 1933, because there is 
               <br />
               no House of Assembly here to guarantee that 
               <br />
               amendment. It would have to be adopted by our 
               <br />
               Newfoundland government if an amendment to 
               <br />
               that 1933 act has to be made. Is the United

               <br />
               passed in 1933? Certainly not. Then there are

               only two forms of government we have to con-

               sider in this country, Commission of Govem- 
               <br />
               ment and responsible government. There is no 
               <br />
               such thing in this act as confederation, or repre- 
               <br />
               sentative government, or commission. There are 
               <br />
               people in this country who are Communistic. I 
               <br />
               had just as much right, if I was a Communist, to 
               <br />
               get a delegation to go to Moscow and ask Joseph 
               <br />
               Stalin what kind of government or terms he 
               <br />
               would give us. I can’t understand how young 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders can come here and say they 
               <br />
               want terms from another country. I cannot under- 
               <br />
               stand it.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The facts are in the Auditor General’s report 
               <br />
               for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">194445,</span> and all the reports that are going to 
               <br />
               be brought in here won’t alter the fact. The longer 
               <br />
               we are going on here the less money we will have. 
               <br />
               The treasury is being cleaned out, gentlemen. I 
               <br />
               make the bold statement that the treasury of New- 
               <br />
               foundland is being looted, and I defy any man in 
               <br />
               the country to contradict that statement. The idea 
               <br />
               is, to loot her until the last dollar is gone, and then 
               <br />
               it will be confederation or Commission or some- 
               <br />
               thing else. That’s the programme, and Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood knows it is. Now in 1895 a delegation 
               <br />
               went to Ottawa to talk confederation with the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada, and our debt at that time 
               <br />
               was some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">33</span> 15 million. The Dominion of Canada 
               <br />
               came back to that delegation and said, “Look, our 
               <br />
               debt is $50 per head (that’s Canada‘s debt, ours 
               <br />
               was $10 per head). We will allow you $50 per 
               <br />
               head of your debt (at that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁrm</span> our population was 
               <br />
               not anything like it is today). Our debt will then 
               <br />
               amount to $10 million, and the other $5 million 
               <br />
               you will have to carry as a provincial debt.” 
               <br />
               Naturally the Newfoundland people turned it 
               <br />
               down cold, But Canada balked at $5 million at 
               <br />
               that time. What is the situation today? The situa- 
               <br />
               tion today is that our per capita debt is less than 
               <br />
               $150, that is when you take the sinking fund and 
               <br />
               our cash on hand at the present time, which I hold 
               <br />
               should have been cancelled in 1940-41, but 
               <br />
               granted that it was not cancelled, our total nation-
