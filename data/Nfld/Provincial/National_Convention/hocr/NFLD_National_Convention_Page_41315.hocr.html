               Mr. Fogwill Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, I do 
               <br />
               not intend to take up much time in speaking to 
               <br />
               this resolution. At the onset I wish to make it clear 
               <br />
               that I am in support of it, particularly that part 
               <br />
               relating to the restoration of responsible govern- 
               <br />
               ment. I feel that in responsible government we 
               <br />
               have the best opportunity for the future. It is 
               <br />
               because I am not less interested than you are in 
               <br />
               the future of our country that I feel conﬁdent in 
               <br />
               justifying that statement. Now, sir, before all else, 
               <br />
               I think we must recognise that we are entering a 
               <br />
               new era. Things perhaps will never again be just 
               <br />
               as they were. We are moving out of old condi- 
               <br />
               tions and old social and economic surroundings. 
               <br />
               We are at the crossroads. Let us accept that as a 
               <br />
               fact, as simply and as categorically as we can, and 
               <br />
               let us build our house of the future accordingly. 
               <br />
               It is my conviction that the Newfoundland people 
               <br />
               are about to face a second great test of their 
               <br />
               powers of survival as a separate unit in the British 
               <br />
               Commonwealth. We have to be careful and see 
               <br />
               to it that we are not saddled with a group of 
               <br />
               experimenters and so-called planners with their 
               <br />
               intricate formulas of social and economic 
               <br />
               security under the misguided notion that 
               <br />
               economic security and freedom and liberty are 
               <br />
               one and the same thing. If you were to ask me, on 
               <br />
               what group of our people falls the greatest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re.</span> 
               <br />
               sponsibility for the future well-being of New— 
               <br />
               foundland, I would put my finger on those who 
               <br />
               drudge in the city, town and village, and those 
               <br />
               who toil in the forest, in the mines, on the land 
               <br />
               and upon the sea —- these are the people of labour, 
               <br />
               Mr, Chairman; these are the people who built this 
               <br />
               country, in good times and bad. It was the men 
               <br />
               and women of labour who made our cities, towns 
               <br />
               and villages and serviced them; it is they who 
               <br />

               built our churches and schools and staffed them. 
               <br />
               We are here, Mr. Chairman, representing those 
               <br />
               people, to consider the good and welfare of them 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all.</span> So let us see to it that their faith in democratic 
               <br />
               government is not injured — and when we speak 
               <br />
               of faith, I say that faith can be applied to the 
               <br />
               events, problems and controversies of modern 
               <br />
               living, especially in the field of industry and the 
               <br />
               relationships of business and labour. Our prob— 
               <br />
               lem is to restore human affairs in this country to 
               <br />
               a satisfactory state without sacriﬁcing the essen- 
               <br />
               tial framework of our way of life. To save what 
               <br />
               is good in our present economy based on a 
               <br />
               legitimate proﬁt motive and the natural right of 
               <br />
               private ownership, we must ﬁrst get to know 
               <br />
               entwining abuses, and then be prepared to cut 
               <br />
               those abuses away. What is basically good in this 
               <br />
               country of ours must be thoughtfully and con~ 
               <br />
               scientiously observed in the face of sceptical and 
               <br />
               perhaps muddled thinking —— that will take time 
               <br />
               and study, and study takes time and sacriﬁce. We 
               <br />
               must prepare, as any alert businessman would do 
               <br />
               to save a going concern, to sacriﬁce whatever 
               <br />
               does not contribute to the general good. The 
               <br />
               Newfoundland people must be careful in their 
               <br />
               consideration of their domestic problems. I feel 
               <br />
               confident, Mr. Chairman, that the people of New— 
               <br />
               foundland are not going to be prompted by any 
               <br />
               jittery impulse to grasp at some quick social 
               <br />
               formula that promises some kind of a general 
               <br />
               remedy. The toilers of this country will decide in 
               <br />
               their own good time and in their own way without 
               <br />
               any ﬂag-waving speeches and fancy talk from 
               <br />
               anyone. That is the way I look at it, and I believe 
               <br />
               the great majority of our people look upon this 
               <br />
               question in the same way. They will decide for 
               <br />
               themselves. It is quite true that we in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New«</span>
