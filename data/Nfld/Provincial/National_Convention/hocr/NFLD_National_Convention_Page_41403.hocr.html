               Since the suspension of responsible govern- 
               <br />
               ment, Newfoundland, from being an island on the 
               <br />
               edge of the world, has become a station in the 
               <br />
               centre of the world. In peace time this strategic 
               <br />
               position is an enviable circumstance and in war 
               <br />
               time it will be likely to involve an inevitable peril, 
               <br />
               and hence it is imperative to the interest of North 
               <br />
               America that all military bases now here shall 
               <br />
               remain a permanent feature. Here may I mention 
               <br />
               that the disgusting lower rates of pay for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New»</span> 
               <br />
               foundlanders working on their own leased soil,

               are as revolting to me as the colour bar is else- 
               <br />
               where. If and when Newfoundland is returned to 
               <br />
               its own administration, I am certain this state of 
               <br />
               affairs will be rectiﬁed. Finally, may I here ex— 
               <br />
               press the belief that a vigourous opposition in the 
               <br />
               government of any country is essential to true 
               <br />
               democracy. Without the impetus afforded by 
               <br />
               such opposition, not only do leaders lapse into a 
               <br />
               state of dictatorial lethargy, but the voice of the 
               <br />
               minority, and hence the people, fails to be heard.

               <br />
               long run. Throughout the past 20 months I have 
               <br />
               borne in mind this quotation:

               The time has arrived to pronounce that judgement

               Mr. Banﬁeld Mr. Chairman, this resolution is 
               <br />
               one that asks us to recommend two forms of

               government to be submitted to our people in the

               forthcoming referendum. The two forms are 
               <br />
               responsible government and Commission of 
               <br />
               Government. It makes no difference to us here 
               <br />
               what form of government We favour ourselves, 
               <br />
               or what form we prefer. That has nothing to do 
               <br />
               with this resolution. We can favour either one of 
               <br />
               these two forms of government, and still vote for 
               <br />
               this motion to place the two of them before the

               other, and still be in favour of submitting both of 
               <br />
               them to the people for their decision. I do not see, 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, how we can vote against the mo- 
               <br />
               tion. It is not as though we were called upon to 
               <br />
               express our own personal wishes, or our own 
               <br />
               personal likes and dislikes in the matter. We are 
               <br />
               only called upon to vote in favour of submitting 
               <br />
               these two forms of government to the people, and 
               <br />
               I suppose the motion will receive the unanimous 
               <br />
               support of the whole Convention.

               We tried responsible government before. In 
               <br />
               fact we had it for 80 years, and where did it land 
               <br />
               us? Our people know where it landed them — it 
               <br />
               landed them on the dole, it landed them on six 
               <br />
               cents a day. All I can say about responsible 
               <br />
               government, Mr. Chairman, is “once bitten, 
               <br />
               twice shy”. Responsible government, sir, landed 
               <br />
               our people on six cents a day, and Commission 
               <br />
               of Government kept them on six cents a day. We 
               <br />
               must not forget that fact... We had the six cent 
               <br />
               dole for three years before Commission of 
               <br />
               Government came, but we also had it long after 
               <br />
               Commission came. In fact, we had the six cents 
               <br />
               dole for six years after the Commission of 
               <br />
               Government came. We must not forget, sir, that 
               <br />
               six years after Commission came, we still had 
               <br />
               40—50,000 of our unfortunate people on the dole. 
               <br />
               They were still on the dole right up to the out— 
               <br />
               break of the war, and in fact for some time after 
               <br />
               the war broke out. It was not until the war was on 
               <br />
               for almost two whole years that the dole began to 
               <br />
               disappear, when Canadian and American money 
               <br />
               began to pour in here to build the bases.

               People who do not like the thought of respon-

               did, but it is just as true that we had it under 
               <br />
               Commission as well. With my own eyes, sir, I 
               <br />
               have seen the Commission government refuse
