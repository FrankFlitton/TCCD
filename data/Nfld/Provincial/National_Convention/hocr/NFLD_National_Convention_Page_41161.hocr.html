               By confederation Canada is again attempting

               to recover the situation in which it ﬁnds itself as

               a result of the grant of the United States bases, 
               <br />
               and as you will appreciate fully, by confederation 
               <br />
               the Canadian government takes the place of the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom government in its dealings with 
               <br />
               the United States arising out of the bases deal. 
               <br />
               Canada further attempted to repair the damage 
               <br />
               done by the grant of sovereignty of part of New- 
               <br />
               foundland to the United States, by the appoint- 
               <br />
               ment of Mr. Charles Burchell K.C. as High 
               <br />
               Commissioner to Newfoundland, constituting 
               <br />
               the first political or diplomatic connection 
               <br />
               Canada has had with the island. This ofﬁce is 
               <br />
               being continued and we still have here a High 
               <br />
               Commissioner for Canada, as well as a Trade 
               <br />
               Commissioner. One of Mr. Burchell’s ﬁrst acts 
               <br />
               was the securing of a 99-year lease to the areas at 
               <br />
               Goose Bay, and in the same year, 1941, the title 
               <br />
               to the land required for the airport at Torbay. I 
               <br />
               will say, in fairness to Mr. Burchell, that the 
               <br />
               leased land at Labrador is under an entirely dif- 
               <br />
               ferent agreement than this bases <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lease...</span> As far 
               <br />
               as Goose Bay is concerned Newfoundland cus—

               toms duties apply, and I think we have to thank 
               <br />
               Mr. Burchell for that. Gentlemen, that is the

               Mr. Smallwood Point of order. Is it in order for

               a member of this Convention instead of in a

               <br />
               was quoting from a book, without naming the 
               <br />
               author as he did on Friday. I can quote the words

               I am not prepared to say that such a union 
               <br />
               would not be a good thing for Newfoundland, but 
               <br />
               I do say that before Newfoundland should decide 
               <br />
               on such a union the matter would have to be much 
               <br />
               more thoroughly investigated than it has been up 
               <br />
               to the present time. I believe the delegation that 
               <br />
               went to Ottawa has gone a long way in its ex- 
               <br />
               ploratory talks, but I am far from convinced that 
               <br />
               it has gone sufﬁciently far, or was sufﬁciently 
               <br />
               competent to make a recommendation to the 
               <br />
               people that federal union with Canada is the best 
               <br />
               solution for Newfoundland. I say that quite sin- 
               <br />
               cerely, because if I was convinced that con- 
               <br />
               federation was the best solution for 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, no matter what my personal feel- 
               <br />
               ing would be, I would vote for it. At the present 
               <br />
               time all I can say is that it has sufﬁcient promise 
               <br />
               to bear further investigation. Now as I said ear-
