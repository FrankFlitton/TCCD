               <br />
               it will never be converted into dollars. that I feel 
               <br />
               like saying as little as I can humanly say on that 
               <br />
               point, as to how the sterling will be converted into 
               <br />
               dollars and by whom. l will say this, that l have 
               <br />
               no doubt whatever that our sterling. that part <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 
               <br />
               our accumulated surplus that now lies in sterling 
               <br />
               or will lie in sterling at the time of union. will be 
               <br />
               converted into dollars; because, as Major Cashin 
               <br />
               points out, the Government of Canada agrees to 
               <br />
               receive on deposit from Newfoundland at 2 5/8% 
               <br />
               interest, only the part of the surplus in dollars... 
               <br />
               It is important therefore, that the sterling be con- 
               <br />
               verted to dollars. I have no doubt, none at all, that 
               <br />
               that will be done. I don’t want to say more than 
               <br />
               that, and furthermore I am not going to be forced
