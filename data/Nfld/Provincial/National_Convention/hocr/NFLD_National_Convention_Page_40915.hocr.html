               Mr. Smallwood Sir, speaking on that, we have

               two documents picked and inserted in the Report

               together. There has been a process of selection 
               <br />
               carried out by the Government of Canada. If the 
               <br />
               other document, the one which Mr. Ballam, Mr. 
               <br />
               Higgins and I received, is tabled, let it be tabled,

               <br />
               tion. Ofﬁcials are hired men, they are civil
