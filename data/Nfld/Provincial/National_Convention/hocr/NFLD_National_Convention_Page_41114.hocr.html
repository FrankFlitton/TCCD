               <br />
               point we, in this country, import most of our 
               <br />
               clothing, food and machinery from abroad. Last 
               <br />
               year we imported from other countries, apart 
               <br />
               from Canada, $31 million worth of goods. I have 
               <br />
               assumed that our imports will be reduced from 
               <br />
               other countries other than Canada, and I have 
               <br />
               assumed that the ﬁgure of $20 million will be 
               <br />
               reasonable After all, we have got to sell our 
               <br />
               produce in the world. We have got to sell it to 
               <br />
               England and Spain and Italy, and to Portugal and 
               <br />
               the West Indies and the United States. Surely 
               <br />
               goodness, you can’t expect Newfoundland to sell 
               <br />
               all her goods to other people and import all her 
               <br />
               needs and wants from the mainland of Canada. 
               <br />
               We can‘t expect to sell everything to other people 
               <br />
               and import everything from Canada. I think our 
               <br />
               reasonable imports from Canada would be $20 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood Yes, import duty free. What we 
               <br />
               usually call customs import duty, ad valorem and 
               <br />
               speciﬁc rates when they come into the country. 
               <br />
               There will be none of that on goods coming in 
               <br />
               from Canada. On that $43 million that we brought 
               <br />
               in last year, or $86 million if you like, it will be 
               <br />
               without paying any import duty. Mr. Fogwill says 
               <br />
               when he was working out this table, “Yes, that’s 
               <br />
               true, therefore as everything would come in duty 
               <br />
               free, we will bring in more than we have in the 
               <br />
               past”, and he begins to ﬁgure how much more. 
               <br />
               He says, “Last year we brought in $30 million 
               <br />
               from the rest of the world, I wonder how much 
               <br />
               we would bring in under confederation?” He says 
               <br />
               he will lop off $1 1 million. He says we will bring 
               <br />
               in $20 million from the rest of the world, and $1 1 
               <br />
               million of this $31 million we will bring in from 
               <br />
               Canada. So that it will be this: $54 million we 
               <br />
               would bring in from Canada, and $20 million 
               <br />
               from the rest of the world. Now what I want to 
               <br />
               know is, and he has based his table on that 50% 
               <br />
               and the $30 million, what I want to know is this: 
               <br />
               is that a guess, and if so, is it based on something 
               <br />
               fairly concrete? Because I will confess that I am 
               <br />
               absolutely stumped when I come to try and ﬁgure 
               <br />
               exactly what the proportion of these imports 
               <br />
               under confederation will come in from Canada, 
               <br />
               and what proportion will come in from the rest of 
               <br />
               the world. I am not sufﬁcient of a trader, I don’t 
               <br />
               know the trade of this country. I can’t, for in- 
               <br />
               stance, say, “Microphones, where do they come 
               <br />
               from — Canada or the United States?” I can’t say 
               <br />
               whether it would pay to bring them in from the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom, or Canada or the United States. 
               <br />
               I don’t know enough about the trading practices 
               <br />
               of our country. I doubt if Mr. Fogwill does. He 
               <br />
               says last year we brought in $31 million worth 
               <br />
               from the rest of the world, but under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confedera»</span> 
               <br />
               tion it will be $20 million. How does he get that? 
               <br />
               Otherwise we can’t accept his ﬁgure. How does 
               <br />
               he arrive at that?
