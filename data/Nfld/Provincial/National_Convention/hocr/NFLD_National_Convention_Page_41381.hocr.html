               Time does not permit of a prolonged disserta- 
               <br />
               tion upon how men, by a slow process, arrived at 
               <br />
               the point of thinking in terms of democracy as we 
               <br />
               know it today. But brieﬂy let us refresh our minds 
               <br />
               with regard to certain essential points. James I of 
               <br />
               England, like the Tudors before him, believed in 
               <br />
               the divine right of kings; in other words, the right 
               <br />
               to govern and regulate the actions of mankind 
               <br />
               was a right divinely bestowed. The Tudor 
               <br />
               monarchs claimed this divine right of supremacy 
               <br />
               over the lives of their fellow men, and so did 
               <br />
               James I, but unlike the previous kings he at- 
               <br />
               tempted to justify this claim to sovereignty by an 
               <br />
               appeal to the will of God as revealed in the 
               <br />
               Scripture, and as manifested in the order of na- 
               <br />
               ture. The conclusions he arrives at are summed 
               <br />
               up at the end of his book, The True law of Free 
               <br />
               Monarchies, 1598. These are his words: “The 
               <br />
               King is overlord of the whole land. In the Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment (which is nothing else but the Head Court 
               <br />
               of the King and his vassals) the laws are but 
               <br />
               craved by his subjects.” You will remember how 
               <br />
               in trying to defend this philosophy one Stuart 
               <br />
               king lost his head, and another was deposed and 
               <br />
               banished.

               The idea was growing amongst men that an 
               <br />
               elected parliament was more than a mere craver 
               <br />
               of laws — they were the cravers of the laws and 
               <br />
               framers of statutes as expressed by the will of the 
               <br />
               people. Thomas Hobbes in his book Leviathan 
               <br />
               said — whereas James claimed sovereignty from 
               <br />
               God, Hobbes goes a step further towards present— 
               <br />
               day thinking. He saw clearly that the divine right 
               <br />
               doctrine was a bankrupt trouble-maker, but he 
               <br />
               saw equally clearly that some person or persons 
               <br />
               not only do claim sovereignty, but must do so if 
               <br />
               society is not to disintegrate. However, he argues, 
               <br />
               sovereign power must be absolute. There must be

               John Locke, who tried to defend the revolu-

               tion in England of 1688, rests his defence on the 
               <br />
               grounds that government depends upon the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con~</span> 
               <br />
               sent of the people. “There is”, he says, “a contract 
               <br />
               between the government and the people. If the 
               <br />
               government violates this contract, revolution is 
               <br />
               justiﬁed.” Both Locke and Rousseau —— Locke in 
               <br />
               his book Two Treatises of Government and Rous- 
               <br />
               seau in his Social Contract — claimed that an 
               <br />
               ideal government for any people is one which 
               <br />
               permits self-government by the people, and that 
               <br />
               true self-govemment is the imposition by eaCh 
               <br />
               individual on himself of rules and limitations 
               <br />
               demanded by him of all others. The evolution of 
               <br />
               self-government, however, was slow. It took the 
               <br />
               American Revolution of 1775 and the French 
               <br />
               Revolution of 1789, as well as the teachings of 
               <br />
               Tom Paine and Jeremy Bentham, to instil into 
               <br />

               liamentary reform. These latter writers argued

               that customs, laws, institutions and constitutions 
               <br />
               could be evaluated in terms of one standard only,

               Burke, who wrote about the same time, was 
               <br />
               most conservative, and held that the people 
               <br />
               should draw on the experience and wisdom of the

               <br />
               choice? The test, says Mill, is twofold. First, to 
               <br />
               what extent does a proposed form of government 
               <br />
               make for the moral and intellectual development 
               <br />
               of the people? Secondly, to what extent does it 
               <br />
               make use of the moral and intellectual resources 
               <br />
               at its command? On these grounds, he says, the
