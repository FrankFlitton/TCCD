               Mr. Smallwood I would like to say that it is my 
               <br />
               intention to reply to the speech of Major Cashin 
               <br />
               and, in all probability to other speeches which 
               <br />
               may be made on these terms. But, sir, just when 
               <br />
               I should do it is a matter that has given me a 
               <br />
               considerable amount of concern in the last day or 
               <br />
               two because I happen to be very anxious, very 
               <br />
               eager, that the Convention should ﬁnish its work 
               <br />
               by the end of January, so that the referendum can 
               <br />
               be held this spring. For that reason, if I were to 
               <br />
               reply to the lengthy speech of Major Cashin and 
               <br />
               to speeches made by other members of the Con— 
               <br />
               vention, each one as it is made, it would take a 
               <br />
               considerable amount of time and might prolong 
               <br />
               the Convention beyond the end of January. I do 
               <br />
               not want to take that risk.... What I would like to 
               <br />
               feel a little conﬁdent about is this: after Major 
               <br />
               Cashin has completed his speech, and if some 
               <br />
               other members speak attacking or criticising or 
               <br />
               analysing these terms of confederation, I would 
               <br />
               like to feel conﬁdent that I will have the oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity of replying to them. What I am trying to 
               <br />
               avoid is this: one man after the other attacks the 
               <br />
               confederation terms, criticises them, analyses 
               <br />
               them unfavourably; and then, before I have had 
               <br />
               the opportunity of replying, a closure motion 
               <br />
               could be put and adopted which would strangle 
               <br />
               any opportunity I would have of replying to these 
               <br />
               criticisms. I want very anxiously to avoid delay. 
               <br />
               I want to get out of this Convention by the end of 
               <br />
               January. I would like to see the referendum held 
               <br />
               this Spring. But I do not want to be deprived of 
               <br />
               the chance to reply. I can be deprived by the 
               <br />
               simple means of a closure <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">motion...</span> I think that 
               <br />
               the gentlemen who are critical of these con— 
               <br />
               federation terms and who express their criticisms 
               <br />
               will be gentlemen enough not to bring in that 
               <br />
               closure motion and choke me <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">off...</span> I put my trust 
               <br />
               in them. I put myself at the mercy of their sense 
               <br />
               of justice and fair play. After they have rapped 
               <br />
               the confederation terms. I will be given full, free 
               <br />
               and ample opportunity to reply with the freedom 
               <br />
               of debate in committee of the whole. With that 
               <br />
               understanding, I do not propose to reply to Major 
               <br />
               Cashin when he completes his speech, but rather 
               <br />
               to wait until he and others have completed their 
               <br />

               Mr. Chairman Before I put that motion I 
               <br />
               want to say that I can give no guarantee that you 
               <br />
               will be permitted to speak at any given time; nor 
               <br />
               can I give any guarantee to any member that he 
               <br />
               will be able to speak to any motion at any time... 
               <br />
               I have no authority to decide the number of times 
               <br />
               any member will speak in committee or the 
               <br />
               length of time he will speak on any subject before 
               <br />
               the Chair, as long as he confines himself strictly 
               <br />
               and in a proper manner to the business before the 
               <br />
               Chair. Therefore, if a closure motion is put to me, 
               <br />
               I will have to accept a closure motion at any time; 
               <br />
               with this qualiﬁcation, that I will not accept a 
               <br />
               closure motion without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">notice...</span> And what the 
               <br />
               Chair has to keep in mind, in a closure motion, is 
               <br />
               to make sure that the rights of the minority or the 
               <br />
               rights of members who have not had the oppor— 
               <br />
               tunity to express themselves fully, or at all, upon 
               <br />
               the business before the Chair shall not be 
               <br />
               abridged or taken away by the prompt putting and 
               <br />
               carrying of a closure motion. To put it simply, I 
               <br />
               am not prepared to guarantee to you, Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood, or to any other member here, that he 
               <br />
