               In 1890, when Sir Robert Bond negotiated the 
               <br />
               Bond-Blaine treaty, it was blocked by Canada 
               <br />
               with the concurrence of the British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government.1</span> 
               <br />
               Later, about 15 years ago I believe, when our 
               <br />
               government was negotiating an advantageous 
               <br />
               trade agreement with the West Indies with 
               <br />
               respect to our ﬁsh, this agreement too was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">block»</span> 
               <br />
               ed by Canada; and a few years later the big 
               <br />
               hearted Canadian government descended to 
               <br />
               penny—pinching antics by discontinuing the few 
               <br />
               dollars that they contributed as subsidy to the 
               <br />
               steamer on the Cabot Strait. When Sir Robert 
               <br />
               Bond tried to negotiate the Bond-Blaine treaty, 
               <br />
               which would have meant the economic salvation 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland, it was objected to by Canada, 
               <br />
               and blocked by the interference of the British 
               <br />
               government. The British government has now 
               <br />
               told as that we can no longer expect ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               assistance. This is all right, but may I ask the 
               <br />
               British government one favour, that if they are 
               <br />
               not prepared to help us, will they please in future 
               <br />
               do nothing to hinder us.

               out of that came the War of Independence, and

               Mr. Smallwood I am an unreformed, un- 
               <br />
               regenerate and unrepentant free trader. If this 
               <br />
               country could have free trade with the United 
               <br />
               States, it would be a great thing. If we could have 
               <br />
               free trade with the Dominion of Canada, it would 
               <br />
               be a great thing. If we could have free trade with 
               <br />
               every country in the world, it would be a great 
               <br />
               thing for the people of this country. I believe in 
               <br />
               abolishing every single cent of customs duties. I 
               <br />
               am a believer in bringing down the cost of living. 
               <br />
               The only way I can see to do that is by absolutely 
               <br />
               free trade. Now, if this motion passes, we may get 
               <br />
               a committee of this Convention going to 
               <br />
               Washington. We may.... It may be received by 
               <br />
               the Government of the United States. If it is, they 
               <br />
               could talk about trade and tariffs, and maybe we 
               <br />
               could get some trade with the United States. As 
               <br />
               a free trader and only as a free trader ~— and 
               <br />
               remember that cuts all ways, local industries, 
               <br />
               protected industries that are an imposition on this 
               <br />
               country, will be wiped out, and our people will 
               <br />
               get a chance to live. I am all for our people getting 
               <br />
               a chance to live, and I don’t care if there are a 
               <br />
               dozen or a hundred whose toes will be trod on. I 
               <br />
               am only concerned with the people in this country 
               <br />
               who have never had a break in the 450 years of 
               <br />
               our history. Whenever they poked their head up 
               <br />
               over the stage head, there was someone there to 
               <br />
               kick them down again. Let’s get free trade if we 
               <br />
               are allowed to send a delegation and if they will 
               <br />
               receive one. I will not vote against it.
