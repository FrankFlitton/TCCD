               Now I touch on another point. On page 1 of 
               <br />
               the report, there is set forth a picture of New- 
               <br />
               foundland, a photograph of Newfoundland of the 
               <br />
               last 50 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years,</span> all drawn in one short paragraph. 
               <br />
               What does it show? It says that for the 50 years 
               <br />
               which came to an end last month, September 
               <br />
               1947, the government spent $500 million, and 
               <br />
               took in $496 million, so they had a shortage of $4 
               <br />
               million on current <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">account.</span> But this paragraph 
               <br />
               goes on to say: “If you deduct from the $500 
               <br />
               million that the government spent, $20 million 
               <br />
               that the present government spent on capital ac- 
               <br />
               count since 1935, that brings the total expenditure 
               <br />
               down to $480 million. Thus, with an expenditure 
               <br />
               of $480 million and a revenue of $496 million, 
               <br />
               the government showed a surplus of $15 million, 
               <br />
               or an average of $300,000 a year for the 50 
               <br />
               years.” In other words, if this paragraph is cor- 
               <br />
               rect, what it means is this: that for the last 50 years 
               <br />
               the government has balanced its budget. More 
               <br />
               than that, it has had an average surplus of 
               <br />
               $300,000 a year, so it appears that the Govem- 
               <br />
               ment of Newfoundland came out of it with ﬂying 
               <br />
               colours. Then those of us who remember the 
               <br />
               1920s, and more of us who remember the 1930s 
               <br />
               begin to prick up our ears. We begin to show 
               <br />
               some great interest. If the government balanced 
               <br />
               its budget and showed a surplus, and we remem- 
               <br />
               ber the unemployment of the 19205, and the 
               <br />
               parades of the unemployed, when we remember 
               <br />
               the rock sheds, and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“roads-deluxe",</span> and the 
               <br />
               pit—prop cutting schemes, and the riots, and the 
               <br />
               dole; when we remember 90,000 of our people 
               <br />
               only eight or nine years ago rotting with beri-ben' 
               <br />
               and TB on the dole, when we remember our 
               <br />
               roads, wharves and bridges falling down because 
               <br />
               there was not a dollar to spend on them, when we 
               <br />
               remember the Gethsemane that our people went 
               <br />
               through from 1920 to 1940 roughly, and we are 
               <br />
               told that for these 20 years, and another 30 with 
               <br />
               them, the government not only balanced its 
               <br />
               budget but had a surplus as well, and the people 
               <br />
               at the same time rotting in poverty many of them, 
               <br />
               we begin to wonder — does it matter very much 
               <br />
               to the people of Newfoundland, the ﬁshermen, 
               <br />

               <br />
               matter much to them if they rot in poverty and the 
               <br />

               Of course the truth of the matter is that the 
               <br />
               govemment’s budget was not balanced in those 
               <br />
               50 years. What happened was this: from 1920 to 
               <br />
               1934 the government never, never once took in 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               they did was this: the ﬁnance minister would 
               <br />
               bring down the loan bill, asking the House of 
               <br />
               Assembly to authorise the government to 
               <br />
               authorise him to go out and borrow money and 
               <br />
               in the bill the law required that there had to be

               <br />
               England and borrow $5-6 million and tell them 
               <br />
               frankly and honestly, “This is money that we 
               <br />

               <br />
               that, so they called it “capital account". Always

               <br />
               our public debt is. It says this — If we were to 
               <br />
               take out present public debt, and take off of it 
               <br />
               what we have saved up for sinking fund, and then 
               <br />
               take off of what’s left what we have in accumu- 
               <br />
               lated surplus, take all that off our public debt and 
               <br />
               what we have left is a net debt of $35 million... 
               <br />
               But, they say, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that‘s</span> not so bad, because look

               what we have got to go against it. We have got a

               Railway that’s worth $72 million. Now where did
