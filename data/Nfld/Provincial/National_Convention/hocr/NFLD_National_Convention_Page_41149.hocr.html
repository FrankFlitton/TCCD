               In my opinion, Canada is today in a position 
               <br />
               where she ﬁnds she has overreached herself. She 
               <br />
               reminds me of the frog in the fable who wanted 
               <br />
               to be as big as a bull and who puffed himself up 
               <br />
               until he burst. Canada is an ambitious country 
               <br />
               and in the thirties she got the idea that she wanted 
               <br />
               to become a big nation. She put on long pants 
               <br />
               before she became of age. She wanted an army, 
               <br />
               she wanted a navy and all the trimmings. How 
               <br />
               she might have gotten on if World War II had not 
               <br />
               come along we do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">know.</span> But like other 
               <br />
               countries, the blast of war hit her, and today she 
               <br />
               is left in an exhausted position, struggling for her 
               <br />
               life, and her ﬁnancial bloodstream is fast running 
               <br />
               dry. As I said, she is begging Uncle Sam for 
               <br />
               dollars and her people are on the rocky road of 
               <br />
               austerity....

               I want to apologise for being so long <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discuss</span> 
               <br />
               ing this matter. I felt that it is of such great 
               <br />
               national importance that it required extensive 
               <br />
               study, and during Christmas recess I spent prac- 
               <br />
               tically all my time going into the Black Books 
               <br />
               and particularly the Grey Book. I felt, as a former 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance for Newfoundland, that I 
               <br />
               owed it to you people who sent me here, par- 
               <br />
               ticularly the District of St. John’s West because 
               <br />
               when they elected me I told them that I would not 
               <br />
               let them down, and I am not going to let them 
               <br />
               down now. I felt I had to make a complete study 
               <br />
               with no one bothering me in order to work out 
               <br />
               these ﬁgures which I have given, and I have come 
               <br />
               to the conclusions which I have already given to 
               <br />
               the house and the country, which I elaborated on 
               <br />
               yesterday.... I have lived in Canada and worked 
               <br />
               there from coast to coast. I like Canada, it is a 
               <br />
               great country, but after living and working there, 
               <br />
               I want to give it as an honest opinion, that if 
               <br />
               confederation were good for Newfoundland 
               <br />
               there would not be a stronger supporter of it in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland today, but I am honest in my 
               <br />
               opinion when I say that confederation will be the 
               <br />
               worst thing that ever struck <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland”.</span> 
               <br />
               Canada is in a worse position ﬁnancially than 
               <br />
               Newfoundland... We are not begging for dollars, 
               <br />
               all we are trying to do is keep people from 
               <br />
               plundering our treasury. We can sympathise with

               <br />
               power and efforts to wrest from Newfoundland 
               <br />
               this particular part of Labrador, together with its 
               <br />
               great undeveloped waterpower? Don’t let us

               <br />

               <br />
               Don’t let us get that idea in our heads, because if 
               <br />
               the agreement made by our government in 1933 
               <br />
               with the British government can be converted 
               <br />
               into a scrap of paper, if the Atlantic Charter 
               <br />
               signed in our own Placentia Bay can become 
               <br />
               equally worthless, what dependence do you think 
               <br />
               we can place in a mere decision of the Privy 
               <br />
               Council? Let us remember that there are more 
               <br />
               ways than one of skinning a cat. Why, I myself 
               <br />
               can think of three different ways at least right 
               <br />
               now, whereby Canada can usher us out of our 
               <br />
               Labrador territory, regardless of any Privy Coun- 
               <br />
               cil, if we were to unite with Canada and become 
               <br />
               the tenth province. It is contained in this Grey 
               <br />
               Book, and it is in there for that purpose. I quoted 
               <br />
               that yesterday, that within a period of eight years 
               <br />
               a royal commission, a royal farce, like they had 
               <br />
               here in 1933, would come and ﬁnd that the 
               <br />
               country is bankrupt and say, “We are going to 
               <br />
               take this”, and I am convinced that, in the minds 
               <br />
               of some of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">promonfederates</span> today is the

               summarise brieﬂy the meaning of all that I have
