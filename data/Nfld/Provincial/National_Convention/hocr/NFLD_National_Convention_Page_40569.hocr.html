               Mr. Job On the eve of your departure for 
               <br />
               England, I am going to express the hope once

               more that that very important matter of our rela— 
               <br />
               tions with the United States of America he not 
               <br />
               forgotten. I may be a little persistent with this, but 
               <br />
               I feel if it is forgotten it would be a rather serious 
               <br />
               matter. The Commission of Government seem to 
               <br />
               be inclined to discard what I think is a very vital 
               <br />
               question, and I fear we are already being faced 
               <br />
               with the results of that inaction.

               When we met the Commission of Government 
               <br />
               as a delegation, one of the things we discussed 
               <br />
               with them was the question of trade and tariffs. 
               <br />
               They pushed it aside. I think they were wrong in 
               <br />
               the stand they took. I hope when this delegation 
               <br />
               gets to England they will bear that question in 
               <br />
               mind and will not allow it to be pushed aside. It 
               <br />
               is a vital question for Newfoundland I feel if they

               try and impress upon the British government the

               lets. They have purchased from our competitors 
               <br />
               quite a large quantity of ﬁllets and we, her ward, 
               <br />
               have been neglected. The reason is exchange 
               <br />
               rates. They pay for the Norwegian ﬁllets in 
               <br />
               pounds, shillings, and pence, but would have to 
               <br />
               pay us in dollars. They have purchased a large 
               <br />
               quantity from our competitors, we are still 
               <br />
               without orders from them, and we are unable to 
               <br />
               sell at the present time in the United States at a 
               <br />
               price which will enable us to give the ﬁshermen 
               <br />
               of this country a fair price. I hope that this vital

               question will not be forgotten on the trip to 
               <br />
