               Now Major Cashin, in referring to Canada’s 
               <br />
               great old age pension scheme, and her pensions 
               <br />
               to the blind, says, in the ﬁrst place, that the old 
               <br />
               age pensions are paid only to paupers, and second 
               <br />
               that before they can get the pension they must 
               <br />
               turn their property over to the government. Well, 
               <br />
               he is completely wrong on both points. The old 
               <br />
               age pension is not given only to paupers, but it is 
               <br />
               provided that a person may have his own private 
               <br />
               income of $240 a year, and still get the full 
               <br />
               pension of $30 a month, or $360 a year. A married 
               <br />
               couple can have a private income of $360 a year 
               <br />
               between them and still get the full pension of 
               <br />
               $720 a year between them, and even if a person 
               <br />
               has more than $240 a year of private income he 
               <br />
               can still get the pension. If he has $10 a year more 
               <br />
               than the $240 allowed, it only means taking the 
               <br />
               $10 off the amount of the pension. He is allowed 
               <br />
               a total of $600 a year altogether, putting the 
               <br />
               pension and his private income <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">together....</span> As for 
               <br />
               having to turn their property over to the govem-

               simply is not true. Let me see if I can make this 
               <br />
               matter very simple, so that everyone in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New«</span> 
               <br />
               foundland will understand. Let us suppose some 
               <br />
               old age pensioner dies, leaving his widow behind 
               <br />
               (I mean under confederation), and he has a little 
               <br />
               property. The property falls to this widow, and 
               <br />
               she goes on getting her old age pension of $30 a 
               <br />
               month as long as she lives. Then she dies. What 
               <br />
               happens to the property then? It can be left to 
               <br />
               anyone in the family or out of the family, anyone 
               <br />
               the pensioner wishes to leave it to, if the property 
               <br />
               is worth $2,000 or less. And remember this: the 
               <br />
               value is not what that property would be worth in 
               <br />
               St. John’s, or Grand Falls, or Comer Brook, but 
               <br />
               right in the settlement where it is. That means that 
               <br />
               nine properties out of ten would fetch less than 
               <br />
               $2,000 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cash,</span> Maybe one out of ten might fetch 
               <br />
               over $2,000 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cash,</span> If the property is worth over 
               <br />
               $2,000, what happens to it when the pensioner 
               <br />
               dies? Well, if some relative or anybody else has 
               <br />
               contributed regularly to the pensioner’s support 
               <br />
               the property can fall to him or her, and he would 
               <br />
               have a good right to it, or she would. It may be a 
               <br />
               grandson, son or nephew, or anyone else, who 
               <br />
               had contributed to the support of the pensioner 
               <br />
               for the last three years of the pensioner’ 3 life. But 
               <br />
               suppose that nobody has helped out the older 
               <br />
               person for those three years, and suppose it is 
               <br />
               worth over $2,000 net in that settlement, what 
               <br />
               happens then? The government steps in and gets 
               <br />
               back what it had paid out in pension before the 
               <br />
               pensioner’s death. So if a man has an old father 
               <br />
               and mother getting $30 a month each in old age 
               <br />
               pension, and if the old people have property 
               <br />
               which would fetch over $2,000 cash in that set- 
               <br />
               tlement if sold, and he wants to come in for the 
               <br />
               property he knows what to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do,</span> All he has to do is 
               <br />
               to contribute regularly and reasonably towards 
               <br />
               the support of his old father and mother, and then 
               <br />
               if the property is worth over $2,000 it will fall to 
               <br />
               him, and as I said, if the property is worth $2,000 
               <br />
               or less then the pensioner can leave it to anyone 
               <br />
               he likes, though of course under the law he must 
               <br />
               leave it to his widow if she is a pensioner as well, 
               <br />
               and as every member in this Convention knows 
               <br />
               just as well as I do, it’s got to be a pretty good 
               <br />
               property in most parts of this country to be worth 
               <br />
               over $2,000 net. 
               <br />
