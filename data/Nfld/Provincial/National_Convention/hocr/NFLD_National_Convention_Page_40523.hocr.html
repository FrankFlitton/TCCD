               The Labrador ore is a higher grade, about 60 - 
               <br />
               65%, while that of Bell Island is about 50 - 52%.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The price of ore is based on 50% iron, and for any 
               <br />
               units over 50% iron they get lOcents a unit. If the 
               <br />
               ore averages 50% iron for $5 a ton, another 20 
               <br />
               units would make it $6.50. I take it that that 
               <br />
               Labrador ore is based on that. The value of the

               Mr. Vardy Without holding up the motion at all

               it has been stated that on the basis of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">produc~</span>

               tion of one million tons, which was last year’s

               figure, we could not seem to reconcile the fact

               that the company would be paying out this year 
               <br />
               $4 million in wages, when it was stated that the 
               <br />
               export value of the ore was $2.55. The facts are 
               <br />
               that they contemplated exporting to Sydney 
               <br />
               750,000 tons and to the United Kingdom from 
               <br />
               750,000 to 1 million tons. That is anywhere from 
               <br />
               1.5 million tons up. If you take it and multiply it 
               <br />
               by $2.55 you will get $3.8 million, they will be

               <br />
               after the company to find out the export value, 
               <br />
               they agreed on a set export value to be placed on 
               <br />
               the ore so that they would come pretty near the
