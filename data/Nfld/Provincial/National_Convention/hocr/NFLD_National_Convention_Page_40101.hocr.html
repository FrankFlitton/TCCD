               Now we come to saw mills, of which there are 
               <br />
               over 800 scattered all over the country, and which 
               <br />
               mills produce over 50 million feet of lumber

               no great importance, but when it is considered 
               <br />

               <br />
               to $2 million annually, they become worthy of 
               <br />
               real consideration. I am informed, however, that 
               <br />
               in connection with these mills there are many 
               <br />
               millions of feet of lumber sawn on which the

               <br />

               that great unknown, unexplored 110,000 square 
               <br />
               miles awarded us by the decision of the Privy 
               <br />
               Council in 1927. As yet, we have only scratched 
               <br />
               the surface of this territory, but our search has 
               <br />
               brought to light what may one day be regarded as 
               <br />
               one of the greatest single deposits of high-grade 
               <br />
               iron ore in the western hemisphere. I am, and 
               <br />
               have always been convinced, that the potential 
               <br />
               riches of the Labrador are beyond our most op— 
               <br />
               timistic dreams and that in that part of our ter- 
               <br />
               ritory alone we have the guarantee of a permanent 
               <br />
               national security. Although we have had this ter- 
               <br />
               ritory under our sovereignty since 1927, a large 
               <br />
               number of our people seem to act as if they were 
               <br />
               unaware of its existence. In view of this it is not 
               <br />
               surprising that my fellow delegate, 
               <br />
               Rev. Mr. Burry, has found it necessary to make 
               <br />
               us Labrador-conscious and to drive home the 
               <br />
               point that when we speak of Newfoundland we 
               <br />
               must include under that term Newfoundland- 
               <br />
               Labrador. But, in speaking of Labrador, there is 
               <br />
               a possibility that I may be regarded as being 
               <br />
               prejudiced or talking for political reasons. So 
               <br />
               then, let me tell you what outsiders and par-

               As stated in the report, the quantity of timber 
               <br />
               available on the Labrador is as yet unknown. 
               <br />
               However, estimates give it as from 50 to 100

               million cords. All this timber is suitable for either

               sition should materialise the virgin forests of the

               Labrador would ensure a constant and steady 
               <br />
               supply of raw material and such a venture should 
               <br />
               give additional employment to at least 1,000 men 
               <br />
               and an annual payroll of another $1.5 million.

               It is admitted that the timber areas of Labrador

               are the last available virgin forests on the east

               submit, Mr. Chairman, that the overall picture of 
               <br />
               our forest industry is one bright with hope and 
               <br />
               encouragement, and a clear denial to those who 
               <br />
               would say that our country is lacking in the 
               <br />
               fundamentals which go to the making of a rich 
               <br />
               and prosperous people. I am aware that we have 
               <br />
               other resources and industries which offer as 
               <br />
               bright or even a more promising future. As you 
               <br />
               will note from the summary of the report, there 
               <br />
               are at the present time some 14,000 people 
               <br />
               engaged in this industry, with a total earning 
               <br />
               power of some $16 million annually. These 
               <br />
               figures speak eloquently for themselves; and as
