               <br />
               out that our total expenditures were $25 million, 
               <br />

               fair! Mr. Chairman, if we turn to the Economic

               Report which Mr. Smallwood took so much 
               <br />

               expenditure for education of $5.75 million and 
               <br />

               <br />
               Smallwood was a member of that committee <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-—</span> 
               <br />
               the importance was stressed of an increased vote 
               <br />
               for education, and it is generally acknowledged 
               <br />
               throughout the country today that we must make 
               <br />
               every effort to advance the education of our 
               <br />
               children. Yet, right here in these estimates, under 
               <br />
               a provincial government, Mr. Smallwood tells us 
               <br />
               in so many words that we should decrease that 
               <br />
               vote; that we should not build more schools for 
               <br />
               our children and our teachers are not entitled to 
               <br />
               any additional remuneration. Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               may not have that programme actually in mind. 
               <br />
               He might have this one: in Canada, in practically 
               <br />
               every province, a school tax is imposed on the 
               <br />
               people. Mr. Smallwood may have in mind the 
               <br />
               raising of that additional $750,000 annually for 
               <br />
               education through additional taxation. The 
               <br />
               people must be taxed additionally, if we are to 
               <br />
               keep up the present annual educational grant. 
               <br />
               This would mean that in the various towns and 
               <br />
               villages all over Newfoundland, unless the 
               <br />
               people are agreeable to further taxation, they 
               <br />
               cannot have their present educational facilities.

               Now let us look at the Department of Public 
               <br />
               Health and Welfare. The estimates of expendi- 
               <br />
               ture for the present year under our present form 
               <br />
               of government amount to approximately $6.25 
               <br />
               million. In addition large amounts are being spent 
               <br />
               in the construction of hospitals which will con— 
               <br />
               tinue to increase our expenses for upkeep. Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood lops a cool $1 million off this amount 
               <br />
               and makes his estimate something over $5.1 mil- 
               <br />
               lion. This Public Health and Welfare Department 
               <br />
               was one on which considerable controversy took 
               <br />
               place. I have a personal interest not alone in the 
               <br />
               country, but particularly in Ferryland; and in 
               <br />
               recent weeks, I am informed, a very serious acci- 
               <br />
               dent took place in that settlement and there was 
               <br />
               no nurse and no doctor there. If we go back to 40 
               <br />
               or 50 years ago, Trepassey had a doctor, Fer— 
               <br />
               ryland had a doctor, Bay Bulls had a doctor. Now 
               <br />
               we have no nurse, nothing. I say now, as a former 
               <br />
               representative of that district, that it has been 
               <br />
               done deliberately by the Commission of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govemn</span> 
               <br />
               ment. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               If we turn again to the Economic Report, we 
               <br />
               will ﬁnd that in our proposed programme, which 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood ridiculed, we forecast an annual 
               <br />
               expenditure of $6.25 million; whilst, in addition, 
               <br />
               we set aside from our anticipated surplus an 
               <br />
               additional $1 million to be devoted to the purpose 
               <br />
               of old age pensions, unemployment insurance 
               <br />
               and additional social service.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               If we turn to the Black Books again, we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that the reductions in expenditure made by Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood eliminate over $800,000 in the form 
               <br />
               of assistance to indigents, allowances to widows 
               <br />
               and orphans and maintenance of hospitals. Just 
               <br />
               imagine, Mr. Chairman, our poor unfortunate 
               <br />
               widows and orphans will be deprived of the mite 
               <br />
               which they have been receiving under our own 
               <br />
               government; the maintenance of hospitals will be 
               <br />
               reduced, whilst we know it is increasing in cost. 
               <br />
               Again, Mr. Smallwood may have in the back of 
               <br />
               his head the idea of further taxation in the form 
               <br />
               of hospital tax as well as‘ municipal tax for the 
               <br />
               poor. He certainly knows that in many provinces 
               <br />
               of Canada the people are taxed speciﬁcally for 
               <br />
               the maintenance of hospitals. In the city of 
               <br />
               Montreal, a 5% tax is collected on all meals 
               <br />
               served in hotels and restaurants for the purpose 
               <br />
               of maintaining hospitals. Also the citizens are 
               <br />
               speciﬁcally taxed to take care of the poor. Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood may not have the idea of decreasing 
               <br />
