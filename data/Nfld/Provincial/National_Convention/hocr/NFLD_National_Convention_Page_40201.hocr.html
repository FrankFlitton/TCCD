               document of 143 foolscap pages, covering the

               Thus 2,000 miles motorable, 3,000 miles local, 
               <br />
               total, 5,000 miles. Of the 5,000 miles in the

               mission of Government came. That government 
               <br />
               has spent on new road construction $2 million;

               of new road machinery and equipment. We ﬁnd
