               Mr. Bradley I am going to make a comparison 
               <br />
               of the economy of the country without a war 
               <br />
               period and with a war period. I repeat that for the 
               <br />
               50 years which ended in 1939 the government 
               <br />
               spent a total of $306,800,000. There are a few odd 
               <br />
               thousand dollars which I have not included, be- 
               <br />
               cause I did not see much necessity of it, and in 
               <br />
               that respect I have followed the methods of the 
               <br />
               Committee itself. That then was their revenue — 
               <br />
               $306,800,000. But capital expenditures made by 
               <br />
               the Commission of Government in the years from 
               <br />
               1934 to 1947 is added, and so then in the years of 
               <br />
               Commission which come within my period, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">namely</span> the capital expenditures from 1934 to

               Now I admit quite frankly thatI have not been 
               <br />
               able to estimate the amount of such capital ex- 
               <br />
               penditure accurately from the report. I would 
               <br />
               judge it to be around <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">234-5</span> million, but I will be 
               <br />
               generous in the matter. In my period, Commis- 
               <br />
               sion was in ofﬁce about ﬁve years only. In the 
               <br />
               period taken by the report, they were in office 13 
               <br />
               years. It is obviously fair to say that their capital 
               <br />
               expenditures were much greater in the last eight 
               <br />
               years of their term when they had vastly greater 
               <br />
               revenues and heavy surpluses. Therefore, if the 
               <br />
               expenditure on capital account in the whole 13 
               <br />
               years of Commission was $20 million, the first 
               <br />
               ﬁve years, which was all that my period of 50 
               <br />
               years include, would not account for more than 
               <br />
               $7 million. Deduct this $7 million from the total 
               <br />
               expenditure of $306 million and we get a net 
               <br />
               expenditure during that period and up to the 
               <br />
               beginning of the war of $299.8, say $300 million 
               <br />
               in round ﬁgures. In that same period they had a 
               <br />
               total revenue of roundly $280 million. Therefore, 
               <br />
               in the 50 years ending in 1939 they fell $20 
               <br />
               million short of meeting expenses on ordinary 
               <br />
               account. That is to say, they ended the half cen- 
               <br />
               tury with not a surplus but a deﬁcit of $20 million.

               Then came the war, six years of it, and two

               years not of peace, but of armistice and armed 
               <br />
               watchfulness. Prices soared to unprecedented

               By 1947 that deﬁcit of $20 million on ordinary 
               <br />
               account in 1939, has become a surplus of $15 
               <br />
               million in 1947. Our position from a governmen- 
               <br />
               tal standpoint was improved in eight short years 
               <br />
               by roughly $35 million. What was the cause of 
               <br />
               this providential change in our govemment’s 
               <br />
               position? The war? Not at all, says the committee. 
               <br />
               Making every allowance, they say, 
               <br />
               for the momentum (whatever that may mean) 
               <br />
               of war expenditures carrying on after the 
               <br />
               close of hostilities, and allowing for the 
               <br />
               gradual recession of this boom period, it is 
               <br />
               yet an obvious fact, that our present revenues 
               <br />
               cannot be something dependent on war 
               <br />
               boom. There must be some other cause, and 
               <br />
               on examining the matter further we found 
               <br />
               that a great portion of our present revenue is 
               <br />
               coming to us because of growth of our main 
               <br />
               industries.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               It would be relevant, sir, to have set out some 
               <br />
               of the details of that growth. But we haven’t got 
               <br />
               it. And is the present price of some $14 per 
               <br />
               quintal for shore ﬁsh to have none of the credit 
               <br />
               when we recollect that in the immediate pre-war 
               <br />
               years it fetched about $5 only? And so this 
               <br />
               Economic Report asks us to believe, and what is 
               <br />
               more important asks this country to believe, that 
               <br />
               present revenues are due to anything but war. 
               <br />
               Such, sir, is the optimistic assumption of the 
               <br />
               committee. That assumption will be received by 
               <br />
               the people of Newfoundland, I fear, with amused 
               <br />
               incredulity. They know the difference between 
               <br />
               $14 and $5. They are watching, watching with 
               <br />
               anxious hearts, for the ﬁrst indication of a break 
               <br />
               in price.

               We have heard a great deal in this Convention, 
               <br />
               sir, about the desirability and the possibility of 
               <br />
               getting the Government of the United States to 
               <br />
               grant to Newfoundland some kind of special 
               <br />
               trade concession. The idea has been repeatedly 
               <br />
               expressed that this concession might take the 
               <br />
               form of special low customs tariff rates on our 
               <br />
               ﬁsh or ﬁsh products entering that country. Such 
               <br />
               special concessions would, of course, prove to be 
               <br />
               a very great value to our fishing industry, and 
               <br />
               therefore to the whole <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> But what are the 
               <br />
               practical possibilities of our getting such a special 
               <br />
               concession from the United States? I used the 
               <br />
               word “special” advisedly. To be of any real value
