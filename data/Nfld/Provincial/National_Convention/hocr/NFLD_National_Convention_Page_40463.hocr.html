               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. Ashbourne Not as far as I am aware. They

               <br />
               they also practice in the other localities around. I 
               <br />

               you would like to have the names of the doctors

               Mr. McCormack It was mentioned about dis- 
               <br />
               trict nurses; and on page 10 it says, “304 nurses, 
               <br />
               or one for each 1,046 of the population.” It should 
               <br />
               not be necessary for me to call attention to the 
               <br />
               fact that the people of Trepasscy and that vicinity 
               <br />
               are in urgent need of a nurse. They have quite a 
               <br />
               population and are isolated all winter and I have 
               <br />
               been trying to get a nurse installed there for some 
               <br />
               time but could not do so. Those people have no 
               <br />
               doctor or nurse, and over all Conception Bay 
               <br />
               there are a lot of nurses in a section connected 
               <br />
               with the city by railroad and taxis all winter.

               Mr. Burry It is true that this Committee found

               there was a shortage of doctors, and when the
