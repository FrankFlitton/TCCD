               <br />
               we are in for bad times — we may be. That is a

               if it is the conviction of a member that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> for

               <br />

               <br />

               have to accept that. Mr. Banfield says the ﬁshery

               ten years. Do we want the people to accept that

               Economic Report based on facts, or does Mr.

               Mr. Chairman If you do not mind, I have per- 
               <br />
               mitted a certain amount of latitude in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">connec»</span> 
               <br />
               tion. In fact I might very well and very properly 
               <br />
               be accused of permitting too much latitude. I 
               <br />
               want members to remember that the expression 
               <br />
               of outside opinion to them is one thing, and must 
               <br />
               not be confused with expressions of opinion by 
               <br />
               members on matters before the Chair, which is 
               <br />
               something entirely different. Therefore I have to 
               <br />
               state that I cannot concern myself with anything 
               <br />
               that happens outside the House and therefore I do 
               <br />
               not propose to allow expressions of opinion 
               <br />
               originating outside the House, in permanent form 
               <br />
               or otherwise, to have any hearing at all upon the 
               <br />
               deliberations of the House. The only thing with 
               <br />
               which I am concerned is to ensure that members 
               <br />
               shall observe the standing orders and regulations 
               <br />
               covering debates on matters which come before 
               <br />
               the Chair. Therefore, Mr. Smallwood, I am com- 
               <br />
               pelled to draw the line and make a general ruling: 
               <br />
               I will not be concerned with any expressions of 
               <br />
               opinion outside this House unless the document 
               <br />
               referred to is of an official nature, which is cal- 
               <br />
               culated to lay the foundation for the consideration 
               <br />
               of some matter which is before the House.
