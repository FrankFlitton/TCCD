               I note <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">11/?</span> pages are taken up with tourist trade in 
               <br />
               Canada, which gives us some interesting facts I 
               <br />
               cannot ﬁnd in the rest of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">report</span> about New- 
               <br />
               foundland. In looking at the tourist trafﬁc as it 
               <br />
               applies to Canada, and looking at it as it applies 
               <br />
               to Newfoundland, we are looking at two different 
               <br />
               propositions. In the United States a man gets in 
               <br />
               his car, takes his family, and drives to some place 
               <br />
               in Canada with little or no inconvenience... In 
               <br />
               this country, there are 90 miles separating us from 
               <br />
               the mainland, absolutely no ferry service. When 
               <br />
               you get to Port-aux-Basques you get on a train 
               <br />
               which is slow moving and you eventually arrive 
               <br />
               at Glenwood. I have been there and I have seen 
               <br />
               tourists coming to Glenwood. At one time I heard 
               <br />
               a lot of curses from four tourists who came up 
               <br />
               from the Gander River and had to stand outside 
               <br />
               the station, the waiting room was locked, waiting 
               <br />
               for the car, a train coming up from Grand Falls. 
               <br />
               They did not like the trip very much. The type of 
               <br />
               tourist we will get will be sportsmen, people who 
               <br />
               want to get away from it all, get clear of the ofﬁce 
               <br />
               and into the wilds where no one can get at them; 
               <br />
               men who do not mind roughing it. They will go 
               <br />
               to the Humber and the Gander and other lakes. 
               <br />
               That is the type we have been getting in the past. 
               <br />
               In the report I think the Committee envisages 
               <br />
               what Oliver and Mathes envisaged; that is, that 
               <br />
               the government should construct a road; that they 
               <br />
               should build a first-class hotel at Stephenville 
               <br />
               with several cabins; that hotels be built in other 
               <br />
               places, and so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on.</span> I do not see that the Committee 
               <br />
               has brought in any ﬁgures to show just what this 
               <br />
               scheme is going to cost the government.

               able to get facts or ﬁgures from the Tourist Board 
               <br />

               here is Newfoundland’s ﬁrst great weakness.

               But it is not one that cannot be quickly 
               <br />
               remedied. As the Bank of Montreal plainly

               stated in their recent report on tourism in

               Mr. Smallwood They were on four wheels and
