               We were not required to make that estimate and

               <br />
               object of our deliberations. Our chief point is that 
               <br />
               the economy is far stronger than it was, and that 
               <br />
               this strength may have come about during a 
               <br />
               period of wartime prosperity, but is now estab-

               <br />
               ﬁnancial situation. Our second point is that, on 
               <br />
               the basis of what we regard to be the reasonable 
               <br />
               volume and value of national production during 
               <br />
               the next three years, the budget can be balanced 
               <br />
               and a substantial sum be available for capital 
               <br />
               expenditure directed towards further strengthen- 
               <br />
               ing of the economy. This is not wishful thinking 
               <br />
               but my free and frank opinion on the basis of my 
               <br />
               own knowledge of the facts and tendencies. Our 
               <br />
               opinions may be subject to challenge by the

               ferent meanings, but that can only be determined 
               <br />
               by sensible discussion, and it certainly cannot be

               Now we come to the very important question 
               <br />
               of a mercantile marine... Should we or should we 
               <br />
               not have a mercantile marine? I think we should. 
               <br />
               We are a maritime nation in every sense of the 
               <br />
               word. We all agree we must export or die. To 
               <br />
               export our produce we must have ships. What are 
               <br />
               we doing now? If we want to export our produce, 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst thing we have to do is to approach about 
               <br />
               half a dozen different countries for ships to take 
               <br />
               our produce to foreign <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">markets.</span> For these we 
               <br />
               have to export, to send out of this country 
               <br />
               thousands and tens of thousands of precious dol- 
               <br />
               lars to pay for the use of these ships and ﬁnd 
               <br />
               employment for hundreds of foreign seamen. 
               <br />
               Therefore I think we should have our own ships 
               <br />
               to take our own produce to market and to bring 
               <br />
               back the things we need. And most important of 
               <br />
               all is the fact that we would be ﬁnding <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">employ.</span>
