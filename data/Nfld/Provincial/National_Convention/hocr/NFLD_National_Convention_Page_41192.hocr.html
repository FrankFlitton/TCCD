               <br />
               $24,460,000. Now when Mr. Smallwood speaks, 
               <br />
               I would like <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">him.</span> to tell me how any group of 
               <br />
               experts in Canada was able to break that down 
               <br />
               and then say that this part of it which they’re 
               <br />
               going to take over, represents that part which 
               <br />
               would have been the responsibility of the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada if Newfoundland had 
               <br />
               been a province. The second part is more inter- 
               <br />
               esting still. “All sinking funds against this portion 
               <br />
               of the debt will be taken over by Canada". But 
               <br />
               the argument has been that that amount of the 
               <br />
               debt which they are taking over would have been 
               <br />
               the responsibility of the Government of Canada. 
               <br />
               Therefore Newfoundland was not bound to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               any part of the sinkin g fund, or service of the debt, 
               <br />
               or anything of the kind. Therefore, if it makes 
               <br />
               sense, and I think it does, the $9 million belongs 
               <br />
               to us.... That is the position, it is our money. It is 
               <br />
               money that we would have had in this country if 
               <br />
               that amount of money had been taken over by 
               <br />
               Canada, and this argument which they put here is 
               <br />
               right. I would like to ask the Ottawa delegation if 
               <br />
               that was put to the Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government.</span> You 
               <br />
               will note that in the part of the debt which is left 
               <br />
               to us, we are left with our own sinking fund. 
               <br />
               Next, our accumulated ﬁnancial surplus. I got 
               <br />
               hot under the collar about that once before, and 
               <br />
               I’m not going to get so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">again.</span> ButI will point out 
               <br />
               that “Newfoundland will have the right within 
               <br />
               one year of union to deposit with the Government 
               <br />
               of Canada all or any part of the surplus held in 
               <br />
               dollars, and to receive interest at the rate of 2 
               <br />
               5/8% annually during a maximum period of ten 
               <br />
               years after union on the minimum balance out- 
               <br />
               standing at any time in the year preceding pay- 
               <br />
               ment of interest". I would draw your attention to 
               <br />
               the fact, that the pe0ple of Newfoundland today 
               <br />
               have on deposit with the Government of Canada 
               <br />
               an amount which must certainly be equal to, if 
               <br />
               not more than the surplus which the government 
               <br />
               has in hand, in that we have Dominion govern- 
               <br />
               ment bonds and our deposit of money is with the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada. We do not have to have 
               <br />
               any special wording put in here, if and when we 
               <br />
               wish to deposit money with the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada. We do not even have to have a limit of 
               <br />
               ten years... It must be $20 million which is 
               <br />
               actually on deposit today with the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada... That really annoys me. I am sick and 
               <br />
               tired of hearing people tell the people of New-

               put it out as a surplus. It might have been added 
               <br />

               government. $180,000 a year and 80 cents per 
               <br />
               head — $1.1 million. It isn’t an awful lot of 
               <br />
               money, but it’s all to the good. It’s something 
               <br />
               which Newfoundland can do with -— an extra 
               <br />
               million dollars... Clause 12 — tax agreement. 
               <br />
               Prior to 1939, the provincial governments of 
               <br />
               Canada, taken together, were spending more 
               <br />
               money than the federal govemment.... As a result 
               <br />
               of two world wars and the institution of certain 
               <br />
               federal welfare services, the federal government 
               <br />
               has had to get into its hands, to take care of 
               <br />
               Canada as a whole, a lot more money. During the 
               <br />
               last war they made war tax agreements with the 
               <br />
               various provinces. Since that time, tax agree- 
               <br />
               ments have been made with seven out of the nine 
               <br />
               provinces for short periods. Whether they were 
               <br />
               good or bad, I don’t know but what we are 
               <br />
               asked to do is to assume that a tax agreement will 
               <br />
               be applied to Newfoundland, the equivalent of 
               <br />
               which in Canada has been the subject of bitter 
               <br />
               controversy for quite a few years. The formula 
               <br />
               itself Mr. Smallwood skipped over, because he 
               <br />
               knew that nobody in the room would understand 
               <br />
               it, and yet we are asked to assume that a tax 
               <br />
               agreement would be applied to Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               and we are given the probable expenditure of a 
               <br />
               tax agreement payment for 1947 of $6,820,000. 
               <br />
               Now the point I’m trying to make is this, that we 
               <br />
               ought not to expect either this Convention or the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland to agree to an assump- 
               <br />
               tion that we would go into a tax agreement until 
               <br />
               it is very carefully studied by people who know 
               <br />
               precisely what they’re doing. Now we come to 
               <br />
               transitional grant. We are going to get $3.5 mil- 
               <br />
               lion for three years and that’s going to tail off in 
               <br />
               the twelfth year. After that we get a reassessment 
               <br />
               of our position 
               <br />
