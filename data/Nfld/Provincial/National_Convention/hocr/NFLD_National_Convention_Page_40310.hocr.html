               Mr. Higgins Speaking of forms of government, 
               <br />
               and remembering the old adage “politics makes 
               <br />
               strange bed-fellows”, and referring to the state- 
               <br />
               ment by Mr. Smallwood that he hoped that he and 
               <br />
               Major Cashin would be in the same government, 
               <br />
               I was wondering just what form of government 
               <br />
               that would be. But what I really meant to say was 
               <br />
               that I was very impressed by the addition to the 
               <br />
               supplementary report, and I think that particular 
               <br />
               aspects should be stressed very highly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~</span> the 
               <br />
               three-mile limit has practically nothing left on it. 
               <br />
               I think, if possible, the recommendations of the 
               <br />
               Committee should be carried out in some form, 
               <br />
               and possibly if we tacked a little more on it the 
               <br />
               powers that be may be impressed, otherwise all 
               <br />
               that will be left for these people will be “small 
               <br />
               wood”.... With reference to the sulphite mill in 
               <br />
               Labrador, is it a fact that sulphite pulp cannot be 
               <br />
               kept very long as it goes sour, and that is why 
               <br />
               there is no sulphite mill there at the present time? 
               <br />
               The other question is, can you split up that $5 
               <br />
               million extra over the $20 million for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ner</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Cashin ....I understand there is now some 
               <br />
               process whereby they can store sulphite for a 
               <br />

               Mr. Higgins That was not so in the past was it? 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin No, not years ago. With regard to 
               <br />
               splitting up that $5 million, I would like to have 
               <br />
               it here to divide between us! But the labour from 
               <br />
               that sulphite mill, that is the manufacturing, 
               <br />
               would average $40 a ton. You would want a 
               <br />
               capital of roughly $5 million to build town sites, 
               <br />
               wharves, etc., to produce 100,000 tons of wood

               Mr. Smallwood I don’t want to delay things, but 
               <br />
               something has me puzzled, and that’s the actual

               amount of timber in Newfoundland. This is a

               George Turner, who was Deputy Minister of 
               <br />
               Mines. He was examined by Sir Rider Haggard,

               In 1939 Mr. Ewbank said this: “We have not 
               <br />
               yet made a complete survey of the timber on 
               <br />
               Crown lands, but the Forestry Officer, Mr. 
               <br />
               Turner, has been collecting data for some years 
               <br />
               and now reports that he has enough information 
               <br />
               on which to make a rough estimate. He calculates 
               <br />
               that the total value of soft wood on Crown lands 
               <br />
               is not more than six million cords. In addition 
               <br />
               there is a good deal of acreage where young trees 
               <br />
               are growing up after burning. He calculates that 
               <br />
               there would be two million cords of growing 
               <br />
               stock.” That gives us eight million cords of soft 
               <br />
               wood. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now I come to the Report, page 12, paragraph 
               <br />
               10: “From information given us we find that, the 
               <br />
               total amount of wood available on Crown lands 
               <br />
               is roughly five million cords (excluding birch) 
               <br />
               and the total amount on leased lands is 60 million 
               <br />
               cords.” The point I want to make is that in 1914 
               <br />
               the Government of Newfoundland estimated that 
               <br />
               the Crown had in this island 10,000 square miles 
               <br />
               of timber. In 1939 the government estimated 
               <br />
               eight million cords of soft wood, that is counting 
               <br />
               two million cords of young stuff that was just
