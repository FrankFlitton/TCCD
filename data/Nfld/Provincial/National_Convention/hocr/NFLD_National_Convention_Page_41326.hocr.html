               was added expense, was not needed, and in fact 
               <br />
               was not wanted. I believe in the minimum num- 
               <br />
               ber required. The next step then, would be to set 
               <br />
               up a somewhat different system of operating the 
               <br />
               government from that which we had prior to 
               <br />
               1933. The ﬁrst step would be to set up a civil 
               <br />
               service commission composed of, say, three to 
               <br />
               five members who would be independent 
               <br />
               citizens, with no political attachments; obviously 
               <br />
               they could not be a member of or connected in 
               <br />
               any way with either the government or any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">op»</span> 
               <br />
               position party. The function or duties of this 
               <br />
               commission would be the governing of the civil 
               <br />
               service. In consultation with the ministers and 
               <br />
               department heads of the various branches, they 
               <br />
               would re-organise, where necessary, the work— 
               <br />
               ings of the departments, decide on the examina~ 
               <br />
               tions necessary to enter the service, the 
               <br />
               remuneration, the pension systems, and the 
               <br />
               employment and discharging of civil servants 
               <br />
               through their departmental heads, which would 
               <br />
               remove once and for all that political association 
               <br />
               of the past with the procuring or losing of posi- 
               <br />
               tions in the civil service. A person would have no 
               <br />
               fear of his job, no matter for which patty he might 
               <br />
               care to vote. He would be independent of politics 
               <br />
               and secure in his chosen profession. The standard 
               <br />
               of the civil service could thus, perhaps, be raised, 
               <br />
               the efficiency improved, and if the more respon- 
               <br />
               sible positions were rewarded in proportion, with 
               <br />
               higher salary in relation to services given, I feel 
               <br />
               sure that the service could become one to envy 
               <br />
               and provide a choice of a career with a future, 
               <br />
               which so many of our people may not consider it, 
               <br />
               as it exists in its operations today. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               A further step would be the proper direction 
               <br />
               in which allocations to departments would be 
               <br />
               spent, eg the Public Works Department. It is 
               <br />
               necessary in this case, as in that of any and all the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">departments,</span> that the allocations in each year of 
               <br />
               the govemment’s budgets could only be made 
               <br />
               and controlled by the government itself in light 
               <br />
               of its estimated revenue and expenditure, and of 
               <br />
               the necessity of certain works to be done or public 
               <br />
               service provided or maintained. Once, however, 
               <br />
               the allocation is made, say to the Public Works 
               <br />
               Department, then the spending of the monies of 
               <br />
               each year would be in the hands of a public works 
               <br />
               commission, including the head of that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">depart.</span> 
               <br />
               ment. The spending on improvement, extensions 
               <br />
               or maintenance of services would be done to 
               <br />

               of his position of the one responsible for the

               Now, Mr. Chairman, I have endeavoured to 
               <br />
               give just a simple illustration of my conception 
               <br />
               of the form and manner in which our government 
               <br />
               of the future should be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">handled,</span> I realise that I 
               <br />
               was perhaps generalising, but my suggestion 
               <br />
               would take a few months of close study to iron 
               <br />
               out the wrinkles and avoid the pitfalls, and time 
               <br />
               does not pemiit me to in any way do justice to it 
               <br />
               in the short period I am allowed in the debate on 
               <br />
               this motion. I trust, however, that I have in some 
               <br />
               measure shown the members of the Convention, 
               <br />
               as well as the people of the country, the basis on 
               <br />
               which our own government should be ad- 
               <br />
               ministered... Along the lines of these principles, 
               <br />
               we can have a better—than-ever self—governed 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. Some people may be inclined to 
               <br />
               doubt the practicability of my suggestions, but I 
               <br />
               am convinced that it could be worked out practi—
