               3. The circumstances surrounding our un- 
               <br />
               fortunate position in 1933 were very largely 
               <br />
               brought about as a result of patriotism in the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst world war, and the ultimate cost of pen- 
               <br />
               sions and allowances for those who survived. 
               <br />
               4. The general world depression being the 
               <br />
               other main factor, we were tied to Canadian 
               <br />
               currency, and were therefore at the mercy of 
               <br />
               Canadian banking institutions for our sur- 
               <br />
               vival or otherwise. Also the countries to 
               <br />
               which our exports were destined were unable 
               <br />
               to pay for our products 
               <br />
               5. The person who conceived the idea of a 
               <br />
               commission form of government for New- 
               <br />
               foundland was not a Newfoundlander and it 
               <br />
               was done, in my opinion, mainly as a spiteful 
               <br />
               gesture to prevent his political opponent from 
               <br />
               returning to power, with little thought or 
               <br />
               regard for the serious implications of his act. 
               <br />
               6. Our country is now self-supporting and will 
               <br />
               be within the reasonably foreseeable future. 
               <br />
               7. Our main industries are in a very healthy 
               <br />
               condition. The reports of this Convention 
               <br />
               have unquestionably brought out this fact. It 
               <br />
               is true the codﬁshery is still undergoing a

               <br />

               <br />
               in the sale of the basic article. 
               <br />
               8. It was a deﬁnite commitment on the part 
               <br />
               of Great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Britain...</span> 
               <br />
               9. It was a solemn pledge from the two great 
               <br />
               leaders of the Allied cause that self-govem- 
               <br />

               <br />
               men of strong character, not afraid to put more in 
               <br />
               work than they would try to take out in cash, men 
               <br />
               of vision with ability of leadership who would 
               <br />
               command the respect and conﬁdence of the elec- 
               <br />
               torate, men who would be far~sighted and 
               <br />
               courageous enough at times to hurt in order to do 
               <br />
               their people good, and I am convinced the hour 
               <br />
               will produce these men, Newfoundland will sur— 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               Our country is not developed, and we do not

               <br />
               take over by joining any other country. In 1933 
               <br />
               our national debt was a serious item in our

               and in our ability to survive. The lesson of 1933 
               <br />
               is one we should never forget, and in my opinion 
               <br />
               both the United States and Canada regret to this 
               <br />
               hour they did not act at that time to save New— 
               <br />
               foundland from losing her democratic institu- 
               <br />

               <br />
               foresight and interest in their weaker, friendly 
               <br />
               neighbour at that time, and I would urge all 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders to unite at this time and guard 
               <br />
               your heritage. We have been elected to recom-

               <br />
               given many forms serious consideration. To

               <br />
               is only one I can honestly commend to our

               people, namely, without reservation whatever, 
               <br />
