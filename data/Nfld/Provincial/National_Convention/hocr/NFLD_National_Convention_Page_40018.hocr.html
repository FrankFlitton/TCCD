               Mr. Smallwood The questions I have submitted

               <br />
               it would be a waste of time to ask a commissioner 
               <br />
               to come up until he had the question, and had 
               <br />
               replied in writing. When he has produced the 
               <br />
               documents then he could be here for supplemen-

               Mr. Chairman The Convention has no power

               to compel attendance or to compel him to answer 
               <br />
               questions. In the old days the statutory rules did 
               <br />
               not cover this and they were amended in 1890 by 
               <br />
               laying down what is known as statutory authority 
               <br />
               to subpoena witnesses and a committee would 
               <br />
               take evidence on a particular point. This was 
               <br />
               found not only desirable, but the only practical 
               <br />
               method. The witness on a particular point would 
               <br />
               attend before a select committee. They had 
               <br />
               statutory authority and these witnesses were re— 
               <br />
               quired to answer. I am not giving a judicial 
               <br />
               opinion, of course. There is no express authority 
               <br />
               in the Convention Act giving the Convention 
               <br />
