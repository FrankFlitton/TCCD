               Mr. Higgins Deﬁnitely. The picture given us 
               <br />
               was that in the early part of that operation there 
               <br />
               was no money, the people running it now got 
               <br />
               practically no money, and the merchants of the 
               <br />
               place carried the production for quite a time. It 
               <br />
               was really co-operatiOn of the very best kind. In 
               <br />
               fact, going further than that, Mr. Poynter said that 
               <br />
               he believed that there were a lot of other places 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland of a similar nature to 
               <br />
               St. Lawrence -—— no mineral of a quantity that 
               <br />
               would be of interest to a big corporation, but 
               <br />
               which might very well be worked by a corpora-

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. MacDonald My reason for raising that 
               <br />
               point is that the report says that the average wage 
               <br />
               paid in the mining industry proves it the most 
               <br />
               highly paid industry in the country. Now I took 
               <br />
               objection to that. Bell Island again — 58 cents an 
               <br />
               hour, and even adding on the 7 cents that they get, 
               <br />
               which gives them 65 cents, and they work 10 
               <br />
               hours a day. Now other industries have a basic 
               <br />
               rate for a nine hour day, with time and a half for 
               <br />
