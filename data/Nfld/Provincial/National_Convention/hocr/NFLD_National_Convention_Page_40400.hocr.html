               Mr. Hollett I notice that one plant referred to, 
               <br />
               the company paid an amount of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$302,000</span> for fish 
               <br />
               and for labour. There were 15 plants, that would 
               <br />
               mean the total paid out would be $4 million; but 
               <br />
               I notice on page 13 the total received was 
               <br />
               $5,515,000. That would probably indicate a 
               <br />
               proﬁt of $1 million. The point i am getting at is 
               <br />
               this: the Committee are lamenting, and I think 
               <br />
               rightly so, that there is likely to be a recession of 
               <br />
               trade in regard to fish. 1 would like to ask, have 
               <br />
               the proﬁts in years past been such that they could 
               <br />
               very well take up some of the slack in a possible 
               <br />
               falling market, so that they might be able to pay 
               <br />
               the ﬁshermen somewhere near the prices which 
               <br />
               were paid last year?

               Mr. Job That is a very pertinent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question.</span> I think

               in a case of this sort you have to provide for the

               writing off of your plant on an extensive scale out

               <br />
               you cannot tell what your proﬁt is; you have to

               provide for the wiping off of capital, to provide
