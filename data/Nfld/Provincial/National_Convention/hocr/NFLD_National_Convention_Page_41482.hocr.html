               In speaking to Mr. Higgins’ motion, Mr. 
               <br />
               Keough, a few days ago, went to great pains to 
               <br />
               rule out several forms of government which 
               <br />
               might be possible future forms of government for 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, on the grounds that, as far asl can 
               <br />
               see, they were unsuitable from his point of View. 
               <br />
               None of these forms had ever been discussed in 
               <br />
               this Convention, none of them had ever been 
               <br />
               given the slightest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attention,</span> One of them was 
               <br />
               union with the USA, and Mr. Keough’ s argument 
               <br />
               for ruling out that form was that the issue raised 
               <br />
               “matters of conscience” that he was not prepared 
               <br />
               to raise among our people. I would like to know 
               <br />
               what matters of conscience union with the United 
               <br />
               States would raise that confederation will not 
               <br />
               raise. The educational and divorce problems are 
               <br />
               present in each case, and the only other matter of 
               <br />
               conscience is that of a change of flag and loyalty. 
               <br />
               And I would ask Mr. Keough, pursuing his own 
               <br />
               line of thought, how would that affect the ﬁsher- 
               <br />
               man on the bill of Cape St. George as long as he 
               <br />
               gets his three square meals a day?

               No, Mr. Chairman, the argument here is that 
               <br />
               this Convention has discussed three forms of 
               <br />
               government, therefore it should recommend 
               <br />
               three forms, ignoring the fact that there are 
               <br />
               several others which can be dealt with under one 
               <br />
               or both of the forms discussed in Mr. Higgins‘ 
               <br />
               motion, which are forever discarded if this Con— 
               <br />
               vention should recommend and the people accept

               As I said before, nowhere in the Black Books

               <br />
               refer to them as “terms"; neither, I note, does Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood in his resolution, where he simply 
               <br />
               calls them a basis for confederation. And I submit 
               <br />
               that’s what they are, a basis for a future sovereign

               government of Newfoundland to negotiate the 
               <br />

               <br />
               the best terms we could get. That is unmitigated
