               <br />

               <br />
               because he, no doubt, anticipates that our surplus 
               <br />
               will soon be gone, and under those terms that 
               <br />

               We have a provincial budget based on those 
               <br />
               terms presented to us, and on which even <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> 
               <br />
               Smallwood, who compiled this budget, estimates 
               <br />
               a $1.25 million deﬁcit each year. No doubt he 
               <br />
               shaved the ﬁgures as close as possible, but still 
               <br />
               could not show how we could operate under 
               <br />
               union with Canada with less than a $1.25 million 
               <br />
               deﬁcit. However, he did not take into considera~ 
               <br />
               tion that he cut the Public Health Department, 
               <br />
               with its yearly expenditure to $5.25 million, 
               <br />
               against our present general expenditure of $6.25 
               <br />
               million, and he did not take into consideration 
               <br />
               that with the completion of the General Hospital 
               <br />
               here at St. John’s and the sanatorium at Corner 
               <br />
               Brook, with a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">250~bed</span> capacity, and the exten- 
               <br />
               sion of the Western Memorial Hospital at Comer 
               <br />
               Brook, that our maintenance of these public ser- 
               <br />
               vices under the department will require closer to 
               <br />
               $7 million a year, so that we would require ap- 
               <br />
               proximately another $2 million in addition to the 
               <br />
               deﬁcit brought in by Mr. Smallwood. That makes 
               <br />
               approximately a $3 million deﬁcit. The education 
               <br />
               grant has been left at just over $3 million, but here 
               <br />
               again the Department of Education will require 
               <br />
               about $4 million, although they may not be able 
               <br />
               to obtain this from the revenue of this country, 
               <br />
               but they will certainly need another $500,000 to 
               <br />
               maintain the educational services for the children 
               <br />
               in this country, and this further increases the 
               <br />
               deﬁcit under union to somewhat just under $4 
               <br />
               million.
