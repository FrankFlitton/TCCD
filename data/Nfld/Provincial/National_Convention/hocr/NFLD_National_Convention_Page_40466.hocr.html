               <br />

               Mr. Hollett Yes, but I want to be sure, because 
               <br />
               I have here the Canada year book for 1945 which 
               <br />
               gives the infant mortality rate by provinces and 
               <br />
               for the whole of Canada, and i ﬁnd that in 1940 
               <br />
               the infant mortality rate was 64 for the whole of 
               <br />
               Canada...

               Mr. Fogwill I have a table showing the world 
               <br />
               rates for 1934-35-36, and this is somewhat 
               <br />
               similar to those quoted by Mr. Hollett. For the 
               <br />
               years 1921—25 the average is 98; in 1934 it was 
               <br />
               72; 1935, 71; and 1936, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">66.</span>

               Mr. Ashbourne I am glad <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Hollett brought 
               <br />
               up that matter. We have here the original script 
               <br />
               given to be mimeographed, and I notice that there 
               <br />
               are several changes made on this list. Perhaps Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood can explain because I believe he was 
               <br />
               responsible for this; for New Zealand the original 
               <br />
               he had was 22.6, and several of the others were 
               <br />
               corrected and altered to give other ﬁgures. It 
               <br />
               seems to me he has taken the wrong rate. I notice 
               <br />
               that New Zealand, Denmark and several others 
               <br />
               have been marked off, but the ﬁgure for Canada 
               <br />
               was left there. It seems as if an error was made. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I notice too that some of the 
               <br />
               ﬁgures have been corrected in ink. I don‘t recall 
               <br />
               from memory, but Australia is raised from 18 up 
               <br />
               to 36 and Great Britain from 15 up to 54, USA 
               <br />
               from 17 up to 40, Denmark from 18.3 up to 45, 
               <br />
               South Africa from 25.3 up to 52, New Zealand 
               <br />
               from 22.6 up to 31. Evidently the wrong ﬁgures 
               <br />
               were typed in there in the ﬁrst place and the 
               <br />
               corrected ones were written in. What strikes me 
               <br />
               as being possible is that Canada was also typed 
               <br />
               and not corrected. I expect that is what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hap~</span>

               Mr. Butt I suppose this table is given to show 
               <br />
               something of a picture of Newfoundland’s assets. 
               <br />
               You will ﬁnd that there is a little note on one of 
               <br />
               these tables which says that this figure of 64 does 
               <br />
               not include statistics for the territories. I point out 
               <br />
               that nine-tenths of the population of Canada runs 
               <br />
               straight across the American boundary. There is 
               <br />
               something like 1,400 miles from that up, and 
               <br />
               there is one tenth of the population in that area, 
               <br />
               and they have a problem of isolation something 
               <br />
               the same as we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have.</span> We ought to take into 
               <br />
               consideration the problem of isolation in this 
               <br />
               country as well. 1 know the problem we have in 
               <br />
               public health. It is serious and terriﬁc. We should 
               <br />
               all give all the time and attention and energy that 
               <br />
               we can do it, but it strikes me as odd that we make 
               <br />
               ours out as a little worse than we need to. I think 
               <br />
               64 would be a little high if you take in the isolated 
               <br />
               districts. 1 am onlyjust trying to keep in my mind 
               <br />
               the fair picture of the problem in relation to our

               Mr. Smallwood This figure <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">0193.5</span> per 1,000 is

               <br />
               applies to the other countries. You take the ﬁgure

               <br />

               parts of Newfoundland which were much better

               <br />

               <br />
               deliberately left out of the report because we 
               <br />
               thought it would be queer to pick out certain 
               <br />
               parts. There was one part that was 210, another 
               <br />
               part <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1455,</span> 118.4 another part is 43.5, another 
               <br />
               part 5 1, etc ..... Taking the country as a whole with 
               <br />
               Labrador it is high, but it is dropping. The report 
               <br />

               up again, but there is a general fall in the rate, in
