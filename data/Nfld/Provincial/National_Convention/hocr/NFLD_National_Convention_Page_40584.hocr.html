               when I went to England. I am not in the frozen 
               <br />
               ﬁllet business, but I know what diversiﬁcation 
               <br />
               can mean to the ﬁsh industry. People had put 
               <br />
               large sums of money into cold storage and 
               <br />
               processing equipment. New draggers had been 
               <br />
               built. The fresh frozen ﬁshery was changing the 
               <br />
               lot of many thousands of ﬁshermen by giving 
               <br />
               them cash returns and relieving them of the toil 
               <br />
               and uncertainty of curing salt cod. However, to 
               <br />
               keep up production until the American and other 
               <br />
               markets expand, we have to ﬁnd an outlet for our 
               <br />
               full production for a period of two or three years 
               <br />
               of readjustment. Britain had taken most of our 
               <br />
               ﬁllets. Now she is cutting us off completely, and 
               <br />
               giving orders to Norway and Iceland. When this 
               <br />
               matter was raised, Lord Addison did admit that 
               <br />
               Newfoundland ﬁsh was preferred by the Ministry 
               <br />
               of Food. When he was then asked why negotia- 
               <br />
               tions were going on for the purchase of 12,000 
               <br />
               tons of Icelandic ﬁsh at higher prices, while New- 
               <br />
               foundland had ﬁsh to offer, he said that Iceland 
               <br />
               was a soft money country. I told him that the 
               <br />
               Icelanders had to get goods, if, with this money 
               <br />
               they were unable to buy things in other markets, 
               <br />
               because, you know, you can‘t eat ﬁve pound 
               <br />
               notes, and then Lord Addison tried to change the 
               <br />
               subject. I referred to our suggestion that New— 
               <br />
               foundland lend dollars out of her surplus to help 
               <br />
               Britain pay for our ﬁsh, and all the Dominions 
               <br />
               Secretary did was to tell us we had no right to be 
               <br />
               discussing trade matters. These were outside our 
               <br />
               terms of reference. It was pointed out that we had 
               <br />
               to report on the economic prospects of the 
               <br />
               country, and had to know something about these 
               <br />
               trade matters, and all we met was a brick wall. 
               <br />
               The only possible conclusion was that it was a 
               <br />
               political matter and that, for reasons best known 
               <br />
               to herself and not for shortage of dollars, Britain 
               <br />
               was willing to buy Icelandic ﬁsh that she did not 
               <br />
               like as well as ours, and was willing to pay more 
               <br />
               for it than our producers wanted. If that is a square 
               <br />
               deal, I don’t know what the term means... 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               On other matters we were left in a state of 
               <br />
               uncertainty. We can get no assurance that they 
               <br />
               will keep on buying Bell Island ore, even though 
               <br />
               very soon the British government itself will own 
               <br />
               and operate the steel mills through nationalisa— 
               <br />
               tion, and thus will not have to intercede with 
               <br />
               private <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">owners.</span> We can get no assurance they will 
               <br />
               continue to buy other local products they can use. 
               <br />
               They turned us down cold on our proposition to

               <br />
               they are because they got us a car to see the sights 
               <br />

               <br />
               tickets to an A.P. Herbert show. Mr. Chairman, 
               <br />
               the very existence of the people of this country is 
               <br />
               bound up in these trade matters, but it seems to 
               <br />
               me that the position of our people is less of 
               <br />
               importance than the special British interests in 
               <br />
               Iceland and elsewhere. In the end, on all matters 
               <br />
               that they didn’t want to talk about, we were told 
               <br />
               that we were outside our terms of reference. We 
               <br />
               were reminded we were not a government, al- 
               <br />
               though I cannot help thinking that, as the only 
               <br />
               elected representatives of the people, we have 
               <br />
               more right to be considered their spokesmen than 
               <br />
               this prudent Commission whose voice may be its 
               <br />
               own, but whose acts are those of the Dominions 
               <br />
               Ofﬁce. Time and again we were told the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Com.</span> 
               <br />
               mission was the government, and it was up to 
               <br />
               them to propose this or suggest that. We said the 
               <br />
               Dominions Ofﬁce was the real government, 
               <br />
               which they half-denied and half-admitted. I can 
               <br />
               assure you the Dominions Ofﬁce is the govern- 
               <br />
               ment, and Commission government only its 
               <br />
               agents, in fact one Commissioner asked us to 
               <br />
               remember that they were only agents... It is all 
               <br />
               very well for them to tell us that if we choose 
               <br />
               Commission government they will guarantee our 
               <br />
               debt and our solvency. They hedge these guaran- 
               <br />
               tees about with such qualiﬁcations as “to the 
               <br />
               extent of our ability” and so on. In any case, Lord 
               <br />
               Addison can safely promise for the time being 
               <br />
               because our prudent Commission of Government 
               <br />
               still has $30 million to spend and seem to be 
               <br />
               getting through it with anything but the prudence 
               <br />
               that Lord Addison gives them credit for.

               Just a word about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gander.</span> What I didn’t like

               was their ramming down our throats the fact that

               the British taxpayer will have to foot this 
               <br />
               $500,000 a year as their share ofGander‘s deficit.

               I am as sorry for the British taxpayer as anyone 
               <br />
               can be, but don’t let this get out of line. The

               and all that money was dollars, it would be the 
               <br />

               <br />
               directed by the British government. The special

               position of the United Kingdom in New-

               get special concessions from other countries for
