               <br />
               some time — whether a harbour board would be 
               <br />
               better to handle the freight in this city. Because 
               <br />
               today there are only two or three places where 
               <br />
               you can land stuff. They have a combine. 1 submit

               that it is an idea that might be constructively 
               <br />
               thought out. I believe that if we became united 
               <br />
               with Canada efforts would be made to establish 
               <br />
               a harbour board where shipping comes in — St. 
               <br />
               John’s, Comer Brook, etc., and it would be a 
               <br />
               corporation run on its own.

               Mr. Smallwood I appreciate what Major Cashin 
               <br />
               has said. 1 would like to say something about the 
               <br />
               National Harbours Board. I feel as he does, that 
               <br />
               something ought to be done about the harbour of 
               <br />
               St. John’s to put it in a position of efﬁcient service 
               <br />
               to the trade and public of the country. It is only a 
               <br />
               hope that the National Harbours Board of Canada 
               <br />
               would take over St. John’s harbour and make it 
               <br />
               one of the modern, efﬁcient harbours on the 
               <br />
               North Atlantic seaboard of America. I hope they 
               <br />
               'would make Corner Brook a national harbour.

               <br />
               administers, I think, 16 harbours in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada...</span> 
               <br />
               The Canadian Government has spent many 
               <br />
               millions of dollars on the vast terminals, 
               <br />
               elaborate piers etc. in the port of Halifax. I hope 
               <br />
               the National Harbours Board would take over the 
               <br />
               port of St. John’s. That is not something to fear; 
               <br />
               it is something to welcome. Let us say these 
               <br />
               services in clause 8 would be taken over by the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada. An earlier clause says 
               <br />
               they would take over and operate all these ser- 
               <br />
               vices and pay the costs of operating <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them.</span> If they 
               <br />
               take them over and pay the cost of running them, 
               <br />
               naturally they have to own them. That is the usual 
               <br />
               practice. If the provincial government operates 
               <br />
               certain services on its own, then that government 
               <br />
               owns those things; if the federal government 
               <br />
               operates such services, they own them. If they 
               <br />
               take over the Railway, the ownership is in their 
               <br />
               own hands, in the name of the federal govem- 
               <br />
               ment. Same thing with Gander. But if they are 
               <br />
               worth $2 million or $120 million, does that mean 
               <br />
               that Canada is getting that value? If they take the 
               <br />
               Railway over and it is worth $73 million, is it $73 
               <br />
               million better <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">0fW....</span> Is Newfoundland $ 1 -2 mil- 
               <br />
               lion better off because as a province it has not to 
               <br />
               pay the operating loss on the Railway in the 
               <br />
               future as we have done since 1920 or 1923‘? I am 
               <br />
               sure Major Cashin will appreciate these points. 
               <br />
               All right, they are worth $l20 million, from the 
               <br />
               standpoint of running them at a loss. One of the 
               <br />
               worries we have had is the loss on Gander airport; 
               <br />
               as a province, that loss will not have to come out 
               <br />
