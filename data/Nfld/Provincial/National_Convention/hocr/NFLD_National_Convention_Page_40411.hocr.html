               to which our friend was referring is a concern that 
               <br />
               has a very large organisation through Spain, Italy, 
               <br />
               Greece and Portugal, and I have no doubt they

               have very heavy expenditures to keep <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">up.</span> That is

               Mr. Hollett That is whatI can’t understand. We 
               <br />
               have the ﬁshermen getting the ﬁsh and the small 
               <br />
               man in the outports collecting it, and sending it 
               <br />
               in to St. John’s. Perhaps he is an exporter, perhaps 
               <br />
               not, but all the Codﬂsh Board has to do is allocate 
               <br />
               it to the trade ~——I don’t know whether the trade 
               <br />
               has anything to do with the Salt Codﬁsh Board 
               <br />
               — and the trade has to sell it. Now we ﬁnd they 
               <br />
               don’t sell it at all, but some commission agent 
               <br />
               here in St. John’s who gets $150,000, is that 
               <br />
               right? I am not trying to decry the work which the 
               <br />
               Fisheries Board has done, but we have to remem- 
               <br />
               ber that they did an excellent job from 1939 up 
               <br />
               to the present time when they were selling the 
               <br />
               goods and dealing with a rising market, the same 
               <br />
               as the Commission of Government during that 
               <br />
               period. I think everybody did an excellent job 
               <br />
               during that period, because we were winning 
               <br />
               hands dOWn. Don’t let anybody live in a fool’s 
               <br />
               paradise. What we must not do is praise up the 
               <br />
               Fisheries Board too much or they might think 
               <br />
               they are little gods, and sit tight. If they were good 
               <br />
               during the war years I feel sure they will be good 
               <br />
               during the years to come.

               One thing I would like to refer to is the statis- 
               <br />
               tics which the Committee has given us with 
               <br />
               regard to inshore, Labrador Stationers, Labrador 
               <br />
               ﬂoaters, and deep sea ﬁshing. The average num- 
               <br />
               ber of quintals caught by inshore ﬁshermen was 
               <br />
               32 last year, stationers 30 quintals, floaters 61 
               <br />
               (these are the men who went down to Labrador 
               <br />
               in their own vessels); then we have the deep sea 
               <br />
               ﬁshing (referring to bankers on the southwest 
               <br />
               coast), 122 quintals. If we are going to improve 
               <br />
               the ﬁsheries, you have to get each man producing 
               <br />
               more ﬁsh. If you look at these ﬁgures you will 
               <br />
               find that you have to make it possible for the 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen to get further away from their own 
               <br />
               stageheads. They must have ships to enable them 
               <br />
               to get further away and get back safely. The

               <br />
               did not make as good a living as they should for

               going to be selling ﬁsh on a rising market all the

               can’t, and it is our duty to try to plan to offset that

               Mr. Newell In the middle of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">page.</span> l0 there is a 
               <br />
               little statement which I think expresses a whole 
               <br />
               lot: “We suggest that consideration be given to 
               <br />
               the idea that the codﬁshery be placed on a cash 
               <br />
               basis.” The implications of that statement are 
               <br />
               very wide indeed. They have their roots right in 
               <br />
               the very question that we have here — whether 
               <br />
               or not the people of this country can be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selfesup~</span>

               brought about. I don’t blame them for not at— 
               <br />
               tempting to answer that, because it is going to be 
               <br />
               something of a headache. You can’t just snap 
               <br />
               your ﬁngers and have it done. I have certain ideas 
               <br />
               on the subject myself, which I do not propose to 
               <br />
               go into now because they have nothing to do with 
               <br />
               the Fisheries Report, but it seems to me that we 
               <br />
               have sometime or other to try to make a picture 
               <br />
               in our minds of a Newfoundland which will pro- 
               <br />
               vide a decent standard of living for its people, and 
               <br />
               as far as ﬁshermen are concerned this question of 
               <br />
               putting our codﬁshery on a cash basis is very 
               <br />
               important from a great many <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">angles.</span> From the 
               <br />
               angle ofeconomy, which is enough at the present

               time, let us consider what happens when the 
               <br />

               codﬁshery is carried on on a credit basis. As a
