               Mr. Newell There are not very many comments 
               <br />
               that l have to make, and not very many questions 
               <br />
               that I want to ask. But I think it would be rather 
               <br />
               discourteous if this report was hurriedly passed 
               <br />
               over. There must have been a tremendous amount 
               <br />
               of work drawn into the compilation of the report 
               <br />
               and as far as I know, and I’m not speaking as an 
               <br />
               authority on the ﬁnancial matters at all, merely 
               <br />
               as a layman, it is a very excellent report in most 
               <br />
               respects. There are one or two points in connec~ 
               <br />
               tion with sections of the report that I should like 
               <br />
               to raise before we read it. I‘m going to refer the 
               <br />
               Convention ﬁrst of all to the section in which a 
               <br />
               matter of opinion is expressed by the Finance 
               <br />
               Committee, pages 97-98. I’ll read it so nobody 
               <br />
               need bother to turn back. “It is the considered 
               <br />
               opinion of the Finance Committee of this Nation— 
               <br />
               al Convention, that at no time during the period 
               <br />
               from 1940-41 to 1945-46 should the total expen- 
               <br />
               diture of the country have exceeded the sum of 
               <br />
               $21 million annually. This would have meant an 
               <br />
               additional $20 million in surplus account today." 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Of course that’s not offered as a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fact,</span> That is 
               <br />
               offered as a matter of opinion concurred in I take 
               <br />
               it by nine or ten people. There are 40 or 44 of us 
               <br />
               here and possibly there are 20 or 25 different 
               <br />
               opinions on a matter such as this. The thing that 
               <br />
               I want to know is, does this refer to expenditures 
               <br />
               on existing services? They say that the expendi- 
               <br />
               ture should have been kept down to $21 million 
               <br />
               annually. Now what I want to know is this: 
               <br />
               whether this $21 million should have been meant 
               <br />
               to cover the existing services that we have today, 
               <br />
               or is it implied by the Committee that we have 
               <br />
               services which are unnecessary, which should 
               <br />
               have been dispensed with? That point is not 
               <br />
               brought out clearly and perhaps it‘s a minor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">point,</span> 
               <br />
               Personally, I don’t know what existing services 
               <br />
               we could dispose of. As for the second part of that 
               <br />
               opinion, that this would have meant an additional 
               <br />
               $20 million in surplus account, that presupposes 
               <br />
               that if the expenditures had been less, the same 
               <br />
               revenue under any form of government would 
               <br />
               have been collected. Let me say quite frankly that 
               <br />
               I’m inclined to doubt that, because any form of 
               <br />
               democratic government is naturally very sensi~ 
               <br />
               tive to the wishes and to the demands of the 
               <br />
               people; and the demands that I have heard raised 
               <br />
               by the public have been largely on the side of 
               <br />
               decreasing taxation. 1 think we’re all aware that

               <br />
               doubt whether under any other than a dictatorial 
               <br />

               <br />
               tually have been collected. Possibly the Finance

               Committee feels entirely differently about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Again, going back to the ﬁrst point raised, the 
               <br />
               expenditures should not have exceeded $21 mil- 
               <br />
               lion annually. I’m wondering if the Committee 
               <br />
               was thinking in terms of past standards of govem- 
               <br />
               ment expenditures, rather then the ideals and 
               <br />
               ideas that more modern governments have 
               <br />
               towards, for instance, a matter like social 
               <br />
               security. And I think that today if you look around 
               <br />
               the British Commonwealth of Nations, you will 
               <br />
               find that most of the governments that comprise 
               <br />
               that Commonwealth are looking towards expen- 
               <br />
               diture on social security. We have been remiss in 
               <br />
               that connection in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country,</span> I don’t think that 
               <br />
               we have done a great deal for those who, having 
               <br />
               contributed largely to the revenue of the country 
               <br />
               as producers, ﬁnd themselves through illness or 
               <br />
               old age or something or other, put in a position 
               <br />
               where they can no longer support themselves 
               <br />
               And I feel that if we are to look forward to a 
               <br />
               standard of living comparable to that of other 
               <br />
               countries within the British Commonwealth, we 
               <br />
               must envisage expenditures along social security 
               <br />
               lines compatible with expenditures in some of 
               <br />
               those other countries. Now we’re all a bit touchy 
               <br />
               here on comparisons with our neighbours, so in 
               <br />
               making the comparison I’d like to go as far away 
               <br />
               from home as possible. I find on referring to a 
               <br />
               book written by Mr. Walter Nash that in 1944 the 
               <br />
               New Zealand government was spending on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">so»</span> 
               <br />
               cial security alone £12,577,000 and at the rate of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$366</span> US dollars for a New Zealand pound, that 
               <br />
               translates into something like $45.5 million, for 
               <br />
               a population of 1,641,000 which, if my division 
               <br />
               is correct, works out at something like $27 per 
               <br />
               capita. On that basis, we in Newfoundland would 
               <br />
               need to spend $9 million annually approximately, 
               <br />
               to provide our people with the social security 
               <br />
               services that they enjoy in New Zealand. I not 
               <br />
               only went as far away from home as possible, but 
               <br />
               I picked the best one. If you’re going to aim at 
               <br />
               anything perhaps it’s just as well to aim at the 
               <br />
