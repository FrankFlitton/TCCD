               Mr. Chairman On that point, before you go any 
               <br />
               further I think I would want to consult the Steer- 
               <br />
               ing Committee on this matter. Some of the 
               <br />
               answers take the form of incorporating by way of 
               <br />
               reference certain voluminous documents which 
               <br />
               are appended thereto, and it might be that it would 
               <br />
               occasion considerable hardship and considerable 
               <br />
               loss of time if the principle of mimeographing all 
               <br />
               replies indiscriminately were employed... 
               <br />

               <br />
               ruling on the point, I think I must refer the matter 
               <br />
               to the Steering and Information Committees, so 
               <br />
               that they may be able to assist me in determining
