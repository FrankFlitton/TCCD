               Mr. Hollett Mr. Chairman, that is the point that

               I’m trying to get home. I don‘t like to see people 
               <br />
               endeavouring to make certain capital, I won’t say 
               <br />
               of what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">kinda“</span> Will somebody tell me this. why 
               <br />
               aren’t the American people and the Canadian 
               <br />
               people in the country today paying wages similar 
               <br />
               to such as are being paid by the Anglo-New- 
               <br />
               foundland Development Company and the 
               <br />
               Buchans Mining Company, which I know to be 
               <br />
               pretty good wages? They may not be enough, but 
               <br />
               I think every working man in the area from which 
               <br />
               I come will tell you, or tell me, that they are 
               <br />
               getting much more then the men who are working 
               <br />
               on the American bases. Now is the Commission 
               <br />
               of Government still keeping the Americans from 
               <br />
               paying these men their wages? If they are, it’s 
               <br />
               time to get the Americans out of it, I would say. 
               <br />
               I say this in all fairness to the companies, vested 
               <br />
               interests if you like, in the area from which I 
               <br />
               come. While I know they’re going to try to get 
               <br />
               labour for the least amount that they can pay, 
               <br />
               from what I found they only had to be approached 
               <br />
               by the representatives of the various unions and 
               <br />
               their cases got good consideration, and nine times 
               <br />
               out of ten they got what they asked for. So I 
               <br />
               cannot sit here and allow any man to say that that 
               <br />
               which happened in 1941-42 or whenever, 
               <br />
               definitely was brought about by such vested in- 
               <br />
               terests, unless proof positive is brought here for 
               <br />
               me to see. I think I would be unjust not only to 
               <br />
               the vested interests, but also to the employee who 
               <br />
               works with them if I didn’t take some notice of 
               <br />
               that. Now what one member has said here may 
               <br />
               be perfectly right, but I want to see the proof 
               <br />
               before I allow it to go unchallenged.

               <br />
               straight. Last year in this House I asked a question

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">labouri</span> I received an answer back saying that the 
               <br />
               wages on Bell Island, that is government wages, 
               <br />
               were the prevailing rate of labour, We never 
               <br />
               received them ﬁrst nor last. They did come up to

               <br />
               I have been questioned on Bell Island by certain

               people inasmuch as to say that I was derelict in

               <br />

               hasn’t anything to do with us but nevertheless I

               tain that the answer we received last fall here was 
               <br />
               that the Commission of Government was paying 
               <br />
               highroad workers the prevailing rate of pay on 
               <br />
               Bell Island, which was 58 cents an hour for the 
               <br />
               lowest man. The prevailing rate I found out after~ 
               <br />
               wards, I’m not sure yet, that’s why I rise to a 
               <br />
               question of information, was 50 cents at the end 
               <br />
               of last year. Possibly they never thought this thing 
               <br />
               was going to carry on as long as it is: I didn’t 
               <br />
               either. But possibly they thought that wouldn’t 
               <br />
               carry on, and as far as I understand now it’s back 
               <br />
               to 40 cents.

               think it’s a decidedly dangerous thing to make
