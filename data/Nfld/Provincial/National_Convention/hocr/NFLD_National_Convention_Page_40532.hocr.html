               Mr. Vardy It is more or less the old crude way. 
               <br />
               The clay is taken from the pits by wheelbarrow, 
               <br />
               and goes to elevators and into the crusher, and 
               <br />
               down into the moulds, and the bricks are cut off 
               <br />
               by a string of wires passing through the moulds. 
               <br />
               Afterwards they are taken out and pass to the kiln, 
               <br />
               then they are sun dried. It’s the old crude 
               <br />
               methods, and I believe if they had more modern 
               <br />
               methods the production would be stepped up, but 
               <br />
               then again you are up against the imported article 
               <br />
               being superior, and in order to make the industry 
               <br />
               worthwhile you will have to condemn the clay 
               <br />

               Mr. Harrington All those bricks that are made,

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Vardy I don’t know of any local made brick 
               <br />
               being exported. I know we are importing a lot of 
               <br />
               brick, but I don’t know of any being exported. It 
               <br />
               has been stated that the main complaint against 
               <br />
               our local brick is that it is very coarse and absorbs 
               <br />
               too much moisture. It can’ t stand up over a period 
               <br />
               of years against the hard brick. Of course, there 
               <br />
               is the hard and soft, I may say they use the hard 
               <br />
               brick for chimneys, but I think that’s the main 
               <br />
               complaint. The brick manufactured from clay has 
               <br />
               been very porous, but the brick manufactured 
               <br />
               from this shale can be hardened up so that, as the 
               <br />
               report says, “it will be like steel”. The opinion is 
               <br />
               that an industry should be started immediately. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hickman I don’t want to disagree with 
               <br />
               Mr. Vardy again, but there has been some brick 
               <br />
               exported.
