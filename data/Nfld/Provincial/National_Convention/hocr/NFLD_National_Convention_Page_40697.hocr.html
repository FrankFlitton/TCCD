               they get that ﬁgure of $72 million? I will tell you, 
               <br />
               in fact they say it here. What happened was this: 
               <br />
               the Ottawa delegation spent weeks before it went 
               <br />
               gathering information about Newfoundland, and 
               <br />
               amongst that was gathered information about the 
               <br />
               Railway, which it got from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">manager,</span> One of 
               <br />
               the things we knew they would want to know in 
               <br />
               Ottawa was, “What is your railway worth? What 
               <br />
               is the value of it?” So naturally we asked the 
               <br />
               manager to give us an inventory.... They gave us 
               <br />
               an estimate of $72 million... Remember we made 
               <br />
               Newfoundland out while we were in Ottawa to 
               <br />
               be sitting on top of the world, so we gave them 
               <br />
               the estimate of $72 million that our Railway is 
               <br />
               worth, but let us not here fool ourselves. If a 
               <br />
               Railway has cost millions upon millions upon 
               <br />
               millions of dollars, taken from the public in taxes 
               <br />
               by the government, brought into the public ex- 
               <br />
               chequer and handed over to the Railway to meet 
               <br />
               their operating losses, millions upon millions of 
               <br />
               dollars to meet the operating losses year by year 
               <br />
               since we took over the Railway in 1923, and for 
               <br />
               two years before that, if we are paying their losses 
               <br />
               and they have come to many millions of dollars, 
               <br />
               let us not fool ourselves into thinking that our 
               <br />
               Railway is actually worth $72 million in cash. I 
               <br />
               am afraid you would have ajob to get anybody 
               <br />
               to pay that for the Railway, unless you would 
               <br />
               undertake to pay the operating loss. They might 
               <br />
               do it then for the sake of having the job of 
               <br />
               manager.

               You say we have $20 million worth of high— 
               <br />
               roads. I happen to believe strongly in highroads, 
               <br />
               but when it takes a million a year to keep up those 
               <br />
               roads, just barely to keep them up, I am not 
               <br />
               willing to accept the ﬁgure of $20 million as an 
               <br />
               asset against an actual public debt. And then they 
               <br />
               put in another $10 million for public buildings 
               <br />
               and hospitals, and finally another $10 million for 
               <br />
               lighthouses and public wharves and breakwaters 
               <br />
               and our telegraph system, making a total of $1 10 
               <br />
               million of assets to go against our net liability of 
               <br />
               $35 million, showing that we have made a net 
               <br />
               gain for the last 50 years, it says, of $75 million, 
               <br />
               or, now I quote the exact words, “... an average 
               <br />
               annual surplus <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of$1.5</span> million” for the last 50 
               <br />
