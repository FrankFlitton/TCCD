               Mr. Job We have had success with them for the 
               <br />
               past 40 years. We have been using them all the 
               <br />
               time. You can go over to our Southside premises 
               <br />
               and see them. Up to the present we have not been

               Mr. Job You would save a lot of your West

               India ﬁsh. I am afraid it is not practical to cure all 
               <br />
               ﬁsh by artiﬁcial drying, because there is no ﬁsh 
               <br />
               that can be cured as well as the shore ﬁsh, which 
               <br />
               is sun-dried. I don’t think it has ever been done. 
               <br />
               We are the only people in the world that are 
               <br />
               attempting to make that very ﬁne light-salted, 
               <br />
               sun-cured ﬁsh. The Norwegian and Iceland ﬁsh 
               <br />
               is not by any means in the same class as our fine, 
               <br />
               merchantable, light- salted cod. It has got a salty 
               <br />
               appearance, and the salt comes up on the face of 
               <br />
               it. It is preferred in some markets, but no one has 
               <br />
               been able to beat our sun-dried ﬁsh when it is 
               <br />
               properly cured.

               Mr. Job Well, it would give the ﬁsherman his

               cash and the ability to go and catch more ﬁsh, 
               <br />
               especially with those 25 foot boats. I think that’s 
               <br />
               a very important suggestion, and the government 
               <br />
               can help them buy these boats. We are building

               some of these boats ourselves, and are going to 
               <br />
               put them into trial this year, but there is a good 
               <br />
               deal to be done, and I was going to suggest in the

               report that the government might build a few of 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Job touched on a point a

               moment ago about this light-salted ﬁsh. We 
               <br />
               would not be here today but for the fact of that 
               <br />
               light-cured ﬁsh. The shortage and high cost of 
               <br />
               salt in England compared with the plentiful supp- 
               <br />
               ly and low cost of salt in Spain, Portugal and Italy 
               <br />
               350 years ago, that enabled the latter to start a 
               <br />
               vessel ﬁshery. They could catch their ﬁsh, salt it 
               <br />
               on the Banks and bring it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">home.</span> The English had 
               <br />
               to light salt it, and that‘s why they settled in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland in the ﬁrst place. That‘s why our 
               <br />
               light—salted cure is so famous and unique.

               I am going to ask Mr. Job this: suppose you 
               <br />
               had your choice of having all ﬁsh brought by the 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen to central curing stations, whether to 
               <br />
               be frozen or salt cured, and no ﬁsherman making 
               <br />
               his own ﬁsh at all, or to go on as we are, where 
               <br />
               each ﬁsherman makes his own ﬁsh, what does 
               <br />
               Mr. Job think would be the best of these two 
               <br />
               methods? I think that theoretically the former 
               <br />
               would be the better -— ﬁshermen merely to be 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen, devoting their time almost entirely to 
               <br />
               catching. But has Mr. Job considered this side of 
               <br />
               it — in normal times when the price is normal, if 
               <br />
               a fisherman makes his own ﬁsh he is in a sense 
               <br />
               getting paid for his own labour and the labour of 
               <br />
               his own family for making that ﬁsh. That’s a very 
               <br />
               important point when prices are low. When 
               <br />
               prices are high, sell the ﬁsh round if you like, but 
               <br />
               if the price is down would the merchant taking 
               <br />
               that ﬁsh and curing it himself pay the ﬁsherman 
               <br />
               enough to live on, or might he not be forced to 
               <br />
               get the few cents extra by making the ﬁsh him- 
               <br />
               self? If he is not making ﬁsh time is on his hands. 
               <br />
               If the price is low, you try to get fishermen to sell 
               <br />
               ﬁsh round when he can get more by making the 
               <br />
               ﬁsh!

               Mr. Job That’s a question that would have to be 
               <br />
               very carefully gone into. No one can tell how that 
               <br />
               would turn out. It might prove to be too costly to 
               <br />
               cure it. It is being tried to some extent now. There 
               <br />
               are plants in the country now that buy the ﬁsh and 
               <br />
               dry it.

               fresh and making it altogether in one place, there 
               <br />
               are a lot of things to be considered. The thing is

               that if it could be done you would get the offal. It
