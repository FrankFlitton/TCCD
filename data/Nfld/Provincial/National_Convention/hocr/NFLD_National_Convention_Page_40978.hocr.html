               nel in Canada and Newfoundland. There is a note

               and Canadian allowances. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett On the ﬁrst note which says, “Some 
               <br />
               of the Canadian beneﬁts listed might have ex- 
               <br />

               justment for Newfoundland ex-servicemen", 
               <br />
               could your delegation tell me how many have 
               <br />
               expired up to date? Have you a record of that? 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne l have not got listed just what 
               <br />
               have expired. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Very well. We will pass on. 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne As to the difference between 
               <br />
               the Canadian and Newfoundland pension, in 
               <br />
               several cases they are similar. The point raised by 
               <br />
               Mr. Northcott as regards pensions of $900 a year 
               <br />
               for 100% disability, 1 think it is the same, with 
               <br />
               the exception that under the Pensions Act of 
               <br />
               1935, I do not think an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exAserviceman</span> in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New;</span> 
               <br />
               foundland can receive anything for children born 
               <br />
               after the last of May, 1934', whereas, under the 
               <br />
               Canadian act he is permitted a pension or some 
               <br />
               allowance, I believe, up to l944. There is that 
               <br />
               difference 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Is there any great difference be— 
               <br />
               tween the beneﬁts veterans in Canada get and 
               <br />
               veterans in Newfoundland? We could get at the 
               <br />
               difference and ﬁnd out where we would beneﬁt 
               <br />
               if we went into confederation. Could you tell me 
               <br />
               that? 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne There were veterans’ allowan- 
               <br />
               ces and service benefits under the Veterans Lands 
               <br />

               <br />
               find these and also the re-establishment credits if 
               <br />
               they refer to the Black Books. 
               <br />
               Mr. Northcott We get some concessions here, 
               <br />
               and as I see it, a little better.

               Mr. Hollett Book 2.

               Mr. Ashbourne Well if you have it there you 
               <br />
               could give it to us. lfyou have the amount <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there,</span>

               Mr. Hollett You are telling <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us,</span> I am asking you 
               <br />
               a question, and you don’t seem to know. 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne Well, I am not conversant with 
               <br />
               everything in this. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Well, let’s have somebody who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Hickman In connection with those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re'es~</span> 
               <br />
               tablishment credits, they are only available, or 
               <br />
               would be available. to those who served in the 
               <br />
               Canadian services. Consequently anyone not in 
               <br />
               the Canadian forces would not be eligible to the 
               <br />
               beneﬁts under that act. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett And as I understand it. according to 
               <br />
               Page 76, a grant equal to the “basic gratuity" 
               <br />
               is equal to $15 per month outside the western 
               <br />
               hemisphere. You might check with somebody if 
               <br />
               that is not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">correct.</span> l am only trying to let our 
               <br />
               veterans in this country know the true position in 
               <br />
               Canada, and the point which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Hickman just 
               <br />
               raised is, and it is a point very well taken, that that 
               <br />
               particular section would not apply to any of our
