               the whole thing. I have talked to many of them 
               <br />
               lately. I have been talking to a Newfoundlander 
               <br />
               who sold his home in Canada, gave up his job and 
               <br />
               returned here because he could not pay his in- 
               <br />
               come tax. I have heard from Canadians who say 
               <br />
               that Newfoundlanders would be crazy to enter 
               <br />

               <br />
               man, I’ve heard of some of the Canadian 
               <br />
               politicians who say how generous Canada is in 
               <br />
               taking over our national debt. Why don’t some of 
               <br />
               our Ottawa delegation tell us how foolish we are 
               <br />
               to take over Canada’s huge and ever increasing 
               <br />
               public debt? Only this morning I came across the 
               <br />
               following in the Financial Post dated January 3,

               Mr. Fudge I’m not quoting, but Vancouver in 
               <br />
               November had 1,000 jobs opened and 12,000 
               <br />
               applications <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> 12,000 applicants. Since then 
               <br />
               things are believed to have gotten worse. The 
               <br />
               same thing is true in the Maritimes and to a lesser 
               <br />

               Just one other point. It seems to be forgotten 
               <br />
               that Canada’s present position ﬁnancially and 
               <br />
               economically is the offshoot of a war boom. It is 
               <br />
               not a solid peace-time economy, and we must 
               <br />
               also bear in mind that the recent surplus an- 
               <br />
               nounced by the Canadian government is not 
               <br />
               earned revenue. As you have heard Major Cashin 
               <br />
               say, Canada is at present a hard-up country. She 
               <br />
               is short of dollars and is even talking about hold- 
               <br />
               ing a sweepstake to obtain American dollars. Her 
               <br />
               people are entering on the road of austerity, 
               <br />
               which is only a more polite term for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">poverty.</span> That 
               <br />
               is the position now. What might it be this time 
               <br />
               next year? By then Canadian taxes and Canadian 
               <br />
               prices may be gone sky high. The baby bonus 
               <br />
               may be a thing of the past. What consolation will 
               <br />
               it be for us to say then that that was not what they 
               <br />
               told us in the Grey Book or the Black Book? 
               <br />
               These are the things which we must consider, not 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial statements and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">like,</span> It is time we put

               Mr. Chairman, I conclude my remarks in the 
               <br />
               full conﬁdence that when the people of this 
               <br />
               country realise what this proposal of confedera- 
               <br />
               tion means to them in their everyday life, when 
               <br />
               they realise the rain of taxes which will descend 
               <br />
               on them from every direction, when they realise 
               <br />
               the overlying plan which has as its object the 
               <br />
               swallowing up of this country, then I have con- 
               <br />
               ﬁdence they will know how to deal with the 
               <br />
               situation -— just as I trust the members of this 
               <br />
               Convention will know how to deal with this 
               <br />
               costly and worthless Ottawa report when the time 
               <br />
               comes for voting on it. At the very opening of this 
               <br />
               Convention I said that this good old ship, a ship 
               <br />
               of state in my opinion, was not in a position to 
               <br />
               send out an SOS to a Canadian rescue tug. She is 
               <br />
               still in that position. She is awaiting her New- 
               <br />
               foundland crew to sail her into her home port. I 
               <br />
               say to you, and to my fellow countrymen, get on 
               <br />
               board, sail her over.

               Mr. Job upon the action that he has taken this

               <br />
               can appreciate the gesture of a man who is 
               <br />
               prepared practically to risk his life in order to 
               <br />
               have his say upon a matter so vital to his country, 
               <br />
               that is now before us. And whilst I’m afraid that 
               <br />
               I cannot quite concur with the Hon. Mr. Job in all 
               <br />

               myself of this opportunity to pay my tribute to a

               gallant gentleman, and one who I have always

               <br />
               is all over and done with, I will be credited with 
               <br />
               being sincere according to mine.
