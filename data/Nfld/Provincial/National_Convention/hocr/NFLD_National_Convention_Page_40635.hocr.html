               and continent. Now, with regard to the Economic 
               <br />
               Report,l there is nothing to stop the Finance 
               <br />
               Committee from preparing it. I am only one 
               <br />
               member of the committee —- there are eight or 
               <br />
               nine others. I cannot see why the load should be 
               <br />
               thrown on me to prepare the Economic Report 
               <br />
               when there are eight or nine members just as 
               <br />
               competent as I am. With regard to the Finance 
               <br />
               Report, brieﬂy, it is divided into four portions. 
               <br />
               The first relates to the government from 1909- 
               <br />
               1920. If my memory serves me right, it shows that 
               <br />
               in that period, under responsible government, we 
               <br />
               had a surplus of some $7 million. The next sec— 
               <br />
               tion deals with the government from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">191920</span> up 
               <br />
               to the time Commission took over in 1933-34, 
               <br />
               and it shows we had an average deﬁcit, if my 
               <br />
               memory serves me correctly, of $2 million a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">year,</span> 
               <br />
               Then it goes from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">193384</span> to 1939—40, and it 
               <br />
               shows the deﬁcits had increased, even though a 
               <br />
               reduction in interest annually had been made of 
               <br />
               $2 million. Finally it winds up with the period 
               <br />
               1940 to March 31, 1947, and it shows we had 
               <br />
               surplus in cash of something over $30 million. In 
               <br />
               other words, the Finance Report was a cash book, 
               <br />
               and showed we had available at the moment 
               <br />
               surpluses of around $30 million. The report 
               <br />
               covers the railway from the time it was taken over 
               <br />
               by the government in 1923 to the present time, 
               <br />
               and shows it cost $30 million in deﬁcits and 
               <br />
               capital expenditure. It shows the taking over of 
               <br />
               the Newfoundland Hotel — we paid $450,000, 
               <br />
               and up to the present time it has cost considerable 
               <br />
               additional money. It is not an economic. report. 
               <br />
               The position of an economic report, as I under- 
               <br />
               stand it, would be the presentation of a budget. 
               <br />
               Well, I am going to take the position now that this 
               <br />
               House, under the terms of reference, has not any 
               <br />
               power to prepare a budget, and that is what an 
               <br />
               economic report is. Last year, when this Conven~ 
               <br />
               tion opened, Mr. Wild told us it would cost from 
               <br />
               $23-23.5 million a year to administer the affairs 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland. Now we have another budget 
               <br />
               which shows that Mr. Wild was wrong.2 He did 
               <br />
               not know what he was talking about. They have 
               <br />
               raised it up $4 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million,</span> We ﬁnd today, according 
               <br />
               to the Commissioner for Finance, that it is going 
               <br />
               to cost $27 million, in addition to which there is 
               <br />
               to be an expenditure on capital account of $ 10- 12 
               <br />
               million. For the life of me, I cannot see how

               The London delegation went away to England 
               <br />
               trying to ﬁnd out if we could get anything on 
               <br />
               which to build a budget. We were told to mind 
               <br />
               our own business and come home. We were told, 
               <br />
               “We will give you an order for fish, if we feel like 
               <br />
               it; we will give you an order for iron ore if we feel 
               <br />
               like it." Personally, I feel I would not be able to 
               <br />
               prepare an economic report on my own, and 
               <br />
               under the circumstances 1 have to plead I am 
               <br />
               unable to do it, and l challenge the fact that 
               <br />
               anyone else is able to do it. We know we are 
               <br />
               self-supporting. Lord Addison told us we were 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self~supportingg</span> Mr. Wild told us we were self- 
               <br />
               supporting; Mr. Attlee in the House of Commons 
               <br />
               in December 1945 said so; Lord Cranborne said 
               <br />
               so. Better authorities than I am have told us we 
               <br />
               are self-supporting. Whether we will be self-sup- 
               <br />
               porting in years to come, no one knows ~— not 
               <br />
               even me, not even Lord Addison or anyone else; 
               <br />
               not even Mr. Smallwood. We have been assured 
               <br />
               that if we had a government — any other form of 
               <br />
               government —— we would have power to ﬁnd out 
               <br />
               whether we are able to sell our fish; whether we 
               <br />
               are able to sell o‘re. We know we can sell 
               <br />
               newsprint — it is a private business — and there 
               <br />
               is a big demand for it. The three major industries 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland are, today, fish, iron ore, 
               <br />
               Buchans and pulp and paper. We know where we 
               <br />
               stand in regard to pulp and paper; we know there 
               <br />
               is a big expansion going <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on,</span> A motion was 
               <br />
               brought in to send a delegation to Washington to 
               <br />
               try and ﬁnd out about sales of ﬁsh and iron <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ore,</span> 
               <br />
               and we were told it was not within our terms of 
               <br />
               reference. Why does not the government of the 
               <br />
               country do something about it? The government 
               <br />
               cannot do it because we were told in London that 
               <br />
               the British government is not in a position to 
               <br />
               approach the United States and ask them whether 
               <br />
               they could give us any concessions, and they will 
               <br />
               not allow the people of Newfoundland to do it. 
               <br />
               That is the position also with regard to iron ore. 
               <br />
               “We will take it if we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can,"</span> They told us in 1930 
               <br />
               that our iron ore was not suitable for their fur-
