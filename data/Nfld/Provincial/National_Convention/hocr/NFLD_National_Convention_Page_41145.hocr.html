               Now, Mr. Chairman, after reviewing these 
               <br />
               Black Books and this Grey Book, and after read- 
               <br />
               ing Prime Minister King’s letter to the Governor, 
               <br />
               that these are the best ﬁnancial terms that the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada can offer to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> 
               <br />
               foundland; I want to say to Prime Minister King 
               <br />
               and to the Ottawa delegation that these proposals 
               <br />
               are fraudulent; that, in short, they do not con- 
               <br />
               stitute a fair and equitable basis for union of our 
               <br />
               two countries In order to make a fair and equi- 
               <br />
               table basis for union it would be necessary that 
               <br />
               the debt question be properly adjusted; that 
               <br />
               Canada would pay to Newfoundland the dif- 
               <br />
               ference between the per capita debt of Canada 
               <br />
               and the per capita debt of Newfoundland. In this 
               <br />
               instance it is approximately $1,200 per head for 
               <br />
               every man, woman and child in our country. This 
               <br />
               would mean that Canada should pay to New- 
               <br />
               foundland not less than $300 million in cash 
               <br />
               before we could go into national partnership on 
               <br />
               a fair and equitable basis. We have been told by 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood that this debt matter was dis— 
               <br />
               cussed at Ottawa, but there does not appear in 
               <br />
               either the Black Books or the Grey Book any 
               <br />
               reference to the matter. As a matter of fact, the 
               <br />
               national debt of Canada has been deliberately 
               <br />
               omitted from both, which to me, at any rate, is an 
               <br />
               indication that the purpose of these proposals is 
               <br />
               to deceive our people, and through the avenue of 
               <br />
               the proposed baby bonus, to lure our people into

               Now let us see where we would ﬁnally land 
               <br />
               ourselves from a financial and taxation 
               <br />
               standpoint, if we were to accept these so-ealled 
               <br />
               terms and become the tenth province of the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada. Mr. Smallwood has told us 
               <br />
               that our per capita tax would not exceed $75 per 
               <br />
               head. Let us work this out properly. To begin 
               <br />
               with, the Canadian government would expect us, 
               <br />
               they would compel us to pull our weight in the 
               <br />
               entire Dominion boat. This means that the people 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland would be compelled to pay 
               <br />
               their proportionate share of the cost of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ad»</span> 
               <br />
               ministration of the federal government. I repeat 
               <br />
               again now, that the cost for every man, woman 
               <br />
               and child in Newfoundland, to pay their share in 
               <br />
               administering the affairs of Canada, would mean 
               <br />
               that each individual would be taxed directly and 
               <br />
               indirectly to the tune of over $200 per head 
               <br />
               annually. It would mean that instead of the people 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland having to ﬁnd, as at present 
               <br />
               under our own Commission or responsible 
               <br />
               government, some $40 million in annual taxation 
               <br />
               to pay the cost of administering our country, or 
               <br />
               at the rate of $120 per head, that we would have 
               <br />
               to ﬁnd as a people an additional $35 million in 
               <br />
               annual taxes or a total of $75 million each year

               In addition to this taxation, we would have to
