            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Smallwood I guarantee you that what I said 
               <br />
               was, “I will read it, make a brief explanation and 
               <br />
               sit down." I have not made the brief explanation. 
               <br />
               The explanation is this: from the time we would 
               <br />
               become part of the Canadian union, we would 
               <br />
               have the status of a province with all the rights, 
               <br />
               powers and privileges and responsibilities of a 
               <br />
               province. That means this: as I see it, Canada is 
               <br />
               a union of countries called provinces — there are 
               <br />
               nine of them. If we became a province, there 
               <br />
               would be ten provinces. Canada is a union of 
               <br />
               provinces or of countries. Each of these provinces 
               <br />
               has its own legislature which it elects itself. That

               29: 
               <br />
               29. Provincial governments in Canada have 
               <br />
               various origins. Nova Scotia, New 
               <br />
               Brunswick and Prince Edward island came 
               <br />
               into Confederation with their pro-existing 
               <br />
               constitutions practically unaltered by the 
               <br />
               union. This was also the case with British 
               <br />
               Columbia, although representative institu- 
               <br />
               tions were not fully developed there at the 
               <br />
               time of union and were later regulated by 
               <br />
               provincial statute. The Governments of On- 
               <br />
               tario and Quebec were provided for in the 
               <br />
               British North America Act of 1867. The con- 
               <br />
               stitutions of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and 
               <br />
               Alberta, which were created out of federal 
               <br />
               territories, were laid down in the Manitoba 
               <br />
               Act of 1870 and in the Alberta and Sas- 
               <br />
               katchewan Act of 1905.

               Mr. Higgins I understood this Black Book was
