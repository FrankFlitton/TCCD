               <br />
               should have considerable time — not taking too

               long. This is a very important thing to my district 
               <br />

               <br />
               time, even if it should take the whole afternoon. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I want to make another point. 
               <br />
               There is a lot of talk here about the deplorable 
               <br />
               condition of Canada; that she is bankrupt; down 
               <br />
               and out; poverty—stricken. Last year the Govern— 
               <br />
               ment of Canada ended up with a surplus of $360 
               <br />
               million. This year for the ﬁrst ﬁve months she has 
               <br />
               had a surplus of $500 million. Why was it neces- 
               <br />
               sary for her to borrow <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$200-$400</span> million? Be- 
               <br />
               cause she was poor? No! Canada today is 
               <br />
               extremely prosperous and because she is 
               <br />
               prosperous she has to borrow some American 
               <br />
               dollars. She is buying American goods at the rate 
               <br />
               of $2 billion a year.... She has not got enough 
               <br />
               dollars, why? Because she is shipping goods to 
               <br />
               Europe; she is shipping goods to Britain; keeping 
               <br />
               Britain alive... Canada is shipping to all over 
               <br />
               Europe and Asia and she is not getting paid in 
               <br />
               American dollars. She is running short of 
               <br />
               American dollars... Last year the Canadian 
               <br />
               government had a surplus of $360 million. Now

               Mr. Smallwood They will? Let us take a look at 
               <br />
               it! If that is so, family allowances are no good... 
               <br />
               If there are 270 children in Bay de Verde proper 
               <br />
               under 16 years, that is $1,620 a month. Will the 
               <br />
               parents have to give the government $1,620 so 
               <br />
               that the children can get $1,620? If so, family 
               <br />
               allowances are no good... If the parents have to 
               <br />
               pay it themselves so that the children can have it, 
               <br />
               then family allowances would be no good; they 
               <br />
               would be only paying it to themselves. We could 
               <br />
               have family allowances and no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confederation...</span> 
               <br />
               All very ﬁne to say family allowances cost $250 
               <br />
               million a year. You can take that $250 million and 
               <br />
               divide it by 12.5 million population; but that is 
               <br />
               not the way. I will put it another way. There are 
               <br />
               nine provinces in Canada. Every one has its own 
               <br />
               government, but one government on top of all, 
               <br />
               the federal government at Ottawa. Does the 
               <br />
               federal government say, “In the coming fiscal 
               <br />
               year in our budget we are going to spend $1.75 
               <br />
               billion — now there are nine provinces, divide 
               <br />
               that into $1.75 billion. That is so much”? That 
               <br />
               would be stupid. They are not stupid. They do not 
               <br />
               collect their revenue in equal amounts from every 
               <br />
               province... The Province of Ontario pays to the 
               <br />
               federal government nearly half of all the revenue. 
               <br />
               Throw Quebec in with it, throw in British Colum— 
               <br />
               bia, those are the duee rich provinces. Quebec 
               <br />
               has an area vastly bigger than Ontario in size; has 
               <br />
               vast water-powers; vast timber resources and 
               <br />
               great mills, mines and factories, and steel mills 
               <br />
               — a vast industrial province. In British Columbia 
               <br />
               there is a vast agricultural province — paradise, 
               <br />
               the Garden of Eden of this world. No country on 
               <br />
               the face of the earth can compare with British 
               <br />
