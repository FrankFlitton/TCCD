               Mr. Chairman I don’t want any arguments at 
               <br />
               all. Mr. Fudge has the floor, and unless and until 
               <br />
               any member arises to a point of order or a ques- 
               <br />
               tion of privilege, he is not to be interrupted... 
               <br />
               Mr. Fudge We’ve been told that under con— 
               <br />
               federation the cost of living would be reduced. 
               <br />
               We have been told this repeatedly. I fail to see to 
               <br />
               what extent. We must not forget that we are living 
               <br />
               on an island. In Canada, where rail haul is short, 
               <br />
               and consequently tranSportation and delivery 
               <br />
               costs low, the position is quite different to what 
               <br />
               it would be in this country. No such beneﬁts 
               <br />
               would accrue to our people. We would still have 
               <br />
               to pay the regular freight direct from western 
               <br />
               Canada to the eastern seaboard — Montreal, 
               <br />
               Halifax, Sydney or Prince Edward Island to N ew-

               <br />
               distribution <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">costs.</span> Many of the items coming into 
               <br />
               this country from Canada pay little or no customs 
               <br />
               duty at the present time. All importations from 
               <br />
               the United States and the United Kingdom will 
               <br />
               be subject to customs duty under confederation, 
               <br />
               and these are no small amounts of our total 
               <br />
               volume of imports.

               Another matter I wish to refer to is a statement 
               <br />
               made by Premier Jones of Prince Edward Island 
               <br />
               the other day, when he said, in substance, that 
               <br />
               with Newfoundland coming into confederation 
               <br />
               with Canada, his island province could expect to 
               <br />
               market an additional amount of its produce. This 
               <br />
               would mean, according to Premier Jones, that an 
               <br />
               air transport service would be inaugurated with 
               <br />
               the west coast of our island. Let my constituency 
               <br />
               businessmen of Corner Brook and the Codroy 
               <br />
               Valley, the latter represented by Mr. Keough, 
               <br />
               take note that Premier Jones says that potatoes, 
               <br />
               vegetables of all kinds, livestock, meat, eggs and 
               <br />
               grain, should ﬁnd a substantial market in New- 
               <br />
               foundland and Labrador ——— Labrador’s mine 
               <br />
               development especially, Premier Jones said, 
               <br />
               when the Labrador railway is completed. When 
               <br />
               Newfoundland joins Canada, Frontier Jones said, 
               <br />
               a weekly service would be developed by steamer, 
               <br />
               and if the Harmon airfield in the vicinity of 
               <br />
               Stephenville could be operated for commercial 
               <br />
               freight planes, commodities such as milk, etc., 
               <br />
               would be carried by air freight to the west coast. 
               <br />

               Air traffic would also be developed with

               eggs, fruit, butter, pork, cheese, and other goods

               would gain a market now served partly by our 
               <br />
               farmers of the Codroy Valley. I wonder what 
               <br />
               does my friend Mr. Keough, who so ably repre—

               Mr. Smallwood presented his budget some 
               <br />
               time ago showing that he would require some $15

               we become one. When asked how he proposed 
               <br />
               getting this revenue, he stated that as in other 
               <br />
               provinces in Canada, the industrial towns would 
               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. Chairman His statement was that 89% of

               the total revenue derived by the federal govern- 
               <br />

               Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, and the 
               <br />
               remaining six provinces paid the remaining 11%.

               John’s and some of our largest outport towns will

               When I look at this confederation in such alight, 
               <br />
               the whole thing seems so silly and extravagant 
               <br />
               and stupid, that I ask myself how this crazy issue 
               <br />
               ever got into this chamber. And how did he 
               <br />
               manage to get us to take it seriously? And he can 
               <br />
               tie up our work for over three months. But it 
               <br />
               seems we have to face reality. The absurd thing 
               <br />
               has been foisted on us. It has destroyed the work 
               <br />
               of this Convention. It has to all sensible New-

               foundlanders become an actual fact, and whether 
               <br />
               we like it or not we have to deal with it. The 
               <br />
               records of our proceedings indicate that we did
