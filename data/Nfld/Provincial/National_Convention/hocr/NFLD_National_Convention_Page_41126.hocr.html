               <br />
               confederate as Mr. Smallwood, I would go out 
               <br />
               and campaign vigorously for the carrying out of 
               <br />
               the agreement of 1933, and then I would further 
               <br />
               campaign this country in the interests of the 
               <br />
               retention of Commission of Government. I would 
               <br />
               do this because i feel sure that it is the policy of 
               <br />
               the United Kingdom government, the historical 
               <br />
               imperial policy, that Newfoundland must be- 
               <br />

               were Mr. Smallwood, for the retention of Com- 
               <br />
               mission government, because I would feel conﬁ— 
               <br />
               dent that the Commission government, through 
               <br />
               its bosses in Downing Street, would hand this 
               <br />
               country over to Canada, lock, stock and barrel, 
               <br />
               within six months after the referendum was 
               <br />
               taken, should the people decide to continue under 
               <br />
               commission form of government. I challenge any 
               <br />
               member of the Commission government, and 
               <br />
               particularly do I challenge the representative of 
               <br />
               the United Kingdom government on that 
               <br />
               Commission, to come out openly and honestly 
               <br />
               and tell the people that their bosses in Downing

               <br />
               Newfoundland into union with the Dominion of 
               <br />
               Canada. If they deny that such is the case, then I 
               <br />
               say to them, each and every member of the Com- 
               <br />
               mission government: tell us why you are not 
               <br />
               prepared to carry out your agreement with the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland, and why you have been 
               <br />
               spending and are continuing to spend the money 
               <br />
               belonging to the people of Newfoundland like a 
               <br />
               bunch of drunken sailors, which in my opinion is 
               <br />
               being done for the sole purpose of trying to break 
               <br />
               our country. Take up this morning’s paper — the 
               <br />
               revenue and expenditures are given —— $31.6 
               <br />
               million in revenue and practically the same in 
               <br />
               expenditure for nine months; and an indication 
               <br />
               given by the Commissioner of Finance, that we 
               <br />
               are going to have a deﬁcit this year on a $40 
               <br />
               million revenue. What is that but deliberately 
               <br />
               squandering the taxpayers’ money, and it is being 
               <br />
               done purposely.

               <br />
               subjected by Canadian Customs ofﬁcials to the 
               <br />
               most undignified examination of their person and 
               <br />

               a favourable balance of trade with the United

               <br />

               coming out of Newfoundland, whereas we buy 
               <br />

               <br />
               United States, therefore we have a credit which

               Canadian politicians, I would like to bring your

               minds back to February, 1943, when the Com~

               Chairman, as a member of the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               Board of Trade, proposed a motion at a public

               meeting of that body condemning such iniquitous 
               <br />
               and dictatorial legislation. Let me tell you, sir, 
               <br />
               and let me tell the people of Newfoundland, that 
               <br />
               this particular legislation, whatl would term im- 
               <br />
               moral legislation, was enacted at the instance of 
               <br />
