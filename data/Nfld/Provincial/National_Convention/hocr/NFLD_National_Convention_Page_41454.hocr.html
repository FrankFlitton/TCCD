               And let me ask this further simple question: 
               <br />
               why is it suggested that forms of government 
               <br />
               should be split up in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unreasonable</span> fashion — 
               <br />
               two to be submitted to the people for their choice 
               <br />
               at the referendum, and a third to be held back and 
               <br />
               subsequently thrown into the confusion and 
               <br />
               chaos of a general election? Three forms of 
               <br />
               government are on men’s lips today. Why should 
               <br />
               one of them be put to such a disadvantage? It is 
               <br />
               noteworthy, sir, that the suggestion comes not 
               <br />
               from those who want our people to have a free 
               <br />
               choice, but rather from those who would force 
               <br />
               responsible government down the people’s 
               <br />
               throats like a dose of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">evilatasting</span> medicine. I ask 
               <br />
               you to remember that it is the anticonfederates, 
               <br />
               the responsible government champions, who 
               <br />
               would thus prevent the people from giving their 
               <br />
               verdict upon a form of government laid before 
               <br />
               them by this Convention itself as a result of 
               <br />
               Britain’s complete good faith -— who would 
               <br />
               force the people to vote, not for what they want, 
               <br />
               but for what they don’t want in order to get what 
               <br />
               they want. 
               <br />

               And ﬁnally, does it not occur to these anticon-

               federates that the referendum is the proper, the 
               <br />

               <br />
               ment, whatever that new government may be

               dling of any political party, decide the matter? Is 
               <br />
               anyone going to tell me that the people are not ﬁt 
               <br />
               to make that decision? Is anyone going to say that 
               <br />
               the people should not be trusted to decide the type 
               <br />
               of government by which they shall be ruled? And 
               <br />
               yet these anticonfederates would say, they do say, 
               <br />
               to the people, “No! You shall not choose from 
               <br />

               Only once in our history has the question of 
               <br />
               confederation been submitted to our people. That 
               <br />
               was in 1869, two years after the then four British 
               <br />
               colonies on the mainland were united to form 
               <br />
               Canada. The Canadian union was then in its 
               <br />
               experimental stage, and there was no certainty 
               <br />
               that it would succeed or even survive. It lacked 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial strength, the prairies were unpopulated, 
               <br />
               the transcontinental railway not even <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con“</span> 
               <br />
               templated, and the country’s'economy almost 
               <br />
               entirely agricultural. Here in Newfoundland our 
               <br />
               people were uneducated. Few ever saw a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">news»</span> 
               <br />
               paper. There was no radio. The whole question 
               <br />
               of confederation was deliberately turned into a 
               <br />
               political squabble. The anticonfederate party was 
               <br />
               led by a great merchant who spared no expense 
               <br />
               to win. An army of party hacks were sent around 
               <br />
               the Island to poison the people’s minds against 
               <br />
               confederation These henchmen traded on the 
               <br />
               people‘s ignorance and assured them that their 
               <br />
               property would be taxed — their homes, their 
               <br />
               furniture, their gardens, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">boats,</span> ﬂakes, stages, 
               <br />
               ﬁshing gear, their poultry and animals, the very 
               <br />
               panes of glass in their homes. A horde of 
               <br />
               Canadian tax-gatherers would swarm over the 
               <br />
               land, the anticonfederates declared, and woe 
               <br />
               betide the unfortunates who didn’t have the hard 
               <br />
               cash to pay up, for the hungry tax collectors 
               <br />
               would seize their property, put them on the street. 
               <br />
               Canada would seize their young men to ﬁght her 
               <br />
               wars, and their bones would be left to bleach on 
               <br />
               the desert sands of Canada. Their very babies 
               <br />
               would be used as gun-wads in the Canadian can—

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nont</span> Sir, if you cannot credit these statements, 
               <br />
               you have only to turn to Prowsc’s History of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. There was no secret ballot in 
               <br />
               those days. There was no manhood suffrage. 
               <br />
               There was no woman’s vote at all. The unfor- 
               <br />
               tunate voter had to declare his vote aloud in the 
               <br />
               presence of the party agent —— often the employee 
               <br />
               of the local merchant, and it was a bold man who 
               <br />
               would brave the anger of his supplier in those 
               <br />
               semi-feudal days. As we look back upon that 
               <br />
               story of 1869, it is difﬁcult to believe that any 
               <br />
               men voted for confederation; but thousands did, 
               <br />
               and it is of tremendous signiﬁcance that out of 30 
               <br />
               members elected to the House of Assembly, ten 
               <br />
               were confederates.1
