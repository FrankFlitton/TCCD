               it was tragedy enough that we could not raise 
               <br />

               <br />
               ear-marked for the bondholders of our debt; but 
               <br />
               was it not an ignominy when Britain said, “Yes, 
               <br />
               allow us to suspend your constitution, and we will 
               <br />

               <br />
               ing again, if you ask for it”. How were we meant 
               <br />
               to ask for it? “Oh, you may elect a national 
               <br />

               <br />
               porting.” But did they say to our people, “If your 
               <br />
               convention ﬁnds you self-supporting, they will 
               <br />
               have authority from you to request the restoration 
               <br />
               of your former constitution”. No, they say, “If 
               <br />
               they ﬁnd your country self-supporting, they may 
               <br />
               suggest to the Dominions Office forms of

               Would it be pertinent to ask GreatBritain what 
               <br />
               she understands by the words “self-supporting”? 
               <br />
               I am sorry to raise this point, for I am as loyal to 
               <br />
               my king and empire as any man in Britain today. 
               <br />
               Who are we, gentlemen, to recommend forms of 
               <br />
               government? Do the men who framed the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Con»</span>

               ment in our great British Empire. We could 
               <br />
               recommend representative government, were it 
               <br />
               not for the fact that it has been tried and failed 
               <br />
               miserably the world over. We could recommend 
               <br />
               that we might come up a peg from where we are 
               <br />
               today and suggest a crown colony; and we could 
               <br />
               recommend any one or more of the 2,000 dif- 
               <br />
               ferent known forms of government that have 
               <br />
               been tried and failed through the ages. We can do 
               <br />
               all that, but do we not know that the British 
               <br />
               system so far has no equal, or why try to force it 
               <br />
               on India or Burma?

               Some people have concurred that this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conv</span>

               <br />
               in fact, it seems to be the idea embodied in the

               motion and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">report.</span> Let me quote you section 146 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act, 1867: “It shall 
               <br />
               be lawful for the Queen on addresses from the 
               <br />
               Houses of the Parliament of Canada, and from the

               Provisions ofthis Act...” You will note that it is 
               <br />
               only lawful for the Queen to admit us into union 
               <br />
               after receiving an address from the House of the 
               <br />
               Legislature. And yet there are some people who 
               <br />
               want to get “the terms". What terms? Are they 
               <br />
               already drawn up? Or are they to be unpigeon~ 
               <br />
               holed from the closets of 1895 and 1867? Are 
               <br />
               there no terms on our side? Not in the minds of 
               <br />
               some people who wanted to hike off to Canada 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Says the Ottawa Journal: “Newfoundland 
               <br />
               owes $100 million, she is facing bankruptcy, and 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               will be so good, I’m told. I tell you there are no 
               <br />
               terms; confederation must essentially be a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ques~</span>

               <br />

               believe we have something to contribute to the

               <br />
               ation if the people of this country say so, and only 
               <br />
               if they say so. How may they say so? I submit 
               <br />
               there is only one way, and that is under section 
               <br />
               146 of the BNA Act and the doctrine of mandate 
               <br />
               and that is embodied in the truth that Parliament 
               <br />
               ought not to adopt any far-reaching measure 
               <br />
               without a mandate from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> But you say, 
               <br />
               “We have no parliament." Ah yes, we have, for 
               <br />
               as soon as our constitution comes out of its state 
               <br />
               of suspended animation, the voice of the people 
               <br />
               can be heard on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">issue...</span>

               The process of entering into federal union is 
               <br />
               clear cut. First you have to have two self-govern- 
               <br />
               ing entities; second they must have much in com- 
               <br />
               mon, and each must have something to offer the 
               <br />
               other. One may be wealthy, but lacking <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some»</span>

               thing which she needs and which the other, who

               may not be so wealthy, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possesses.</span> Third, the 
               <br />
               people of both countries must he made duly 
               <br />
               aware of the situation. In the fourth place, the 
               <br />
               people of both countries must authorise their 
               <br />
               respective governments to explore the pos- 
               <br />
               sibilities of a fair partnership. Fifth, each govern— 
               <br />
               ment must then report back to its people and get 
               <br />
               their final approval, by way of the referendum or 
               <br />
               otherwise. There is no other way, except by coer-
