               that these countries have recognised the strategic

               great United States of America has bases here in 
               <br />

               <br />
               defense for the western hemisphere. I don't think 
               <br />
               that Canada is going to make any move as regards 
               <br />

               Now I know that time is running short, and it 
               <br />
               is not my intention to go through all these terms 
               <br />
               which have been fully explained by Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood. Members have had as much <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex.</span> 
               <br />
               planation on these terms as probably they want. 
               <br />
               But there are a few points that I would like to 
               <br />
               touch on, such as the slight change in our form of 
               <br />
               taxation, and in the manner of raising taxes, 
               <br />
               which may have to be made if we become a 
               <br />
               province of Canada. But we must not assume that 
               <br />
               because we have been accustomed to a certain 
               <br />
               way of taxation for 100 years of so, that that way 
               <br />
               is according to the law of the Medes and Persians 
               <br />
               and cannot be changed. If it is in the interest of 
               <br />
               the masses of the people for a change to be made, 
               <br />
               then certainly it should be made. Very few people 
               <br />
               know exactly how much taxes they’re paying. I 
               <br />
               doubt it.... Personally I can’t say what taxes I’m 
               <br />
               paying. All I know, according to the last budget 
               <br />
               speech that was delivered, is that 54% of our 
               <br />
               revenue was collected through the Customs, 
               <br />
               something over $20 million. Under these terms 
               <br />
               it’s estimated that we shall be paying $2 million. 
               <br />
               According to that, there would be a saving of $18 
               <br />
               million. Well, suppose we do have to find new 
               <br />
               taxation of $5-6 million. Well, aren’t we saving 
               <br />
               a considerable amount then?

               Mr. Ashbourne Yes that’s right, there is a proﬁt

               <br />
               the bank and get the money to pay into the 
               <br />

               <br />
               money from the bank without interest. And if 
               <br />
               they have money of their own, well, their money 
               <br />
               is generally able to earn some interest. That’s

               how the world is run. These people can’t really

               Now so far as I am aware, no province has 
               <br />
               seceded from the Canadian confederation. There 
               <br />
               are nine provinces and not one of them has 
               <br />
               seceded. If things were so bad in Canada why 
               <br />
               is it that one of the provinces has not left? During 
               <br />
               my stay in Canada I questioned a captain of one 
               <br />
               of the boats in which I was travelling, and I asked, 
               <br />
               “What about all this talk we hear down in New- 
               <br />
               foundland sometimes, that you people, not being 
               <br />
               satisﬁed with confederation, would like to get out 
               <br />
               of it?" “Sir,” he said, “I never heard talk of it.” 
               <br />
               Do you think that Canada would send an army 
               <br />
               down here to keep us in confederation if we 
               <br />
               wanted to get out of it? I think it would be the 
               <br />
               other way around... In union is strength. I believe 
               <br />
               that some real and marked increases in the money 
               <br />
               that the people would have in their pockets would 
               <br />
               ensue as a result of confederation. And if New- 
               <br />
               foundland, after her surplus was used up <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ml</span> 
               <br />
               naturally, being a part of Canada, we would know 
               <br />
               where to look in order to get help. We have a 
               <br />
               tremendous overhead in Newfoundland. We 
               <br />
               have the trappings of an elephant and the back of 
               <br />
               a cat.

               Somebody has remarked that the terms might 
               <br />
               be improved. But I read here in Prime Minister 
               <br />
               King’ 5 letter that the government could not readi- 
               <br />
               ly contemplate any change in these arrangements 
               <br />
               which would impose larger ﬁnancial burdens on 
               <br />
               Canada. We know that the economy of a country 
               <br />
               can change very quickly. We have been very 
               <br />
               fortunate in Newfoundland these last few years, 
               <br />
               in that millions of dollars have come in here from 
               <br />
               Canada and from the United States of America. 
               <br />
               We have had good prices for our ﬁsh, and the 
               <br />
               result is that we have built up a surplus. But let 
               <br />
               us not forget that we are spending this year about 
               <br />
               $40 million. How long can we go on spending 
               <br />
               such a sum of money as that? It is only for the 
               <br />
               price of fish to drop and of certain other basic 
               <br />
               commodities, for the beginnings of a depression 
               <br />
               to start again. We are dependent upon world

               markets and dependent upon countries overseas 
               <br />
