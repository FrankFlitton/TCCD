               <br />
               second conclusion was that this report showed 
               <br />
               that we would remain so in the foreseeable future.

               The impression has been created that the fu— 
               <br />
               ture of this country must necessarily be limited to 
               <br />
               the ﬁgures forecast in this report. For instance, 
               <br />
               we allow for future revenues of approximately 
               <br />
               $30 million per year. This does not mean that our 
               <br />
               revenues may not far exceed this amount. And for 
               <br />
               the same reason, the amounts which we have 
               <br />
               estimated as available for old age pensions and 
               <br />
               other social services may be far in excess of the 
               <br />
               ﬁgures we have given. Indeed I would hazard 
               <br />
               the guess that undreamed of prosperity awaits 
               <br />
               this country. And why do I say this? Because of 
               <br />
               something which is only brieﬂy touched on in the 
               <br />
               report, an asset which we have not included in our 
               <br />
               estimate of revenue. I refer to Newfoundland- 
               <br />
               Labrador.... I now make another forecast and it is 
               <br />
               this: that if a Newfoundland government is ever 
               <br />
               in a position to capitalise on our Labrador posses- 
               <br />
               sion, she will in less than ten years be, for her size 
               <br />
               and population, the richest little country in the 
               <br />
               world. But why have we not heard more about the 
               <br />
               Labrador? Simply because it is not in the interests 
               <br />
               of those who want to exploit our territory to 
               <br />
               advertise the fact. They are keeping very quiet 
               <br />
               about it all.

               this Economic Report have gone far over the time
