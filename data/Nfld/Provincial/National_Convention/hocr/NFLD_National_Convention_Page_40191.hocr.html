               Mr. MacDonald I rise as a member of this 
               <br />
               Forestry Committee. I have been listening to 
               <br />
               criticism in regard to this report. A good many of 
               <br />
               the questions asked came before the Committee 
               <br />
               and we could not see any possible way of getting 
               <br />
               the information. For instance, the question of the 
               <br />
               value of timber on the Labrador. How can we get 
               <br />
               it? The Natural Resources department which 
               <br />
               gave us a lot of help, could not give us that 
               <br />
               answer. If we have to get that before this Conven-

               has been no survey made on Newfoundland ex-

               cept what we can get from companies; whatis left 
               <br />
               is only a guess. I would suggest that these 
               <br />
               gentlemen asking questions give us a list of them.

               <br />
