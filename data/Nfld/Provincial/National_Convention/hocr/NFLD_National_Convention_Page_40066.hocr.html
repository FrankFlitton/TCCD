               Newfoundland from the people who had money 
               <br />
               to invest, money made during the war, in order to 
               <br />
               pay off sterling debt. It was not spent. It was a 
               <br />
               conversion operation. That was a sound thing to 
               <br />
               do. In fact it has been suggested to me quite 
               <br />
               recently that we should go much further than that, 
               <br />
               and use our surplus to pay off external debt. It is 
               <br />
               required either for reconstruction development or 
               <br />
               to meet the needs of a rainy day. If we use the 
               <br />
               whole of that money now to pay off sterling loans 
               <br />
               or other loans —— the only ones we have to pay off 
               <br />
               — and depression hits us, or is required to go 
               <br />
               ahead with reconstruction development, we 
               <br />
               should have to borrow again. Why pay off 3% 
               <br />
               loans when, if the country went out to borrow, we 
               <br />
               would have to pay more than 3%? It is extremely 
               <br />
               doubtful if Newfoundland could go into the open 
               <br />
               market and borrow at 3% to a large extent. If we 
               <br />
               wanted a limited loan we would get 3%, but if we 
               <br />
               wanted more than $5-6 million we would have to 
               <br />
               go to Canada. Our experience in that regard, as 
               <br />
               far as Newfoundland is concerned, has been dis- 
               <br />
               appointing. Some of the work of the local 
               <br />
               branches of the savings committee was, I regret 
               <br />
               to say, disappointing.

               went to balance the budget. I do think, if we put

               a loan out we would get $2 or 3 million, but for 
               <br />
               a larger amount we would probably have trouble.

               <br />

               suggested having a preliminary meeting and then

               there was some delay; some nations were not

               slowed things The timetable is now drawn up.

               The ﬁrst meeting of the members of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Com“</span>

               monwealth and the dominions, and, of course, the 
               <br />
               colonies, will be held in London. The preliminary 
               <br />
               meeting is not to discuss detailed tariffs but ar- 
               <br />
               rangement of trade agreements such as banking, 
               <br />
               subsidies and matters of that kind; to determine

               their general attitude to matters which were a 
               <br />

               <br />
               ested in seeing that white paper, I think we could 
               <br />
               get a copy. The ﬁrst meeting will just be a 
               <br />
               preliminary. The second meeting follows imme- 
               <br />
               diately and is being attended by the bigger na- 
               <br />
               tions. It is an international affair. Then the 
               <br />
               delegates go home and wait until January 1; the

               the Chairman of the Board of Customs,

               Gushue. I am hoping that when they come back 
               <br />
               they will be able to throw light on the general 
               <br />

               tions will be of most interest. We have invited 
               <br />
               major manufacturing concerns in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               to submit their views. We were asked over six 
               <br />
               months ago to indicate what tariff concessions we 
               <br />
               would like from the United States. That is what 
               <br />
               would interest us <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">most,</span> We have had the beneﬁt

               <br />
               the paper companies. I have a list of the requests 
               <br />
               we want to make against other countries and 
               <br />
               dominions; they in turn will send us a list of what 
               <br />
               they want from us. We sent another circular to 
               <br />
               different associations and manufacturing con- 
               <br />
               cerns. There is a committee of the Board of Trade 
               <br />
               sitting with Mr. Howell to get this question set- 
               <br />
               tled. I do not think we could do more than that. 
               <br />
               We have not only to decide what beneﬁts we 
               <br />
               want from them but what we are prepared to give 
               <br />
