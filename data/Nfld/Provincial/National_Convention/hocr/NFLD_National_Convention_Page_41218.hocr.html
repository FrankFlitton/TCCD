               While we are at it, it would be interesting to

               see just how many persons are employed by our

               Newfoundland government today, both as civil 
               <br />
               servants and otherwise. In the civil service we

               in civil aviation we have 1,300, and of teachers 
               <br />
               we have 2,200, giving us a grand total employed

               by the Newfoundland government today of 
               <br />

               be under confederation? The federal government

               would take over 1,947 civil servants, 3,700 rail—

               readers and coastal boat men, and 1,304 for civil 
               <br />
               aviation, a total of nearly 7,000, which would 
               <br />
               leave a total of 4,864 still to be paid by the

               employed or paid by the provincial government

               I noticed that Major Cashin came back again

               to this question of what constitutes revenue for a 
               <br />
               government. It was in connection with my es- 
               <br />
               timates of what the provincial government would 
               <br />
               spend and collect. I included in that estimate

               you how far the United States government goes 
               <br />
               in this matter. If they lend money to another 
               <br />
               country then that entire amount goes into that 
               <br />

               back any interest or any of the principal then that 
               <br />
               goes in there as revenue. It is not a matter of

               quoting what Webster says about the meaning of 
               <br />
               “revenue”, it is a matter of knowing what is the

               actual practice of governments such as the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom, Canada and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">die</span> United States. I have 
               <br />
               followed their practice and I have done right. The 
               <br />
               Commission of Government did the same thing, 
               <br />

               Major Cashin says that confederation would

               <br />
               foundlanders. That clause will go, he says, and 
               <br />
               French Canadians will take the jobs from our 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders. There is not one word of truth 
               <br />
               in that statement. The agreement made with the 
               <br />
               Labrador Mining Company will stand, and every 
               <br />

               tion to stop any provincial government from 
               <br />
               making such an agreement with a company, as 
               <br />
               our government has made with this Labrador 
               <br />

               <br />
               sions, the Nova Scotia government can insert a 
               <br />
               clause in the agreement stating that nobody but

               government or any province can do that if it cares 
               <br />
               to do it. This argument is nothing but a political
