               Mr. Job I desire to make a few remarks with 
               <br />
               regard to the Ottawa proposals. I wish ﬁrst of all 
               <br />
               to make it absolutely clear that I’m not in prin— 
               <br />
               ciple against confederation, nor am I an anticon— 
               <br />
               federate, as suggested since by Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               to the Canadian press. I don’t want to be unkind, 
               <br />
               but that’s the fact. In order to avoid any 
               <br />
               misunderstanding as to the position I take in 
               <br />
               connection with the confederation issue, let me 
               <br />
               say that it was my View that unless the advantages 
               <br />
               and disadvantages of confederation with Canada 
               <br />
               are very clearly set forth, the electorate will not 
               <br />
               be placed in a position to fairly weigh the issue. 
               <br />
               And the outcome of the decision is so far-reach- 
               <br />
               ing and irretrievable that a snap judgement might 
               <br />
               be fatal for the future of our country. [doubt very 
               <br />
               much whether the disjointed debate which has 
               <br />
               gone out over the air from the Convention has 
               <br />
               conveyed any idea of the true position on this 
               <br />
               issue. In spite of the voluminous, valuable but 
               <br />
               still very incomplete information contained in the 
               <br />
               so-called Black Books compiled as the result of 
               <br />
               three months’ discussions in Ottawa, the situa- 
               <br />
               tion is far from clear. I’d like to say in that 
               <br />
               connection, that I’m not at all sure that those 
               <br />
               gentlemen who wired suggesting the return of the 
               <br />
               delegation from Ottawa should not have advised 
               <br />
               them to stop there for another six months; be— 
               <br />
               cause they could not in the time be expected to 
               <br />
               bring about a thorough, clear picture. The posi- 
               <br />
               tion is very far from being clear, and it is evident 
               <br />
               that it cannot possibly be made clear to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Con«</span> 
               <br />
               vention delegates or to the electorate prior to the

               month and that the referendum will be held in 
               <br />
               May. The question therefore arises as to whether 
               <br />

               The very ardent advocate and/or advocates of

               a general election would then be held. And there 
               <br />
               would then be an opportunity for those who

               <br />

               Newfoundland’s views as to a fair and equitable 
               <br />
               basis has not yet been formulated. It may be 
               <br />
               argued that in the case of the choice being Com- 
               <br />
               mission instead of responsible government there 
               <br />
               would not be a chance of considering the con— 
               <br />
               federation issue. I do not think that is necessarily 
               <br />
               correct. Presumably the continuation of Commis- 
               <br />
               sion government, if placed on the paper, will be 
               <br />
               with a limit of perhaps three or four years. And if 
               <br />
               that is the case, the government might be asked 
               <br />
               to set up a royal commission to endeavour to set 
               <br />
               forth more clearly the advantages and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disad»</span> 
               <br />
               vantages to Newfoundland of union with Canada. 
               <br />
               As an alternative to a royal commission, the idea 
               <br />
               expressed by Mr. Pratt, chairman of the New- 
               <br />
               foundland Industrial Board, might be adopted 
               <br />
               and the government might arrange for an expert 
               <br />
               economic survey of our position which would 
               <br />
               include details on the impact of confederation 
               <br />
               with Canada on our future prosperity. There 
               <br />
               should be no hurry to decide such an irretrievable 
               <br />
               step as the confederation issue. The electorate 
               <br />
               must be absolutely clear as to its effect before 
               <br />
               voting on it. We have not yet got all the facts by 
               <br />
               a very long way.

               Now, sir, I wish to emphasise that Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood must have been aware of the views I 
               <br />
               have just expressed before he sent that despatch 
               <br />
               to the Canadian newspapers. I made them clear 
               <br />
               on 6 December last through the local press. I do 
               <br />
               not take it lightly that Mr. Smallwood would let 
               <br />
               anything of importance go in the newspaper. 
               <br />
               However, I will forgive this indiscretion and call 
               <br />
               it a politician’s license to discourage an op— 
               <br />
               ponent. There is probably no one in this assembly 
               <br />
               who takes a more independent view than I do 
               <br />
               upon the subject which we have been sent here to 
               <br />
               discuss. I offered myself as candidate without 
               <br />
               any expectation of future political associations, 
               <br />
               which is easily imaginable in view of my age and
