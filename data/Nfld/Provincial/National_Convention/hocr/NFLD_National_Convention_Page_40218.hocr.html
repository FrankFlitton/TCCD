               Mr. Crosbie I did not expect to get into this this 
               <br />
               afternoon. By the word “assets” 1 mean every~ 
               <br />
               thing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> the water that runs; power mken from

               that water; trees; fish around the shores we con-

               trol; timber; anything that is under New- 
               <br />
               foundland domain. I used the word “natural 
               <br />
               resources” today. You do not have to go back 
               <br />
               very far to ﬁnd $8 million loaned free of interest; 
               <br />
               $2 million borrowed at interest. It does not make 
               <br />
               sense. That is why I deliberately used the word 
               <br />
               “asset”. Mr. Smallwood thinks it might mean that

               <br />
               “disposal” with which I am concerned. We are

               <br />
               had a lot of criticism because we have had no 
               <br />
               public sessions; if we had had public sessions, 
               <br />
               there would not have been much assets left to play 
               <br />
               with. What we have left, for goodness’ sake let 
               <br />
               us hold on to. I will head a parade, sure, but it may

               Mr. Hollett Irise to support the motion made by 
               <br />
               Mr. Crosbie. Mr. Smallwood thinks we are 
               <br />
               taking it in a lukewarm manner. I think it is 
               <br />
               because each of us agrees that it should have been 
               <br />
               on the carpet long ago. I feel the hopelessness of 
               <br />
               the situation. All we can do is pass our opinion 
               <br />
               on the disposal of assets. The Commission of 
               <br />
               Government, and I probably should say the 
               <br />
               Dominions Ofﬁce, will take no more note of our 
               <br />
               opinion than throw it in the wastepaper basket.
