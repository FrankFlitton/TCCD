               Mr. MacDonald I wouldn’t have asked, Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, only the invitation was put to any 
               <br />
               person who wished to rise. I could have very well 
               <br />
               left it alone for that matter. But it’s not my 
               <br />
               intention to address the Convention at any length 
               <br />
               on the subject matter now before the Chair, as it 
               <br />
               is more than probable that most of it will be 
               <br />
               repeated again when the question of recommen- 
               <br />
               dations arises. We have heard various opinions 
               <br />
               and many contradictions on the subject of the 
               <br />
               proposals for union with Canada. What results as 
               <br />
               far as the members of this Convention and the 
               <br />
               people of the country are concerned is a matter 
               <br />
               of opinion. I take it, Mr. Chairman, that the idea 
               <br />
               of holding our sessions in public, and that of 
               <br />
               installing the microphones in this chamber, was 
               <br />
               for the purpose of acquainting our people as to 
               <br />
               what was going on and informing them as to the 
               <br />
               economic and ﬁnancial position of this country 
               <br />
               of ours and giving them the facts. I repeat, Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">facts...</span> I submit that a good many 
               <br />
               of our thinking people are more bewildered than 
               <br />
               they were when we started 16 months ago. We 
               <br />
               have disagreed and wrangled about every point 
               <br />
               that has been brought forward in our various 
               <br />
               debates, often descending to tactics more worthy 
               <br />
               of a gathering in a pub or the oft-quoted beer 
               <br />
               parties than that of a body of men gathered 
               <br />
               together to consider the future of our country. We 
               <br />
               have individually criticised and abused almost 
               <br />
               everything from the British Dominions Ofﬁce 
               <br />
               down to the Commission of Government to the 
               <br />
               Convention itself and the members thereof, I 
               <br />
               might add. Now do not let us forget this part. That 
               <br />
               whatever our individual opinions may be of the 
               <br />
               necessity of this Convention, we must realise that 
               <br />
               the people who voted in the election of 1946 did 
               <br />
               so in all good faith, and sent their respective 
               <br />
               delegates to this Convention not only to make 
               <br />
               recommendations as to possible forms of govern- 
               <br />
               ment, but also to get information for them so that 
               <br />
               when the time came for the referendum they 
               <br />
               would be a position to decide intelligently as to 
               <br />
               the type of government which in their opinion 
               <br />
               would be the best in the interests of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ner</span> 
               <br />
               foundland. Have we succeeded in this? Or has 
               <br />
               our time been more occupied in using this Con~ 
               <br />
               vention as a forum from which to preach our own 
               <br />
               particular form of political ideology? In this very

               <br />
               wise of Newfoundland to generations yet unborn. 
               <br />
               We have heard these proposals very ably, if 
               <br />
               somewhat heatedly at various times, supported 
               <br />
               by Mr. Smallwood. We have heard them also 
               <br />
               very ably and sometimes heatedly criticised by 
               <br />
               Major Cashin and other speakers. We have heard 
               <br />
               a lot about sales taxes, excise taxes, etc., even 
               <br />
               hidden taxes such as shoe taxes and gasoline 
               <br />
               taxes and so on. But we have not stopped to 
               <br />
               explain that outside of local sales tax, we are 
               <br />
               possibly paying all these taxes every time we buy 
               <br />
               these goods from Canada at the present time... 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, we are nearing the end of our 
               <br />
               deliberations as a National Convention. In the 
               <br />
               course of our work we have accumulated a great 
               <br />
               quantity of information, both essential and non- 
               <br />
               essential, and in what way are we to present all 
               <br />
               the facts to the people is the question which 
               <br />
               concerns me considerably. I doubt that the mem- 
               <br />
               bers of this Convention can even agree on facts. 
               <br />
               I do not know yet what choices of government 
               <br />
               will be placed on the ballot papers. But whatever 
               <br />
               they may be, the people are entitled to know the 
               <br />
               pros and cons of each form of government placed 
               <br />
               before them. If this is not done, then we have 
               <br />
               failed miserably in our efforts of the past 16 
               <br />
               months. The people want to know whether con- 
               <br />
               federation will lower their cost of living and thus 
               <br />
               raise their standard of living. Andi don’t think it 
               <br />
               can be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contradicted,</span> and I state this on very good 
               <br />
               authority, Mr. Chairman, that the cost of a 
               <br />
               month’s groceries in New Brunswick is consid- 
               <br />
               erably less then one half of that in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               at the present time in spite of the austerity 
               <br />
               programme. And I state that on good authority. 
               <br />
               They will also want to know as to whether it is to 
               <br />
               their advantage to have the whole Dominion of 
               <br />
               Canada open to their sons and daughters when 
               <br />
               they are unable to get renumerative positions at 
               <br />
               home. That’s another matter that’s never been 
               <br />
               brought up. Of if they wish to advance themsel- 
               <br />
               ves more quickly in their chosen trades or profes- 
               <br />
               sions and not as at the present time be treated as 
               <br />
               foreigners and be admitted on a quota. These 
               <br />
               things and scores of others they will want to 
               <br />
               know. I agree with Mr. Higgins that the proposals 
               <br />
               are good as a fair and equitable basis on which to 
               <br />
               work, and undoubtedly the proper authorities 
               <br />
               who would ﬁnalise the deal, if the people so wish, 
               <br />
               would recognise this and possibly get further 
               <br />
