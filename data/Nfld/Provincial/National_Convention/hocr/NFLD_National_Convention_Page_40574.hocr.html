               We pointed out to the representatives of the 
               <br />
               British government that the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               delegation was deeply conscious of the condition 
               <br />
               of affairs generally in the mother country, but that 
               <br />
               at the same time we were fully aware of what the 
               <br />
               saving of $1 million annually would mean to the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland, who after all had suf— 
               <br />
               fered more than their share of hardship and priva— 
               <br />
               tion in the past. We took occasion to draw the 
               <br />
               attention of the Dominions Secretary to the ab- 
               <br />
               normal rise in our public expenditures during the 
               <br />
               past six or seven years, when such expenditures 
               <br />
               have risen from $16 million in 1940 to over $38 
               <br />
               million this year. We suggested that there was no 
               <br />
               sound reason for these excessive capital expen- 
               <br />
               ditures, and that in our opinion under no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cir~</span> 
               <br />
               cumstances should the expenditures exceed the 
               <br />
               revenues, and that our present cash balances 
               <br />
               should be conserved. We further pointed out that 
               <br />
               the application of this $9.25 million interest-free 
               <br />
               loan to Britain to the reduction of our sterling debt 
               <br />
               was a sound business proposition, and that such 
               <br />
               a disposition of this money would in no way 
               <br />
               effect the dollar situation in Great Britain. Our 
               <br />
               efforts to get any commitment in respect to this 
               <br />
               matter were of no avail, and as usual we were 
               <br />
               informed by Viscount Addison that these matters 
               <br />
               had already been considered by the Commission 
               <br />
               government.

               With regard to the operation of Gander airport, 
               <br />
               it will be seen from the interchange of memoran- 
               <br />
               da that under the new arrangement New- 
               <br />
               foundland is being held liable for a minimum of 
               <br />
               $250,000 a year deﬁcit on the operation of this 
               <br />
               international air highway. Our delegation feltthat 
               <br />
               because Newfoundland as a country was not in- 
               <br />
               terested in the air transport business, and par- 
               <br />
               ticularly in View of the fact that several foreign 
               <br />
               airlines were using the facilities of the airport, our 
               <br />
               country should not be called upon to pay any 
               <br />
               deﬁcit that might be incurred in its operation. 
               <br />
               However, under the present circumstances it is 
               <br />
               quite evident that both the Dominions Ofﬁce and

               <br />
               any deficit that might be incurred. Nevertheless, 
               <br />
               it was pointed out to us that in the event of the

               administration of this particular airport. There is 
               <br />
               no doubt in my mind, Mr. Chairman, that the 
               <br />
               British government is using this airport for inter-

               You will observe that in our memorandum to

               the United Kingdom government, we stressed the

               under the present trying times which their

               position to take the matter up with the American

               With regard to matters of trade and tariffs, we 
               <br />
               pressed with all our ability the importance of the 
               <br />
               purchase by Great Britain of substantial quan- 
               <br />
               tities of our fresh and frozen ﬁsh. We took oc— 
               <br />
               casion to point out that during the war they had 
               <br />
               purchased considerable quantities of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland’s fishery products at much lower 
               <br />
               prices than we could have obtained from the 
               <br />
               United States. They invariably replied sym~ 
               <br />
               pathetically, but stated that their great difﬁculty 
               <br />
               was the dollar exchange. When the matter of their 
               <br />
               buying some 12,000 tons of fish from Iceland and 
               <br />
               over 20 million pounds from Norway was 
               <br />
               brought to their attention, the Secretary of State 
               <br />
               informed us that he was writing the Chancellor 
               <br />
               of the Exchequer on the whole matter. It was 
               <br />
               pointed out to them that this very year <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> 
               <br />
               foundland had purchased three ships from Great 
               <br />
               Britain at a cost of some $2.5 million and that in 
               <br />
               our opinion they should have taken ﬁsh in pay- 
               <br />
               ment, instead of transferring these dollars to the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom from the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               treasury, and not even buying our fish. At this 
               <br />
               point the representatives of the United Kingdom 
               <br />
               became somewhat indignant, because they felt 
               <br />
               that the people of Newfoundland would not mind 
               <br />
