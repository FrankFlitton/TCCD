               <br />
               Mr. Jackman I am beginning to get at home 
               <br />
               now, and I welcome this opportunity to explain 
               <br />
               the economic relationship which exists on Bell 
               <br />
               Island today. You will note on page 4 that there 
               <br />
               was a closedown of the mine in 1943 due to 
               <br />
               labour trouble. The workers at Bell Island 
               <br />
               decided that things were not as we would like 
               <br />
               them to be. We could not live... We decided we 
               <br />
               wanted more money for our work. Well, the 
               <br />
               thought was to throw us out of work, but we came 
               <br />
               back and got things adjusted between us, but not 
               <br />
               as we wanted them. All around that time, 1943- 
               <br />
               44-45, the relationship between labour and 
               <br />
               management on Bell Island was a dog-eat-dog 
               <br />
               relationship, but early in the year we negotiated 
               <br />
               a new contract. I believe that if the same relation— 
               <br />
               ship between capital and labour which exists on 
               <br />
               Bell Island today could be brought into effect 
               <br />
               throughout Newfoundland, we would not have 
               <br />
               any worry about how we are going to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">live.</span> We 
               <br />
               would be self-supporting. Here is the exact <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">posi«</span> 
               <br />
               tion. In order for our people to live we must have 
               <br />
               an outside market for our output. The only per- 
               <br />
               manent market we had before was the Sydney 
               <br />
               market, and that would only give us about two 
               <br />
               days a week. I must give the Commission of 
               <br />
               Government credit for helping in this matter, 
               <br />
               especially Commissioner Neill. We were very 
               <br />
               anxious to obtain an English market to absorb our 
               <br />
               extra output. In order to do so we had to get 
               <br />
               around the table, not with chips on our shoulders, 
               <br />
               but get down to work it out between ourselves 
               <br />
               and ﬁnd out how we could get at it. Anyway, the 
               <br />
               management told us that they could break in on 
               <br />
               an English market for 750,000 tons of ore, but the 
               <br />
               question was the matter of price. We decided that 
               <br />
               this market would be a beneﬁt the whole com- 
               <br />
               munity and the whole country, so we decided we 
               <br />
               would get out and get this market. The manage- 
               <br />
               ment were very fair and very frank and put their 
               <br />
               cards on the table. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now I know there are certain men over on Bell 
               <br />
               Island listening to me now, and it is quite possible

               <br />

               <br />
               anything for the common good. Anyway, the 
               <br />
               company put their cards on the table and so did 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we,</span> We wanted to live and so did they. This 
               <br />
               market meant 750,000 tons of ore, so we forgot 
               <br />
               our differences in I943 and got down and shook 
               <br />
               hands and decided that we were going out to get 
               <br />
               this market. Now the reason I bring this up is 
               <br />
               because I feel regardless of what our people 
               <br />
               decide on later with regard to forms of govem- 
               <br />
               ment, that it is not the forms of government that 
               <br />
               count but the effect they have...

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now as I said a moment ago, there are a few 
               <br />
               who would knock my head off because I am 
               <br />
               standing with the company. I am not standing 
               <br />
               with the company or anyone, but we got together 
               <br />
               and in order to get that market it took co-opera— 
               <br />
               tion on both sides. Labour and management are 
               <br />
               working hand in hand, and if you will notice here 
               <br />
               anything over 5,000 tons of ore we all share in 
               <br />
               the proﬁt. We have a general bonus for everyone, 
               <br />
               but when we get above 5,000 tons everyone gets 
               <br />
               his share. For example, our basic rate of pay is 58 
               <br />
               cents an hour, but after we got this working, the 
               <br />
               very ﬁrst week every man on this job got 3 cents 
               <br />
               an hour extra because of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">production...</span>
