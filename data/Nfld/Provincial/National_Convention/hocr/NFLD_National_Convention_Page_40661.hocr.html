               was lecturing on electricity, and he caught this 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               is this. I have taken the value of our country’s 
               <br />
               exports every year as being the nearest we’ve got

               Mr. Chairman In that case Mr. Smallwood, 
               <br />
               may I suggest that members use approximate 
               <br />
               ﬁgures. If there are no ofﬁcial ﬁgures or statistics 
               <br />
               available, then I think one can’t go wrong if he 
               <br />
               gives his ﬁgures as approximate ﬁgures, bearing 
               <br />
               in mind the fact that his figures are given to the 
               <br />
               best of his ability and to his knowledge.

               Mr. Smallwood Yes. Here is a country which 
               <br />
               exports just about everything it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">produces.</span> We 
               <br />
               grow some vegetables and we produce other 
               <br />
               things for our own use that we don’t export. But 
               <br />
               in the main, here is a country which exports to 
               <br />
               other markets most of what it produces. So what 
               <br />
               I’ve done is this. I’ve taken the value of the 
               <br />
               country’s exports every year from 1900 to 1947 
               <br />
               as being the nearest we can get to a value of the 
               <br />
               country’s wealth produced each year. I’ve taken 
               <br />
               the total expenditure of the government and com- 
               <br />
               pared it each year for the 47 years with the total 
               <br />
               value of all our exports. And I’ve reduced it to 
               <br />
               percentages to show what percentage of the total 
               <br />
               exports is taken by the government and spent for 
               <br />
               public purposes. 
               <br />
