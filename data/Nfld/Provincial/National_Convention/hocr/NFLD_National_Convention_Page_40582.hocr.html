               Finally, I want to say a word of congratulation 
               <br />
               to Major Cashin on his speech yesterday. I have 
               <br />
               no doubt that he fought in London, along with the 
               <br />
               other delegates, to get all he could for New— 
               <br />
               foundland; butI also know that in his heart it must 
               <br />
               have been very little he expected from a country 
               <br />
               that is up against what Britain is up against today. 
               <br />
               I do not expect that he or the delegates can be 
               <br />
               disappointed. If I wanted to be nasty, I could take 
               <br />
               up his speech and criticise it, but I want Major 
               <br />
               Cashin to back me up. I want to make him my 
               <br />
               minister of ﬁnance. He has been ﬁghting for 
               <br />
               responsible government, and I believe he is as 
               <br />
               sincere in that as I may be in ﬁghting for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com</span> 
               <br />
               federation if we get good terms. If I wanted to 
               <br />
               make him angry, I would say what Sir Edward 
               <br />
               Morris said (standing about where I am standing 
               <br />
               now) to Sir William Coaker. He said (pointing his 
               <br />
               ﬁnger at Sir William), “I will get you when I want 
               <br />
               you.” I will not say that, because I am sure of one 
               <br />
               thing; if the day ever comes when Major Cashin 
               <br />
               makes up his mind that there is a better chance to 
               <br />
               get rid of Commission of Government by going 
               <br />
               into confederation, I believe he will be a con- 
               <br />
               federate from that day.

               Yesterday Major Cashin gave us some news. 
               <br />
               He told us that he brought back from London the 
               <br />
               ﬁrm opinion that the British government would 
               <br />
               be pleased if Newfoundland did throw in her lot 
               <br />
               with the Dominion of Canada. I do not know if 
               <br />
               Lord Addison or the prime minister told him that, 
               <br />
               but he told us, and I hope he is right. Major 
               <br />
               Cashin, like myself, is an old-timer; he has been 
               <br />
               gauging public opinion for a long time. If the

               people of Newfoundland thought that the British 
               <br />
               government would like us to link up with Canada, 
               <br />
               that will make more confederates in New- 
               <br />
               foundland than Joe Smallwood could make if I 
               <br />
               am talking for a year. There is another hit of news. 
               <br />
               He said that up in Ottawa they are pleased that 
               <br />
               this delegation is going up there; they are 
               <br />
               delighted; they are not writing back and demand- 
               <br />
               ing to know this, that, and the other thing; they 
               <br />
               said, “Come on up", with their heart in their hand. 
               <br />
               He said the joy bells will ring. I hope they are 
               <br />
               glad, because if the joy bells ring out in Ottawa, 
               <br />
               it means they really want Newfoundland; and that 
               <br />
               means they will give us better terms than i am 
               <br />
               hoping for now, and I will get out fighting for 
               <br />
               confederation and a better Newfoundland.

               Mr. Crosbie I agree with Mr. Smallwood when 
               <br />
               he said that some members of the delegation were 
               <br />
               not disappointed. I know I was not disappointed 
               <br />
               with the information we got. I was very pleased 
               <br />
               we got the information from the Dominions Of- 
               <br />

               We ought to remember the plight of the British 
               <br />
               people is a very serious one. No one could go to 
               <br />
               England, meet the people and see what they have 
               <br />
               to put up with in the way of shortages, without 
               <br />
               realising how high a price they paid for victory, 
               <br />
               and are still paying. On top of that, they have had 
               <br />
               a good deal of bad luck. Everything seemed to 
               <br />
               come together and it is astonishing to see how 
               <br />
               cheerful they are in the face of all their trouble, 
               <br />

               I have heard it said we went to England to ask 
               <br />
               for help. That was never in my mind, and I am 
               <br />
               sure it was never in the mind of any of my 
               <br />
               colleagues on the delegation. We did not want 
               <br />
               help, and sought for nothing except what we felt 
               <br />
               Newfoundland was entitled to, and what was fair. 
               <br />
               We did want information, and we thought we 
               <br />
               were entitled to discuss and ask for trade agree- 
               <br />
               ments with England... On the ﬁnancial side, all 
               <br />
               we wanted was the right to suggest that the money 
               <br />
               on interest-free loan in England should be used 
               <br />
               to reduce our debt. That would have saved us 
               <br />
               about $400,000 a year in interest and sinking fund 
               <br />
               at no cost to Britain. In fact, since she guarantees 
               <br />
               the debt, it would be helpful to her to have a good 
               <br />
               slice of it paid off by our cancellation of a dollar
