               <br />

               <br />
               $260,000 already... The revenue from motor 
               <br />
               licenses and drivers’ licenses is shooting up as 
               <br />
               more roads are built and more motor cars and 
               <br />

               revenue is going up very rapidly under that head-

               Item no. 3 is examination fees for drivers’

               <br />
               up a bit, but I did not. Item no. 4 is payments from

               <br />

               <br />
               it at $4,000. Number 8 is fees for inspection of 
               <br />

               <br />
               $500 for the four years. Number 9 is rentals of 
               <br />
               mineral leases, royalties, etc., $90,000, and if I 
               <br />
               had anything to do with the Government of New-

               <br />
               we had spent four years in union that would be 
               <br />
               easily a lot more than $90,000, but I am leaving 
               <br />
               the ﬁgure that the government gives. It is scan-

               the government from gasoline is shooting sky 
               <br />
               high. I will give you an example. The revenue 
               <br />
               from gasoline at the present time is got from 
               <br />
               customs duty. They collect one cent a gallon on 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen’s gas, 14 cents a gallon on ordinary 
               <br />
               gasoline off the Avalon Peninsula, and l6 cents 
               <br />
               a gallon on the Avalon Peninsula. and the total 
               <br />
               amount in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l94l'42</span> was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$600,000,</span> Last year. it 
               <br />
               was getting up towards $l million. The exact 
               <br />
               amount was $922,000. 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood Yes, on gasoline alone, not

               <br />
               collected in that one year just on gasoline, and so 
               <br />
               I have put what I claim to be a most modest 
               <br />
               figure... Of course under confederation we 
               <br />
               would not collect any customs duties on gasoline, 
               <br />

               <br />
               gasoline <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tax.</span> Now in my estimate I did not in- 
               <br />
               clude any tax whatever on fishermen‘s gasoline, 
               <br />
               or what is commonly known as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“Auto“.</span> 1 think 
               <br />
               that as that gasoline enters directly and basically 
               <br />
               into two of the basic industries of the country, that 
               <br />
               that gasoline ought not to have any tax what- 
               <br />
               soever so far as customs duty is concerned. 
               <br />
