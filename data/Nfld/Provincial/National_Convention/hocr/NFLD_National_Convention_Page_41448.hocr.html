               Mr. Chairman, during my business life I have 
               <br />
               had business dealings with Canadians, and I have 
               <br />
               found some of them to be as crooked as God is 
               <br />
               straight; and if we give them the monopoly of our 
               <br />
               trade that Mr. Smallwood advocates, I predict 
               <br />
               that within ﬁve years, if we can survive at all, the 
               <br />
               majority of Newfoundlanders will be obliged to 
               <br />
               leave their island home and seek refuge in some 
               <br />
               foreign land, or be no better situated than if we 
               <br />
               all lived on the most northerly part of Labrador. 
               <br />
               I really believe that. After all, Canadians, in the 
               <br />
               Canadian government or out, are only ordinary 
               <br />
               individuals and are as subject to taking advantage 
               <br />
               from monopolies as people from any other land. 
               <br />
               And I do not blame them, no more than I do the 
               <br />
               people who have the monopoly of trade in this 
               <br />
               country. I do blame the governments who give 
               <br />
               these monopolies to the people who enjoy them 
               <br />
               to the detriment of the people in general. If we go 
               <br />
               into confederation with Canada, and that country 
               <br />
               takes advantage of the monopolies given, which 
               <br />
               is only natural to expect them to do, I will blame 
               <br />
               it on the advocates of confederation, and on Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood in particular. No one in this chamber 
               <br />
               knows better than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr,</span> Smallwood how hitterl am 
               <br />
               against monopolies. I do regard them as parasites, 
               <br />
               because they are sure to eat into the life of any 
               <br />
               business into which they are allowed to apply. It 
               <br />
               is senseless, criminal, devilish and the worst 
               <br />
               thing to happen in any country. It is a scourge that 
               <br />
               everybody in this country should ﬁght.

               the TB germs in this country are only angels 
               <br />
               compared with that monstrous parasite called 
               <br />

               <br />
               protected by the laws of the land to devour us. It 
               <br />
               has been in the past, and if we the people do not 
               <br />
               crush it in its infancy, there is no hope for us. If 
               <br />
               there had been no monopolies in this country, I 
               <br />

               <br />

               make if that germ monopolies is given as outlined

               I intended to speak when the debate on the 
               <br />
               proposals for confederation was taking place and 
               <br />

               subjected to deception, or in any light they would 
               <br />
               persuade the electorate to vote for confederation, 
               <br />
               without giving it any consideration if it was bad 
               <br />
               or good for this country; and I, not being inter— 
               <br />
               ested in any party politics, did not feel inclined to 
               <br />
               take part in a political campaign at that time.

               Mr. Chairman, as I said before, we New~ 
               <br />
               foundlanders were accused of being touchy and 
               <br />
               suspicious, of which I plead guilty. I will admit 
               <br />
               my suspicions have been greatly aroused during 
               <br />
               the past five weeks, and time alone will show me 
               <br />
               if my suspicions were well-founded; and the fact 
               <br />
               that monopolies have been introduced in the offer 
               <br />
               of confederation with Canada. I cannot support 
               <br />
               the motion. My not supporting this motion does 
               <br />
               not mean that I am taking away the privilege of 
               <br />
               the people from voting for confederation with 
               <br />
               Canada; because the advocates of confederation 
               <br />
               can vote for responsible government to be placed 
               <br />
               on the ballot paper in the referendum this spring, 
               <br />
               and if responsible government wins, they can 
               <br />
               place a party in the field and issue a manifesto 
               <br />
               setting forth just what taxes we will be called 
               <br />
               upon to pay if we become a province of Canada, 
               <br />
               and guarantee the electorate that we will not be 
               <br />
               called upon to give Canada the monopoly of all 
               <br />
               our trade; also that the province will not be called 
               <br />
               upon to pay any property tax, and no settlement 
               <br />
               will be forced against the people’s will to form 
               <br />
               town councils, as promised by Mr. Smallwood — 
               <br />
               this will be giving the people something definite 
               <br />
               to vote for. If that is done, I will be one of the 
               <br />
               most ardent supporters of confederation in this 
               <br />
