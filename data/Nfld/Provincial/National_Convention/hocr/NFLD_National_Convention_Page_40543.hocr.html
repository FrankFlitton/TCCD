               power, would Mr. Higgins be able to tell us about 
               <br />
               the scope and cost of the survey which the 
               <br />
               government intends to make here, having this 
               <br />
               engineer come in for a short time? 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins I am afraid the Mining Committee 
               <br />
               knows very little as to the scope of his work. I 
               <br />
               assume he is not far enough advanced to tell us 
               <br />
               what he proposes to do. but from what little 
               <br />
               information we have, he is going to assess the 
               <br />
               horsepower of each of the rivers in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundh</span> 
               <br />
               land, whether they are granted or ungranted. 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashboume Do you know the cost? 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins No. He is on a regular salary, and 
               <br />
               I presume whatever help he is going to require, 
               <br />
               plus his salary, will be the cost. 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne I think it is a very pertinent 
               <br />
               question. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins I agree with you, and as you know 
               <br />
               from our report, we comment that we approve of 
               <br />
               such an appointment, and we think it should have 
               <br />
               been made many years ago. Unfortunately, prac~ 
               <br />
               tically all the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">waterhpowerin</span> the country has been 
               <br />
               given away, and in a good many cases for that 
               <br />
               very valuable article, a peppercom, whatever that 
               <br />
               rs. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Do I understand that the counsel for 
               <br />
               the plaintiff lost the case or won it? Some person 
               <br />
               owning property sued the Housing Corporation 
               <br />
               for expropriating their property? 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins Yes, they were suing the Housing 
               <br />
               Corporation on the grounds that they no powers 
               <br />
               to expropriate their land. Judgement was given 
               <br />
               against the plaintiff. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood On the grounds that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">plain</span> 
               <br />
               tiff was local and not foreign? 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins That does not come into it. The 
               <br />
               judge ruled that the act had been properly 
               <br />
               negotiated and the assentof the Secretary of State 
               <br />
               had been obtained... 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins Is that all on that particular point? 
               <br />
               If so, we will go on to the next part of the report.

               planation, and so that there will be no doubt I 
               <br />
               would like to read that. “iron ore is the cheapest 
               <br />
               metal commodity in the world ore deposits on 
               <br />

               <br />
               comment on that explanation was this: “Your 
               <br />
               Committee does not find itself in a position to 
               <br />
               accept this explanation, as we are of the opinion 
               <br />
               that even though the company operating the iron 
               <br />
               ore deposits may not be actually showing a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sub</span>

               <br />
               steel manufacturing company, is actually making 
               <br />
               real proﬁt. As far as we can gather, the companies 
               <br />
               operating the deposits are merely holding com- 
               <br />
               panies of some large steel manufacturing cor- 
               <br />
               porations."2 With respect to that comment of the 
               <br />
               Mining Committee, I have to inform you that the 
               <br />
               members of the Committee are not in full <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agree‘</span> 
               <br />
               ment, consequently it was decided that they 
               <br />
               should bring up the matter and, having heard all 
               <br />
               the comments and the reasons, you could either 
               <br />
               order that section deleted or otherwise. However, 
               <br />
               we are not able to go into the full argument on 
               <br />
               that right now. When this section was put in we 
               <br />
               did not have the Quebec act, which is before you 
               <br />
               now. This morning, we had a meeting with the 
               <br />

               <br />
               Mr. Claude Howse and Mr. George Allen. I want

               we let it stand at that point till I get the minutes,

               and in the meantime the Secretary will continue
