               good grace by the members at that private ses-

               <br />

               <br />
               down to try and get the facts myself, so that the 
               <br />
               people of this country would know the facts of

               <br />
               excise duties of $7,916,000, and I have got to add 
               <br />
               to that the excise duty on imported cigarettes, 
               <br />
               which is $568,000, which makes $8,484,000. 
               <br />
               Customs duties I have laid down $5,544,000, 
               <br />
               sales tax local —in Newfoundland we have quite 
               <br />
               a lot of local production. For instance we have 
               <br />
               beer and tobacco and soft drinks, and those three 
               <br />

               Now, I did ask <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr,</span> Smallwood a question 
               <br />
               when this debate ﬁrst started, whether ﬁshery salt 
               <br />
               was subject to sales tax. I believe now that it is, 
               <br />
               and if so it means over $40 million which the 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen will have to pay on salt to process fish. 
               <br />
               I think you will ﬁnd that ﬁshery salt is subject to 
               <br />
               sales tax.

               <br />
               it would be reduced more than 40%, so I have laid 
               <br />
               that down at $1 million. I have a total of sales tax
