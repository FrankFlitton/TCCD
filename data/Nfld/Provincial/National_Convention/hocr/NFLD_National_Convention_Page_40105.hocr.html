               throughout this island I move this resolution. I

               adopt this resolution, and Canada offers us 
               <br />
               generous terms, as I believe she will, and New- 
               <br />
               foundland decides to shake off her ancient iso- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the people will bless the day this resolution was

               Mr. Higgins Mr. Chairman, I had no intention 
               <br />
               of seconding this motion. I want to make myself 
               <br />
               quite clear at the onset with respect to that. I do 
               <br />
               intend to second it. My purpose in doing so I will 
               <br />
               explain as I go on. I entirely disagree with 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood’s statements, entirely. Idon’t in- 
               <br />
               tend to adopt them in any one whit. But the 
               <br />
               motion that he makes is for the acquiring, as far 
               <br />
               as the Convention is concerned, of a fact which 
               <br />
               is actually as important as any fact that we have 
               <br />
               had presented here to us today. It is important for 
               <br />

               one reason, that is that we may disabuse our 
               <br />
               minds for once and all of this business of con- 
               <br />
               federation. I do believe that we have to get the 
               <br />
               terms of confederation. I do believe the country 
               <br />
               expects it, and certainly we can hear from the ﬁre 
               <br />
               of Mr. Smallwood’s speech that he is going to be 
               <br />
               one person who makes us expect confederation 
               <br />
               as a form of government to be considered. 
               <br />
               Whether good or bad, whether it meets with our 
               <br />
               ideas of the economy of the country or not, it is 
               <br />
               still a fact, and as a fact that we must ascertain, I 
               <br />
               second the motion. It is just as real a fact as that 
               <br />
               we ascertain the report of the Forestry Committee 
               <br />
               today. To me, Mr. Chairman, it is in this class. 
               <br />
               We have heard of St. George’s coal ﬁelds, most 
               <br />
               of us, all our lives. A lot of us are beginning to 
               <br />
               doubt very much the value of St. Georges’ coal 
               <br />
               ﬁelds, but we are determined to ﬁnd out, if we 
               <br />
               can, if they have value. I doubt very frankly if the 
               <br />
               terms that Mr. Smallwood envisages from 
               <br />
               Canada are going to be very much better than we 
               <br />
               got when we were not in nearly as good a posi- 
               <br />
               tion, as when the approach was made before. But 
               <br />
               it is a fact that we have to ascertain these terms, 
               <br />
               and in this spirit I second this motion. I want to 
               <br />
               be understood as not agreeing with Mr. Small— 
               <br />
               wood, and having no wish for confederation. 
               <br />
               Mr. Harrington Mr. Chairman, I felt solemn 
               <br />
               when I rose in this House to deliver my maiden 
               <br />
               speech on Thursday, September 12, but my feel- 
               <br />
               ings on that occasion were not half so intensely 
               <br />
               patriotic and righteous as they are today in speak- 
               <br />
               ing to the motion introduced by Mr. Smallwood. 
               <br />
               I feel it will be a great surprise to Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Small«</span> 
               <br />
               wood, who is quite convinced I am going to 
               <br />
               support his motion, to realise that on the contrary, 
               <br />
               I am strongly opposed to it, on factual, but, more 
               <br />
               important, on moral grounds. In the first place, I 
               <br />
               think his resolution is premature. This Conven— 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               have taken place in this country since 1934, and
