               He was an anticonfederate, and seeing a crowd 
               <br />
               before him, he could not resist the temptation to 
               <br />
               put over a cute piece of anticonfederate 
               <br />
               propaganda. He said, “Do you see that? That will 
               <br />
               be taxed under confederation. Do you see this and 
               <br />
               that? Everything will be taxed under confedera- 
               <br />
               tion.” He thought he was going to bluff these 
               <br />
               people, but there happened to be some men there 
               <br />
               who had lived and worked in Canada, and they 
               <br />
               were able to stand up and show up his lies. The 
               <br />
               anticonfederates think they have a trump card in 
               <br />
               this property tax, but they are not going to get 
               <br />
               away with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> We have too many people here 
               <br />
               today who have lived and worked in Canada, and 
               <br />
               too many who have relatives living and working 
               <br />
               in Canada for that bluff to be put over.

               Under confederation we will have two go- 
               <br />
               vernments over us ~— the federal government of 
               <br />
               Canada and the provincial government of New- 
               <br />
               foundland. The federal government of Canada 
               <br />
               never yet collected any property tax whatsoever. 
               <br />
               They never did and never will. The provincial 
               <br />
               government of course will be our own govem- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ment.</span> We will elect it, and they will sit here in 
               <br />
               this very chamber. They will never pass a law to 
               <br />
               collect property taxes from our people —— never, 
               <br />
               never, never, and if they ever become so foolish, 
               <br />
               if they ever become so foolish as to do it, why we 
               <br />
               will simply turn them out at the next election. It 
               <br />
               is as simple as that. No government in New— 
               <br />
               foundland would stand a week if they ever tried 
               <br />
               to put property taxes on us. So the federal govem- 
               <br />
               ment will collect no property taxes from us, and 
               <br />
               the provincial government will collect none from 
               <br />
               us. Who is left? The town council if left. If a town 
               <br />
               council exists in a settlement, no doubt that town 
               <br />
               council will collect a few local taxes, just as most 
               <br />
               town councils are already doing in New- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">foundland.</span> But it is left to the people of every 
               <br />
               town or settlement to decide for themselves 
               <br />
               whether they will have a town council or not. If 
               <br />
               they want one, they will have one. If they do not 
               <br />
               want one they will not have it. It is in their own 
               <br />
               hands. Nobody can force them. Mr. Claude Hicks 
               <br />
               of Fredericton, in Fogo District, says for example 
               <br />
               that he has a house, a barn and two acres of land, 
               <br />
               and he wants to know what tax he will have to 
               <br />
               pay on that property under confederation. I can— 
               <br />
               not answer that question until I know if the people 
               <br />

               of Fredericton will decide to have a town council. 
               <br />
               If the Fredericton people, including Mr. Hicks, 
               <br />
               should decide to have a town council, then per— 
               <br />
               haps the council will collect a small tax on his 
               <br />
               property <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~—</span> maybe a ﬁve dollar bill a year, or 
               <br />
               whatever the council decides. Maybe Mr. Hicks 
               <br />
               would be elected a member of that town council. 
               <br />
               If so he would help to decide what tax to put on 
               <br />
               his property. But if Fredericton decides not to 
               <br />
               have a town council, then there will be no tax at 
               <br />
               all on Mr. Hicks’ property, for there is no one to 
               <br />
               collect a tax on it. The Government of Canada 
               <br />
               will not tax his property, the provincial govern- 
               <br />
               ment of Newfoundland will not tax it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">w</span> so who 
               <br />
               is there to tax it if there is no town council in 
               <br />
               Fredericton? And remember that it is left to the 
               <br />
               people of Fredericton to decide whether they will 
               <br />
               have a town council or not — it is up to themsel- 
               <br />
               ves. Nobody can force them to have it. And what 
               <br />
               I say about Mr. Hicks applies to every man in 
               <br />
               Fredericton; and what I say about Fredericton 
               <br />
               applies to every settlement or town in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New»</span> 
               <br />
               foundland. But the people of Newfoundland need 
               <br />
               not worry; all this will be explained to them 
               <br />
               before the referendum is held. This is one time 
               <br />
               the anticonfederates are not going to bluff our 
               <br />
               people on this property tax question.

               Mr. Higgins did me the honour the other day 
               <br />
               of quoting from the speech I made when I intro— 
               <br />
               duced my motion more than a year ago, my 
               <br />
               motion that the Convention should send a delega- 
               <br />
               tion to Canada to seek the terms of union. I was 
               <br />
               greatly interested in the part of my speech that he 
               <br />
               read out, and to tell you the truth I thought it was 
               <br />
               very good. 1 am surprised that I made such a good 
               <br />
               speech on that occasion. Anyway, that made me 
               <br />
               look up my speech, and there was one paragraph 
               <br />
               that struck me very much. I think it is worth 
               <br />
               repeating. Here is what I said on that occasion, 
               <br />
               and now I quote my own words exactly:

               So now, Mr. Chairman, We know all the 
               <br />
               factors but one. We know that it is lawful for 
               <br />
               the Convention to send the delegation to Ot- 
               <br />
               tawa. We know that Ottawa will receive the 
               <br />
               delegation, and receive it cordially. We know 
               <br />
               that the opposition party will not oppose it. 
               <br />
               We know that the Canadian people will not 
               <br />
               oppose <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> The only thing we still don’t know 
               <br />
               is what the Newfoundland people want. We 
               <br />
               don’t know whether they want confederation
