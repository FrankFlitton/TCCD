               I am not going to discuss either the merits or

               think it is incumbent upon the Committee to

               ever, if you are going to discuss such things, 
               <br />
               perhaps it would be well for the Convention and 
               <br />
               the Committee to discuss not only the setting up 
               <br />
               of a merchant marine, but also the setting up of a 
               <br />
               Crown company to run that paper company on 
               <br />
               the south coast in which there will be a great deal 
               <br />
               of money. All our wealth in one form or another 
               <br />
               is being shipped <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">holuslbolus</span> out of the country.

               We have no control over it. We beneﬁt very little 
               <br />
               from it except in the matter of labour. While I am 
               <br />
               on this subject, I might offer this suggestion: how 
               <br />
               much stronger would the economy of this country 
               <br />
               be if the $8 million we have invested in the banks, 
               <br />
               were invested in organisations which could put 
               <br />
               that capital to work here in Newfoundland. Be- 
               <br />
               cause capital is the means of production, and as 
               <br />
               the report shows we have twice as much money 
               <br />
               as we had in 1934, or more. I imagine in the case 
               <br />
               of capital goods as well as money, we are also far 
               <br />
               ahead of 1934, and our means of production is a 
               <br />
               great deal ahead of what it was in 1934. To what 
               <br />
               greater extent than in 1934 is this means of 
               <br />
               production controlled and used by and for the 
               <br />
               people? The means of production, whether it lies 
               <br />
               in the Savings Bank, insurance or other forms, are 
               <br />
               being shipped out of this country and being used 
               <br />
               to produce wealth for other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">countries.1</span> Presum-

               <br />
               as in 1934, is Newfoundland producing twice as 
               <br />
               much wealth? Is the Labrador ﬁshery twice as 
               <br />
               great? Are we producing twice as much salmon,

               Newfoundland is hitched to the banking sys— 
               <br />
               tem of another country, with the result that real 
               <br />
               wealth leaks out of this country. Consequently, 
               <br />
               Newfoundland money is being used to develop 
               <br />
               and create wealth in other countries. As things 
               <br />
               stand at the moment the Canadian banks could 
               <br />
               depreciate Newfoundland‘s savings <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by'</span> 10% or 
               <br />
               15% at a stroke of a pen, and Newfoundland 
               <br />
               could not do a thing about it. One of the primary 
               <br />
               functions of a bank is the control of credit, and 
               <br />
               the control of Newfoundland’s credit is vested 
               <br />
               with outside <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interests.</span> This control could be used 
               <br />
               to Newfoundland’s disadvantage. When New- 
               <br />
               foundland went broke in 1934, for example, there 
               <br />
               was $25 million in the banks. Yet the government 
               <br />
               could not borrow this money. Newfoundland 
               <br />
               could not control the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">financial</span> system, and thus 
               <br />
               was not an independent ﬁnancial unit.

               Another point in Newfoundland’s economic 
               <br />
               set-up which bothers me is that this country has 
               <br />
               little control over the production of foodstuffs. 
               <br />
               The question of Newfoundland’s ability to 
               <br />
               double her agricultural production has been 
               <br />
               raised. But I wonder how far it can be pushed 
               <br />
               towards covering essential supplies. I am of the 
               <br />
               opinion that the gap left between this production 
               <br />
               and the actual requirements represents the degree 
               <br />
               to which Newfoundland must export or perish — 
               <br />
               in other words, the degree to which New- 
               <br />
               foundland is dependent on other countries, and 
               <br />
               thus the degree to which Newfoundland is de- 
               <br />
               pendent on the export policies of these other 
               <br />
               countries. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&gt;</span>

               it is a lack of trust in political leaders. They need 
               <br />
               new leaders, or old leaders with new ideas. The 
               <br />

               <br />
               lack of hope and trust. A recent storm did <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">13</span> 10,000

               people did not sit back and bemoan the fact, they 
               <br />
               began to rebuild.

               The report ends with the words of President

               Roosevelt: “We have nothing to fear but fear
