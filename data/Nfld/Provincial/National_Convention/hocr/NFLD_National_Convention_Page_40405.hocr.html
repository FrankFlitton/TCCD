               Mr. Job I think they would take a reasonable

               made these regulations — that a man should be 
               <br />

               Mr. Hollett I understood yesterday from Mr. 
               <br />
               Job that the fresh fish industry was at the moment 
               <br />
               more or less in the doldrums. I take it therefore 
               <br />
               that you, Mr. Job, would not be able to handle 
               <br />
               much more ﬁsh if conditions remain as they are? 
               <br />
               The amount of ﬁsh that you caught last year 
               <br />
               would be sufﬁcient to supply the markets that you 
               <br />

               Mr. Hollett I would like an explanation of this 
               <br />
               part on page 19A: “The Committee agrees that as 
               <br />
               many men as possible should be diverted into the 
               <br />

               Mr. Job You missed three important words — 
               <br />
               “and will permit”. If the market does not permit, 
               <br />
               you can’tdo <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> That’s the position at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">moment.</span> 
               <br />
               Unless the fresh fish boards can pay the same or 
               <br />
               a better price than the people who are salting their 
               <br />
               fish and selling it, they won’t get the ﬁsh. That’s 
               <br />
               the position that may occur this year. Last year 
               <br />
               we handled around this time a considerable num- 
               <br />
               ber of bankers. This year we are not going to be 
               <br />
               able to do that because the conditions are entirely 
               <br />
               different, but I think the quantity of fresh fish 
               <br />
               processed by the plant will greatly depend on the 
               <br />
               price of salted fish as against the price of fresh. 
               <br />
               We can’t expect to get the fresh ﬁsh at a cheaper 
               <br />
               price than can be realised by salting <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> It will 
               <br />
               more or less cure itself, that situation. At the 
               <br />
               present time it would seem it is better business to 
               <br />
               salt your fish. That situation may change, I hope 
               <br />
               it will. It will be a healthy thing to have both the 
               <br />
               plants and the salting go on together.

               <br />

               of the particular groups which will have to make

               in marketing for a small group would be in 
               <br />
               providing these allocations. One central agent, if 
               <br />
               I may use that term, marketing for a group of 
               <br />
               businesses around the country, can count in ad- 
               <br />
               vance on getting their codfish, and is therefore 
               <br />
               able to fill in his allocation. For instance he may 
               <br />
               have an allocation for 20,000 quintals of fish, and 
               <br />
               may have an agreement in St. Anthony for 20,000 
               <br />
               quintals, and another in Bonavista for 20,000 
               <br />
               quintals, and ifone is not ready he can take it from 
               <br />
               the other. Shipping out little bits of fish now and 
               <br />
               then would not be satisfactory. lam vague on this 
               <br />
               information, which is as I understand it, but I 
               <br />
               think the system works very well. The large 
               <br />
               groups in St. John‘s act for the smaller people 
               <br />
               outside on a pretty reasonable commission basis. 
               <br />
               I don’t know what the qualiﬁcations are beyond 
               <br />

               <br />
               know if you have to put up a money qualification

               With regard to licensing, I understand the 
               <br />
               situation is that a small merchant, or small group 
               <br />
               of fishermen, whatever you have in an outport, 
               <br />
               that wishes to pack fish for export, secures from 
               <br />
               the Fisheries Board a license, not a license to 
               <br />
               export, but a license to pack for export. Their 
               <br />
               agent in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">St.</span> John’s does the exporting, and he has 
               <br />
               the licence to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">export,</span> Before they get that license 
               <br />
               their premises have to be subject to inspection by 
               <br />
               the Fisheries Board. Which leads me to another 
               <br />
               point. The situation today is this, that if a mer— 
               <br />
               chant is exporting through a large merchant in St. 
               <br />
               John’s say, his premises may be inspected before 
               <br />
               he gets this license to pack for export, but if a 
               <br />
               businessman or a group in an outport is merely 
               <br />
               putting up codfish which he sells outright to an 
               <br />
               exporter in St. John’s for a fixed price, his
