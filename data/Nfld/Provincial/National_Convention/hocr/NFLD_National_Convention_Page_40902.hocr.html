               Mr. Bailey After you hezu' what I have to say, 
               <br />
               you will understand why i wanted to read the two 
               <br />
               together. I think this. above anything else in this 
               <br />
               country of ours, is long overdue, especially a 
               <br />
               hydrographic survey. The others, I am not going 
               <br />
               to touch on; they are outside my jurisdiction. In 
               <br />
               fact, I know very little about them. If you notice, 
               <br />
               when you pick up a chart of this country, it refers 
               <br />
               back to Captain Cook. He is a long time dead. I 
               <br />
               must say he did a wonderful job. But I think it is 
               <br />
               time someone else did ajob. It is long overdue. 
               <br />
               There is many a mother and wife whose husband 
               <br />
               did not come home, because nobody was inter— 
               <br />
               ested in what was under the vessel’s bottom. 
               <br />
               Sometimes the only way to ﬁnd a depth of water 
               <br />
               is to have a wire dragging between two ships with 
               <br />
               floats on them. This is long overdue and whether 
               <br />
               we have responsible government, commission 
               <br />
               government or confederation, the ﬁrst job is to 
               <br />
               get this survey of our cast and Labrador <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">coasts.</span> 
               <br />
               The Labrador coast is in the worst condition of 
               <br />
               any part of the world. It is a crying shame, espe- 
               <br />
               cially in a maritime country.... Take the Funks -— 
               <br />
               nobody knows the ﬁshing ground around the 
               <br />
               Funks. I had hopes of bringing this up before, but 
               <br />
               I could not work it in. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Smallwood I have a great deal of sympathy 
               <br />
               for what Mr. Bailey says. As a matter of interest, 
               <br />
               I took occasion when in Ottawa to go down to the 
               <br />
               ofﬁce where this work is done, and talked with 
               <br />
               the men in charge <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~—</span> the men who would be in 
               <br />
               charge of the mapping and charting of the coast 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland and the coast of Labrador. As 
               <br />
               professional men, they were looking forward 
               <br />
               with interest to the charting of the coast of New- 
               <br />
               foundland and Labrador. But let us be quite ac- 
               <br />
               curate about this. The British Admiralty has 
               <br />
               brought Captain Cook’s charts up to date; we are 
               <br />
               not as far back, in coastal charts. We are a little 
               <br />
               more modem than that. But I agree they are 
               <br />
               lacking, and need to be brought up to date. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Ballam I believe had our Commission 
               <br />
               government made arrangements with the RCAF 
               <br />
               -- they had planes stationed in this country, and 
               <br />
               did a lot of photography work in the training of

               pilots — I cannot see why it could not have been 
               <br />
               done. If it had been put before the British govern-
