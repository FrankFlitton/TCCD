               Mr. Hickman Might I ask if the delegation did 
               <br />
               bring up the question of independently owned 
               <br />

               <br />
               whether they will be allowed to operate or not? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood It was not brought up in view 
               <br />
               of the fact that throughout Canada there are 
               <br />
               probably two privately owned stations for every 
               <br />

               <br />
               It is quite obvious that they have privately owned 
               <br />
               stations. They have private stations in Nova

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               that is. Mr. Duplessis in Quebec wanted to start 
               <br />
               a provincial government station, the federal 
               <br />
               government stepped on it, would not allow it. 
               <br />
               They could not allow one, if they did not allow 
               <br />
               another. They adopted that categorical policy.
