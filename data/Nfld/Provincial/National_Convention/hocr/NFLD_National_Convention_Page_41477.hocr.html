               We have also heard the oft-made remark about 
               <br />
               the bottom falling out of ﬁsh prices, etc, and the 
               <br />
               price going down to $5 per quintal, but surely the 
               <br />
               members who make these statements do not ex- 
               <br />
               pect that union with Canada is going to prevent 
               <br />
               ﬁsh or any other commodity from dropping in 
               <br />
               price? That will be the result of world conditions, 
               <br />
               and Canada or any other country cannot stabilise 
               <br />
               or prevent the drop in prices of ﬁsh or any other 
               <br />
               product. In fact in my opinion, union with Canada 
               <br />
               will have a destructive effect on our ﬁshing in- 
               <br />
               dustry, inasmuch as we will be unable to make 
               <br />
               the marketing arrangements that we have today 
               <br />
               with European markets, particularly Portugal and 
               <br />
               Spain and perhaps Italy, and also I can see noth- 
               <br />
               ing in the terms of the Black Book, nothing 
               <br />
               ofﬁcial, that will show me that the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               Fisheries Board will be able to continue its 
               <br />
               present work which is resulting in the better 
               <br />
               marketing and selling of our products. It can only, 
               <br />
               as far as I can see, he the agent of the Canadian 
               <br />
               Prices Support Board, and this has nothing 
               <br />
               whatever to do with markets or export, and to lose 
               <br />
               the Fisheries Board in its present capacity would, 
               <br />
               in my opinion, not only be destructive, but also 
               <br />
               have a very far-reaching and bad effect on our 
               <br />
               whole industry.

               It has also been said by some of our most 
               <br />
               ardent confederates that it is very difﬁcult to 
               <br />
               provide full social services in this country be— 
               <br />
               cause the population is so scattered over such an 
               <br />
               area. Do they mean to tell me that union with 
               <br />
               Canada would make our population less scattered 
               <br />
               and Newfoundland any smaller? We will have 
               <br />
               exactly the same problems under confederation, 
               <br />
               and to my mind this is just one more of the red 
               <br />
               herrings that are drawn across our trail, and if Mr. 
               <br />
               Crosbie had thought of it in advance, he could 
               <br />
               have put his herring factory here in the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion because there are more red herring here than 
               <br />
               in Bay of Islands.

               The people will want to consider what effects 
               <br />
               confederation may have on our industries. I have 
               <br />

               will have on our ﬁsheries; but here is also the 
               <br />
               effect it will have on our paper mills and paper 
               <br />
               industries. Newfoundland has one of the most 
               <br />
               economically operated paper industries in the 
               <br />
               world today, and while the demand for the next 
               <br />
               few years will be such that total outputs or 
               <br />
               production may be sold out, yet it may be that in 
               <br />
               the near future paper mills under union will have 
               <br />
               to restrict their output —— to go on the quota basis 
               <br />
               as they did in Canada. If this happens, New- 
               <br />
               foundland, under its own government, being 
               <br />
               operated so economically, the industry could still 
               <br />
               work at capacity without restriction; but as 
               <br />
               operated in Canada, our paper mills would be 
               <br />
               placed under production restrictions, with the 
               <br />
               result that perhaps 1,000 of our people would be 
               <br />
               put out of work in the mills and in the woods. The 
               <br />
               effect on our industries, as I have mentioned, 
               <br />
               must have consideration by the people, because 
               <br />
               it affects them directly in the amount of employ— 
               <br />
               ment available, which might be reduced in this 
               <br />
               respect through confederation with Canada. 
               <br />

               Our agricultural industry today is producing 
               <br />
               around $12-15 million and if we should become 
               <br />
               part of Canada, I hesitate to say what effect it 
               <br />
               would have on our agricultural products and on 
               <br />
               our farmers generally, particularly in view of the 
               <br />
               increased land production that we are endeavour- 
               <br />
               ing to obtain. This is one very good reason Why . 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island would like to see us in 
               <br />
               confederation at the expense of our west coast 
               <br />
               farmers, as well as those on the east coast. It 
               <br />
               would provide the Canadian farmers with an 
               <br />
               opportunity to increase their proﬁt at the expense 
               <br />
               of the Newfoundlanders.

               Do the people of this country realise that we

               <br />
