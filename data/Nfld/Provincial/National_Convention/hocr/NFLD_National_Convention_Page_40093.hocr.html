               <br />
               tee the things that stand out seem to be that there

               will be necessary plant extension and there will 
               <br />
               have to be subsidising of the industry to the extent 
               <br />
               that the ﬁshermen will be paid more money. By 
               <br />
               thatI gather that we will have to keep in line with 
               <br />
               the other countries such as Canada and Iceland. 
               <br />
               But the whole point of this debate is the 
               <br />
               US market. If we don’t have a United States 
               <br />
               market we are not going to have a fresh ﬁsh 
               <br />
               industry. Now that being granted, and I hopeI am 
               <br />
               not going to be accused by Mr. Butt of being a 
               <br />
               fatalist, we have got this to face with the United 
               <br />
               States of America. They have a very large ﬁshing 
               <br />
               population, and are very interested in the same 
               <br />
               industry that we ourselves are trying to increase 
               <br />
               in production. We all remember what happened 
               <br />
               here in 1938. That big General Seafoods <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cora</span> 
               <br />
               poration1 came in here and concluded an agree- 
               <br />
               ment with the government that would have been 
               <br />
               of immense beneﬁt to the people of this country, 
               <br />
               and I don’t know whether any local industrialist 
               <br />
               in the ﬁshing industry had anything to do with it 
               <br />
               or not, but when the deal was practically through 
               <br />
               the American House of Congress, the American 
               <br />
               Senate, the ﬁshing industries of New England 
               <br />
               were organised to such an extent that a prohibi- 
               <br />
               tive tariff was raised against that deal and that big 
               <br />
               industry was dropped and the General Sea Foods 
               <br />
               people went out of the picture. What power has 
               <br />
               that same New England bloc today? We know 
               <br />
               they are vitally interested, and they are watching 
               <br />
               this new Louisbourg proposition in Canada, and 
               <br />
               even the debates in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">house,</span> We saw yesterday 
               <br />
               one of the representatives of the US government 
               <br />
               present here and everything that goes on is going 
               <br />
               to be of interest. Now the point is, is the western 
               <br />
               bloc referred to by Mr. Russell, namely the 
               <br />
               western states, of sufﬁcient power to overcome 
               <br />
               the lobbying effect of the New England ﬁsh bloc? 
               <br />
               If not, then we might as well forget our fresh ﬁsh 
               <br />
               industry. If only a 1% increase on the present 
               <br />
               tariff went on the fresh frozen ﬁllets going in it 
               <br />
               would not pay the industry to operate. How are 
               <br />
               we going to block that? I would certainly try but 
               <br />
               the bases are here, that’s an accomplished fact. 
               <br />
               We can’t tomorrow or the next day say, “Give us 
               <br />
               these concessions or we will turn you out.” We

               Mr. Crosbie l have been listening to what I 
               <br />
               consider to be an awful lot of pessimism. We 
               <br />
               have the ﬁnest ﬁshing ledge known in the world. 
               <br />
               One American ﬁsh man told me the time would 
               <br />
               come when the US would have to come to New- 
               <br />
               foundland waters to get her ﬁsh. Before the war, 
               <br />
               in the midwestem states very little fish was con- 
               <br />
               sumed. The methods of freezing and keeping 
               <br />

               today compared to ten years ago. One town in the 
               <br />
               midwestem states did not consume one pound of 
               <br />
               ﬁsh per year. They put in a Birdseye freezer there, 
               <br />
               and they increased their consumption of ﬁsh in a 
               <br />
               few months from none to 15 lb. per person. We 
               <br />
               have no reason to be pessimistic. Why should we 
               <br />
               not ask for tariff concessions? We can ask, and if 
               <br />
               we don’t get them, well, we can’t be blamed. We 
               <br />
               can ﬁght <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anyway.‘lt</span> is true there is a tariff on fresh 
               <br />
               ﬁsh in the United States, but that does notsay that 
               <br />
               it can’t be changed. I don’t expect this govern—

               ment to go back and ask for a change in the base 
               <br />
               agreement. They can’t ~—— they signed it. The 
               <br />
               American market is not the only market for fresh 
               <br />
               ﬁsh. The methods of processing fish are changed 
               <br />
               entirely. You can take and consume huge quan— 
               <br />
               tities in this country year in and year out. Within 
               <br />
               the last couple of months I have had inquiries for 
               <br />
               a fairly large tonnage of frozen ﬁsh from Brazil, 
               <br />
               which now takes hardly any saltﬁsh at all. We 
               <br />
               can’t send it down because we have not the 
               <br />
               cold-storage ships and facilities, and they have 
               <br />
               not the facilities to handle it either, but I believe 
               <br />
               that will change in a year or two and we may have 
               <br />
               a market in Brazil or other countries. I say let’s
