               Mr. Fogwill Yes, sir. The amendment to the 
               <br />
               resolution is as follows: to delete the words from 
               <br />
               line six “the Chairman of this Convention in 
               <br />
               consultation with the Steering Committee shall 
               <br />
               thereupon select a delegation of members of this 
               <br />
               Convention”, and insert these words: “elected by 
               <br />
               the National Convention from its own members”. 
               <br />
               Mr. Job I have no objection to that change. I 
               <br />
               think it is quite proper and probably democratic 
               <br />
               if the Convention should elect its own commit- 
               <br />
               tees. The only reason I put it in was that the rules 
               <br />
               provided for it.

               <br />
               and Mr. Higgins, I think that in many cases we

               are going to askthem things which we as sensible

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               people should not ask. For instance, “What steps, 
               <br />
               if any, can be taken for establishing improved 
               <br />
               economic or ﬁscal relationships between the 
               <br />
               United States of America and New- 
               <br />
               foundland....‘?” Surely to goodness, every mem— 
               <br />
               ber of this Convention knows that the only step 
               <br />
               which can be taken is that the government itself 
               <br />
               get in touch with the United States government 
               <br />
               and ask them these questions. They won’t tell us 
               <br />
               to appoint a delegation to go to Washington, 
               <br />
               because I think it’s been proved that we have no 
               <br />
               power to do that.

               And then the second part, “What ﬁnancial and 
               <br />
               fiscal relationships could be expected between 
               <br />
               the Government of the United Kingdom and 
               <br />
               Newfoundland etc.“ First when this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion met there was a ten year programme placed 
               <br />
               on the table of the house, which is now being 
               <br />
               carried out. That $59 million program, of which 
               <br />
               in this ﬁscal year so far about 398-9 million have 
               <br />
               been spent, they have been carrying it out and 
               <br />
               have never asked us whether they would or not.

               The government has power to go to the United

               States and talk paper, mines or anything else. I 
               <br />
               would also like to point out that, at the present

               time, the ﬁshing interests of Gloucester are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">put»</span> 
               <br />
               ting on a campaign looking for increased tariff 
               <br />
               protection for their fish. In my opinion we have 
               <br />
               no power, it is up to the government to do that, 
               <br />
               and they would be falling down on their job if 
               <br />
               they are not trying to do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> Now, I would be 
               <br />
               perfectly willing to support this part of the ques- 
               <br />
               tion: “What steps, if any, are you taking", is the 
               <br />
               government taking. But what steps can be taken, 
               <br />
               or what steps are the government trying to take? 
               <br />
               They should be taking some. The British govern- 
               <br />
               ment should be taking some steps in our interests, 
               <br />
               but are they doing that? They know what can be 
               <br />
               done if they will only do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> 
               <br />

               The next thing: “What would be a fair and 
               <br />
               equitable basis for federal union...‘!" We are as— 
               <br />
               king them to tell us what they think is fair. It’s 
               <br />
               our job to decide what is fair, not theirs, and 
               <br />
               furthermore, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Chairman, we had this matter 
               <br />
               up some three or four months ago and there was 
               <br />
               an amendment moved by Mr. Penney and passed 
               <br />
               in this House, whereby this confederation issue 
               <br />
               was to be left over until such time as our reports 
               <br />
               were ﬁnished. I think Mr. Penney will agree that 
               <br />
               that was the idea of his amendment, and now we 
               <br />
               ﬁnd it in here. I have no objection to a delegation
