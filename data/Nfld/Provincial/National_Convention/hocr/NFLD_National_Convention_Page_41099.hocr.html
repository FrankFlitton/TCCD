               ment does not collect any taxes whatsoever on 
               <br />
               property. The Government of Canada has no 
               <br />

               <br />
               since the Government of Canada began in 1867. 
               <br />
               The Government of Canada has never collected 
               <br />
               a dollar, or a cent in property taxes from anyone 
               <br />

               <br />
               Newfoundland becomes a province then the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada will not collect any 
               <br />
               property tax from anybody in Newfoundland.

               Now as to the provincial government, that is

               the next government you come to, the govem—

               <br />
               not being in existence, I cannot and you cannot, 
               <br />
               and no man can answer ﬁnally for what they will 
               <br />
               do and what they will not do, but this we can 
               <br />
               answer, that the government of the Province of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland is not obliged to collect any 
               <br />
               property tax, is not compelled to collect any 
               <br />
               property tax, is not forced to collect any property 
               <br />
               tax. If they do so it will be of their own free will. 
               <br />
               If the government of the Province of New— 
               <br />
               foundland decides to collect a tax on one’s homes 
               <br />
               or gardens or animals or boats or ﬁshing gear or 
               <br />
               schooners, if they decide to collect such taxes it 
               <br />
               will be they who will decide it, and who will they 
               <br />
               be? They will be the elected members of the 
               <br />
               House of Assembly, elected by the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. There is not a man sitting in this 
               <br />
               chamber today who, if he were a member of the 
               <br />
               future House of Assembly of this island would 
               <br />
               even dream of agreeing to putting any property 
               <br />
               tax on the people of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland.</span> No one 
               <br />
               would dream of it.... Now remember they have 
               <br />
               not got to put them on. There is no law which says 
               <br />
               they must put on property taxes. The Government 
               <br />
               of Canada does not say, and cannot say, “You, 
               <br />
               the provincial government of Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               must put on property taxes." They have no law 
               <br />
               that gives them the right to say it. The Parliament

               of Canada cannot say it. If our future government 
               <br />
               does it, it is because they decided to do it of their 
               <br />
               own free will, and that they are not likely to do.
