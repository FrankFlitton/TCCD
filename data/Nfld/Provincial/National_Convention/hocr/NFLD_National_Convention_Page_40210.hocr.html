               Sir William Hillman was in Gander, he was 
               <br />
               the Director General of Civil Aviation of the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom at that time, on his way through 
               <br />
               to the Bermuda Conference, and he made the 
               <br />
               statement that “they were fed up with repeated 
               <br />
               requests coming to them from Newfoundland in 
               <br />
               connection with Gander, authorising this, that 
               <br />
               and the other for amounts of $50,000 here, 
               <br />
               $70,000 there and $100,000 somewhere else." 
               <br />
               His complaint was that instead of putting them to 
               <br />
               the necessity of running to their superiors with so 
               <br />
               many requests for authorisation, they should 
               <br />
               come in and say they wanted $1 million or $2 
               <br />
               million, and it would only occur once, and there 
               <br />
               would be a row, but they would pass it and there 
               <br />
               would be no more trouble for a year. There was 
               <br />
               another point that Mr. Ashboume raised — 
               <br />
               Goose Bay and Torbay. We thought that as the 
               <br />
               operation of Goose and Torbay do not come 
               <br />
               within the realm of public finance we would 
               <br />
               ignore them. The contracts for the lease of Goose 
               <br />
               and Torbay have been published in the press and 
               <br />
               are public property, and certainly the exchequer 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland is not involved in the expenses 
               <br />
               of either of those airports... If we made a mistake 
               <br />
               and if the House orders us to get further informa- 
               <br />
               tion regarding Goose and Torbay, we will be 
               <br />
               happy to carry out their orders.

               Mr. Ashbourne My point about Goose was that 
               <br />
               on account of its proximity to Newfoundland it 
               <br />
               might have a prejudical effect on our bargaining

               the CAA it is the only designated airport for

               <br />
               I don’t think there is anything to it. I don’t think

               our government would be so insane as to permit

               the civilian use of any other airport except 
               <br />

               far as Goose airport is concerned it does not enter 
               <br />
               into the civilian aviation picture. That is because 
               <br />
               it is considered to be a permanent military base 
               <br />

               <br />
               fectly right in saying that planes coming across

               the Atlantic have the right to land at Goose at the 
               <br />
               rate of three or four a day when Gander is closed

               <br />

               <br />
