               <br />
               the Convention since its opening. It is, I think, 
               <br />
               expected that every member should make some 
               <br />
               contribution, no matter how modest it might be, 
               <br />
               to aid the Convention in its work. That is ex- 
               <br />
               pected of us by the country which sent the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Con»</span>

               sections who have chosen us to represent them

               No matter what the outcome of the Conven-

               <br />
               from will always have to depend almost entirely 
               <br />
               on the ﬁsheries. For a great portion of the south- 
               <br />
               west section of Newfoundland the future 
               <br />
               economy is a matter of the development on pro- 
               <br />
               gressive lines <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,of</span> the ﬁshing industry. I think 
               <br />
               everybody will agree with Mr. Wild when he 
               <br />
               says “there is room for considerable development 
               <br />
               of the ﬁsheries“, and we hope that, no matter what 
               <br />
               form of government is to follow the Convention, 
               <br />
               the policy outlined by Mr. Wild will be carried 
               <br />
               out when he says that “a determined effort will 
               <br />
               be made to stabilise prices and to ensure that 
               <br />
               primary producers are given a fairer deal than 
               <br />
               they often were in the past." If we could feel that 
               <br />
               this would be really the policy of the future 
               <br />

               <br />
               were glad to hear the remarks of the Governor the 
               <br />
               other day when he referred to the road from Burin 
               <br />
               Peninsula to Terenceville. The people of the 
               <br />
               peninsula have been looking forward to this main 
               <br />
               highway for many years. Some of the older 
               <br />
               people in the district still remember the first 
               <br />
               campaign of Sir Edward Morris when he came to 
               <br />
               the district nearly 40 years ago. Addressing the 
               <br />
               people ofBurin, he spoke of the need for this road 
               <br />
               to help the development of the Burin Peninsula. 
               <br />
               Some people might be inclined to say this was 
               <br />
               done for political purposes, but however that may 
               <br />
               be, Lord Morris showed great insight into the 
               <br />
               future. We hope that in the reconstruction work 
               <br />
               of the next few years this important highway will 
               <br />
