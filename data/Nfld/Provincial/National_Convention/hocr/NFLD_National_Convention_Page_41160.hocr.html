               Mr. Higgins Thank you, sir. Before adjourn- 
               <br />
               ment on Friday, I had been elaborating at some 
               <br />
               length on the value of our strategical, geographi- 
               <br />
               cal position, and its particular value to the two 
               <br />
               countries immediately adjoining us, the United 
               <br />
               States and Canada. I am going to go on from 
               <br />
               there.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I stated that Canada is as yet, politically, an 
               <br />
               immature country. It is only slowly realising its 
               <br />
               own individuality. It is not therefore to be ex- 
               <br />
               pected that it would have as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clear«cut</span> a policy as 
               <br />
               has the United States. Until June, 1940 it was 
               <br />
               impossible to secure much attention to arguments 
               <br />
               urging that Canada should assume responsibility 
               <br />
               for Newfoundland; it was too remote for the 
               <br />
               average Canadian to know much about, and since 
               <br />
               it was part of the Empire, there was no need to 
               <br />
               worry about it. Canada’s failure to take any part 
               <br />
               in the effort taken in 1933 to put this country on 
               <br />
               its feet springs in a large measure from this cause. 
               <br />
               So too, in the American bases deal. A nation 
               <br />
               conscious of itself and jealous for its future would 
               <br />
               have been ready to undertake the complete job in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, rather than to have even the 
               <br />
               friendliest of neutrals do it, with political results 
               <br />
               still to be determined. Things were moving 
               <br />
               quickly in the summer of 1940, and there was a 
               <br />
               suggestion of panic about. But even so, the grant 
               <br />
               by Great Britain of what is virtually territorial 
               <br />
               sovereignty in an island adjacent to Canada, 
               <br />
               which was once close to entering the Canadian 
               <br />
               confederation, and which administers an impor— 
               <br />
               tant area of the continent (Labrador) that had 
               <br />
               been handed over to it by Canada’s acquiescence 
               <br />
               in a decision of arbitration ( 1927) largely because 
               <br />
               it was all in the family, was a rather extraordinary 
               <br />
               proceeding. It was only to be defended because 
               <br />
               of the exigencies of the moment, and because it 
               <br />
               was felt at the time that the United States was also 
               <br />
               one of the family. The Canadian government has 
               <br />
               since attempted to recover the situation by the 
               <br />
               protocol it secured to the bases agreement of 
               <br />
               1941. Paragraph 1 of this protocol is as follows: 
               <br />
               “It is recognised that the defence, and as such is 
               <br />
