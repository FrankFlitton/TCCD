               the early stages of the debate in the autumn of 
               <br />
               1946, I said that if a referendum were to be held 
               <br />
               tomorrow I would not vote for a retention of 
               <br />
               Commission of Government. In January 1948, I 
               <br />
               see no reason to change my opinion. As Mr. 
               <br />
               Keough said, Commission of Government may 
               <br />
               have brought system and method to the civil 
               <br />
               service; Commission of Government may have 
               <br />
               introduced many <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">long~wanted</span> reforms; Commis~ 
               <br />
               sion of Government may have expanded our 
               <br />
               public health service. With that I entirely agree, 
               <br />
               but gentlemen, Commission of Government has 
               <br />
               outlived its usefulness, it has nothing to offer for 
               <br />
               the road ahead. It was a necessary expedient. But 
               <br />
               the measure of its performance in the past, under 
               <br />
               circumstances vastly different from what they 
               <br />
               will be tomorrow, can be no prediction of its 
               <br />
               achievement in the future. In fact, sir, the whole 
               <br />
               concept of such a form of government is wrong. 
               <br />
               Any form of government which is in itself the 
               <br />
               essence of naked power, and which shows scant 
               <br />
               respect for, and little concern with popular public 
               <br />
               opinion. cannot in my opinion be a good form of 
               <br />
               government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> in short, it is a dictatorship. Let 
               <br />
               me illustrate, let me take you back to the northeast 
               <br />
               coast, where 15,000 people living between 
               <br />
               Gambo and Carmanville are isolated from 
               <br />
               December until April. Their economy is for the 
               <br />
               most part built on the ﬁsheries. All supplies and 
               <br />
               local products are, of necessity, waterhauled. 
               <br />
               From time to time intelligent and progressive 
               <br />
               citizens have petitioned for a road system to link 
               <br />
               up those northern conununities. Such a road sys- 
               <br />
               tem would naturally be a costly project and 
               <br />
               maybe not commercially proﬁtable; but from an 
               <br />
               economic standpoint it might well lead to a wider 
               <br />
               diversiﬁcation of the ﬁsheries there; it might 
               <br />
               enable fishermen to rush their product to a 
               <br />
               centralised curing plant, and their salt product to 
               <br />
               a sheltered shipping point. It might well be a wise 
               <br />
               expenditure of public monies heretofore called 
               <br />
               ‘dole', but petitions of popular opinion on such 
               <br />
               matters are given scant attention. In more cases 
               <br />
               than one, high ofﬁcials of government have little 
               <br />
               inside knowledge of the real wants of the people. 
               <br />
               But yet without stint or scruple that same govern- 
               <br />
               ment will expend many thousands of dollars on

               Mr. Chairman, our hard-working toilers want 
               <br />
               more than three square meals and a tight roof, and 
               <br />
               they deserve more, and I would repeat that they 
               <br />
               do not take very kindly to the policy of any 
               <br />
               member of this Convention or government that 
               <br />
               would put the Avalon ﬁrst and the rest of the 
               <br />
               country afterwards. I see no earthly reason why 
               <br />
               we should retain the Commission government. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood said a few days ago that there are 
               <br />
               many who would vote for it. I do not follow that 
               <br />
               line of reasoning. Do they believe that Commis- 
               <br />
               sion of Government brought prosperity to New- 
               <br />
               foundland? Are they forgetting the lean years of 
               <br />
               six cents a day dole? Do they think Corrunission 
               <br />
               should be credited with the upsurge of prosperity 
               <br />
               created by the inﬂux of scores of millions of 
               <br />
               dollars of foreign capital into this country during 
               <br />
               the war years? Or would they credit the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Commis»</span> 
               <br />
               sion government with world prosperity — a 
               <br />
               prosperity engineered by the warmongering of 
               <br />
               that misguided prophet called Hitler. Further- 
               <br />
               more, sir, in the event of our being ﬁnancially 
               <br />
               unsound in the not too distant future, are the 
               <br />
               adherents of this form of government asking 
               <br />
               themselves now, do they expect the brave but 
               <br />
               impoverished mother country, now battling inﬂa— 
               <br />
               tion with a fierce austerity programme, to come 
               <br />
               to our aid? The Englishman is a gallant fellow, 
               <br />
               but just now he is up to his neck with his own 
               <br />
               worries, and it is just plain folly to expect help 
               <br />
               from the imperial government should we fall 
               <br />
               upon lean times. It is just not good cricket and it 
               <br />
               is unreasonable. With no assurance of help, 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial or otherwise, let us ask ourselves, 
               <br />
               “Should we retain Commission of Government?” 
               <br />
               The answer should be emphatically, “No.” It 
               <br />
               would indeed be a grave mistake. Our date with 
               <br />
               tomorrow is going to be a long one, not just 
               <br />
               another temporary expedient. We must take the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">longvrange</span> View, for our choice may well be the 
               <br />
               government of a century. In summing up this 
               <br />
               phase of the motion, I repeat that I will not vote 
               <br />
               for Commission and I will not recommend Com- 
               <br />
               mission. It has outlived its usefulness and should 
               <br />
               go. I repeat again, I am unable to recommend it 
               <br />
               to my constituents or to Newfoundlanders generally.
