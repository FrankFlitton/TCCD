               or 1921 when the late Sir William Coaker <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">en~</span>

               deavoured to tackle this question of the organisa-

               tion of the ﬁsheries, the trade was divided very 
               <br />
               seriously, and it got into a political atmosphere 
               <br />
               and the thing was an absolute failure. I believe if 
               <br />
               the trade had supported it, then the whole thing 
               <br />
               would have been brought into being then, but 
               <br />
               there was so much political spleen brought in that 
               <br />
               it killed it. We have been fortunate in getting the 
               <br />
               trade to support it now. I believe that if they don’t

               contention of the one witness we had before us, 
               <br />
               who is interested in canning, was that it would 
               <br />
               pay the country better if the lobsters, instead of 
               <br />
               being shipped alive, had all been canned. It seems

               very doubtful whether that’s correct, but anyhow

               That is not what I wanted to say, but rather this:

               it is a wonderful thing that this Fisheries Commit-

               <br />
               co—operative movement.... The fact that this 
               <br />
               movement, young as it is, has been able to 
               <br />
