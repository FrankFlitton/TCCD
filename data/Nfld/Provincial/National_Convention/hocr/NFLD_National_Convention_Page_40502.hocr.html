               ment we are only considering Buchans. Others 
               <br />
               are doing the same. I feel like making a motion

               Mr. Hollett I had something to do with the com- 
               <br />
               pilation of this report, and I don’t want the Con- 
               <br />
               vention to get the wrong impression from 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood’s remarks. He seems to have got 
               <br />
               the idea that we should keep our ores in the 
               <br />
               ground and let them stay there till the next mil- 
               <br />
               lenium. I fail to see what value ores are if they are 
               <br />
               not dug out and sold I see no reason why we 
               <br />
               should keep them mere. If we go back to the other 
               <br />
               table we ﬁnd they contributed 7.6% to the 
               <br />
               revenue of the country. Mr. Smallwood drinks 
               <br />
               that duties do not go into the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               government. I wonder where they do go? They 
               <br />
               surely went into the general revenue of the 
               <br />
               country. Royalties certainly did, income tax — 
               <br />
               there should be no doubt about that, and the 
               <br />
               trouble seems to be concentrates, freights, etc. I 
               <br />
               will tell you what Buchans get from the 
               <br />
               AND Co. for that amount. We will forget that the 
               <br />
               cars are loaded with ore when they leave 
               <br />
               Buchans. They send two trains a day from 
               <br />
               Bishop’s Falls to Buchans to haul away ore. The 
               <br />
               AND Company put two engineers and one 
               <br />
               brakesman and one conductor on the New- 
               <br />
               foundland government’s engine. That is con— 
               <br />
               nected up on the cars owned by the Buchans 
               <br />
               Mining Co. The government finds just the engine

               and three or four men to manipulate it. They go 
               <br />
               to Buchans and load up and come back again, and 
               <br />
               the only part of the Newfoundland Railway 
               <br />
               which is touched by these cars is the railway 
               <br />
               between Millenown Junction and Bishop’s Falls. 
               <br />
               In other words, during the past 19 years the 
               <br />
               AND Co. for concentrate freight, have paid 
               <br />
               $5,375,420, for supplying an engineer and the 
               <br />
               men to drive it, to haul their own cars to and from 
               <br />
               Millenown Junction and Bishop’s Falls. 1 think 
               <br />
               that looks a very good showing... We merely 
               <br />
               threw the point out to the Convention, the value 
               <br />
               of that little hole in the ground up in Buchans, 
               <br />
               away in the heart of the country, which would 
               <br />
               have been of no value whatever if certain cor- 
               <br />
               porations did not secure certain sums of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">money,</span> 
               <br />
               It would have been there yet, and this country 
               <br />
               would have been deprived of a great deal of 
               <br />
               money, over $40 million. Our men would have 
               <br />
               been deprived of labour to the value of over $5 
               <br />
               million; we would not have received over $4 
               <br />
               million in royalties, income tax, etc., so I fail to 
               <br />
               see why Mr. Smallwood gets so hot under the 
               <br />
               collar on this question. I would like him to hold 
               <br />
               ﬁre until he sees the report which we shall put in 
               <br />
               about me Bell Island and Labrador operations. I 
               <br />
               felt pretty hot under the collar too when I saw 
               <br />
               some of these figures, but we were deﬁnitely 
               <br />
               informed that ore is absolutely valueless until it 
               <br />
               is dug out, freighted from the country and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sold.</span> It 
               <br />
               seems to me that if the proper deal had been made 
               <br />
               in the first instance, we would either have got 
               <br />
               more money, or the corporations concerned 
               <br />
               would not have taken the chance. I am prepared 
               <br />
               to state that the less taxes you can put on capital 
               <br />
               coming into this country in the endeavour to 
               <br />
               locate ores and send them out -— I would almost 
               <br />
               go so far as to say we should let them import all 
               <br />
               their machinery free of duty, the better it will be 
               <br />
               for this country... I think the Buchans Company 
               <br />
               have made ajolly good thing out of this. I am glad 
               <br />
               they have, and I think the country has made a very 
               <br />
               good job out of it too. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Smallwood I agree with so much of what 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett says, that it seems ungraeious to dis- 
               <br />
               agree in part. The issue is not whether we should 
               <br />
               be glad to have Buchans or not, of course we are 
               <br />
               glad, but Mr. Hollett has summed up for me 
               <br />
               better than I was able to do myself the whole 
               <br />
               attitude to this whole business. He said we should 
               <br />
               be grateful about those mining companies com-
