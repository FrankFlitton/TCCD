               <br />
               the Barrelman radio programme. I believe he is a 
               <br />
               patriot, and I believe he loves this country every 
               <br />
               bit as much as I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do.</span> I am all the more sorry, 
               <br />
               therefore, that he has marred his political career, 
               <br />
               which I thought was a rather promising one, by 
               <br />
               his remarks aimed at me on Monday. I thought at 
               <br />
               ﬁrst that I should put them down to naivety, to 
               <br />
               lack of experience in everyday affairs. I felt sorry 
               <br />
               that he should make such an almost unforgive- 
               <br />
               able break. Yes, I told Mr. Harrington that I 
               <br />
               thought he would make a very good member of 
               <br />
               any delegation that might go to Canada to get the 
               <br />
               terms of confederation. I did not promise a seat 
               <br />
               on any such delegation from this Convention to 
               <br />
               Ottawa. 1 shall not appoint it I suppose I would 
               <br />
               be lucky to be on it myself. I did tell Mr. Har— 
               <br />
               rington that he would make a good member of the 
               <br />
               delegation, and I would say now again that he 
               <br />
               would make a good member, ifI could feel sure 
               <br />
               that it was only an unfortunate break he made 
               <br />
               here on Monday last, and not a deliberate piece 
               <br />
               of double-crossing treachery, if it was not an 
               <br />
               unscrupulous attempt at political throat-cutting. 
               <br />
               Some day, I trust, Mr. Harrington will learn that 
               <br />
               in the circles in which men move and work and 
               <br />
               deliberate there is a line drawn, a well-known and 
               <br />
               well-established line, which men do not cross. 
               <br />
               It’s simply not done to rush into a public assemb- 
               <br />
               ly and blurt out what is said in private conversa— 
               <br />
               tion... Mr. Harrington will learn all this if he 
               <br />
               remains in the public life of our country. Maybe 
               <br />
               Mr. Harrington merely made an unfortunate and 
               <br />
               immature break <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> if he did I forgive him, and 
               <br />
               there are no hard feelings. Again, perhaps he 
               <br />
               fancied a perfectly sincere remark to be a foul 
               <br />
               attack upon his political virtue. In that case I 
               <br />
               could be sorry for his inexperience. But if it was 
               <br />
               a deliberate piece of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">throatcutting,</span> if it was part 
               <br />
               and parcel of a planned campaign to rivet respon- 
               <br />
               sible government on us, and to tune out every- 
               <br />
               thing but responsible government, then it’s 
               <br />
               another situation altogether. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now I turn to Mr. Hollett’s remarks. I did not 
               <br />
               offer him a senatorship for two very sound 
               <br />
               reasons. First, because I have no senatorships to 
               <br />
               offer. Secondly, because ifI were going to offer 
               <br />
               him any job it would be something on a very 
               <br />
               much lower level than a senatorship. I do Mr. 
               <br />
               Hollett the credit of not having accused me 
               <br />
               directly of offering him a senatorship.

               <br />
               tricts they represented. But this Convention is not 
               <br />
               a parliament. Under the circumstances, I think 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood has the right to refer to you by

               never exchanged more than 50 words with Mr. 
               <br />
               Hollett in my life and I trust to his honour to make 
               <br />
               it clear that it was not to me he referred. My friend 
               <br />
               Mr. Fudge’s objection was to the holding of a 
               <br />
               little “side Convention" in my room at the New- 
               <br />
               foundland Hotel. I notice that a local paper also 
               <br />
               referred to these meetings, so-called. It is perfect- 
               <br />
               ly true that many delegates — I might say two or 
               <br />
               three dozen delegates, have visited me in my 
               <br />
               room at the hotel, some by my speciﬁc invitation, 
               <br />
               some without any particular invitation. l have 
               <br />
               visited other delegates in their rooms. In my room 
               <br />
               and in their rooms, and in committee rooms in 
               <br />
               this house, and walking along the street, and in 
               <br />
               the streetcar, I have often discussed public affairs 
               <br />
               with delegates and with non-delegates. [am quite 
               <br />
               sure that other delegates have done likewise. It’s 
               <br />
               a habit we have. It’s a habit all public men have. 
               <br />
               You can’t stop it. It isn’t even sensible to want to 
               <br />
               stop it. It happens all over the world... lt’sjust 
               <br />
               the ordinary, practical, every day procedure for 
               <br />
               men to talk things over, to try to convince each 
               <br />
               other, or to try to find out what the other man is 
               <br />
               thinking, to canvass the situation generally. 
               <br />
               There is nothing improper or unusual about it... 
               <br />
               It is just simple inexperience, immature un- 
               <br />
               sophistication, to paint such meetings as sinister
