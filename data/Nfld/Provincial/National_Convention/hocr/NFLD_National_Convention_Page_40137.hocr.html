            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Some months ago, in a broadcast to the people 
               <br />
               of this country, I offered the opinion that this 
               <br />
               Convention was a bench of judges rather than a 
               <br />
               body of partisans. I am more conﬁrmed today that 
               <br />
               my interpretation of its function was and is still 
               <br />
               right. There is something incongruous in the as- 
               <br />
               sociation of either eloquence or tub-thumping 
               <br />
               with matters and problems of finance and 
               <br />
               economics, of addition and subtraction, multi— 
               <br />
               plication and division. Figures do at times speak 
               <br />
               eloquently, but they speak quietly. We are con- 
               <br />
               cerned principally with ﬁgures. We have to as- 
               <br />
               certain the ﬁnancial and economic position and 
               <br />
               prospects of this country, and whether under the 
               <br />
               tutelage of Britain, as an autonomous state, or in 
               <br />
               partnership with the provinces of Canada, lies the 
               <br />
               greatest probability of relegatin g the six cent dole 
               <br />
               of pre-war days into the realm of unpleasant and 
               <br />
               eventually traditional memories. In the welter of 
               <br />
               irrelevant and dubious eloquence the real issues 
               <br />
               have sometimes been wholly submerged. Can we 
               <br />
               not forget these confusing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sideissues</span> and con- 
               <br />
               fine ourselves strictly to the question upon which 
               <br />
               we have shortly to vote, bearing in mind that we 
               <br />
               must vote as judges, cooly, impartially, and calm- 
               <br />
               ly, and not as partisans in heat and in passion?

               What is this question? Briefly, it is a proposal 
               <br />
               that a delegation be sent to learn the terms and 
               <br />
               conditions of the confederation of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               with Canada. Obviously it is not a discussion of 
               <br />
               the merits or demerits of confederation; and yet 
               <br />
               we have been told of the allowance offered by 
               <br />
               Canada in respect of our public debt in 1895, and 
               <br />
               of a computation of what we should get in the

               Again it has been suggested that the delega- 
               <br />
               tion might explore the question of tariffs and 
               <br />
               other matters affecting the general relations be- 
               <br />
               tween Canada and an independent Newfound- 
               <br />
               land. Surely it is clear that such investigations are 
               <br />
               wholly without the jurisdiction of this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion and obviously beyond the scope of any 
               <br />
               delegation’s activities. None of these things has 
               <br />
               anything to do with the resolution before the 
               <br />
               Chair. The proposal is simply that this delegation 
               <br />
               endeavour to obtain facts, the terms or conditions 
               <br />
               of union which would be acceptable to the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada, if the people of New— 
               <br />
               foundland approved of such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">union.</span>
