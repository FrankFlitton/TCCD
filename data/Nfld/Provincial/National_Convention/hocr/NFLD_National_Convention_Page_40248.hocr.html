               Last year there were 6,000 pounds of beef waiting

               Mr. Hillier The section of the country I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">repre»</span> 
               <br />
               sent has received no attention. I would like to take 
               <br />
               you all over the road from Burin to St. Lawrence. 
               <br />
               One thing I would advise is that you have your 
               <br />
               life insured, another thing is to bring a nice, soft 
               <br />
               cushion. The roads are very narrow and very little 
               <br />
               money has been spent in that area. I agree that 
               <br />
               vast sums of money are necessary for roads 
               <br />
               throughout the country, but I do not think it is in 
               <br />
               order for so much money to be spent on one 
               <br />
               section. In the Lamaline area the roads are eight 
               <br />
               feet wide and the soil is soft. There has been 
               <br />
               nothing done in that area, apart from a man going 
               <br />
               over it with a horse and scraper. You can imagine 
               <br />
               what he can accomplish. These places should 
               <br />
               have closer attention. Mr. Reddy of Burin East 
               <br />
               could tell a similar story of the road problem in 
               <br />
               his section.

               Mr. Ballam I think every disuict in the country

               has a road problem, and people throughout the 
               <br />
               country will hear of this ridiculous expenditure 
               <br />
               of $500,000 on this road de luxe. But talking of 
               <br />
               it for weeks will not bring back that $500,000. It 
               <br />
               is not our duty to define government policy on 
               <br />

               whatever form of government we might have in 
               <br />

               in the Humber area. We are trying to do some— 
               <br />
               thing about it ourselves. That is the only thing we 
               <br />
               can do at the moment. That is why I have not 
               <br />
               spoken about this report. We are all aware that 
               <br />
               the only thing we can do is recommend.

               Mr. Reddy I am a firm believer in the building 
               <br />
               of roads, but the Avalon Peninsula has been very 
               <br />
               well favoured in road expenditure over the last 
               <br />
               few years. Inote with satisfaction from the report 
               <br />
               that the Burin Peninsula road is to be undertaken 
               <br />
               next year. I assure you the people of Bun'n Penin- 
               <br />
               Sula will be very interested in this road, which 
               <br />
               will touch four districts; so I am not speaking for 
               <br />
               my district alone. It is essential to the ﬁsheries, 
               <br />
               especially to the fresh ﬁsh industry carried on in 
               <br />
               Burin by Fishery Products... As to the local roads 
               <br />
               in St. Lawrence, they are in a desperate condition.

               Mr. Harrington I feel just as strongly as Mr. 
               <br />
               Hollett does about the expenditure on the Avalon 
               <br />
               Peninsula, but as a member of St. John’s West, I 
               <br />
               do not feel like hanging my head. After all, we 
               <br />
               are not here as part of a House of Assembly which 
               <br />
               is responsible for the outlay. I think if we were, 
               <br />
               we would be re—elected. One thing that has oc- 
               <br />
               curred to me as I read the report is that since 1934 
               <br />
               the average mileage of roads constructed has 
               <br />
               been something in the neighbourhood of 22 miles 
               <br />
               a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">year.</span> Before we get on to the future aspects, I 
               <br />
               would like to take a look at the past. From 1832 
               <br />
               to 1934, the average has been 50 miles a year. In 
               <br />
               the very beginning, in the day of Sir Thomas 
               <br />
               Cochrane, 1835, the ﬁrst roads were built around 
               <br />
               Conception Bay. 1 do not imagine a great deal of 
               <br />
               roads were built in the ﬁrst 20 years of repre- 
               <br />
               sentative government, so the annual average 
               <br />
               would be 50 or 60 miles. If we consider that was 
               <br />
               done by pick and shovel, it stands up very well in 
               <br />
               contrast with the last 14 years with all types of 
               <br />
               modern <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">machinery.</span> The amount of money spent 
               <br />
               in these recent years did not get maximum results 
               <br />
               —- the paving of Topsail Road at $60,000 a mile 
               <br />
               is proof of that. That point should be brought to 
               <br />
               light. I would like to hear the other inhabitants of 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               years. It is a deliberate action on the part of the
