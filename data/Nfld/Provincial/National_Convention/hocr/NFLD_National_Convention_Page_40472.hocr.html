               <br />

               <br />
               going on in one department and the public knows 
               <br />
               nothing about it. Nasty rumours are going around

               you had in mind. I appreciate the situation now. 
               <br />
               Your motion is still in order, of course. I would 
               <br />
               like to point out that this Convention has no 
               <br />
               authority to obtain any such information from the 
               <br />
               government and if the government refuses, there 
               <br />
               is nothing we can do about it. In the meantime, I 
               <br />
               do suggest this to you: that these proceedings can 
               <br />
               go along. We are not likely to ﬁnish the report 
               <br />
               tonight. Even should we do so, on the 
               <br />
               committee’s report you can raise the question 
               <br />
               again. I think that would be the better place to 
               <br />
               raise it.

               Mr. Cashin I appreciate your suggestion. This 
               <br />
               has been on the go for some time. True it does not 
               <br />
               concern the Convention, but these people are 
               <br />
               trustees of the people’s money. We are the only

               <br />
               other act, we should demand and get an explana—

               <br />
               derelict in our duty here tonight. They saw ﬁt to 
               <br />
               give us a document two or three months ago. We 
               <br />
               have kept our months shut about it. I want to serve

               notice on the government that I am going to open 
               <br />
