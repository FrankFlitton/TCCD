               I am not going to be greatly moved either by 
               <br />
               the argument that we must restore intact our

               <br />

               macabre gymnastics, that is entirely their own

               <br />

               It might be just as well if we were to face up 
               <br />
               to a few facts concerning sovereignty. It is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some</span> 
               <br />
               thing that has intimate relations with economics. 
               <br />
               Sovereignty must be based upon an economic 
               <br />
               structure that will admit of being sovereign unto 
               <br />
               itself. One reason why, let us say Bell Island, 
               <br />
               would not be granted responsible government 
               <br />
               tomorrow would be the economic inability of 
               <br />
               Bell Island to be sovereign unto itself in all 
               <br />
               things. I have often wondered if it was not lack 
               <br />
               of an adequate economic basis for sovereignty 
               <br />
               that was the main cause of our failure in respon- 
               <br />
               sible government. It is a fact of our history that 
               <br />
               we have depended, for the most part, upon our 
               <br />
               ﬁsheries to ﬁnance our sovereignty. It is a fact 
               <br />
               also that most every time the ﬁsheries failed a 
               <br />
               large number of Newfoundlanders have nearly 
               <br />
               starved to death. I am by no means an old man, 
               <br />
               and in my own time I have known more than one 
               <br />
               man who did not know where his next meal was 
               <br />
               coming from. And as far as the man who does not 
               <br />
               know where his next meal is coming from is 
               <br />
               concerned, sovereignty is not enough. And there 
               <br />
               will subscribe to that opinion, all those New~ 
               <br />

               with depression sought to walk the world with 
               <br />
               dignity, as sovereign men should, on six cents a day.

               Mr. Chairman, Abraham Lincoln once

               warned his people that they could not escape

               <br />
               that we cannot escape the 20th century. And the

               to make them the predominant passions. There is, 
               <br />
               ﬁrst of all, the fierce passion to be free. Within 
               <br />

               politicians and the financiers may have had other

               Beaumont Hamel and at Ypres, who stormed the

               passion, equally fierce, to be secure — for three

               mass of men everywhere are in a mood for the

               <br />
               century demand. Liberty! Security! One of them 
               <br />
               they’re going to have. Which one? Or need it be

               must; those who assert that civic liberty and 
               <br />
               economic security are two such disparate entities 
               <br />

               order than water and hot lead may be fused into 
               <br />
               an amalgam. I am not one who subscribes to such 
               <br />
               dark pessimism. I have every conﬁdence in the 
               <br />
               ability of that Christian intelligence, which has 
               <br />
               proven equal to every challenge of two millennia,

               <br />
               and economic security into a social order to 
               <br />
               which the Christian conscience can subscribe. If 
               <br />
               that can be done, then will the future offer men
