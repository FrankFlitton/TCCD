               Another alarming result of union with Canada

               is the statement contained in section 9, subsection 
               <br />
               3 of the Grey Book. I’ll read it, it’s a honey: “No 
               <br />
               part of the surplus shall be used to subsidise 
               <br />

               in unfair competition with similar products of 
               <br />
               other provinces, it being understood that this 
               <br />
               proviso does not preclude assistance to industry 
               <br />
               by such means as developmental loans on 
               <br />
               reasonable conditions or by ordinary provincial 
               <br />
               administrative services." Now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Chairman, the 
               <br />
               substance of this particular section conveys to me 
               <br />
               at least that the Canadian government will do 
               <br />
               everything it possibly can to prevent any serious 
               <br />
               competition from our ﬁshing industry. This is not 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst time that Canada has shown its feelings 
               <br />
               with regard to our ﬁshery. The Bond-Blaine 
               <br />
               treaty has been dealt with many times in this 
               <br />
               chamber and outside, so it’s not necessary for me 
               <br />
               to go into further details on it. I only wanted to 
               <br />
               point out that it has been one of our fondest hopes 
               <br />
               that our fishery should be developed along 
               <br />
               modem and scientiﬁc lines, and there are many 
               <br />
               cases where government assistance would be of 
               <br />
               the utmost value. But the Canadian government, 
               <br />
               in these proposals, tells us that we will not be 
               <br />
               permitted with our own money to further develop 
               <br />
               our industry. I would like to take your minds back 
               <br />
               to last September and October, when it was 
               <br />
               necessary for our government to use ap— 
               <br />
               proximately $7 million in order to obtain foreign 
               <br />
               exchange to pay for Newfoundland ﬁsh produc- 
               <br />
               tion of 1947. I wonder would this be called a 
               <br />
               subsidy? Or would it have another name? 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood It’s not a subsidy.

               <br />
               government. I know what I’d do if I was there. 
               <br />
               I’d call it a subsidy.

               Gentlemen, I‘m not interested in baby bonuses. 
               <br />
               They may be good, they may be bad, but they are 
               <br />
               something for which our people must pay. I am 
               <br />
               only interested in the life-blood of this country, 
               <br />
               which permits individuals to make a living. Let’s 
               <br />
               assume that a ﬁsherman with four children under 
               <br />
               16 receives $288 baby bonus. What good is it to 
               <br />
               him if our marketing system is gone? The price 
               <br />
               of ﬁsh falls, and he receives only $5 a quintal 
               <br />
               where he might have received $10 on say 100

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               quintals of ﬁsh. I am conﬁdent that at the moment 
               <br />
               we enter confederation our Fisheries Board, our 
               <br />
               whole system of marketing that has been built up 
               <br />
               at considerable cost by the government, will be 
               <br />
               demolished overnight, and that we will have the 
               <br />
               chaotic experience of the early twenties and the 
               <br />
               early thirties, when so many of our people are 
               <br />
               depending on this for a livelihood. Let’s go back 
               <br />
               again to last September and October. The catch 
               <br />
               for 1947 was roughly 1.1 million quintals, andI 
               <br />
               am sure that if the $7 million had not been used 
               <br />
               to make exchange available, and if we hadn’t had 
               <br />
               the system of marketing that we have today, the 
               <br />
               price of ﬁsh would have fallen at least $5 and 
               <br />
               might have been on sale. Let’s assume it dropped 
               <br />
               $5 —— $5.5 million, gentlemen, that was our baby 
               <br />
               bonus gone overboard right away. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               All this being so, I cannot see what we can 
               <br />
               possibly gain from federal union with Canada. 
               <br />
               We may even lose many of the advantages we 
               <br />
               now have. To summarise, gentlemen, it is my 
               <br />
               ﬁrm and considered opinion that under union 
               <br />
               with Canada we will bring about the following: 
               <br />
               the abolition of the Newfoundland Fisheries 
               <br />
               Board; two, the abolition of compulsory inspec- 
               <br />
               tion and control of exports which have been so 
               <br />
               beneﬁcial in the last few years; three, the bait 
               <br />
               system as a government facility, as the province 
               <br />
               could not afford to maintain the cost; four, we 
               <br />
               would be under the dictates of Ottawa with regard 
               <br />
               to the export of our fresh ﬁsh; ﬁve, we would be 
               <br />
               deprived of the power to negotiate our own trade 
               <br />
               agreements with any country, and particularly 
               <br />
               with the USA which could be so essential to our 
               <br />
               economy today; six, we would lose assistance 
               <br />
               from England in our current ﬁsh arrangements, 
               <br />
               thus running a great risk of losing our European 
               <br />
               markets; seven, the loss of the use of our surplus 
               <br />
               for anything by way of subsidy, particularly if we 
               <br />
               wish to use it for subsidising exchange as was 
               <br />
               done last fall. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Chairman and gentlemen, in
