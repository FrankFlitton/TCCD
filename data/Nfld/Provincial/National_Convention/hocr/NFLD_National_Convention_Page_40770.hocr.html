               Mr. Fudge ....I do not know of any human docu-

               ment, including the Bible itself, that has not been 
               <br />
               criticised, and consequently I was not at all 
               <br />
               surprised when certain delegates set themselves 
               <br />
               up as being greater authorities than the compilers 
               <br />
               of the Economic Report. We have witnessed this 
               <br />
               in the case of every report which has come before 
               <br />
               us. I regret this, because whilst I consider a cer— 
               <br />
               tain amount of honest criticism healthy, at the 
               <br />
               same time a policy of opposition in an assembly 
               <br />
               such as this cannot be a good thing, either for 
               <br />
               ourselves or for the country at large. Constructive 
               <br />
               suggestion and bitter opposition are worlds apart. 
               <br />
               On Tuesday past we had an exhibition of the sort 
               <br />
               of thing I have in mind ~— a verbal storm was 
               <br />
               raised when one delegate spent hours saying that 
               <br />
               we are not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self-supporting...,</span> 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I listened attentively to those criticising this 
               <br />
               report, hoping I might hear something that would 
               <br />
               throw a new light on the facts presented. I heard 
               <br />
               the member for Bonavista Centre put his personal 
               <br />
               construction on many items but in no case was he 
               <br />
               able to change these facts. I heard a great deal of 
               <br />
               hair splitting, for instance, the report states that 
               <br />
               our Railway is valued at $72 million, and the 
               <br />
               member for Bonavista Centre says no one would 
               <br />
               pay this amount for it. No one suggested that our 
               <br />
               railroad should be put up for sale or that anyone 
               <br />
               should be asked to buy it. The report simply states 
               <br />
               that the Railway is valued at $72 million, a figure 
               <br />
               which Mr. Smallwood endorses himself in the 
               <br />
               report furnished by the Ottawa delegation. I give 
               <br />
               this as an example of the extremes to which critics 
               <br />
               will go to get something to say. Again he bewails 
               <br />
               the fact that our highroads do not earn any 
               <br />
               revenue. If this is an argument against highroads, 
               <br />
               then it would appear to be Mr. Smallwood’s 
               <br />
               argument that North America has made a grave 
               <br />
               mistake in building roads. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Again he is not satisﬁed with the limited na- 
               <br />
               ture of the scope of the report. He says we should 
               <br />
               know what the condition of this country is going 
               <br />
               to be beyond three years from now. I suggest he 
               <br />
               discuss this matter with the governments of the 
               <br />
               United States or Canada, or any government. I 
               <br />
               imagine he would be surprised at what they 
               <br />
               would say to him. He says that we should not plan 
               <br />
               to build a local merchant marine. If he honestly

               thinks this, then it simply means one of two 
               <br />
               things, either we should continue to pay hundreds 
               <br />
               of thousands of dollars annually to foreign ship- 
               <br />
               ping companies, to pay the wages of hundreds of 
               <br />
               foreign sailors, or we should stop bringing goods 
               <br />
               to the country. Mr. Smallwood said many other 
               <br />
               things, but as they amount to nothing more than 
               <br />
               carping criticism, I honestly do not think that I 
               <br />
               am justiﬁed in taking up the time of this House 
               <br />
               in dealing with them. Since he has dismally failed 
               <br />
               to show that this country is not self-supporting, 
               <br />
               has been unable to prove that Newfoundland will 
               <br />
               not be self-supporting in the foreseeable future, I 
               <br />
               contend he has failed in everything, except to 
               <br />
               show how easy it is to attempt to tear down the 
               <br />
               things which other men build up.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Coming back to the report itself, the most 
               <br />
               interesting thing I found was the fact that it ofﬁ- 
               <br />
               cially shows the things which I had always felt to 
               <br />
               be so, but which I was not in a position to prove. 
               <br />
               The ﬁrst was my belief that Newfoundland could 
               <br />
               always look after itself if given a square chance 
               <br />
               to do so.... If Newfoundland had been allowed to 
               <br />
               do what she should have done in l933, declare a 
               <br />
               moratorium on her debts, we would never have 
               <br />
               known a depression such as we had. The report 
               <br />
               states that we are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self«supporting,</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dais</span> fact is 
               <br />
               so self-evident that a dozen critics cannot change 
               <br />
               it. The second fact it shows is that we are in a 
               <br />
               position where we can look to our future with 
               <br />
               conﬁdence. The report limits its view to three 
               <br />
               years. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Chairman, my own view goes far 
               <br />
               beyond this. When I review the stable nature of 
               <br />
               our industries, 1 say that our future is assured not 
               <br />
               for ten years, but for the next 50 years, until the 
               <br />
               last ton of ore is dug from the limitless iron beds 
               <br />
               of Bell Island; the last ton of paper comes from 
               <br />
               our mills, and the last cod’s tail comes out of the 
               <br />
               ocean. No man in this chamber will live to see the 
               <br />
               exhaustion of our main industries, and to 
               <br />
               prophesy the failure of these sources of wealth is 
               <br />
               a blasphemy against a bountiful Providence.
