               <br />
               were not getting sufﬁcient for their toil. Wood 
               <br />

               hour for $1.60, but today I ﬁnd that matters have 
               <br />
               improved and the economic position is much 
               <br />
               better, and therefore the economic position of the 
               <br />
               country has come up <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">also,</span> The ﬁsherman and the 
               <br />
               woodsman are well aware of what is going on. 
               <br />
               They are aware that there’s been a lot of people 
               <br />
               who have done fairly well off the ﬁsherman and 
               <br />
               the labourer, and some of those have made state- 
               <br />
               ments in this House today. They are aware of that, 
               <br />
               and I say that those things don’t help the position 
               <br />
               in any case. I fear that by the words that we use, 
               <br />
               and the gloom that we are prepared to cause, we 
               <br />
               may have some effect upon our people. I realise 
               <br />
               that there are businessmen who are willing to 
               <br />
               allow a person two or three months groceries 
               <br />
               ahead to carry them over the winter; but with the 
               <br />
               pictures that we are painting here, why the wolf 
               <br />
               is living at their doors, and they will wake up in 
               <br />
               the morning and say, “I am sorry we can’t give 
               <br />
               you anything, because those fellows in the Na- 
               <br />
               tional Convention know it all, and poverty is right 
               <br />
               at our door”. We should be careful in the way we 
               <br />
               express ourselves. I feel conﬁdent that this thing 
               <br />
               will right itself and I have taken a course perhaps 
               <br />
               opposite to others, and I am prepared to see what 
               <br />
               I can do about the future in Newfoundland. Along 
               <br />
               with the rest of the labour organisation I think 
               <br />
               those of you who are in doubt can leave it in the 
               <br />
               hands of those who represent labour, especially

               Mr. Burry I would like to make a few com- 
               <br />
               ments on this report. First, I would like to give 
               <br />
               my congratulations to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Bradley (he is not in 
               <br />
               the House at present), because I feel he has given

               a very able and masterly and well balanced <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ad</span> 
               <br />
               dress. The report, sir, as you pointed out at the 
               <br />
               beginning of the debate, is one that is of utmost 
               <br />
               importance, the most important document before 
               <br />
               us in connection with the main purpose of this 
               <br />
               Convention. It was with a great deal of eagerness 
               <br />
               that we looked forward to it. I remember clearly 
               <br />
               the disappointment I received, before we ad— 
               <br />
               journed last spring, when the Finance Committee 
               <br />
               thought it would not give an economic report. But 
               <br />
               the report is before us, and in anticipation of it I 
               <br />
               tried to draw up in my own mind a picture of what 
               <br />
               the economy was like, and to project it into the 
               <br />
               future. I did it for my own satisfaction, and to my 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               own satisfaction. I came here two weeks ago and 
               <br />
               heard this report given by Major Cashin in his 
               <br />
               characteristic way, and l was very much inter- 
               <br />
               ested in it, but I must say that I was keenly 
               <br />
               disappointed, because it did not match up with 
               <br />
               the things I had in mind... It has been said often 
               <br />
               that the Finance Committee has done an excellent 
               <br />
               job in marshalling the facts and presenting them 
               <br />
               to us in the Finance Report that they presented to 
               <br />
               us some time ago. I subscribe to that, and say that 
               <br />
               it is a very comprehensive and able <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">report...</span> 
               <br />
               Now this report that is before us is an inter- 
               <br />
               pretation of these facts, and an interpretation of 
               <br />
               the facts coming out of the other reports and I am 
               <br />
               not enthusiastic about the work of the Committee 
               <br />
               in interpreting the facts that we have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis‘</span> 
               <br />
               covered... 1 think the weakness of the report is 
               <br />
               that it does not give sufficient consideration to 
               <br />
               the smaller units of production in this country, 
               <br />
               and their relation to the economy. I refer to the 
               <br />
               individual farmer, ﬁsherman, trapper and miner 
               <br />
               —— the primary producer. or what Mr. Keough 
               <br />
               likes to call the “little man". Now it may be 
               <br />
               argued that his capacity to produce is reﬂected in 
               <br />
               the millions and millions of dollars that have been 
               <br />
               referred to in this Economic Report and in the 
               <br />
               Financial Report. It may be that the farmer’s 
               <br />
               ability to produce is reflected in the $12.5 million 
               <br />
               that the industry is worth in the estimation of the 
               <br />
               Agricultural Committee; and that the ability of 
               <br />
               the individual fisherman to produce is reﬂected 
               <br />
               in the number of quintals of ﬁsh, etc. That may 
               <br />
               be true in a sense, but it does not tell the whole 
               <br />
               story of the ability of the individual man to 
               <br />
               produce, and how it reﬂects upon the actual 
               <br />
               economy. The farmer, for instance, how is he 
               <br />
               equipped to produce? What is the state of his 
               <br />
               equipment, and how modem is it, and how well 
               <br />
               is he provided to bring the best possible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contribu»</span> 
               <br />
               tion? The ﬁsherman, much has been said about 
               <br />
               him and his ability to produce. We have heard it 
               <br />
               said, and it was brought out in the Fisheries 
               <br />
               Report, that the equipment he has today, in some 
               <br />
               parts of our country at least, is outmoded — it is 
               <br />
               old <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fashioned,</span> I wonder if we realise just how 
               <br />
               outwom and dilapidated that equipment is and 
               <br />
               how much he is handicapped in his ability to 
               <br />
               produce because of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that...</span> Someone has said that 
               <br />
               the equipment of the fishermen has reached a 
               <br />
               very high stage of efficiency. I have no doubt that 
               <br />
               he was sincere in making that statement, and that 
               <br />
