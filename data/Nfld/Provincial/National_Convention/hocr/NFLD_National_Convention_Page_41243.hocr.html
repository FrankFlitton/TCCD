               different. In this case, the taxpayer doesn’ t put his

               hand in his pocket and hand over the taxes to the 
               <br />
               government direct himself. With indirect taxa—

               tion somebody else puts his hand in his pocket,

               takes out the money and hands it over to the 
               <br />
               government, not the man who pays it at all. In 
               <br />
               fact, the man who really pays it doesn’tknow just 
               <br />
               what he is paying, because it was taken out of his 
               <br />
               pocket by somebody else. And that somebody 
               <br />
               else forgot to tell him how much he took out for 
               <br />
               taxes. If a ﬁsherman goes into a shop and pays 
               <br />
               $50 for a bedstead, he pays $50 for it. Does the 
               <br />
               shopkeeper tell him how much of that $50 goes 
               <br />
               to the government in tax? No. And all the ﬁsher- 
               <br />
               man knows is that he paid $50 for the bedstead. 
               <br />
               He knows that he probably paid some tax on it, 
               <br />
               that some part of that $50 went to the govem- 
               <br />
               ment, but how much? He doesn’t know. If he had 
               <br />
               a copy of the customs tariff he could look it up 
               <br />
               and ﬁnd out that the duty on that bedstead is 
               <br />
               50%.... But not only does some of that $50 go to 
               <br />
               the government in tax, but the shopkeeper has 
               <br />
               made a proﬁt on that duty —— I don’t mean a proﬁt 
               <br />
               on the bedstead itself now, but a proﬁt on the duty 
               <br />
               that was paid on the bedstead. He doesn’t tell the 
               <br />
               ﬁsherman that and there’s no reason why he 
               <br />
               should. The shopkeeper has already paid the 
               <br />
               duties to the government. He has paid out that 
               <br />
               money and he, the shopkeeper, is entitled to make 
               <br />
               a proﬁt on the money he puts out, whether it’s put 
               <br />
               out to buy the bedstead in Canada in the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               place, or to pay the government the 50% duty on 
               <br />
               it. It’s all the same to the shopkeeper. He’s in- 
               <br />
               vested the money and he’s expecting to make a 
               <br />
               proﬁt on it. And that’s how it goes, all the way 
               <br />
               through, wherever a customs duty is paid on an 
               <br />
               article. A proﬁt is made on that duty as well as on 
               <br />
               the article itself. Two proﬁts -— and they both 
               <br />
               come out of the customers’ pockets. Even when 
               <br />
               the customer has some idea of this, he usually 
               <br />
               doesn’ t know how much more the article cost him 
               <br />
               because of the duty and the proﬁt on the duty. 
               <br />
               That’s what we call indirect taxation. And that’s 
               <br />
               how the bulk of our govemment’s money is made 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland.

               Suppose the wholesale merchant here in St. 
               <br />
               John’s imports $100 worth of goods from 
               <br />
               Canada. He pays $100 wholesale for the goods in 
               <br />
               Canada. The goods are all at the wharf, but can 
               <br />
               he go and take it off to his own store? No, not till 
               <br />
               he pays the government say $40 duty. So they

               cost him $140 landed in his store. So he puts his 
               <br />
               proﬁt on the $140.... Say his proﬁt rate is 20%, 
               <br />
               that’s $28. So he sells the goods to a retail shop— 
               <br />
               keeper for $168.... The government has its $40 
               <br />
               tax, the wholesale merchant has his $100 back 
               <br />
               and his $40 back, together with his proﬁt on $100 
               <br />
               and his proﬁt on the $40 duty. Now the retail 
               <br />
               shopkeeper has the goods. They cost him $168. 
               <br />
               So he puts on his 20% proﬁt, and that makes the 
               <br />
               goods worth $201. The retail shopkeeper sells 
               <br />
               them to the public, to the ﬁshermen, and loggers, 
               <br />
               and miners, and everybody else, for $201. Now 
               <br />
               what‘s happened? The wholesaler pays the duty 
               <br />
               tax to the government and gets it back with a 
               <br />
               proﬁt from the retailer. The retailer gets it all 
               <br />
               back, together with his own proﬁt from the 
               <br />
               public. The customer, the consumer, the man 
               <br />
               who ﬁnally forks over his money across the 
               <br />
               counter, he pays it all — a tax to the government, 
               <br />
               a proﬁt to the wholesaler on the tax, and the 
               <br />
               retailer’s proﬁt on the wholesaler’s proﬁt — 
               <br />
               proﬁt piled on proﬁt. And the customer pays it all 
               <br />
               and wonders why the cost of living is so high. 
               <br />
               Yes, and some of them shiver when they’re told 
               <br />
               in this Convention about the awful taxes they’ll 
               <br />
               have to pay if we go in with Canada. That system 
               <br />
               of taxation is one of the most unjust, yes, one of 
               <br />
               the most vicious in this world today. It’s bad 
               <br />
               enough to have to pay taxes to the government, 
               <br />
               but a lot worse when private individuals, private 
               <br />
               businessmen, are able to make their own private 
               <br />
               proﬁt on those very taxes. That‘s what we get 
               <br />
               when we raise the bulk of our taxes through 
               <br />
               customs duties.

               Last year we paid the government, all of us 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders, around $20 million in cus- 
               <br />
               toms duties. That was bad enough, and it certain- 
               <br />
               ly drove the cost of living up high enough, but on 
               <br />
               top of that $20 million we paid at least another 
               <br />
               $5 million to the wholesale and retail merchants 
               <br />
               between them as proﬁts on that $20 million duty. 
               <br />
               You see, sir, the merchants paid the duty to the 
               <br />
               government. They laid out their money to pay the 
               <br />
               duty and they were fully entitled to make a proﬁt 
               <br />
               for themselves on that money. I’m not saying one 
               <br />
               word against the merchants on this point. We 
               <br />
               can’t blame them a bit. They have got to do it if 
               <br />
               they’re going to stay in business. But the fact 
               <br />
               remains that the general trade of the country last 
               <br />
               year took at least $5 million out of all of us, to 
               <br />
               compensate themselves for collecting the
