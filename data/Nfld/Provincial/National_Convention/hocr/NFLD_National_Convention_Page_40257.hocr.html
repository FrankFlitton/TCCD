               <br />
               be deeply impressed by the debate of yesterday 
               <br />
               and today. To hear 40-odd men, elected from 37 
               <br />
               districts, come in and bear out a united and unan- 
               <br />
               imous story of neglect of roads that once existed 
               <br />
               and have disappeared, that have been washed 
               <br />
               away by the ﬂoods and storms, and have had 
               <br />
               practically no money spent on them for a dozen 
               <br />
               years, I thinkI would be deeply impressed by the 
               <br />
               fact that here is an island which, except for a few 
               <br />
               highroads, is practically without roads, and I 
               <br />
               would not feel in the least like ridiculing the 
               <br />
               elected representatives from those districts. I 
               <br />
               would know enough about the conditions of this

               Now, this appendix prepared for us by the 
               <br />
               Department of Public Utilities describes the new 
               <br />
               system which the government has brought into 
               <br />
               existence in the past couple of years for dealing 
               <br />
               with local roads. I am not disposed to ridicule the 
               <br />
               scheme the government has worked out. It seems 
               <br />
               to me that behind this plan of working up these 
               <br />
               local road boards, of which we now have about 
               <br />
               400 involving, I suppose, between 400 and 500 
               <br />
               settlements, there is something more than merely 
               <br />
               forming committees to handle local roads. Be~ 
               <br />
               hind it is a plan to get the people of New— 
               <br />
               foundland to take a more active part and interest 
               <br />
               in the public affairs of their country. It may turn 
               <br />
               out, when all the reports have been considered 
               <br />
               by this small batch of Newfoundlanders, that we 
               <br />
               will recommend some form of elected govem- 
               <br />
               ment, or it may turn out that we will recommend 
               <br />
               that we go right on under Commission govem- 
               <br />
               ment, we don’t know yet. Let us say that we 
               <br />
               recommend some form of elected government. 
               <br />
               What gentleman in this chamber today, or out of 
               <br />
               it, would be willing to be a member of that 
               <br />
               government of the future, knowing that there 
               <br />
               were 1,300 settlements with, at the present time, 
               <br />
               3,000 miles of local road (that’s only a guess) 
               <br />
               which have to be taken care of? What member 
               <br />
               would wish to be a member of a government, if 
               <br />
               that government had to ﬁnd every dollar to keep 
               <br />
               up those 3,000 miles of local roads? I feel that no 
               <br />
               one would want to do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that.</span> 
               <br />

               For that reason I am delighted to see an effort 
               <br />
               made to work up these local road committees, not 
               <br />
               merely for the sake of getting the people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inter»</span>

               ested in their own local affairs with regard to 
               <br />
               roads and bridges, but also for getting these same 
               <br />
               people more actively interested in public affairs 
               <br />
               generally. One of the weaknesses of this country 
               <br />
               in the past has been the fact that we had in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland only one government, namely the 
               <br />
               central government in the city of St. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">John’s.</span> They 
               <br />
               tell me that you cannot get more than 60 miles 
               <br />
               from the salt water anywhere in Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               But from St. John’s to some parts of this country 
               <br />
               it might as well be 2-3,000 miles. This means that 
               <br />
               St. John’s and the government here know practi~ 
               <br />
               cally nothing of what goes on in the country. If 
               <br />
               you are going to have democracy and efﬁcient 
               <br />
               government, you have got to enlist the people of 
               <br />
               the country in it, and to do that they have at least 
               <br />
               made a beginning in the formation of these road 
               <br />
               committees. I know it is pitiful to think of 
               <br />
               $109,000 voted by the government to assist these 
               <br />
               local road <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">committees.</span> It only scratches the sur- 
               <br />
               face of the problem, but it is a beginning. I hope 
               <br />
               that people in the settlements where they still 
               <br />
               have no local road committees, as they listen in 
               <br />
               to these broadcasts, many of them ﬁnding out, 
               <br />
               maybe for the first time, that there is a way in 
               <br />
               which they can get a few dollars from the govern- 
               <br />
               ment, I hope that they also will get awake and 
               <br />
               active and form their road committees. Who 
               <br />
               knows but that these local road committees may 
               <br />
               some day develop into a first class form of local 
               <br />
               government.

               I will say that this Convention is supposed to 
               <br />
               consider not only roads, but everything else, in 
               <br />
               the light of one great question: will the future 
               <br />
               government of Newfoundland, whether it be 
               <br />
               Commission or anything else, be able to balance 
               <br />
               its budget? If it can’t, we are up against it. In

               <br />

               <br />
               like it or not, we must ﬁnd out as far as we can 
               <br />
               what the future expenditure of the government 
               <br />
               has got to be. Now, so far as the Transportation

               and Communications Committee is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">concerned,</span> 
               <br />
               that is exactly what we have been trying to do. In 
               <br />
               our report on Gander we have told you that so far 
               <br />
               as we can see, the country is saddled with a loss 
               <br />
               of $1 million a year; that as far as the Railway is 
               <br />
               concerned, a loss of $1.5 million a year. So far as
