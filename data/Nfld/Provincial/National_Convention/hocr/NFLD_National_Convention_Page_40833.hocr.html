               proceed, Major Cashin. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin After some 12 days the debate on 
               <br />
               this Economic Report has been concluded, and it 
               <br />
               now remains with me to wind up the discussion 
               <br />
               and to answer as best I possibly can the questions 
               <br />
               which have been put through you, Mr. Chairman, 
               <br />
               in order to clarify the whole situation. The 
               <br />
               speeches of the delegates generally were of a high 
               <br />
               order and showed that the various reports sub- 
               <br />
               mitted to this Convention had received their 
               <br />
               closest attention. However, there were one or two 
               <br />
               speeches which were devoted primarily to 
               <br />
               destroying the basis on which the report was 
               <br />
               compiled, and to generally paint a gloomy picture 
               <br />
               of the country from every possible angle. Notably 
               <br />
               was the speech of the delegate from Bonavista 
               <br />
               Centre directed in this avenue. It reminded me of 
               <br />
               speeches delivered by soap box orators in Times 
               <br />
               Square in New York and in Hyde Park in London. 
               <br />
               None of our critics whose object was to paint a 
               <br />
               gloomy picture attempted to show any altema- 
               <br />
               tive, and in this respect it is proven that there was 
               <br />
               a deliberate attempt by a few delegates to tear 
               <br />
               down the economic structure of the country, sole— 
               <br />
               ly for the purpose of trying to advance their own 
               <br />
               fanatical cause.

               wood states that our estimate of cash surpluses is

               shown in the last paragraph on page 2 of the

               <br />
               speech made by Mr. James on May 7, 1947. ldo 
               <br />
               not propose at this time to criticise Mr. James’ 
               <br />
               budget speech, but at the same time I am com— 
               <br />
               pelted to point out that this budget speech does 
               <br />
               not reveal the true situation of the country. Before 
               <br />
               proceeding, let me point out that the Finance 
               <br />
               Report was compiled on information received 
               <br />
               from the various departments of government, but 
               <br />
               particularly its statements of figures were com~ 
               <br />
               piled on information requested from the Depart- 
               <br />
               ment of Finance; also on information given the 
               <br />
               Convention by former Commissioner Wild over 
               <br />
               one year ago. This Economic Report was com- 
               <br />
               piled and presented to this assembly on Novem- 
               <br />
               ber 3, nearly seven months after the presentation 
               <br />
               of the Financial Report. The figures in the 
               <br />
               Economic Report were based on information 
               <br />
               contained in the Finance Report, as well as infor- 
               <br />
               mation obtained since the presentation of this 
               <br />
               latter report. Now, what are the facts?

               In Mr. James’ budget speech delivered in May

               <br />
               as at March 31, 1947, amounted to $28,789,000. 
               <br />
               Now, Mr. Chairman, if we take the revenue and

               <br />

               revenues for this particular period amount to 
               <br />
