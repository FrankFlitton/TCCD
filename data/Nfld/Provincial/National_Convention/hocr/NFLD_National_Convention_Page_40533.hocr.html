               Mr. Smallwood With reference to 12 rivers 
               <br />
               given in this list, in each of them it says from two 
               <br />
               years (in three cases three years) after granting 
               <br />
               the water-power, they were supposed to develop 
               <br />
               them. The grants were issued 1910, 1911, 1912, 
               <br />
               1913, 1914, 1896, 1897, 1921 and 1924. All 
               <br />
               these, according to the conditions, were supposed 
               <br />
               to be developed within two or three years. Could 
               <br />
               Mr. Banﬁeld tell us the position with regard to 
               <br />
               these water-powers? Are they still under grant, or 
               <br />
               did the grant lapse when they failed to develop? 
               <br />
               Mr. Banﬁeld All these pay annual rentals with 
               <br />
               the exception of three rivers — Rattling Brook,

               Mr. Smallwood How can they pay in the case

               <br />
               on demand. Also Black River. In other cases they 
               <br />
               pay 25 cents a horsepower developed. In these 
               <br />

               Mr. Banﬁeld 1 may say that they have not 
               <br />
               developed the water-powers, but I think they 
               <br />
               have some other agreement to pay an annual 
               <br />

               develop water-power on the river. The condition 
               <br />
               of getting that tremendous grant was that within 
               <br />
               two years they would develop the water-power 
               <br />

               horsepower from John Finlay Stewart of England 
               <br />
               and Bowaters? Can they tie it up for 99 years? 
               <br />
               Suppose] want to go up there and develop? Does 
               <br />
               it mean that for the remainder of 99 years no one 
               <br />
               can develop that 100,000 hp or any of it?

               Mr. Starkes There must be some 
               <br />
               misunderstanding -- Indian Brook, Halls Bay — 
               <br />
               Mr. Banﬁeld gave out the Operating horsepower,

               Mr. Smallwood That “could be” developed. 
               <br />
               That is the capacity. Could Mr. Banfield tell us if 
               <br />
               the government has the ﬁgures as to the total 
               <br />

               <br />
               that mean the government does not know what 
               <br />
               the water-power in Newfoundland is? 
               <br />
