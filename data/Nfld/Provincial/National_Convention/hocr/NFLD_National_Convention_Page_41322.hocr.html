               Now, I made the statement that Newfound- 
               <br />
               land was never quite free, never wholly inde- 
               <br />
               pendent. What did I mean by this? Simply that 
               <br />
               while Newfoundland was theoretically under 
               <br />
               responsible government managing her own af- 
               <br />
               fairs, in reality, in the last analysis, Great Britain 
               <br />
               had the ﬁnal say on any matters affecting the 
               <br />
               extra-territorial activities of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> Hence, 
               <br />
               amongst other things, the blocking of the Bond— 
               <br />
               Blaine reciprocity treaty, when Canada went over 
               <br />
               Newfoundland’s head to Great Britain, with the 
               <br />
               known results. Things have greatly changed 
               <br />
               since then, and there is in existence what is 
               <br />
               known as the Statute of Westminster, enacted in 
               <br />
               1931 in relation to the dominions, of which New- 
               <br />
               foundland was one in 1931, and still is, though

               been reading a very good book on the Statute of

               Westminister and its application to the various

               it would appear that in the interval between the

               Statute of Westminister into the House of Com— 
               <br />
               mons, Newfoundland requested the insertion of 
               <br />
               a clause postponing the application of sections 2 
               <br />
               — 6 of the statute to Newfoundland until its par- 
               <br />

               tion 3 of these postponed clauses reads as 
               <br />
               follows: <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“3,</span> it is hereby declared and enacted that 
               <br />
               the Parliament of a Dominion has full power to

               <br />
               That means, as I understand it, that if a respon-

               Westminster, by and with the consent of the 
               <br />
               people, it could then be free to negotiate a trade 
               <br />
               or other agreement, a reciprocity treaty on the 
               <br />
               lines of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Bond«Blaine</span> treaty, and there could

               be no interference by Britain, or by Canada through 
               <br />
               Britain. That is the clue to our future solution of our

               to be deemed to possess all the powers of that 
               <br />
               legislature, nor were they described as a 
               <br />
               legislature or parliament. It may be argued 
               <br />
               therefore, that no parliament exists to exer—

               Westrninister upon ‘the Parliament of a 
               <br />

               <br />
               2 - 6 of the Statute is impossible so long as

               this system of government by commission

               be a dominion still (though in name only), 
               <br />
