               natural resources of both Labrador and New- 
               <br />
               foundland. Can we not hold on to this a little 
               <br />
               longer and find out what it will really mean to us? 
               <br />
               After all, only yesterday, through the efforts of 
               <br />
               Mr. Fudge, we learned ofﬁcially that somebody 
               <br />
               had offered $150 million for Labrador. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood No, no, no ~— no such thing... 
               <br />
               No one has made any offer at all, no one. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman The position is that the offer 
               <br />
               was allegedly made by an undisclosed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">principal.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood No sir, it’s not even that. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman You read the letter, but the name 
               <br />
               of the person was not made known. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood The letter merely said that 
               <br />
               somebody wrote the department suggesting that 
               <br />
               it be sold. The one who wrote it wasn’t offering 
               <br />
               to buy it. He didn’t say that anyone was offering 
               <br />
               to buy it. He merely up and said it should be sold 
               <br />
               for $150 million. That’s What's in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">letter...</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman If it’s important I’ll make a 
               <br />
               decision, so we’ll all see what the letter contains.

               Mr. Fowler I really brought it up because Iknew 
               <br />
               there were some doubts about it, and I think it’s 
               <br />
               very good to have it cleared up. Gentlemen, even 
               <br />
               though we have been dead politically for the past 
               <br />
               14 years, let us bestir ourselves, awake to the 
               <br />
               importance of our inheritance, and if any ad- 
               <br />
               vantages are tobehad, let us as Newfoundlanders 
               <br />
               reap the beneﬁts, and if Canada or the United 
               <br />
               States are interested, we will be in a position to 
               <br />
               do business with them as friendly neighbours. For 
               <br />
               these reasons then, it is my opinion that respon— 
               <br />
               sible government, the goal of all civilised people, 
               <br />
               should be restored to Newfoundland so that the 
               <br />
               people should be free to do business with the 
               <br />
               United States as well as Canada, if they so desire. 
               <br />
               And in any event, they would be free to act 
               <br />
               according to the dictates of the country. Thank 
               <br />
               you.

               Mr. Crummey Mr. Chairman, it’s a pity almost 
               <br />
               to spoil that happy relationship we had in Canada, 
               <br />
               so ably demonstrated by our friend Senator 
               <br />
               Prospective. I did not intend at this juncture to 
               <br />
               take any part, but seeing I’m the lone bird of the 
               <br />
               Ottawa delegation, I thought that possibly it 
               <br />
               might be thought that I was in accord with the 
               <br />
               majority of the delegation that returned from 
               <br />
               Ottawa. I want to say without any shadow of a 
               <br />
               doubt that I am anticonfederate on the terms that 
               <br />
               have been brought down here. Mr. Burry, I think, 
               <br />
               hinted yesterday that if we had had some New- 
               <br />
               foundland experts up there we would have been 
               <br />
               back in possibly three weeks. I’m half inclined to 
               <br />
               disagree with him on the grounds that if we had 
               <br />
               had all the experts in Newfoundland and else- 
               <br />
               where, it was not possible to get back before we 
               <br />
               did. I doubt very much, Major, that we would 
               <br />
               have been back by the time we did arrive, had not 
               <br />
               that famous message been sent up and a copy sent 
               <br />
               to the Prime Minister of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada.</span>

               came a little ahead of the time that they would 
               <br />
               have liked for us to come. True, they said come 
               <br />
               around June or the lst of July. But they dis- 
               <br />
               covered politically that we arrived a little too 
               <br />
               early. The suggestion was made that we go home 
               <br />
               and come back again in September. But 
               <br />
               we...thought that if we came back the possibilities 
               <br />
               were that we wouldn’t get back again in Septem-
