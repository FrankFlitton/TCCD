               I wish to speak in support of the motion moved 
               <br />
               by Mr. Smallwood because I consider that there 
               <br />
               is a matter of principle involved. The principle is 
               <br />
               this: the right of the people of Newfoundland to 
               <br />
               know all the facts, to see both sides of the story 
               <br />
               to be shown all the angles. When the people of 
               <br />
               this island ﬁnally come to determine upon the 
               <br />
               form of government they desire I want them to

               be in a position to determine, if they so desire,

               <br />
               a higher standard of living than any other. They 
               <br />
               may well determine upon that form of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govem~</span>

               meet — they hope. But they should be in a

               position then, among the several forms that may 
               <br />
               be available to their discretion, to determine upon 
               <br />
               that calculated to mean the most in terms of better

               lesser dimension of “enough” than a standard of 
               <br />

               ter. But I see no good and sufﬁcient reason for 
               <br />
               being satisﬁed with anything less. “Enough”, as 
               <br />
               far as I am concerned, is not less than the most 
               <br />
               that may be had. I hate to say anything so original, 
               <br />

               wish to imply that confederation is the best that 
               <br />
               may be had, I do wish to afﬁrm that we must not

               fail to search out all information that will enable 
               <br />
               the people of this island to judge wherein the best 
               <br />
               may be achieved

               There are some who are prepared to settle for 
               <br />
               less than that. Thus we hear much mention of the 
               <br />
               irreducible minimum cost of government. I do 
               <br />
               not like that yardstick. A mere 36 inches of ability 
               <br />
               to make both ends meet at this moment would 
               <br />
               seem to me too meagre a measure of our ability 
               <br />
               to be sufﬁcient unto ourselves tomorrow. I can— 
               <br />
               not see that it would be the wisest thing to decide 
               <br />
               the constitutional issue on our ability to meet the

               irreducible minimum cost of government at this 
               <br />
               moment. For given an economic reversal of any 
               <br />
               magnitude we might easily ﬁnd ourselves below 
               <br />
               that level.

               With regard to the motion before the House, I 
               <br />
               am not going to be greatly moved by any who 
               <br />
               may care to point the ﬁnger of constitutional 
               <br />
               scorn. I am not an expert in constitutional law. 
               <br />
               Thus was I shocked in the beginning to hear this 
               <br />
               Convention in which I sat termed illegal. I did 
               <br />
               subsequently console myself with the thought 
               <br />
               that perhaps the Parliament of Britain did also 
               <br />
               know something about what was constitutional 
               <br />
               and what was not, that whilst that Parliament 
               <br />
               might often do things of which many did not 
               <br />
               approve, it was unlikely to do that which was 
               <br />
               constitutionally improper. So I sit here quite con- 
               <br />
               tent that it is legal to sit here. It may be immoral, 
               <br />
               even fattening, but I am quite convinced that it is 
               <br />
               not illegal to sit here. Similarly if the appropriate 
               <br />
               authorities act now as requested, then I feel that 
               <br />
               we shall have every assurance that the act en~
