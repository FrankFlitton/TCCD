               I’ve been unable to ﬁnd from perusing this 
               <br />
               report that the Committee takes seriously into 
               <br />
               account section three of the act which sets forth 
               <br />
               that we are to bear in mind the extent to which 
               <br />
               our high revenues have been due to wartime 
               <br />
               posterity. I don’t ﬁnd that there’s very much 
               <br />
               mention of that in the Financial Report. it more 
               <br />
               or less gives the ﬁgures and lets us place our own 
               <br />
               interpretation on them. On page 107, coming to 
               <br />
               the year 1940-41, we ﬁnd our budget balance for 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst time in 11 years, and a small surplus was 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shown,</span> Now, that certainly might lead one to 
               <br />
               jump to the conclusion that wartime increased 
               <br />
               expenditures had something to do with our 
               <br />
               balancing our budget. But I think we must at all 
               <br />
               times bear in mind the extra labour and high 
               <br />
               prices that we’ve received for our products 
               <br />
               during this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">period.</span> The report doesn’t go into any 
               <br />
               fundamental changes that have taken place in our 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">economy.</span> But I imagine that would be left more 
               <br />
               for the economic section of the report than for the 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial, and we accept it as such. But! would 
               <br />
               ask us all to bear in mind, that in all good 
               <br />
               capitalist economies, due note and very serious 
               <br />
               note is always taken of what is called the business 
               <br />
               cycle; in fact the whole world is very responsive 
               <br />
               to this business cycle, almost as to an act of God. 
               <br />
               I refer of course to the boom that you get from 
               <br />
               times of prosperity followed by a recession fol- 
               <br />
               lowed by a bust, followed by a slow recovery, and 
               <br />
               ﬁnally a boom <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">again.</span> If you read economic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his!</span> 
               <br />
               tory you’ll ﬁnd that that’s gone on and on, and 
               <br />
               it’s taken for granted. And such things as social 
               <br />
               security schemes, family allowances and what 
               <br />
               not, that we have referred to already, are in my 
               <br />
               opinion guy wires or props to keep up an 
               <br />
               economic system and keep it going, which takes 
               <br />
               note of these things and accepts them as part of 
               <br />
               the system. I think it’s very necessary that in the 
               <br />
               future we should keep that kind of thing ahead of 
               <br />

               us; and the point is not to say that we are worse 
               <br />
               off than other countries or better off than other 
               <br />
               countries. That’s not enough. What we want to 
               <br />
               know is where we stand objectively, where we 
               <br />
               stand ﬁnancially. Beyond this I have no desire to 
               <br />
               go at the moment in commenting on or commit- 
               <br />
               ting myself to the conclusions reached by the 
               <br />
               Finance Committee, and set forth by them in the 
               <br />
               concluding pages of their report. The work they 
               <br />
               undertook was considerable and the result as far 
               <br />
               as it goes is commendable. It seems to me how- 
               <br />
               ever that we can all too glibly separate the ﬁnan- 
               <br />
               cial from the economic. We’ve been saying this 
               <br />
               can come up in the Economic Report, and that’ll 
               <br />
               come up in the Economic Report, this is merely 
               <br />
               a Financial Report. But are not high or low 
               <br />
               revenues the outward visible and financial signs 
               <br />
               of a thriving or a depressed economic condition? 
               <br />
               You cannot entirely separate the two. Well, 
               <br />
               we’ve had a Financial Report, and in the main 
               <br />
               I’m satisﬁed with it. It’s been excellent in its 
               <br />
               factual contents. We are also to have an 
               <br />
               Economic Report equally as good 1 trust. i feel 
               <br />
               though, and 1 must say this in all fairness to 
               <br />
               myself and to the Committee, that the con- 
               <br />
               clusions set forth in the summary of the Financial 
               <br />
               Report might more properly have been drawn 
               <br />
               from a consideration of both reports together, 
               <br />
               rather then from the Financial Report alone. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smaliwood If there‘s no one to take ad- 
               <br />
               vantage of the opportunity, there’s a question I’d 
               <br />
               like to direct to Mr. Cashin. It arises from a 
               <br />
               statement on page 52. It says: 
               <br />
               The Finance Committee also deplores the 
               <br />
               action of the Commission of Government 
               <br />
               with respect to a restriction by the Commis~ 
               <br />
               sion of the rates of pay to be given our New- 
               <br />
               foundland workmen in return for their 
               <br />
               services in the construction of the American 
               <br />
               bases, inasmuch as it is asserted that the 
               <br />
               Commission of Government gave direct or 
               <br />
               indirect instmctions to the American and 
               <br />
               Canadian contractors not to pay New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders the same rates of pay as the 
               <br />
               American workmen for performing similar 
               <br />
               work, on the grounds that it would upset the 
               <br />
               general economy of the country. 
               <br />
               Then it goes on to say that the first contingent of 
               <br />
               American military forces <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arrived</span> here in January 
               <br />
               1941, and began the construction work and goes 
               <br />
               on to tell of the Canadian military authorities
