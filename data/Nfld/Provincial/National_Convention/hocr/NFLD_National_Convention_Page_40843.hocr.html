               <br />
               that information. In 1931 I happened to be Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Finance in Newfoundland, unfortunately. 
               <br />
               When our loans were turned down, and when we 
               <br />
               cut everything to the bone, as I described it here 
               <br />
               the other day, at the end of October, 1931, the 
               <br />
               banks came to the government, asking us to go 
               <br />
               off the gold standard. At that time our people had 
               <br />
               some $24-25 million in gold, in money in the 
               <br />
               banks, which they could take out on demand in 
               <br />
               gold. We refused for two months. Finally we had 
               <br />
               to go off. As an Executive Council member at that 
               <br />
               time you will understand that I am not in a posi- 
               <br />
               tion to reveal anything of what happened. Mr. 
               <br />
               Bradley was a member at the same time. But here 
               <br />
               is what did happen: when we eventually went off 
               <br />
               the gold standard, gold was $20.67 an ounce. It 
               <br />
               did not rise to a very great extent during the next 
               <br />
               year, but when the last President Roosevelt took 
               <br />
               over the administration of the affairs of the 
               <br />
               United States in March 1933 he rose the price 
               <br />
               of gold in order that the banks would be able to 
               <br />
               issue more paper, and give more employment, 
               <br />
               and gold went up to $35 an ounce. That meant 
               <br />
               that if we had not gone off the gold standard, and 
               <br />
               we had compelled the Canadian banks to bring 
               <br />
               down that $25 million in gold to pay our 
               <br />
               depositors, in 1930 or somewhere in that vicinity, 
               <br />
               their money would be worth 80% more than it 
               <br />
               was before. Now who made that money? Some 
               <br />
               people think that the Canadian chartered banks 
               <br />
               here made it. I hold that they did not. There was 
               <br />
               a central bank established in Canada which con- 
               <br />
               trolled currency, and they took over all the gold 
               <br />
               and they, if anyone, made the money, not the 
               <br />
               chartered banks; and I have no brief for the 
               <br />
               chartered banks, because I hate to go into one of 
               <br />
               them if I owe them a note or something, but I give 
               <br />
               them credit they did not make all that money. I 
               <br />
               think they got a commission, so to speak... They 
               <br />
               made the profit, but Newfoundland lost that 
               <br />
               proﬁt. Whoever’s fault it is, it is done and we 
               <br />
               can’t undo it.... That is the story of the bank 
               <br />
               people. I have not given it to you in full, Mr. 
               <br />
               Reddy, because I am not in a position to do so.

               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, would Major 
               <br />
               Cashin explain how, when the government 
               <br />
               brought in the act which put us off the gold 
               <br />
               standard, it was not a mandatory act but merely 
               <br />
               a permissive one, that would have enabled the 
               <br />
               government to put us back on the gold standard

               at any moment. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin That’s what happened. I went out 
               <br />
               of the finance department shortly after that. We 
               <br />
               went off the gold standard New Year’s Eve, 
               <br />
               about 12.30. It was really New Year’s Day. We 
               <br />
               were technically defaulting on December 31, and 
               <br />
               before they would give us any money to pay our 
               <br />
               interest, they put the gun to our head and told us 
               <br />
               we had to go off the gold <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">standard...</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I think in fairness to yourself, 
               <br />
               Major Cashin, you did point out the other day that 
               <br />
               the banks of Canada had that money, and if you 
               <br />
               insisted on their bringing down that $25 million 
               <br />
               worth of gold to depositors they would have gone 
               <br />
               broke. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin The commercial houses owed the 
               <br />
               banks a lot of money, and they did not know what 
               <br />
               was going to happen — anything could happen. 
               <br />
               Ithink you will admit, Mr. Chairman, that our 
               <br />
               Committee had to give its findings to this Con- 
               <br />
               vention under anything but favourable condi- 
               <br />
               tions. This report, instead of being treated in an 
               <br />
               impartial manner as it should have been, and 
               <br />
               regarded as the best efforts of the Committee 
               <br />
               was subjected to vicious attack from the moment 
               <br />
               it was laid on the table. From every conceivable 
               <br />
               angle its critics attacked it, making it a political 
               <br />
               football. They went through all its 45 pages, 
               <br />
               looking for an uncrossed “t”, or an undotted “i”, 
               <br />
               to furnish them with ammunition for their 
               <br />
               denouncements. Mr. Chairman, when you 
               <br />
               opened the debate you said all holds were fair, 
               <br />
               and the critics came out and tore the report to 
               <br />
               bits... 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman If you don’t mind Mr. Cashin, I 
               <br />
               hope you don’t... 
               <br />
               Mr Cashin I don’t mind a bit. Those political 
               <br />
               windjammers... 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I made the order because I knew 
               <br />
               that no holds were going to be barred. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin Those political windjammers hit 
               <br />
               below the belt, because they could not hit any 
               <br />
               higher. They charged it with being a dishonest 
               <br />
               report, but that has been cast back in their teeth. 
               <br />
               Their efforts have been in vain, and now, after a 
               <br />
               12 day barrage, when these critics have slung all 
               <br />
               their mud and exhausted their bag of tricks, our 
               <br />
               report has come through intact on all its fun- 
               <br />
               damental points. It came through for the same 
               <br />
               reason that truth always comes through. It came 
               <br />
               through because it was based on unassailable and 
               <br />
