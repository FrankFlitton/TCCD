               Now if anyone has any doubt in his mind on 
               <br />
               the system of taxation in Canada, which would 
               <br />
               and must be the system which would prevail in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland if we go into confederation, then 
               <br />
               I ask him to consider well these ﬁgures. These 
               <br />
               ﬁgures are correct, and only serve to show how 
               <br />
               largely the system of taxation in the provinces 
               <br />
               depends upon the taxation of land and buildings, 
               <br />
               farm machinery and ﬁshing equipment, and other 
               <br />
               real and personal property. In the new province 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland there is being collected today, 
               <br />
               by means of such taxation, less than $600,000. In 
               <br />
               my estimate made a few days ago, I came to the 
               <br />
               conclusion that under the proposals forwarded to 
               <br />
               us by the Prime Minister of Canada we should 
               <br />
               ﬁnd ourselves storing up deﬁcits to the extent of 
               <br />
               over $5 million a year unless we resort to further 
               <br />
               taxation on real and personal property. I submit 
               <br />
               therefore, sir, that we shall ﬁnd that within a 
               <br />
               period of two or three years under confederation 
               <br />
               anybody who is still living in this country will be 
               <br />
               able to ﬁnd that the total municipal taxes were 
               <br />
               $5-6 million, and of this amount some $4 million 
               <br />
               or over will have been collected on real and 
               <br />
               personal property.

               <br />
               your attention to the Ontario Gazette of Septem- 
               <br />

               <br />
               there listed some 542 lots of property which are 
               <br />
               listed under the heading “Treasury’s Sale of Land

               <br />
               week I endeavoured to point out how the 
               <br />
               municipalities, and the provinces too for that 
               <br />

               <br />
               cannot pay your taxes. We have the right here in 
               <br />
               this country, but it has not been exercised. In the 
               <br />
               last 40 years here in the town of St. John’s there 
               <br />
               has not been a piece of property sold for payment 
               <br />
               of taxes. That is an authoritative fact. Yes, they

               <br />
               property under the heading “Treasury’s Sale of 
               <br />
               Land for Arrears of Taxes.” Now this is in the 
               <br />
               Province of Ontario alone. Here is one instance: 
               <br />
               “Widow, Frances M. Kelly, Lot No. 17, one 
               <br />
               half-acre of land, arrears of taxes $10.36 — cost 
               <br />
               $2, total $12.36." Now, sir, this widow, unable to 
               <br />
               pay $10.36, had her half acre of land sold by the 
               <br />
               municipality because she was unable to pay. And 
               <br />
               there were 542 pieces of a like nature in the said 
               <br />
               province in that particular quarter of the year. 
               <br />
               Yes, when our main sources of taxation have 
               <br />
               been taken over by the Government of Canada, 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood will have to resort very largely 
               <br />
               to taxation on such real and personal property as 
               <br />
               we have in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> Let us point out, sir, that 
               <br />
               in the whole of Canada the total of their provin- 
               <br />
               cial and municipal taxes collected in 1943 was 
               <br />
               $649 million, and of this amount $274 million 
               <br />
               came from taxes on real and personal property. 
               <br />
               New this is much more than one-third of the 
               <br />
               whole of the taxes collected by the provinces and 
               <br />
               municipalities. Apply this to the case of New- 
               <br />
               foundland. I estimated a week or so ago that we 
               <br />
               would need some $173 million to run the country 
               <br />
               as a province, and I believe myself to be at least 
               <br />
               equally as capable as Mr. Smallwood when it 
               <br />
               comes to dealing with ﬁgures. I have pointed out 
               <br />
               that more than one—third of the taxes collected by 
               <br />
               the provinces and municipalities in Canada are 
               <br />
               derived from taxes on property. Is it not therefore 
               <br />
               reasonable to anticipate that we as a province 
               <br />
               would be collecting more than one-third of this 
               <br />
               $17.3 million, and that will make more than $5 
               <br />
               million? 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now I quite agree with that. There are many 
               <br />
               people holding vacant and unoccupied land, and 
               <br />
               I have no objection whatsoever to their being 
               <br />
               made to pay taxes, but when the taxes affect the 
               <br />
               primary producers of this country, then I feel in 
               <br />
               duty bound to warn those primary producers, 
               <br />
               such as the ﬁsherman, the farmer, the miner and 
               <br />
               the logger, of what they can expect. 
               <br />
