               It’s time our people made an entirely new 
               <br />
               approach to their appraisal of Commission of 
               <br />
               Government: a new approach in this way, that

               each and every voter ask himself or herself this 
               <br />
               question — what assurance have I from the state- 
               <br />
               ments of Lord Addison that the British govem- 
               <br />
               merit will guarantee our economic stability 
               <br />
               should we fall upon mean times ﬁve or ten years 
               <br />
               from now? Or to put it plainer, what guarantee is 
               <br />
               there contained in this report that England will be 
               <br />
               in a position to help us with anything at any time? 
               <br />
               Now quite plainly the answer isjust this: there is, 
               <br />
               there can be no such hard and fast guarantee.

               I have no illusions as to what a large percent- 
               <br />
               age of our people think of Commission <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern»</span> 
               <br />
               ment, but there are many whose apathy merely 
               <br />
               causes them to shrug their shoulders and say, 
               <br />
               “This is the best government we ever had. This 
               <br />
               government brought us prosperity, higher wages, 
               <br />
               and a better price for our ﬁshery products”. It’s 
               <br />
               just as much a truth to say, “Adolf Hitler was the 
               <br />
               greatest man that ever lived. He was great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be»</span> 
               <br />
               cause he created a world crisis that brought us 
               <br />
               unheard of wealth and prosperity.” The London 
               <br />
               delegation brings us just this, my friends: “Any 
               <br />
               guarantee of financial and economic aid is 
               <br />
               definitely out of the question, and we, the 
               <br />
               Dominions Ofﬁce, can actually guarantee New~ 
               <br />
               foundland nothing at all.” I would emphasise this 
               <br />
               now, lest ten years hence Newfoundlanders, 
               <br />
               having made their decision, may once again have 
               <br />
               desperate reminders of their choice in the form of 
               <br />
               six cents per day guaranteed dole.

               In concluding, I cannot altogether agree with 
               <br />
               the sentiments expressed so dramatically by my 
               <br />
               good friend Major Cashin.... Now I am more 
               <br />
               concerned with the welfare of my fellow-

               <br />
               and loves of my great ancestors who, perhaps 
               <br />
               more patriotic than practical, waved a ﬂag when 
               <br />
               they might have been better employed. Whether 
               <br />
               we like it or not, from the dust of old beliefs, old 
               <br />
               customs, old loves; from the ashes of old tradi- 
               <br />
               tions, political and otherwise, a new order is 
               <br />

               <br />

               foundland are not unaffected by this historic

               <br />
               duced suggesting an approach to a foreign power. 
               <br />
               A few shouted “upstart", “renegade", “seces- 
               <br />
               sionist", a few talked of kicking down any con~

               <br />

               sive sentiment that is slowly, in the minds of 
               <br />
               young Newfoundlanders, tearing down the dams 
               <br />
               of the past, and bringing a new thought and 
               <br />
               perhaps a new vision for our people.

               Mr. Chairman, I am well content to let the 
               <br />
               matter of choice of government rest in the hands 
               <br />
               of my fellow countrymen. I care not if the 
               <br />
               majority view of things differs from mine, but 1 
               <br />
               am concerned that they be not misled in their 
               <br />
               interpretations of the reports of this Convention. 
               <br />
               To this end I submit that l cannot find in the report 
               <br />
               of the London delegation sufﬁcient guarantee for 
               <br />

               <br />
               casion in me past was made here yesterday by 
               <br />
               Mr. Butt, when be quoted the famous 
               <br />
               Labouchere despatch of 1857, which has been 
               <br />
               referred to as Newfoundland’s Magna Cana, in- 
               <br />
               asmuch as it laid down the democratic principle 
               <br />
               “that the consent of the community of New- 
               <br />
               foundland is regarded by Her Majesty’s Govern- 
               <br />
               ment as the essential preliminary to any 
               <br />
               modification of their territorial or maritime 
               <br />
               rights”. What a shame that our Newfoundland 
               <br />
               Commissioners of the 19405 did not recall the 
               <br />
               Labouchere despatch before they collaborated in 
               <br />
               “modifying” —or “impairing" as this report says 
               <br />
               — the territorial rights of Newfoundlanders for 
               <br />
               99 years. Sir Hugh Hoyles and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">RF.</span> Little were

               the members of the delegation who were as-

               sociated with this famous despatch; that achieve-

               ment was one of many that illumine the pages of 
               <br />
               the history of responsible government from 1855 
               <br />
               down to almost its very end. Another instance 
               <br />
               occurred in 1886 when the House of Assembly 
               <br />
               passed the Bait Act which was to sound the 
               <br />
               death-knell of French inﬂuence in this country.
