               he felt there was some security for his wife and 
               <br />
               children, would make a much better ﬁsherman 
               <br />
               than he would be at the present time. I think it 
               <br />
               most important that some sort of scheme be 
               <br />
               worked out. Some years ago I took it up with the 
               <br />
               government —~ I sent to Ottawa and got their 
               <br />
               fishermen’s insurance scheme which applied to 
               <br />
               Louisbourg. It was too ambitious for us, so I 
               <br />
               asked the government to do something along 
               <br />
               those lines. It went in the wastepaper basket. I 
               <br />
               think we should do something about ﬁshermen’s 
               <br />
               insurance.

               On page 5 you say that the very high cost of

               <br />

               use of the cod, herring and other ﬁsh industries? 
               <br />
               If you are going to have free trade in that par- 
               <br />
               ticular branch of our basic industry, why not free 
               <br />
               trade in all the other branches?

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Job Ican give you one good reason: the seal 
               <br />
               ﬁshery is a hazardous speculation. Take this year, 
               <br />
               it cost between $30,000 and $45,000 to outfit 
               <br />
               each steamer — that has to be hazarded. If you 
               <br />
               get no seals you lose the whole thing. You have 
               <br />
               paid on that $5,000 or $6,000 duty. When you 
               <br />
               take a risk, you want that risk to be cut down as 
               <br />
               much as it can be, in order to encourage them to 
               <br />
               take the risk. It is not the same with cod ﬁshery. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Suppose you send a ship out 
               <br />
               and it costs $35,000 to outﬁt her, including 
               <br />
               $5,000 or $6,000 to the government, and she

               <br />
               of repairs I cannot agree. I had a certain amount 
               <br />
               of work done on a Whaler, converting from coal 
               <br />
               to oil, and the quotation I got from Halifax was 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$25,000</span> higher than our own dockyard, and that 
               <br />
               included duty on the materials. It was quite a
