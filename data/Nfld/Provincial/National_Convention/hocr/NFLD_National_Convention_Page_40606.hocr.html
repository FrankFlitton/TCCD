               Mr. McCormack When this Convention was 
               <br />
               convened I understood that its purpose was the 
               <br />
               collection and digestion of facts with a view to 
               <br />
               determining whether this country was self-sup- 
               <br />
               porting, and for how long a period it could 
               <br />
               reasonably hope to remain so. I felt satisﬁed that 
               <br />
               all delegates, as well as all Newfoundlanders, 
               <br />
               would want nothing less than responsible govern- 
               <br />
               ment, if after investigation and deliberation we 
               <br />
               came to the conclusion that we were self- sup- 
               <br />
               porting. Since that time many extraneous matters 
               <br />
               have been introduced which tended to befog our 
               <br />
               original purpose. I realised that we had men 
               <br />
               amongst us who were not only more familiar than 
               <br />
               I with Newfoundland affairs, but also more ex- 
               <br />
               perienced in public debate. I felt that our real job 
               <br />
               was the collection and analysis of facts, and not 
               <br />
               a political platform or an opportunity to display 
               <br />
               our oratorical qualiﬁcations. For this reason, Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, I observed the maxim that speech is 
               <br />
               silver but silence is golden, and I cannot but think 
               <br />
               that the radio audience often wished that some 
               <br />
               delegates did likewise. I remained silent, even 
               <br />
               when one of our most loquacious delegates prac- 
               <br />
               tically insulted all delegates like myself who 
               <br />
               were not in love with our oWn melodious voices 
               <br />
               when, commenting on some letters in the public 
               <br />
               press and seeking to justify his long—winded and 
               <br />
               repetitious speeches, he conveyed the impression 
               <br />
               that any delegate with brains must necessarily 
               <br />
               speak to the different reports, and associated <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">himv</span> 
               <br />
               self with half a dozen others as being the brains 
               <br />
               of the outfit. I don’t know if the others felt flat- 
               <br />
               tered... I do not make any apologies for these 
               <br />
               irrelevancies, as I have been obliged to listen to 
               <br />
               too many since last September.

               In speaking to this report I had hoped for a lot 
               <br />
               more than it contains. We sent a delegation to 
               <br />
               England to obtain facts which only England 
               <br />
               could give us, and which were necessary to us if

               authority to discuss trade and other matters,

               <br />
               what it would mean to our economy, and that we 
               <br />

               <br />
               dollars to buy our frozen ﬁsh fillets. We are told 
               <br />
               that the Commission govemmeni in its prudence 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               the saving in interest would be considerable. We
