               even Mr. Smallwood won’t deny, we might well 
               <br />
               ask ourselves which of the two forms of govern— 
               <br />
               ment which we are discussing would be able 
               <br />
               better to capitalise on such assets. In my opinion 
               <br />
               it is responsible government, and I doubt if any 
               <br />
               delegate thinks differently. Mr. Chairman, in ad— 
               <br />
               dition to this great bargaining power which a 
               <br />
               responsible government could use to our ad- 
               <br />
               vantage, permit me to point out that the demand 
               <br />
               for pulp and paper is practically guaranteed for 
               <br />
               some years to come. Our mining prospects are 
               <br />
               exceptionally good. We have considerable 
               <br />
               employment at the different bases and at Gander. 
               <br />
               We have a nice surplus and our national savings 
               <br />
               are high. Our immediate outlook for the future 
               <br />
               must look good to the business brains of the 
               <br />
               country, considering the amount of capital <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ere</span> 
               <br />
               pended in the construction of ﬁsh processing and 
               <br />
               canning plants; and given a government respon- 
               <br />
               sible to the people, with the initiative to in- 
               <br />
               augurate a continuous and intensive program of 
               <br />
               research and experimentation, we could very 
               <br />
               well build up the national income to the point 
               <br />
               where the earnings of the people would guarantee 
               <br />
               sufﬁcient revenues to provide adequate social 
               <br />
               services. Mr. Bailey’s idea of more intelligent 
               <br />
               buying merits consideration. He says, “Take 
               <br />
               more from the countries who can and will take 
               <br />
               more from us." Import grain from countries who 
               <br />
               will take our ﬁsh in exchange, and mill it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oursel‘</span> 
               <br />
               ves, giving employment in the mills and using our 
               <br />
               own ships for both the export and import. Ship~ 
               <br />
               building, I might say in passing, is an industry 
               <br />
               which deserves every encouragement from a 
               <br />
               maritime people, and the Clarenville shipyards 
               <br />
               have proven the quality of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               workmanship. Before concluding, Mr. Chair— 
               <br />
               man, I wish to refer brieﬂy to our main industry, 
               <br />
               the ﬁsheries, which affects directly and indirectly 
               <br />
               almost every class of workmen in this island. 
               <br />
               Government should endeavour to reduce the cost 
               <br />
               of supplies, production, processing and market- 
               <br />
               ing, in order to give our young men some incen- 
               <br />
               tive to return to the most vital industry. In 
               <br />
               conclusion, I would tell the people of this 
               <br />
               country, particularly those from my own district, 
               <br />
               it is my sincere conviction, after mature considera~ 
               <br />
               tion, that responsible government would better 
               <br />
               advance our political, social and economic welfare. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin Mr. Chairman, in rising to support 
               <br />
               the motion before the Chair, I feel there is not 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               much that I can add to what I have already said 
               <br />
               on this matter. This House well knows, as I 
               <br />
               believe does the entire country where I stand 
               <br />
               today and where I can be found tomorrow. When 
               <br />
               ﬁrst this Convention opened its doors, there were 
               <br />
               many who were inclined to believe that my at— 
               <br />
               titude was somewhat unreasonable, if not wholly 
               <br />
               prejudiced. They accused me of not being in 
               <br />
               possession of that priceless thing called an open 
               <br />
               mind. They insinuated that I had not given this 
               <br />
               country’s political condition proper study, that I 
               <br />
               just didn’t know what I was talking about. Now, 
               <br />
               all this, of course, was entirely incorrect. It is true 
               <br />
               I did not have an open mind. I don’t think I ever 
               <br />
               had such a thing in my life. As a rule, I could 
               <br />
               make up my mind on such matters that called for 
               <br />
               a decision. To me, an open mind is like an open 
               <br />
               mouth. It catches all sorts of ﬂies, and the owner 
               <br />
               sometimes does not know when to shut it up. I 
               <br />
               did not have to wait for the opening of this 
               <br />
               Convention to give thought and study to the 
               <br />
               political situation of our country. Indeed, for 
               <br />
               nearly a year previous to the Convention election, 
               <br />
               I had been broadcasting my political doctrine to 
               <br />
               all who cared to hear me. The conclusions which 
               <br />
               I voiced were arrived at for the simple reason that 
               <br />
               the bare facts and the truth of things left no other 
               <br />
               course open to me, that for Newfoundland, the 
               <br />
               proper, logical, only course open to her was as a 
               <br />
               ﬁrst step, to recover that former status and politi— 
               <br />
               cal position which was hers previous to the loss 
               <br />
               of her political freedom in 1933. And so I came 
               <br />
               as one who had already added up the sum and 
               <br />
               found the answer. And if I had wanted any further 
               <br />
               proof that my decision was the right one, and that 
               <br />
               I had the right answer, I was given ample proof 
               <br />
               of it in the course of the debates which have taken 
               <br />
               place in this chamber. Every report on our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in»</span> 
               <br />
               dustrial and economic position went to verify it. 
               <br />
               Every ﬁgure in the Financial Report came as a 
               <br />
               further endorsement. And, although I have heard 
               <br />
               the endless speeches of those whose political 
               <br />
               opinions differ from mine, I, and the country, 
               <br />
               have yet to hear any sound, reasonable or logical 
               <br />
               arguments advanced to prove to me or them that 
               <br />
               this country is not now ﬁtted to assume once 
               <br />
               again the proud mantle of democracy which was 
               <br />
               unjustly torn from her weakened shoulders in the 
               <br />
               dark days of 1933. And after all, I submit that my 
               <br />
               attitude will not seem at all strange to anyone who 
               <br />
               has given any sound consideration to our political 
               <br />
