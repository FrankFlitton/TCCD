               I would, however, like to speak about a few 
               <br />
               matters. I could discuss the quality of responsible

               <br />
               people who gave their time and energy and 
               <br />
               thought to the government of the country. And 
               <br />
               here I would like to say it is the noblest thing a 
               <br />
               man can do, to offer his services to his country 
               <br />

               <br />
               interest of the people. It may be a thankless job, 
               <br />

               <br />
               cumstances, and such has been the history of 
               <br />
               people who have taken upon themselves these 
               <br />
               responsibilities. Nevertheless, they have ac- 
               <br />
               cepted these duties and no doubt they have the 
               <br />
               recompense and reward that comes from duties 
               <br />
               well performed. “Responsible government 
               <br />
               would be restored at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">request...”</span> I have 
               <br />
               wondered many times just how the British 
               <br />
               government would ascertain the voice of the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland and just how it was 
               <br />
               proposed that the people of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               should make their request known to the British 
               <br />
               government. Evidently, sir, the setting up of this 
               <br />
               National Convention, and its recommendations, 
               <br />
               will give the people an opportunity to vote on the 
               <br />
               forms of government submitted to them.

               mind, responsible government as it existed 
               <br />
               before 1934 did not make itself indispensible. I

               <br />

               case there may be a contrary opinion with 
               <br />
               respect to the motion, that the form Ihad original-

               ly on the order paper was for the purpose of 
               <br />
               conforming as closely as possible to the wording 
               <br />
               of the legislation under which we relinquished 
               <br />
               our former government in 1933. That was the 
               <br />
               only purpose behind it I want to make that quite 
               <br />
               clear beyond any doubt, beyond any suggestion 
               <br />
               such as was made here this afternoon, when it was 
               <br />
               stated that the verbiage of the motion showed the 
               <br />
               cloven hoof of partisanship. As far as I am con~ 
               <br />
               cemed, anybody who wants to believe that the 
               <br />
               motion was rigged in such a way as to prevent 
               <br />
               members of this Convention from recommending 
               <br />
               other forms, any person who wishes to believe that 
               <br />
               can go to the residence usually associated with 
               <br />
               the gentleman of the cloven hoof. I say that in 
               <br />
               deference to myself, because as you are aware, at 
               <br />
               our private session on Friday last, it was placed 
               <br />
               beyond doubt that both these motions would be 
               <br />
               debated — the one under my name on the order 
               <br />
               paper, and the one under Mr. Smallwood’s name. 
               <br />
               Time was allotted and agreed to, and there can be 
               <br />
               no doubt in anybody’s mind who was present at 
               <br />
               the meeting that that is so. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Which is why I did not worry 
               <br />
               about the form of the motion. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, in 
               <br />
               my opinion, whatever forms of government this 
               <br />
               Convention recommends to the United Kingdom 
               <br />
               to be placed on the ballot paper at the forthcom-

               <br />
               ment will place only two forms on the ballot and 
               <br />
               these are the two forms envisaged in the motion 
               <br />
               you have before you tonight. I say that because 
               <br />
               of my respect for British jurisprudence and 
               <br />
               British justice. And British justice demands that 
               <br />
               the United Kingdom government carry out its 
               <br />
               pledge that appears throughout the legislation, 
               <br />
               and throughout the report on which that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legisla«</span> 
               <br />
               tion was based back in 1933. Because of that, I 
               <br />
               say that no matter what forms of government this 
               <br />
               Convention recommends, that with that well~ 
               <br />

               <br />
               the United Kingdom government will be com- 
               <br />

               <br />
               only two forms of government and these are the

               two forms you will vote on tonight.
