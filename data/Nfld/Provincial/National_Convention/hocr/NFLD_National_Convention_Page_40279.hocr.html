               poor business. In these few remarks I propose to 
               <br />
               touch on the Education Report only, and to 
               <br />
               review the items discovered under Trans- 
               <br />
               portation and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Communications.</span> The remark on 
               <br />
               education is this: it has, I believe, been accepted 
               <br />
               by a majority of us that this one item of govern- 
               <br />
               ment expenditure must be of the order of $3 
               <br />
               million — $4 million.1 That is one item which 
               <br />
               must go into our second table to be spent on 
               <br />
               education.

               Let us turn now to the report immediately 
               <br />
               under consideration. In my view we can add 
               <br />
               certain items to our projected government expen- 
               <br />
               diture table. First of all radio service — $25,000; 
               <br />
               secondly, posts and telegraphs ~— $l.5 million- 
               <br />
               $1.75 million; roads and bridges ~—~ $2.5 million- 
               <br />
               $3 million; railway —— $12 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million«$13</span> million; 
               <br />
               Gander and the tourists. On these last mentioned 
               <br />
               I am unwilling to say what our expenditure will 
               <br />
               have to be because, as regards Gander, I feel that 
               <br />
               the position should not be allowed to remain as it 
               <br />
               is: namely, Newfoundland is giving outside con- 
               <br />
               cerns services for which these concerns are only 
               <br />
               paying an estimated one—half of the cost. We have 
               <br />
               agreed that this is a matter which will require 
               <br />
               much more probing before we can say what must 
               <br />
               go into our expenditure account. Again, on 
               <br />
               tourists, we will have to make up our minds 
               <br />
               where we are going and then estimate our expen- 
               <br />
               diture with its counterpart of the estimated return 
               <br />
               to the total <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">economy.</span> Before leaving this short 
               <br />
               sum-up, sir, I would ask you to note two things. 
               <br />
               First, that although the items at present about 
               <br />
               which we are able to speak deﬁnitely are very 
               <br />
               few, the country ought to know that within the 
               <br />
               next few weeks as the bulk of the work is done 
               <br />
               many more items will be added quickly. I say that 
               <br />
               in fairness to the members of the Convention and 
               <br />
               because I feel that the public generally would like 
               <br />
               to know that that is so. And secondly, you will 
               <br />
               note that I have neglected for the moment the 
               <br />
               form in which we are to cover the expenditure for 
               <br />
               these government services — that is to say, how 
               <br />
               we are going to collect the funds to pay for the 
               <br />
               services. 
               <br />

               Our discussion of posts and telegraphs ap- 
               <br />
               peared to turn on the question of the adequacy of 
               <br />
               the wages paid to postal employees, and at the 
               <br />
               same time to an extension of the services. On the 
               <br />
               question of an equitable distribution of wealth, I 
               <br />
               have a closed mind. My mind cannot tolerate a 
               <br />
               general position where wealth is concentrated 
               <br />
               into the hands of a minority. We should be dis— 
               <br />
               covering ways and means of seeing to it that 
               <br />
               everyone produces and that wealth is shared. 
               <br />
               However I say frankly that we ought not to go off 
               <br />
               half-cocked. Whether wages paid in the Depart- 
               <br />
               ment of Posts and Telegraphs are high, low, or 
               <br />
               fair in relation to other government services, I do 
               <br />
               not know, because I have not carefully studied 
               <br />
               the position. How a postal telegraph employee’s 
               <br />
               wages in the various communities compare with 
               <br />
               the average person’s wages I do not know. If the 
               <br />
               courier to whom Mr. Burry referred is doing a 
               <br />
               necessary job, and that job takes a great deal of 
               <br />
               his time and puts him out of production in other 
               <br />
               spheres, then he should be paid a wage which will 
               <br />
               put him in as favourable a position as the rest of 
               <br />
               the people with whom he lives. However, to refer 
               <br />
               to a $50 a year payment in some cases as a salary 
               <br />
               of $4 per month, and as shameful, is not neces- 
               <br />
               sarily being realistic. For example, a community 
               <br />
               of ﬁshermen wants a lightkeeper at the approach 
               <br />
               of their harbour. They cannot afford to pay a man 
               <br />
               a living wage forjust doing a half-hour’s work a 
               <br />
               day, so they say to someone of their number who 
               <br />
               lives on the point: “Keep your eye on that light, 
               <br />
               fix it up if anything happens to put it out on the 
               <br />
               odd occasion. This will take some of your time 
               <br />
               away from farming, carpentry, etc, and we’ ll pay 
               <br />
               you for that lost time, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Le.</span> $50 a year." This 
               <br />
               question will come up time and time again before 
               <br />
               our discussions have ﬁnished. It is right that it 
               <br />
               should. I have offered my comments in the hope 
               <br />
               that they might be of some value in helping us all 
               <br />
               to keep a sense of perspective. I repeat, I am all
