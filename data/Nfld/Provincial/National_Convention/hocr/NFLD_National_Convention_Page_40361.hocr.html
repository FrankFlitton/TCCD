               our ﬁsheries are of prime importance." Coming 
               <br />
               from a ﬁshing district where the word “farmer" 
               <br />
               humorously applies only to a sea-sick, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">third‘rate</span>

               fisherman who is usually also a bungler, i can

               appreciate the truth of that statement; but isn’t 
               <br />
               there something in this centralisation idea? Isn t 
               <br />
               it possible for the ﬁsherman to fish from sheltered 
               <br />
               inland harbours where he could produce enough 
               <br />
               vegetables for his own family? Are there to be 
               <br />
               found around our bays and inlets, sites where 
               <br />
               towns could be built for fishermen-farmers? The 
               <br />
               big problem is the centralising of our ﬁsheries in 
               <br />
               selected communities where men can till the soil 
               <br />
               and reap the harvest of the sea as well. Some will 
               <br />
               say this is but a vision, but it is a vision that we 
               <br />
               must keep before us, and while large scale com- 
               <br />
               mercial farming can never be carried on on the 
               <br />
               coastal belt, there is a lot which can be done. We 
               <br />
               must in the future have men big enough to put the 
               <br />
               centralisation idea into effect, and I can only 
               <br />
               visualise success through the ﬁsherman-farmer 
               <br />
               method. I am not suggesting a Markland land 
               <br />
               settlement idea, rather places where the cod- 
               <br />
               fishery can be profitably prosecuted, for example 
               <br />
               Glovertown and Eastport —— Glovertown in par- 
               <br />
               ticular, built on a good harbour, up to last year 
               <br />
               (when that disastrous fire occurred) possessing 
               <br />
               lots of available timber and very fertile <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">soil.</span> Here 
               <br />
               a fisherman could prosecute the Labrador fishery 
               <br />
               and grow enough vegetables for himself and 
               <br />
               some to sell, thus being able to produce fish at a 
               <br />
               much lower cost than his fellow Labrador ﬁsher- 
               <br />

               farmers, the question that’s been agitating me and 
               <br />
               a great number of us who are not farmers, is 
               <br />
               whether we ever hope to compete in our sale of 
               <br />
               vegetables with the people of the continent next 
               <br />

               <br />
               price down? If you can’t, what is the best thing 
               <br />
               to do? is it better to subsidise the farmer or put 
               <br />
               the duty up and also the cost ofliving? That’s the 
               <br />
               general question. Could you give your 
               <br />

               Mr. Butt The evidence that we got varied very 
               <br />
               considerably as between individual farmers. We 
               <br />
               were informed that it was possible to get down 
               <br />
               the cost of certain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">items.</span> For example, I don’t 
               <br />
               think we had any evidence to show that potatoes 
               <br />
               could be grown as cheaply as we could import 
               <br />
               them, but turnips, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">yes.</span> The reason was that there

               is so much land that we have not yet cleared for

               growing potatoes with the help of machinery, and 
               <br />
               we could not afford that land. But turnips, you 
               <br />
               require so much less land that you can produce, 
               <br />
               not perhaps as cheaply as they can be imported,
