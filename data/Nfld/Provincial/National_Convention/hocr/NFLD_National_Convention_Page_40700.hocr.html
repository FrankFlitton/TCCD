               that breakwater, will take $500,000, and the

               three years. You would not begin to touch it... 
               <br />

               mercantile marine —— down the sink, down the 
               <br />

               <br />
               sell them two or three years later for half the price, 
               <br />
               and lose on them while you are running them. 
               <br />
               And you are going to spend $3 million capital 
               <br />
               expenditure on the Railway ——— about one third of 
               <br />
               what needs to be spent, just about one third. If you 
               <br />
               turn to the Black Book that we brought from 
               <br />

               the next year they expect to spend $17 million, 
               <br />

               Railway into condition. It just can’t be done, just

               <br />
               mean. We are conscious of the fact that there may 
               <br />
               be delegates who will be satisﬁed with nothing

               will be for the next three years.” Now, this report 
               <br />
               sets out very frankly, and I take it sincerely, to 
               <br />
               give an estimate of our probable revenue and
