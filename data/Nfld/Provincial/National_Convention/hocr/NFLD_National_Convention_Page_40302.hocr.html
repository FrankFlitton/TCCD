               <br />
               this before, and I think we all agreed that we did 
               <br />
               not give any tem’tory of ours to the United States, 
               <br />
               therefore in what way can we use that as a bar- 
               <br />
               gaining power in order to get our ﬁsh into the 
               <br />
               USA duty free or with concessions? That part of

               our territory which has been stolen from us and 
               <br />
               given away, was taken from us by Great Britain. 
               <br />
               If we look for concessions on account of that, we 
               <br />
               must look to Great Britain, who sliced it off this 
               <br />
               little island and gave it away. I can imagine the 
               <br />
               answer any delegation would get if we ap— 
               <br />

               you have got some of OUr territory, what are you 
               <br />
               going to do about it?” That’s a signed and sealed 
               <br />
               bargain, by which Great Britain gave away for 99 
               <br />
               years, which means forever, those bases, and for 
               <br />
               which they got 40 or 50 old destroyers. That I 
               <br />
               think is something which we have to think about

               cate with the Commission of Government, and in 
               <br />
               conjunction with them set up a committee to say, 
               <br />
               “Well now, if we have responsible government, 
               <br />

               some other form of Government, what is your

               in our wisdom. I think we ought to get to work
