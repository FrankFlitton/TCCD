               <br />
               Mr. Higgins had not interrupted. Mr. Hollett, on 
               <br />
               Friday the 12 of December, quoted to the House 
               <br />
               an act of the Province of Nova Scotia authorising 
               <br />
               town councils and other such municipal bodies to 
               <br />
               collect taxes in their respective areas, and also 
               <br />
               setting forth the penalties which could be im- 
               <br />
               posed by those town councils upon the residents 
               <br />
               in their areas if they refused or failed to pay their 
               <br />
               taxes. First let me ask you: this is a copy of the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland Gazette, and in it they have pub- 
               <br />
               lished the Town of Curling Act. Am I proper in 
               <br />
               quoting from it? 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood So there is nothing extraordi- 
               <br />
               nary, there is nothing unusual, when one of the 
               <br />
               provinces of Canada passes a law giving 
               <br />
               authority to the town councils in that province to 
               <br />
               collect certain taxes. In doing that, if they set 
               <br />
               penalties that is quite usual, and that is exactly 
               <br />
               what has been done in respect of town councils 
               <br />
               and city councils here in Newfoundland. There is 
               <br />
               nothing unusual about it. If you are going to give 
               <br />
               the town council the authority to collect certain 
               <br />
               taxes, you must also set up the right to punish the 
               <br />
               man who refuses to carry out the law and pay his 
               <br />
               just taxes. Now, what does it amount to? If New- 
               <br />
               foundland becomes a province would the people 
               <br />
               have to pay taxes on their homes and boats and 
               <br />
               ﬁshing gear, on their livestock and land, gardens 
               <br />
               and farms, generally on their property? Will they 
               <br />
               have to pay those taxes? And the answer is, “No, 
               <br />
               they will not have to pay those taxes”.... They will 
               <br />
               not pay any taxes on property to the government 
               <br />
               of the province, and they will not pay any to the 
               <br />
               federal government of Canada. They will pay 
               <br />
               property taxes only if they have a town council, 
               <br />
               and as to whether they will have a town council 
               <br />
               or not is their own business. They decide that for 
               <br />
               themselves without any coercion from anyone 
               <br />
               else, whether it be the Government of New- 
               <br />
               foundland or the Government of Canada, should 
               <br />
               we become a province.

               Now sir, I turn to another aspect of the speech 
               <br />
               of Mr. Hollett on Friday the 12th of December... 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett examined the estimates, or guesses if 
               <br />
               you like, that I brought in as to what revenue or 
               <br />
               expenditure the provincial government of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New.</span> 
               <br />
               foundland will have to make, and what revenue 
               <br />
               it will have to get to balance its books —- a series 
               <br />
               of ﬁgures designed to show whether or not the 
               <br />
               provincial government .of Newfoundland could 
               <br />
               pay its way —— whether Newfoundland, as a 
               <br />
               province, could pay its way ofﬁcially. Mr. Hollett 
               <br />
               thought that we would need $15,138,000 a year 
               <br />
               for the ﬁrst four years, and $15,638,000 a year for 
               <br />
               the next four years, and that on to that I should 
               <br />
               add something or other, I think it was $4 million, 
               <br />
               to bring the total up to around $19 million. It was 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett‘s contention that the provincial 
               <br />
               government of Newfoundland would need $19 
               <br />
               million more or less to pay its way, and as I had 
               <br />
               shown a revenue to go against the expenditure 
               <br />
               from all sources of only $14 million that therefore 
               <br />
               we would be about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$67</span> million short. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Hollett $5 million.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr.Smallwood Yes, $5 million short to balance 
               <br />
               our budget. We would fail by $5 million. Mr. 
               <br />
               Hickman put the figure I believe at $17 million, 
               <br />
               but Mr. Hollett upped it a bit and broughtit to $19 
               <br />
               million. I want to examine it, because that is a 
               <br />
               matter of prime importance. I said when I intro- 
               <br />
               duced the provincial budget so-called, that if the 
               <br />
               provincial government of Newfoundland could 
               <br />
               not pay its way and balance its budget without 
               <br />
               cutting down on the public services, and without 
               <br />
               driving up taxation, then that alone was enough 
               <br />
               to condemn confederation. I said that at the out- 
               <br />
               set, and I repeat it now. Now we have a yardstick 
               <br />
               to go by, and that is the Economic Report. The 
               <br />
               Economic Report gave us an estimate of $30 
               <br />
               million revenue per year, and an expenditure of 
               <br />
               $25 million per year. The $25 million was to 
               <br />
               cover all ordinary expenditures of the Govem— 
               <br />
               ment of Newfoundland — all ordinary expendi~ 
               <br />
               tures. It did not include capital, or reconstruction, 
               <br />
               or special, just ordinary expenditure, and that 
               <br />
