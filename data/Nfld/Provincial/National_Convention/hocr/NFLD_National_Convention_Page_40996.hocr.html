               has broken that down into per capita taxation at 
               <br />
               so much a head. Let us deal with that for a moment. 
               <br />
               The revenue of the Government of Canada — 
               <br />
               $2,200,000,000 —— is from all the people of 
               <br />
               Canada; but in fact the Province of Ontario alone 
               <br />
               contributed half the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revenue...</span> It has a population 
               <br />
               of four million people. It is a very high per capita 
               <br />
               tax, is it not? But the other billion dollars is to be 
               <br />
               divided among 81/2 million people. From the 
               <br />
               other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">81/2</span> million people, take the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3V2</span> million of 
               <br />
               Quebec. What have you? The per capita tax for 
               <br />
               the other provinces is very small. The Govem- 
               <br />
               ment of Canada, the Minister of Finance does not 
               <br />
               say at the beginning of the year, “We are going 
               <br />
               to spend that, that and that. A total of $2 billion. 
               <br />
               We have to get $2 billion. There are nine provin- 
               <br />
               ces. Nine divided into $2 billion, therefore we 
               <br />
               must get that much from each province." Neither 
               <br />
               does he do this: “Our population is 12.5 million 
               <br />
               souls; divide that into $2 billion, that is so much 
               <br />
               per head; every head has to pay that much." He 
               <br />
               does not do this. He says “Let those who can 
               <br />
               pay it, pay it." There is an exception and that is 
               <br />
               indirect taxes. Indirect taxation is the most 
               <br />
               cursed, the most wicked thing ever invented. 
               <br />
               Direct taxation is fair. You know what you pay. 
               <br />
               Indirectly, you can be looted and ﬂeeced. You 
               <br />
               never know how much is looted out of you. They 
               <br />
               have it in Canada. I wish they did not. In <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New:</span> 
               <br />
               foundland, the bulk of taxes has come from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in.</span> 
               <br />
               direct taxation. It is a wicked and cursed burden 
               <br />
               on our people, a much heavier burden than in the 
               <br />
               case of Canada. In Canada, the bulk of taxation 
               <br />
               is raised by direct taxation, falling on the 
               <br />
               shoulders of those who can best afford to pay it. 
               <br />
               In Newfoundland, the very diapers on the baby 
               <br />
               born tomorrow morning will be taxed; the cofﬁn 
               <br />
               in which you are buried will be taxed — a cursed, 
               <br />
               wicked imposition on the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland. If we could abolish this wicked <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">im»</span> 
               <br />
               position; if we could do that; if some genius could 
               <br />
               do it; I think I would throw confederation and all 
               <br />
               out the window — if we could ﬁnd a fair system 
               <br />
               of taxation, those who could afford to pay, and 
               <br />
               those who could not afford it would not have to 
               <br />
               pay.
