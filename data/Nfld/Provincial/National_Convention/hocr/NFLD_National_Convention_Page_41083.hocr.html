               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Hollett made the statement 
               <br />
               yesterday that whatever we import from Canada, 
               <br />
               whatever else we would import we would pay 
               <br />
               duty on. I say that is not so, that about half of all 
               <br />
               the things that Canada imports come into Canada 
               <br />
               duty free; and if we become a province of Canada 
               <br />
               and we import goods from countries other than 
               <br />
               Canada, whatever came in from Canada would 
               <br />
               be duty free (that would be the bulk of it); but if 
               <br />
               we still imported things from other countries 
               <br />
               we would pay the customs duty according to the 
               <br />
               Canadian customs tariff...

               <br />
               from Canada would come in duty free — every-

               thing. If we import anything from other countries 
               <br />
               then we will pay duty, if there is a Canadian duty 
               <br />
               on it.... Half the value of all they import into 
               <br />
               Canada comes in duty free, and the rest of it 
               <br />
               comes in at a lower rate of duty than our own

               <br />
               a province of Canada, anything we do import into 
               <br />
               Newfoundland not from Canada would come in 
               <br />
               at much lower rates of duty on an average than 
               <br />
               we are paying now in our own customs tariff. 
               <br />
               Now that’s that.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I have another note <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">here.</span> Mr. Hollett said that, 
               <br />
               “If Newfoundland goes into confederation 
               <br />
               Canada will man the American bases, probably 
               <br />
               with skeleton crews, and in that case 3,500 New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders will lose their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">jobs"</span> I presume he 
               <br />
               means the 3,500 Newfoundlanders that he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> 
               <br />
               sumes are now working on these American bases. 
               <br />
               That is a remarkable statement for a man to make. 
               <br />
               No one has brought any evidence, still less 
               <br />
               brought any proof. It is just a statement of a 
               <br />
               personal opinion, that if we become a province 
               <br />
               the Americans will be forced out of New- 
               <br />
               foundland, out of these bases that they occupy 
               <br />
               now, and that therefore the Newfoundlanders that 
               <br />
               are working on the bases will lose their jobs 
               <br />
               because Canada would occupy those bases with 
               <br />
               her own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">soldiers,</span>
