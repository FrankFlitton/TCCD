               Mr. Smallwood Sir, I call upon every member 
               <br />
               of this Convention to vote for this motion. I call 
               <br />
               upon even the bitterest anticonfederate here to 
               <br />
               vote for it. Hate confederation all you like. That 
               <br />
               is your privilege, but do not vote to deny our people 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland their rights to decide the matter. 
               <br />
               We here in this Convention have not been 
               <br />
               given the right to decide what form of govern- 
               <br />
               ment this country shall have, the people have 
               <br />
               been given that right, and they will exercise their 
               <br />
               right in the referendum. If the anticonfederates 
               <br />
               here in the Convention want confederation to be 
               <br />
               defeated, let them go out amongst the people, and 
               <br />
               try to persuade the people to vote against it in the

               <br />
               temptible for them to try here in this Convention, 
               <br />
               just because they have a majority, to try to cheat 
               <br />
               the people out of their chance to decide the matter. 
               <br />
               Since the terms of confederation arrived here 
               <br />
               and were debated, new hope has arisen in the 
               <br />
               hearts of our people. They see in confederation a 
               <br />
               new hope for the common man. They see in it a 
               <br />
               new hope for justice and fair play for themselves 
               <br />
               and for their children. They see in it the dawn of 
               <br />
               a new day for Newfoundland. Let no man dare to 
               <br />
               crush that hOpe that has arisen in our people’s 
               <br />
               hearts. As for myself, I have accepted the words 
               <br />
               of the English mystic and poet, William Blake, 
               <br />
               with the substitution of just one word in his 
               <br />
               moving poem: 
               <br />
               Bring me my bow of burning gold! 
               <br />
               Bring me my arrows of desire! 
               <br />
               Bring me my spear! O clouds unfold! 
               <br />
               Bring me my chariot of tire! 
               <br />
               I will not cease from mental ﬁght, 
               <br />
               Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand, 
               <br />
               Till we have built Jerusalem 
               <br />
               In OUR green and pleasant land.

               Mr. Banﬁeld Mr. Chairman, the greatest hon- 
               <br />
               ourl consider I have ever had in my life is at this 
               <br />
               very moment, as I rise to second Mr. Small- 
               <br />
               wood’s motion. I could not hope to find words to 
               <br />
               express what pleasure it gives me. I am a native 
               <br />
               of the southwest coast and a resident of there, and 
               <br />
               as such I would be ashamed ever to go on that 
               <br />
               coast again if I failed to support this motion with 
               <br />
               all my heart. I would be ashamed to look those 
               <br />
               people in the face. I doubt very much if ever a 
               <br />
               member in any district expressed the wishes of 
               <br />
               his district any more than I am expressing the 
               <br />
               wishes of Fortune Bay, and indeed the whole 
               <br />
               coast when I stand up here to advocate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confedera’</span> 
               <br />
               tion. 
               <br />
               Ever since 1869 there has not been a month or 
               <br />
               a day when those people were not in favour of 
               <br />
               confederation. In the 1869 election on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">south«</span> 
               <br />
               west coast they elected confederate candidates, 
               <br />
               and up there today they are only longing for the 
               <br />
               day of the referendum to come, so that they can 
               <br />
               march into the ballot booths in their thousands to 
               <br />
               mark for confederation. Sir, our southwest coast 
               <br />
               people know a lot about confederation. They 
               <br />
               know a lot about Canada. In their thousands they 
               <br />
               have worked in Canada, ﬁshed in Canada, visited 
               <br />
