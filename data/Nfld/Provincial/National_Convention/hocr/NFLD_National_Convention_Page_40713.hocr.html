               Now I ask you, do you think that this Commit- 
               <br />
               tee were not candid when they presented this 
               <br />
               report for our consideration? Anybody who 
               <br />
               thinks so should be examined. Then we go a little 
               <br />
               further down in the next paragraph. “We are 
               <br />
               conscious of the fact that there may be some 
               <br />
               delegates who will be satisﬁed with nothing less 
               <br />
               than an absolute gilt-edged guarantee of our sol— 
               <br />
               vency for the next 20 years, before they will 
               <br />
               accept the fact that Newfoundland is self-sup- 
               <br />
               porting.” So they were under no illusions. Now 
               <br />
               about this matter of self-support. Luckily, under 
               <br />
               the Convention Act, Major Cashin, you did not 
               <br />
               have to decide whether we were self-supporting. 
               <br />
               That was the people away back in 1933 in the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland Act. They said, “You can have 
               <br />
               your government back when you are self—sup- 
               <br />
               porting”, but not the Convention Act. They say, 
               <br />
               “No, you have to consider the ﬁnancial condi- 
               <br />
               tions of this country due to wartime conditions 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">etc,</span> and satisfy yourselves, and make some 
               <br />
               recommendations.” You did not have to ﬁnd out 
               <br />
               whether we are self-supporting. No country in 
               <br />
               this world is ever self—supporting, no man or 
               <br />
               woman is ever self-supporting over any predes- 
               <br />
               tined period. This country, Canada, Great Britain 
               <br />
               — the mother of a good many countries, the 
               <br />
               country which we thought in our young days 
               <br />
               would be always self-supporting. She is not, and 
               <br />
               never was, and never can be. Don’t let us forget 
               <br />
               that we ourselves can never be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selfwsupporting</span> for 
               <br />
               any particular period. We can only hope and pray 
               <br />
               to Almighty God that prosperity will continue to 
               <br />
               keep us self—supporting as long as possible. So 
               <br />
               you did not have to decide, although you said we 
               <br />
               are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self-supporting,</span> There were some remarks 
               <br />
               made yesterday aboutoptimism, realism and pes— 
               <br />
               simism. The gentleman from Bonavista Centre 
               <br />
               says you are too optimistic. I don't want it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">up</span> 
               <br />
               timistic, or pessimistic, but realistic. I ask you, 
               <br />
               who is a pessimist in this House? Is it not the man 
               <br />
               who said these words yesterday?

               of the new industries. Think of the fisheries and 
               <br />
               mining and forestry, and all the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">others,</span> Think of

               the $25 million that‘s in the Bank ofNova Scotia.

               Think of all these things, and you will have to 
               <br />
               come to the conclusion that they have brought in

               Mr. Vardy Mr. Chairman, after making a very 
               <br />
               careful analysis of the ﬁgures and statements 
               <br />
               made in this report, my wonder is how any person 
               <br />
               continuously accused of being crammed full of 
               <br />
               politics could bring in such a comprehensive, 
               <br />
               informative, and conservative estimate of the true 
               <br />
               economic position of Newfoundland. There are 
               <br />
               no wild, exaggerated statements... Treating the 
               <br />
               overall picture as we should, and as we would a 
               <br />
               private business, our liquid position is most en~ 
               <br />
               couraging. If we were attached today and sold 
               <br />
               lock, stock and barrel, we are solvent and would 
               <br />
               have a surplus after all creditors were paid. The 
               <br />
               Ottawa delegation has done a splendid job by 
               <br />
               conﬁrming in substance and in fact the essence 
               <br />
               of everything contained in this Economic Report 
               <br />
               and for this they deserve our congratulations. I 
               <br />
               would say to these gentlemen, stick to your guns, 
               <br />
               you have built a good case and some day you may 
               <br />
               have a chance to see your dreams come true; but 
               <br />
               do not come back and before the ink is dry on the 
               <br />
               paper tell the world you painted a false picture 
               <br />
               and were just trying to get money from Canada 
               <br />
               under false pretences. This will react badly and 
               <br />
               will cast a reflection on the whole delegation. We 
               <br />
               have agreed the country is watching, other 
               <br />
               countries beside ours are watching also, and they 
               <br />
               will judge us on our merits by the permanent 
               <br />
               good and loyalty that is in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us.“</span> We all have a
