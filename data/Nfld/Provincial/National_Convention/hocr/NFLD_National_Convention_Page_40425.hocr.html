               Mr. Vardy That is what is being done in our

               district. I have personally inspected some of the 
               <br />
               factories. One man made three visits last year in

               plained about being overworked The regular 
               <br />
               inspectors make inspections, and I have not seen 
               <br />
               any ﬁsh plants as clean as the lobster factories.

               of dogfish affect unfavourably every other 
               <br />

               before the hook can reach the bottom where the 
               <br />
               cod reside. In view of the importance of this 
               <br />
               matterl wonder if the Committee had considered

               Mr. Ashbourne Mr. Chairman, according to the 
               <br />
               figures given here it is very evident that these 
               <br />
               ﬁsheries, particularly the lobster ﬁshery and the 
               <br />
               salmon ﬁshery, are very important ﬁsheries to 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, and it is very interesting to note 
               <br />
               that the lobsters exported to Canada and United 
               <br />
               States amounted to over $650,000. We see also 
               <br />
               that the markets, Canada and the States together 
               <br />
               with the United Kingdom, for our salmon ﬁshery 
               <br />
               exports is good, and in view of the high value of 
               <br />
               these ﬁsheries to Newfoundland I think that some 
               <br />
               scientific investigation should be undertaken and 
               <br />
               continually pursued to see that we are not over- 
               <br />
               fishing these important ﬁsheries. To my mind, 
               <br />
               there are no statistics in this report to back it up, 
               <br />
               but I rather think that the salmon fishery is a 
               <br />
               declining one, and I have often wondered what 
               <br />
               will be the future of the salmon fishery, and what 
               <br />
               are the causes of the serious decline in the catches 
               <br />
               of salmon particularly. Some people think that 
               <br />
               the increase in the number of seals the past few 
               <br />
               years has been probably brought about by the fact 
               <br />
               that these seals may be preying upon the salmon. 
               <br />
               l don’t <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">know.</span> I believe the recommendation that 
               <br />
               some assistance be provided for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Dr.</span> Templeman 
               <br />

               well spent in investigating the decline of these 
               <br />
               fisheries, because they are very important
