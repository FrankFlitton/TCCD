               <br />
               we have in Newfoundland now. I was wondering 
               <br />
               if that was why the delegation to Ottawa cut 
               <br />
               $500,000 off the amount of the teachers, so that 
               <br />

               this year, 1947. that any government in

               put an extra pound of pork in the barrel? Yes, for
