               Now turning to Mr. Cashin. I like Mr. Cashin. 
               <br />
               I enjoy him. He fascinates me. His arguments 
               <br />
               fascinate me. His statements fascinate me. For 
               <br />
               instance, that statement he made here that he 
               <br />
               never said anything outside the House that he 
               <br />
               wouldn’t be prepared to say in the House. Most 
               <br />
               men I’d hardly be willing to believe if they made 
               <br />
               such a statement. I think I believe Mr. Cashin 
               <br />
               when he makes it. And that other statement he 
               <br />
               made, when he said there was an ulterior motive 
               <br />
               behind this resolution. Mr. Cashin is not an easy 
               <br />
               one to fool. We can trust him always to ferret out 
               <br />
               ulterior motives and plots. He ferreted out an 
               <br />
               ulterior motive behind this Convention itself — 
               <br />
               that it was just a bluff, a glorious stall, dripping 
               <br />
               with treachery, a clever stunt to keep <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Commis~</span> 
               <br />
               sion of Government in power. But he admits that 
               <br />
               the members of the Convention are not aware of 
               <br />
               the ulterior motive behind this resolution to get 
               <br />
               information for our people. And he fears that the 
               <br />
               members do not see the ulterior motive behind 
               <br />
               the setting up of this Convention. He is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deter</span> 
               <br />
               mined to protectthe members of this Convention, 
               <br />
               and expose the ulterior motive behind the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resolu«</span> 
               <br />
               tion and behind the Convention. He’s going to 
               <br />
               see that the country gets the only kind of govern- 
               <br />
               ment that he thinks is ﬁt for the country, respon— 
               <br />
               sible government. He’s againstthis resolution, on 
               <br />
               the ground that he knows the country is self-sup- 
               <br />
               porting anyway, so why waste time getting more 
               <br />
               information? He knows the country is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self-sup»</span> 
               <br />
               porting, because it’s all in the Auditor General’s 
               <br />
               report. There it is, according to him, as clear as 
               <br />
               mud, the clear proof that the country is self-sup- 
               <br />
               porting. We don’t need to look any further. And 
               <br />
               yet, Mr. Chairman, one of his reasons for not 
               <br />
               sending a delegation to Ottawa is that the delega- 
               <br />
               tion would have no information to take with 
               <br />
               them. Wasn't he overlooking that remarkable 
               <br />
               piece of information about this country? 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin in one breath says that on the basis of 
               <br />
               the 1895 confederation offer from Canada we’d 
               <br />
               get $300 million cash from Canada if we 
               <br />
               federated with her now. In the next breath he 
               <br />
               speaks about selling the country. There’s some- 
               <br />
               thing wrong in this line of reasoning. I fear there’s 
               <br />
               something wrong in a lot of his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reasoning,</span> for 
               <br />
               example when he convinces himself that Prime 
               <br />
               Minister Attlee’s reference to the three-year 
               <br />

               <br />
               Mr. Cashin’s standing as an authority on con-

               <br />

               <br />
               ﬁnancial matters. Before I leave Mr. Cashin for 
               <br />
               the time being, I must say that it appears to me 
               <br />
               that he is annoyed with me for not including him 
               <br />
               in my list of senatorships. I hasten to repair that 
               <br />
               blunder on my part. I have no more senatorships 
               <br />
               to offer. I’m sorry, but I promise him faithfully 
               <br />
               that if I should ever become prime minister of 
               <br />
               Canada I’ll see that he is taken care of. I’ll see 
               <br />
               that he is ﬁxed up. I’ll see that he gets a position 
               <br />
               fully in keeping with his parliamentary back— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ground.</span> I’ll make him Gentleman Usher of the

               And now while I’m at it, I want to say a word

               doing it.

               Turning to more important aspects of this

               main question in this resolution. The people of 
               <br />
               our country want to know the truth and they have 
               <br />

               anyone who is trying to keep the truth about

               is responsible government. Their every thought
