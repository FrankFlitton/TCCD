               <br />
               found out the things we did. I believe each and 
               <br />
               every one in this House should forget all differen- 
               <br />
               ces and get this country back to the people to 
               <br />
               whom it belongs. We are here because our people 
               <br />
               love this country. Why should they give away the 
               <br />
               assets our forebears fought so hard to get? The 
               <br />
               Commission government intends to spend that 
               <br />
               $30 million surplus before they get out. Then they 
               <br />
               will turn the government over to us. We waited 
               <br />
               too long. How much longer are we going to put 
               <br />
               up with it? We are not going to get anything 
               <br />
               without ﬁghting for it. The average Briton does 
               <br />
               not understand anything but a ﬁght. I risked my 
               <br />
               life for this country and I would do it again. 
               <br />
               Mr. Vincent However there is no need to 
               <br />
               elaborate on why this motion should, and doubt- 
               <br />
               less will command the unanimous approval of 
               <br />
               this House. To me it would be most extraordinary 
               <br />
               indeed should a dissenting voice be heard. I make 
               <br />
               no apologies for saying that any delegates raising 
               <br />
               their voice against this should be deemed un~ 
               <br />
               patriotic indeed. Let’s back the resolution with 
               <br />
               concerted action, and do it right away.

               Mr. Higgins I don’t think there will be any 
               <br />
               notice taken of the motion. but to be critically 
               <br />
               correct I think that the motion will have to be 
               <br />
               amended, and for that reason I move the follow- 
               <br />
               ing amendment: that the word “assets” be deleted 
               <br />
               and the following words substituted: “any of the 
               <br />
               natural resources or liquid assets of New- 
               <br />
               foundland at present under the control of the 
               <br />
               Commission of Government, other than already 
               <br />
               contracted for, either in Newfoundland or 
               <br />
               Labrador”. Otherwise it will mean that High-

               roads cannot even sell a tractor. The waterpower 
               <br />
               situation is already covered by one of the acts in 
               <br />
               l938 and 1944, giving the Labrador Mining and 
               <br />
               Exploration Company full power to acquire what 
               <br />
               waterpower they require as soon as mining leases 
               <br />
               are taken out by them. We have no control over 
               <br />
               that. That’s why I move that amendment.

               Mr. Jackman Five years ago I wrote a letter to 
               <br />
               the Daily News. In the final paragraph I pointed 
               <br />
               out that since the beginning of Commission 
               <br />
               government we, the people of Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               stood by silently and had our possessions and our 
               <br />
               assets given to outsiders without having any 
               <br />
               voice in the matter whatever. I congratulate 
               <br />
               Mr. Crosbie; I am strongly in favour of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mo»</span> 
               <br />
               tion, and will do anything I can to see that the 
               <br />
               motion will have teeth in it. I realise that we as a 
               <br />
               Convention are not in a position to demand the 
               <br />
               Commission of Government do anything, but we 
               <br />
               have an opportunity if we wish to take it on 
               <br />
               ourselves, that each delegate when he goes back 
               <br />
               to his district should call a public meeting 
               <br />
               throughout the whole country to deal with 
               <br />
               Mr. Crosbie’s motion from a public standpoint, 
               <br />
               and, while the Dominions Office is inclined prac- 
               <br />
               tically at all times to ignore things, I think some 
               <br />
               public agitation at least may open their eyes... 
               <br />
               Mr. Harrington i would like to take up where 
               <br />
               Mr. Bailey left <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oft...</span> l certainly agree with him. 
               <br />
               ldon‘t think that Mr. Bailey was being radical in 
               <br />
               what he said, neither do I think that Mr. Hollett 
               <br />
               is a dcfeatist, but a realist. However I have my 
               <br />
               doubts. I think this motion may do something. 
               <br />
               The stronger we make it the more chance we have 
               <br />
               of doing something. Mr. Bailey made a little 
               <br />
               excursion into our history, a matter which 
               <br />
               Mr. Bailey and I have made numerous excur- 
               <br />
               sions into the past few years. When people say, 
               <br />
               “That’s 50 or 100 years ago, forget that", well the 
               <br />
               same thing is happening today, and what are we 
               <br />
               going to do about it? I want to support Mr. 
               <br />
               Bailey’s stand that it is time for ﬁghting, and if 
               <br />
               this is the beginning of the fight, I am all for it.
