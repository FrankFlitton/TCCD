               Mr. Ashboume When this Convention opened 
               <br />
               on September I 1 the microphones were here, and 
               <br />
               I for one would not like to debar any person from 
               <br />
               hearing what was going on in this chamber. If 
               <br />
               there is anybody who does not wish to listen to 
               <br />
               the broadcasts, all they have to do is switch their 
               <br />
               radio over and listen to another programme. 
               <br />
               Mr. Penney I was one of the delegates who said 
               <br />
               I would like to see the microphones thrown out 
               <br />
               of the room... At the time I made the statement 
               <br />
               in this House, I think we were all kind of upset 
               <br />
               with long—winded speeches and I blamed it on the 
               <br />
               microphones. I would not want the people of this 
               <br />
               country to think I would be a party to depriving 
               <br />
               them of information regarding this Convention. I 
               <br />
               am just as fully for the obtaining of public infor- 
               <br />
               mation for the people of the outports as any other 
               <br />
               delegate in this Convention. One thing, I would 
               <br />
               like to see addresses conﬁned to 15 minutes. 
               <br />
               Mr. Butt I think the people of this country are 
               <br />
               just as much a part of this Convention as the 
               <br />
               actual members sitting here and they are entitled 
               <br />
               to every bit of information they possibly can get. 
               <br />
               The radio was made for this country, as isolated

               I had a feeling from the letter that there was 
               <br />
               an implication that we ought to soft-pedal our 
               <br />
               language. I do not know if that was intended. I 
               <br />
               agree with Mr. Smallwood, who already has said 
               <br />
               it is up to each individual member, in accordance 
               <br />
               with his ability, to say anything he believes and 
               <br />
               it is up to each individual to take the risk after- 
               <br />
               wards, if it be treated as not proper. I do feel that 
               <br />
               we ought to get a little harder, and consequently

               initial speech in support of Mr. Job’s motion, I
