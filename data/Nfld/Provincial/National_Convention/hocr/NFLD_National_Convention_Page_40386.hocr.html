               About the Ottawa delegation, I have said all I 
               <br />
               have to say. Mr. Smallwood’s suggestion that the

               people of this country be asked to make a decision 
               <br />

               delegation of this Convention without bargaining 
               <br />
               or negotiation is fantastic. The Canadians would 
               <br />
               think we are fools if we accepted such a position. 
               <br />
               Accordingly, I propose the following resolution:

               not opposed to getting these terms through the 
               <br />

               <br />
               first to elect our own government which will then

               decide what they want, and open negotiations

               with the Dominion government and see what

               Mr. Crosbie I have listened for some four or 
               <br />
               five months to the question of confederation 
               <br />
               debated by confederates and anticonfederates. 
               <br />
               When I was elected in the West End of St. John’s 
               <br />
               I did not know confederation could or would be 
               <br />
               an issue. However, we have been told by the late 
               <br />
               Chairman and by Professor Wheare that it is a 
               <br />
               form of government that might be recommended 
               <br />
               by the Convention for the referendum. This being 
               <br />
               so, I do not see why this House should be delayed 
               <br />
               any longer objecting to a delegation going to 
               <br />
               Canada and coming back with the terms. I agree 
               <br />
               with Mr. Harrington that there is an awful lot of 
               <br />
               loose talk of federal terms and propaganda going 
               <br />
               around, and I think the time has come when we 
               <br />
               should pin down the loose talk. If Canada has 
               <br />
               terms, let us get them; let us know what we are 
               <br />
               talking <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">about.</span> We were elected for the purpose of

               finding out the ﬁnancial and economic position

               of this country, and personally I am going to vote 
               <br />

               <br />

               matter was premature and that we should not send
