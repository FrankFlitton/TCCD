               they are established, the judges in them would be 
               <br />

               <br />
               constituting of the county courts is left to the 
               <br />
               province. The province constitutes the county 
               <br />
               courts; divides the county into as many districts 
               <br />
               as it desires, and provides for the creation of a 
               <br />
               county court, but it is the federal government 
               <br />
               which appoints the judges and pays their salaries. 
               <br />
               It is not much use for the provinces to create 
               <br />
               county courts unless they know the federal 
               <br />
               government will ﬁll the courts with judges and 
               <br />
               pay their salaries. I pointed out how many 
               <br />
               magistrates we had in Newfoundland and sug- 
               <br />
               gested, jokingly, that we could have every 
               <br />
               magistrate we now have in a magistrate’s district; 
               <br />
               we could then create a county court and leave it 
               <br />
               to the federal government to provide magistrates 
               <br />
               by appointing them as county court judges. There 
               <br />
               was a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">laugh,</span> They said, “You can not go the

               <br />
               would be entitled to six or eight or ten county 
               <br />
               court judges, therefore that many county courts. 
               <br />
               Their salaries, allowances and pensions would be 
               <br />
               paid by the Government of Canada, if and when 
               <br />
               established.

               Mr. Chairman No. We have only one district 
               <br />
               court as such —— the Central District Court in St. 
               <br />
               John's. All other district courts are magistrates 
               <br />
               courts. To illustrate what I mean, take Judge 
               <br />
               Browne, he occupies a unique position in the 
               <br />
               sense that when he sits on criminal matters, he 
               <br />
               sits as a magistrate of the St. John's Magistrate’s 
               <br />
               Court. In any civil claims, in the case of debt or 
               <br />
               liquidation, demanding up to $200, then he sits 
               <br />
               as judge of the Central District Court. That does 
               <br />
               not apply to any other magistrate. As opposed to 
               <br />
               that, the county court system is amidway position 
               <br />
               between the magistrate system and our Supreme 
               <br />
               Court. For example, in the Magistrate’s Court or 
               <br />
               in the Central District Court of St. John's, for that 
               <br />

               <br />
               ically must go into the Supreme Court. Were we 
               <br />
               to have the county court system, the county court 
               <br />
               would have jurisdiction in the case of debt and

               the Admiralty districts are constituted in all
