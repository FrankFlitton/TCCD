               not. They took the Blue Book and they guessed

               cause Mr. Smallwood says so, that we will be

               importing our goods from Canada? Will we not 
               <br />
               be permitted to buy anywhere else? Why, last 
               <br />
               year, we imported $25 million worth of goods 
               <br />
               from the United States on which duties of not less 
               <br />
               than $3 million were paid —I am estimating that. 
               <br />
               I say they probably collected nearly $4 million; 
               <br />
               and those so-called experts say we will get $2 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million.</span> And again on flour; we are told we will 
               <br />
               get it in duty free from Canada. That reminds me, 
               <br />
               in connection with flour coming into the country, 
               <br />
               the Canadians are tipping Newfoundlanders with 
               <br />
               the ﬂour, because they are selling wheat in Great 
               <br />
               Britain for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1.50</span> a bushel, market price, and it is 
               <br />
               $3 a bushel in Newfoundland. We in New- 
               <br />
               foundland have been paying on wheat based at 
               <br />
               $3 a bushel; while in Great Britain they are 
               <br />
               paying on wheat based on $1.50 a bushel. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               They say they will collect $400,000 in liquor 
               <br />
               taxes. If you can tell me they were not guessing, 
               <br />
               I will eat my hat. In 1946—47 we collected over 
               <br />
               $1.5 million in taxes on liquor. I am glad I am 
               <br />
               talking on this liquor business. In Canada, they 
               <br />
               can never unload the Scotch manufactured in 
               <br />
               Canada on the Canadian people. The distillers, 
               <br />
               like Seagrams, have to pay $12 a gallon in the 
               <br />
               form of excise duties to the federal government. 
               <br />
               It is coming here duty free, but they forgot to put 
               <br />
               in the $12 a gallon they collect there. It was 
               <br />
               deliberately done or else they are not experts. The 
               <br />
               same thing applies to mm which they import 
               <br />
               from the West Indies; the duty is much higher 
               <br />
               than it is here at the present time. And again on 
               <br />
               cigarettes — take Lucky Strikes; they are 52 
               <br />
               cents to 55 cents in Canada. You do not hear them 
               <br />
               telling us that. Under confederation we will 
               <br />
               probably pay 20% or 25% more than we pay now. 
               <br />
               I have a package I bought here for 37 cents; I 
               <br />
               bought them in Montreal the other day for 44 
               <br />

               Now, Mr. Chairman, I think I have shown 
               <br />
               conclusively that based on our present ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               and economic position, if Newfoundland entered 
               <br />
               into confederation Canada would stand to gain 
               <br />
               many billions of dollars annually over and above 
               <br />
               the subsidies paid to this Country.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Let us for a moment refer to Annex IV of the 
               <br />
               Grey Book which gives the possible expenditures 
               <br />
               of the federal government annually in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. Great stress has been made by 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood on the importance of the pay- 
               <br />
               ment of family allowances which are estimated 
               <br />
               to amount to $8.35 million yearly. I refer now to 
               <br />
               what is generally called the “baby bonus”. To get 
               <br />
               to the root of this matter, it is necessary to give a 
               <br />
               somewhat brief history of how it was brought 
               <br />
               about in the Dominion of Canada. I go so far now, 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, as to term this piece of Canadian 
               <br />
               legislation the most immoral and corrupt enact- 
               <br />
               ment that has ever stained the pages of the 
               <br />
               statutes of Canada.

               In 1944 the Mackenzie King government was 
               <br />
               on the verge of total collapse, because efforts 
               <br />
               were being made by many of its outstanding 
               <br />
               members to bring about conscription into the

               armed forces of Canada for the purpose of rein- 
               <br />
               forcing the Canadian army.... Prime Minister

               <br />
               French element in his party, putting through the 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               principally forthe purpose of healing the political 
               <br />
