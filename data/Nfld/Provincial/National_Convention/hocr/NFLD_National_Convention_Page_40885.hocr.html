               was surprised to note that it started at $7 per

               Mr. Smallwood The explanation is this: Can~

               ada is a country of 12.5 million people; there are 
               <br />
               vast numbers of industries; a certain amount of 
               <br />
               ups and downs, comings and goings, men getting 
               <br />
               work and men losing work; you would naturally 
               <br />
               expect a tremendous shift of population in 12.5 
               <br />
               million people. At the present time, the latest 
               <br />
               ﬁgures I read in the Financial Post gave the 
               <br />
