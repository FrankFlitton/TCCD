               Newfoundland — 1497, 1739, 1832, 1845 and

               many others. It is now over 217 years since the 
               <br />
               first governor of Newfoundland was appointed, 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               memorable dates in the history of Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               Amongst those dates, in the days to come, will 
               <br />
               ﬁgure with no less lustre September 11, 1946. 
               <br />
               That date will not be omitted by the future his- 
               <br />
               torian of Newfoundland, since it is that on which 
               <br />
               the elected representatives of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               gathered together as a National Convention, 
               <br />
               presided over by a fellow countryman of theirs 
               <br />
               whose name has a deservedly honoured place in 
               <br />
               the counsels of the nation. These 46 New— 
               <br />
               foundlanders gather together to consider, and 
               <br />
               here in the interest of accuracy I quote from the

               economic situation of the island since 1934, and 
               <br />
               bearing in mind the extent to which the high

               <br />
