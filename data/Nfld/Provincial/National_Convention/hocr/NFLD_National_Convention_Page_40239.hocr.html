               Mr. Smallwood Commenting on Major

               Cashin’s remarks, I would like to point out that 
               <br />
               this $700,000 is only the average amount that the 
               <br />
               government has had to pay to the Railway each 
               <br />
               year since 1923. It is not the actual losses of the 
               <br />
               Railway at all. The loss last year was $1 million; 
               <br />
               this year it is going to be $1.5 million. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Comment~</span> 
               <br />
               ing on another point raised by Major Cashin, he 
               <br />
               is right. In 1940 the government owed the 
               <br />
               Colonial Development Fund $2,794,000 of the 
               <br />
               $4.5 million they borrowed. In 1940 the Colonial 
               <br />
               Development Fund cancelled that debt. Included 
               <br />
               in that was an amount of $600,000 that the 
               <br />
               government borrowed from the Fund to give to 
               <br />
               the Railway to build a paper shed and pier at 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Port~aux~Basques</span> ($300,000) and one at St. 
               <br />
               John’s ($300,000). That was included in the 
               <br />
               $2.75 million cancelled in 1940. Yet, since 1940, 
               <br />
               the Finance Department has been collecting from 
               <br />
               the Railway the interest on that loan. It is only an 
               <br />
               amount of between $3,000 and $4,000 and as 
               <br />
               they have been dealing in millions, I suppose they 
               <br />
               have not paid much attention to it. With regard to 
               <br />
               the additional cost, during the war years they did 
               <br />
               make a proﬁt each year. Their costs now begin to 
               <br />
               rise and today we find the cost of wages has 
               <br />
               increased 60%, steel, coal and other purchases 
               <br />
               have advanced close to 100%.

               Mr. Jackman How can you have a profit if you 
               <br />
               do not match your rates to meet the increased 
               <br />
               costs? If you are going to have increased costs, 
               <br />
               you must have increased freight rates and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> 
               <br />
               creased passenger rates. My opinion is that there 
               <br />
               is a deliberate policy to foist the Railway on us 
               <br />

               <br />
               won the war but we have lost the peace. I suggest 
               <br />
               freight rates and passenger rates be increased to 
               <br />
               meet the cost. The people will pay. They are

               Mr. Hillier I did not happen to be here at the 
               <br />
               opening of this debate, but I have listened with 
               <br />
               great interest to the various speakers and I ﬁnd 
               <br />
               figures are very interesting things, but I feel as 
               <br />
               we have a lot of reports yet to consider and if we 
               <br />
               spend so much time debating each report, we will 
               <br />
               get through in the New Year of 1948.... The 
               <br />
               question is, what has the government to con- 
               <br />
               tribute to the Railway to keep it going? It is 
               <br />
               earning something. The Railway is a necessity. 
               <br />
               We have to consider income and expenses, but 
               <br />
               we should be as brief as possible in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">debating.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Northcott I think Mr. Jackman struck the 
               <br />
               nail on the head. If I have 100 pounds of freight 
               <br />
               landed at Lewisporte it will cost 78 cents; if I have 
               <br />
               a carload lot, I will get it for 39 cents. If the AND 
               <br />
               Co. has a carload lot, they get it for 16 cents per 
               <br />
               l00 lbs. I have no money; they have. Same thing 
               <br />
               applies to Bowaters. We are giving them too big 
               <br />
               a concession. We can pick up a lot of money 
               <br />
               there, maybe $30,000 or $40,000 a year. The time 
               <br />
               has come when we should. It is true they own 
               <br />
               their cars; it is also true that they pay 16 cents per 
               <br />
               100 lbs. I think the same concession applies to 
               <br />
               Bowaters and I think Imperial Oil are getting 
               <br />
               their cars hauled back from Gander without 
               <br />
               charge. I do not think it is fair. There is need of 
               <br />
               an adjustment there, and a large one.
