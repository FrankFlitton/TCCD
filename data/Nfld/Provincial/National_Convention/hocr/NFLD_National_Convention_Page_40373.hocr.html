               Mr. Vardy ....I support both the spirit and words 
               <br />
               of this motion. When it first came in my mind to 
               <br />
               represent the district of Trinity North the sending 
               <br />
               of certain delegations seemed to me unavoidable. 
               <br />
               Now some have suggested leaving the matter of 
               <br />
               a delegation to Ottawa until the results of a 
               <br />
               delegation to England are examined. They argue 
               <br />
               that the terms from England may be so good that 
               <br />
               it may not be necessary to send a delegation to 
               <br />
               Ottawa. I can do no more than assure this Con- 
               <br />
               vention that there is no member here more 
               <br />
               anxious to ﬁnd that this may be so. If it is, what 
               <br />
               has anyone opposed to it got to worry about, 
               <br />
               because the people of Newfoundland, you can 
               <br />
               rest assured, will vote for what in their opinion 
               <br />
               they consider best...

               1932 election. Just prior to going to the district a

               gentleman who is now living, and undoubtedly 
               <br />
               will hear my voice tonight, gave me a letter of

               introduction to go to the then acting Prime Min-

               <br />
               district that I eventually faced but for that party. 
               <br />
               I spent about two hours in that interview, and 
               <br />
               asked for their platform as a result of my deter-

               mination to do all possible to prevent New-

               given charge of this country again, he was 
               <br />
               branded as a crook. He came to the railway 
               <br />
               station when I went out with my manifesto, and 
               <br />

               <br />
               another one printed. He followed me in his car to 
               <br />
               Manuels and I still refused, and I have never 
               <br />
               regretted it.

               <br />
               everything they have done. I took the trouble to 
               <br />
               write them a letter a few days ago congratulating 
               <br />

               <br />
               the farmers of this country. Everything good I

               have seen I have taken occasion to remind them

               the people of this country and their liberty as well. 
               <br />
               I have never felt that those who associated with 
               <br />
               the Commission of Government went with that 
               <br />
               body for any other reason except to enrich their 
               <br />
               pockets at the expense of the people. I remind this 
               <br />
               House that as a much younger man than the 
               <br />
               gentleman who spoke a few minutes ago I served 
               <br />
               in the first war, and was held up on account of my 
               <br />
               age in the last war, being wounded at least four 
               <br />
               times in both wars. But as sure as I gave all I had 
               <br />
               for the purpose of saving this island home, just as 
               <br />
               sure I would most willingly give all that’s left of 
               <br />
               me for what I consider to be the best for this 
               <br />
               country. I have been dragged through the mud by 
               <br />
               the Commission of Government. They have at- 
               <br />
               tempted to bribe me (I hope they are listening). 
               <br />
               As long as I hold my head up I will defend this 
               <br />
               country in the way I think will be to the best 
               <br />
               interests of the people coming after me. My boys 
               <br />
               served in the war as well as myself, and I do not 
               <br />
               have to make any apology for saying this, and I

               hope no one who thinks differently towards this
