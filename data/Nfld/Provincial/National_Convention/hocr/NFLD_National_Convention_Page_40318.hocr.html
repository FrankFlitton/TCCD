               did that $4,800,000 come from? It came from the

               fishermen, the paper makers and forest workers 
               <br />

               <br />
               by making the cost of living higher. That’s what 
               <br />

               <br />
               Committee. It is one of the things that we have 
               <br />
               kept hidden in this country. I only know a few 
               <br />
               men, some in this house today, who are very 
               <br />
               much alive to the effect of the protective tariff. 
               <br />
               Here it says, “It can be clearly understood that the 
               <br />
               tariff in effect today is a revenue tariff." Who says 
               <br />
               it is?

               <br />
               the Committee. You can’t say that our tariff in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland today is a protective tariff, or a 
               <br />
               revenue tariff, it is both, and the people pay it all. 
               <br />
               Every cent of it comes out of the ﬁsh and the 
               <br />
               paper and the minerals, and drives up the cost of 
               <br />
               living. Some day someone has got to get down to 
               <br />
               brass tacks and ﬁnd out once and for all just how 
               <br />
               far these local industries are justiﬁed, just how far 
               <br />
               it pays the 315,000 of our population to have this 
               <br />
               protection on these local industries.

               <br />
               believe in the industries that are natural to the 
               <br />
               country, eg. ﬁsh... We have the raw material 
               <br />
               right here, and it is only a matter of hauling it out 
               <br />
               of the water and curing it, tinning or bottling or 
               <br />
               freezing it. Let’s encourage the industry in every 
               <br />
               way. What else is natural? Paper making, because 
               <br />
               we have the timber and the waterpower. 
               <br />
               Minerals, because we have the minerals. Furring, 
               <br />
               because we have the animals, and gaming be- 
               <br />
               cause we have the game. These are the industries 
               <br />
               we ought to foster and protect.

               You have it summed up magniﬁcently by the 
               <br />
               Industrial Development Board, if I can anticipate 
               <br />
               just for a moment. “The local Industrial Board 
               <br />
               have done a fine job considered the possibility 
               <br />
               of making cement”. That’s all right because we 
               <br />
               have the raw material to make cement. They sent 
               <br />
               away samples and had them analysed and the 
               <br />
               report came back that it would make a ﬁrst~class 
               <br />
               Portland cement. But why could they not go 
               <br />
               ahead with a cement industry? Because some of 
               <br />
               the raw materials are on one side of the island, 
               <br />

               and the rest on the other side, and it would be too

               expensive to bring them together to manufacture 
               <br />
               them into cement. All you have to do is put a high 
               <br />
               tariff on imported cement. Make out the cost of

               comes to $5 a bag to produce it here in New- 
               <br />
               foundland. Well, make the price $5.60 for the 
               <br />
               imported cement by putting on a high tariff. If 
               <br />
               you can do it for other things why not do it for 
               <br />
               cement? Putting a protective tariff on an imported 
               <br />
               article makes it more expensive then the local 
               <br />
               article and drives up the cost ofliving. It was said 
               <br />
               by Major Cashin 20 years ago, and it is a wonder- 
               <br />
               ful thing how Major Cashin and l are growing to 
               <br />

               <br />
               before I am finished! Some day we have got to 
               <br />
               go into this question of our tariff, above all our 
               <br />
               protective tariff...

               <br />
