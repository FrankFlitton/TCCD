               Majesty’s Government should prepare and make 
               <br />

               factual and objective statement on our economic

               for you because as I see it, ﬁnancial implications 
               <br />
               are subject to change with change of policy, as 
               <br />
               we are asked to consider policy. Therefore if we 
               <br />
               cannot deal with possible changes in policy, 
               <br />

               <br />
               what does Lord Amulree say. I’ll quote again, 
               <br />
               “We have already indicated the serious loss 
               <br />
               which the country generally, and St. John’s in 
               <br />
               particular, suffers through the absence of a local

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               mercantile marine. It is, to say the least, highly 
               <br />
               anomalous that in a maritime country, proud of 
               <br />
               its seafaring traditions, with an extensive 
               <br />
               European and South American trade, use should 
               <br />
               be made of foreign vessels to carry its products 
               <br />
               to market. It is still more anomalous that the 
               <br />
               foreign vessels generally employed for this pur- 
               <br />
               pose should be those of a nation which is one of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland’s chief competitors in the codfrsh 
               <br />
               markets of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">world.“</span> Lord Amulree concludes, 
               <br />
               “We content ourselves with recording the facts 
               <br />
               and suggesting that a special enquiry should be 
               <br />
               instituted, with a view to the elaboration of a 
               <br />
               practical scheme for encouraging the formation 
               <br />
               of a local carrying fleet."2 I am satisﬁed that the 
               <br />
               Economic Report has been constructive in their 
               <br />
               suggestions. Agriculture. As I foresee the future 
               <br />
               of agriculture in Newfoundland in its different 
               <br />
               phases I would say that its possibilities are 
               <br />
               unlimited... I base my conclusions on the 
               <br />
               progress made over the last 15 years. And if I 
               <br />
               must, I give credit for it to the reconstruction 
               <br />
               programme of Commission of Government. Our 
               <br />
               people have become farm conscious. We have 
               <br />
               started an era of commercial farming. True, we 
               <br />
               are late, as some speaker remarked a few days 
               <br />
               ago, we come in a period when pioneering is a 
               <br />
               forgotten word and competition from farm 
               <br />
               mechanisation confronts us. Despite all this we 
               <br />
               are progressing. We are equal to the task, and 
               <br />
               nothing can more effectively cushion a national 
               <br />
               setback in any country than the products of the 
               <br />
               land. It’s as symbolic as the action of a man who 
               <br />
               throws himself on the ground when an explosion 
               <br />
               passes over him. But these prosperous years have 
               <br />
               not tended to continuity of purpose. Money came 
               <br />
               easy of late. Further, the high values for cattle 
               <br />
               encouraged people to sell perhaps a little too 
               <br />
               much. Add to this the meager supply of cattle 
               <br />
               feeds, and there a new phase of farm life must be 
               <br />
               tackled, the cultivation of seeds. This may take 
               <br />
               half a century to climatise growth, but it can be 
               <br />
               done and will be done. The greater purchasing 
               <br />
               power of our people and the greater distribution 
               <br />
               of money has created demand. Our farmer is 
               <br />
               watching as keenly as he watches the farm life, 
               <br />
               the plant life he fosters. Again I am satisﬁed to 
               <br />
