               meet such an attack. Once before there were those

               <br />

               That, presumably, is the substance of a despatch 
               <br />
               from His Majesty’s Government in Canada to the 
               <br />
               Governor in Newfoundland. It is a development 
               <br />
               which I may say I anticipated to some extent. 
               <br />
               Many of you are aware of the fact that President 
               <br />
               Truman of the United States is likely to visit 
               <br />
               Ottawa in the early part of June, which will 
               <br />
               doubtless take up a considerable portion of the 
               <br />
               time of the Canadian government for three or four 
               <br />
               days, and a little later there is a very large con- 
               <br />
               gress which will meet in Ottawa, and which will 
               <br />
               bring into the city I believe about 150,000 
               <br />
               pilgrims. These proceedings will occupy a con- 
               <br />
               siderable period of time, and the Canadian 
               <br />
               government will be of course engaged to some 
               <br />
