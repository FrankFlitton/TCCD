               This amount, I pointed out, depended on the 
               <br />
               population of Newfoundland and the gross na-

               being $6,820,000, but that it should be listed as 
               <br />
               $6.21 1,756.60. That is to say the irreducible min-

               <br />

               <br />
               ment can guarantee to us. Under the next item you 
               <br />
               will see that they have listed for old age pensions 
               <br />
               an amount of $2 million to $2.6 million. Now this 
               <br />
               is merely guesswork. They admit that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">themselv</span>

               By the way, Mr. Smallwood has said very 
               <br />
               little about old age pensions of late, because he 
               <br />
               failed to point out in the ﬁrst instance that the 
               <br />
               federal government demands that the Province of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland will have to assure it that the 
               <br />
               recipient of the old age pension has made over 
               <br />
               his property to the province, which on his death 
               <br />
               will be sold, the amount paid to the pensioner 
               <br />
               prior to his death to be taken therefrom and 
               <br />
               forwarded to the federal government. It is as- 
               <br />
               sumed, I take it, that the balance, if any, will be 
               <br />
               paid over to his heirs. But the main question in 
               <br />
               that particular item which I refer to was the sum 
               <br />
               of $9.4 million under the heading “Other 
               <br />
               Departmental Expenditures.” You will remem- 
               <br />
               ber that I asked the Canadian government to 
               <br />
               break down that amount under the heading of the 
               <br />
               various services on which it would be spent. They 
               <br />
               have done that, and the answer is before you in 
               <br />
               that memorandum. I won’t go through it now, I 
               <br />
               will just refer to some items. You will note that 
               <br />
               they intend to spend $1.7 million on Veterans’ 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Affairs.</span> That is to say, if we become a province, 
               <br />
               Canada proposes to spend $1.7 million on 
               <br />
               Veterans’ Affairs in Newfoundland. Now let us 
               <br />
               look and see what we spent last year under 
               <br />
               Veterans’ Affairs. You will ﬁnd by reference to 
               <br />
               the government’s estimates that we spent the

               Royal Canadian Mounted Police (I suppose they 
               <br />

               to these ﬁgures, sir, in order to Show how very 
               <br />
               unreliable are the estimates which Mr. Macken- 
               <br />
               zie King received from his various federal depart- 
               <br />
               ments of the cost of the existing services in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, when they quoted the ﬁgure of 
               <br />

               I would also like to draw your attention to

               footnote no. 3, on the same page 16 of Annex IV, 
               <br />

               ship services taken over by Canada are not in- 
               <br />
               cluded in this $9.4 million” - and yet in this 
               <br />
               reply you have $1,393,000 under the heading of 
               <br />
               Transport in the breakdown of this $9.4 million. 
               <br />
               The more one looks at these terms in the light of 
               <br />
               the ﬁnancial experiences of the various provinces 
               <br />
               of Canada during recent years, the more one has 
               <br />
               to come to the conclusion that Prime Minister 
               <br />
               Mackenzie King surely thinks we are really too 
               <br />
               green to burn, and yet Mr. Smallwood has the 
               <br />
               temerity to tell his countrymen that these terms 
               <br />
               are generous! Well, a good many of his country~
