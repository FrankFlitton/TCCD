               Mr. Ashbourne I was speaking about the capi- 
               <br />
               tal necessary to help develop our industries, and 
               <br />
               about the scientiﬁc experience we needed for our 
               <br />
               men. I thought about mentioning the fact that we 
               <br />
               were going to have a technical college or institute 
               <br />
               as a result of the extension of the men’s vocation-

               <br />
               get some training and experience to equip them 
               <br />
               to take up these necessary occupations. We have 
               <br />
               natural resources to develop, but our lack of 
               <br />
               available capital, I am afraid, may interfere with 
               <br />
               their development, which will perhaps react upon 
               <br />
               our ability to take full advantage of our maritime 
               <br />

               As regards the matter of a mercantile marine 
               <br />
               mentioned in the report, l think we have in the 
               <br />
               past lost quite a bit of money, which might have 
               <br />
               gone into our economy, by not having such a 
               <br />
               ﬂeet, but on the other hand we are a small 
               <br />
               country, and we cannot be reasonably expected 
               <br />
               to provide services as if we had a population 
               <br />
               twice or three times the size. I believe we are 
               <br />
               underpopulated and our present transportation 
               <br />
               system and highroads could serve a far greater 
               <br />
               number of people. We are a small country, but 
               <br />
               yet it seems that we cannot provide full employ-

               ment for all of our people even at the present time. 
               <br />
               Surely this problem should not defy solution. If 
               <br />
               we are to survive, this should command the 
               <br />
               earnest consideration of all of us. We want full 
               <br />
               employment in order to realise full production. 
               <br />
               Our main sources of wealth come from the land 
               <br />
               and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seal</span> We have to study the problem of 
               <br />
               production as well as the problem of distribution; 
               <br />
               and while we want to try and get the maximum 
               <br />
               production, we also want to try and provide full 
               <br />
               employment for our people, for these are com-

               What is our dollar worth today? It has been 
               <br />
               said here already that the current index, or 
               <br />
               yardstick, was a barrel of ﬂour for a quintal of 
               <br />
               ﬁsh. Today a barrel of flour is $20. The fisher- 
               <br />
               man, who is the backbone of Newfoundland, has 
               <br />
               to get a barrel of flour a month, which means he 
               <br />
               needs $240 a year for one item of food — flour. 
               <br />
               The cost of living index continues to rise and the 
               <br />
               question, is when will it start to fall? People are 
               <br />
               looking with anxious hearts to the time when the 
               <br />
               cost of living will start to come down, for we 
               <br />
               cannot expect big prices for ﬁsh. The big prices 
               <br />
               we got during the war years will not continue. 
               <br />
               When Iceland, Norway and other ﬁsh—producing 
               <br />
               countries did not catch the ﬁsh, it was a matter 
               <br />
               practically of transportation for us — we could 
               <br />
               sell all the ﬁsh we could get providing we could 
               <br />
               get the transportation to carry it to the markets. 
               <br />
               When these countries get into full production, we 
               <br />
               shall not be able to get the prices for ﬁsh which 
               <br />
               we have been getting in the past. This whole 
               <br />
               problem of cost of living is a very, very important 
               <br />
               one and really enters into our economic picture.

               <br />
