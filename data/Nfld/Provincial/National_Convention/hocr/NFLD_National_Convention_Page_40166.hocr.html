               Mr. Miller I think we ought to proceed with the 
               <br />
               discussion on the report, and, since I am on my 
               <br />
               feet, I think I will give Mr. Butt a material ex~ 
               <br />
               ample of patriotism taught in the schools during 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">war,</span> Unlike <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mrl</span> Smallwood, who looks on 
               <br />
               any form of patriotism with some suspicion, I 
               <br />
               think it is a clean example, and perhaps the only 
               <br />
               reason why we did not include it was that it was 
               <br />
               obvious that every Newfoundlander should know 
               <br />
               about it. That was the selling of war savings 
               <br />
               stamps in our schools, where our children came 
               <br />
               and looked for a dime, and the next day for 
               <br />
               another dime, and eventually they got the price 
               <br />
               of a war savings certificate. I believe these 
               <br />
               children knew the purpose of these certiﬁcates, I 
               <br />
               believe that was a clean way of teaching 
               <br />
               patriotism. It certainly worked, and it was 
               <br />
               countrywide, and as it was perfectly obvious and 
               <br />
               we did not mention it; but it is a typical <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">example,</span>

               Mr. Butt Excuse me for getting up again. I am

               not trying to be like Hitler. I am not interested in

               $40,000 went down the drain, but $40,000 could

               Mr. Ballam There is one point Mr. Butt brought 
               <br />
               out. He mentioned that the money spent on 
               <br />
               teacher training was $15,000, whilst that for 
               <br />
               building schools was $500,000. 1 think what Mr. 
               <br />
               Butt meant was, is there enough being spent for 
               <br />
               teacher training, is it in proportion? And if not do 
               <br />
               you consider making recommendations for more 
               <br />
               expenditures in that respect?

               Mr. Butt I know that I am correct. The $15,000 
               <br />
               is not even the correct ﬁgure, but I do want to put

               <br />
               teacher training, during the sessions of die Com- 
               <br />
               mittee we did have Mr. Frecker, Secretary for 
               <br />
               Education, before us on several occasions, and 
               <br />
               although we have not embodied his talks in this 
               <br />
               report we secured enough information from him 
               <br />
               to make us believe that the Department of Educa- 
               <br />
               tion is very much alive to this matter of education, 
               <br />
               and are now making plans for summer schools in 
               <br />
               the Memorial College and all over the island; so 
               <br />
               they have taken steps to raise the standard of our 
               <br />
               teachers. That is a very difficult problem, as 
               <br />
               Mr. Frecker pointed out. Along these lines I am 
               <br />
               quite sure that the average standard of teachers in 
               <br />
               the years to come is going to be very much ahead 
               <br />
               of what it is at present. We have to remember that 
               <br />
               we have I think it is over 2,000 teachers all over 
               <br />
               the island, some of them with only 12 or 14 
               <br />
               scholars, and it is not to be expected that the state 
               <br />
               could spend thousands of dollars to send a teacher 
               <br />
               to each small settlement. But they are endeavour— 
               <br />
               ing to raise the standard of all teachers insofar as 
               <br />
               the money allows. Mr. Frecker left no doubt in 
               <br />
               our minds that that is one of the great problems 
               <br />
               which we will have to face, and they are facing it 
               <br />
               manfully. I cannot give you any particular facts 
               <br />
               on it...
