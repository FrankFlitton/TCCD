               Mr. Burry I rise to make a few remarks on this 
               <br />
               question before the House. I was hoping that 
               <br />
               today we would get around to the debate on the 
               <br />
               report of the Education Committee, and that 
               <br />
               would give us a chance to cool off from yes— 
               <br />
               terday. I ﬁnd myself regretting that the issue 
               <br />
               yesterday was on the level that it was, not in the 
               <br />
               spirit of condemnation of any member who took 
               <br />
               part, because I can assure those who did take part 
               <br />
               and raised their voices towards the end and if I 
               <br />
               may say, got a little hot under the collar, had no 
               <br />
               more attentive listener in this House than myself. 
               <br />
               Not because I agreed with what they said or how 
               <br />
               they said it, but because I know how interested 
               <br />
               they are in the issue, and I feel they were sincere 
               <br />
               in the attitude they took towards <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.,.,</span> I have 
               <br />
               found myself, and will ﬁnd myself, in a position 
               <br />
               such as these men were yesterday, and get excited 
               <br />
               over some of the issues that will be raised; but if 
               <br />
               I do, I assure you I will call upon all the powers 
               <br />
               that I have to control myself and to conform to 
               <br />
               the rules of procedure, and to carry on the debate 
               <br />
               as quietly, or as near to the rules of procedure, as 
               <br />
               possible. I do not wish to have this Convention 
               <br />
               resolved into a boys’ Sunday school class....
