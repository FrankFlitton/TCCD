               be other instances where deﬁnitely it would not

               be in the public interest to disclose information. 
               <br />
               I think we might proceed on the broad principle 
               <br />
               that all information, commitments, obligations 
               <br />

               tain well expected reservations) will be made 
               <br />
               available to the Convention; but we are not to 
               <br />
               forget that there may be negotiations which no 
               <br />
               government, no matter how willing it is to take 
               <br />
               the people into its conﬁdence, can disclose. Take 
               <br />
               a Water Street merchant who may have some

               <br />
               I don’t think it would be fair that the matter be 
               <br />
               publicised under those circumstances. We have 
               <br />
               to bear in mind these exceptions to the general 
               <br />
               rule that all information will be made available to

               Mr. Crosbie I quite agree. But you might ask a 
               <br />
               lot of questions, 15 or 20. You meet Mr. X, 
               <br />
               commissioner, in conference and he says, 
               <br />
               “Gentlemen I don’t want you to make this 
               <br />

               Mr. Hollett It is most unfortunate that they have 
               <br />
               taken this attitude. Do you think that they can 
               <br />
               give us information, 45 men or so, not sworn or 
               <br />
               anything, and net expect it to leak out? Are the 
               <br />
               persons of the Commission of Government not to 
               <br />
               be allowed to come and see us in public? They 
               <br />
               defeat their own ends by refusing to come before 
               <br />
               the pubiiC. In any case, if an official comes here 
               <br />
               we know that if he is not allowed to disclose 
               <br />
               something he is not going to. I think it is most 
               <br />
               unfortunate, and gentlemen I submit that there is 
               <br />
               nothing for us to do but take it gracefully and hear 
               <br />
               the commissioner in committee of the whole. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Perhaps it might be wise if 
               <br />
               we did not anticipate difﬁculties. Nothing may be 
               <br />
               discussed by the commissioner in regard to which 
               <br />
               there is any necessity for confidence or secrecy. 
               <br />
               Why not cross the bridges when we meet them, 
               <br />
               and perhaps we will not have any trouble at all.

               Mr. Dawe There is a method of finding infor-

               Mr. Cashin The point I have been trying to 
               <br />
               make is, Mr. Wild may say, “We will speak to 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               you as a committee of the whole, but we will not 
               <br />

               <br />
               Why? They have not explained the reason why 
               <br />
               they won’t do that. They have some reason for it, 
               <br />
               and I think they are playing their cards very 
               <br />
               badly, because the public can say, “There must 
               <br />
               be something wrong, what is it?” Are they afraid 
               <br />
               they will be asked an embarrassing question 
               <br />
               which they don’t want to answer? We delegates 
               <br />
               were to enquire into everything and the sessions 
               <br />
               were to be open to the public, and now we find 
               <br />
               that if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr,</span> Wild comes here we have to bar that 
               <br />
               door, and John Citizen cannot get in while <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> 
               <br />
               Wild tells us how he handled this or that. If Mr. 
               <br />
               Wild was across the House and was asked a 
               <br />
               question by a leader of the opposition he would 
               <br />
               have to answer it. Now he says, “Bar the doors”. 
               <br />
               That is not democracy. We can’t make them 
               <br />
               come, but if they don’t come publicly they should 
               <br />
               stay out altogether. With your permission I put an 
               <br />
               amendment in this form, that when this invitation 
               <br />
               goes to Mr. Wild he be asked to come to this 
               <br />
               House tomorrow afternoon, and that when he 
               <br />
               does come the House will be in public session, 
               <br />
               and ask his reply to it. He can only say no, and 
               <br />
               then we know where we are.
