               may be all right; but this has been made possible 
               <br />
               by an export fee. Who pays that fee? Does it not 
               <br />
               come from the ﬁshermen, to be given the Fishery 
               <br />
               Board or the Commission of Government to go 
               <br />
               to market and negotiate the price for fish? Taxes 
               <br />
               have been collected from fishermen by way of 
               <br />
               protection for the trade exporters. The ﬁsherman 
               <br />
               has not been taken care of; Mr. Brown for a 
               <br />
               number of years was trying to get the ﬁshermen 
               <br />
               and the exporters together. Last year there was a 
               <br />
               common understanding that a certain price would 
               <br />
               be paid; there was no agreement really made. I 
               <br />
               understand the ﬁshermen on the average received 
               <br />
               about $13.50 a quintal. I am not at all satisﬁed 
               <br />
               with the price the fisherman has been getting. 
               <br />
               There is too big a gap between fisherman and 
               <br />
               exporter and that gap shall have to be bridged. If 
               <br />
               something is not done, in view of what we have 
               <br />
               seen happen a year ago, we may ﬁnd the exporter 
               <br />

               Mr. Fowler It is a fact that during the war 50

               cents was taken from all the fish exported from 
               <br />
               this country; that was for the price of salt. Take a 
               <br />

               the Committee says about it is that there is a

               doing a good job. They do not tell us how they

               the Fisheries Board is costing around $250,000

               annually and an expenditure of this magnitude 
               <br />
               warrants more comment and explanation than is

               given here. I contend we should be supplied with 
               <br />
               copies of the Salt Codfrsh Act in order to get some

               With regard to the question of rebates on salt, 
               <br />
               as far as I understand it the rebate on salt applies 
               <br />
               to the man who has salt left over. If a man has 50 
               <br />
               hogsheads of salt left over he gets a rebate of 35 
               <br />
               cents a hogshead and the man who uses his salt 
               <br />
               gets no rebate. If the Fisheries Board had not 
               <br />
               entered the picture, what would the landed cost 
               <br />
