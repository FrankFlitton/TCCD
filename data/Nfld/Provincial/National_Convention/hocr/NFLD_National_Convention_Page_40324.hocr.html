               Mr. Smallwood Let us consider the appendix 
               <br />
               compiled by the Industrial Development Board, 
               <br />
               which strikes me as a constructive. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">report.</span> They 
               <br />
               seem to have the same idea I have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> to use up 
               <br />
               the raw materials we have here in the country 
               <br />
               rather than import. I do not think sealskins are 
               <br />
               mentioned, but that is an important item. They are 
               <br />
               exported raw. Why are they not manufactured 
               <br />
               here? Then the birch. What possibilities are there 
               <br />
               for manufacturing that here? Then, limestone. It 
               <br />
               seems from this report that limestone is sub- 
               <br />
               sidised in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada.</span> To encourage agriculture, the 
               <br />
               government subsidises limestone to make it 
               <br />
               cheaper for farmers. Fish offal —— perhaps Mr. 
               <br />
               Crosbie can tell us something about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that,</span> I was 
               <br />
               into a place in Labrador where there was 
               <br />
               machinery for turning fish guts, sound bones, and 
               <br />
               heads into fish meal. Then we come to seaweed. 
               <br />
               What do we find? “Processing ﬁrms in the USA 
               <br />
               when contacted re the establishment of branch 
               <br />
               plants in this country immediately asked for data 
               <br />
               on the quantities of the various species of 
               <br />
               seaweed available. This information, unfor- 
               <br />
               tunately, has never been compiled.” Why not? 
               <br />
               They make blancmange out of seaweed. 
               <br />
               Blancmange is the usual Sunday dessert in New-

               about sealskins and Mr. Crosbie about fish <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offal,</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Job I take this opportunity of making a few 
               <br />
               remarks about Mr. Smallwood’s ideas in regard 
               <br />
               to different industries. I am in accord with some 
               <br />
               of his ideas but I am not in accord with the drastic 
               <br />
               way in which he thinks local industries should be 
               <br />
               dealt with. Any local industry must have a small 
               <br />
               amount of protection and the most important 
               <br />
               thing about local industries is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">employment,</span> 
               <br />
               There are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">34,000</span> men employed in local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in.</span> 
               <br />
               dustn'es, what would be the position if they were 
               <br />
               out of employment now? It is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">serious.</span> I think it is 
               <br />
               helpful to the country generally. The other point 
               <br />
               is the enormous government revenue from those 
               <br />
               industries. I do not know how much. I do say that 
               <br />
               if any industry is receiving excessive protection, 
               <br />
               it should be remedied. Now, with regard to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sealskins.</span> The answer is simple. It has been tried 
               <br />
               on various occasions. The main trouble is foreign 
               <br />
               tariffs. Our sealskins go into the United States
