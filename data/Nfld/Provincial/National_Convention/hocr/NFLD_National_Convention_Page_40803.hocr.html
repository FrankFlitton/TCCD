               Mr. Starkes A few days ago, when I spoke on 
               <br />
               this Economic Report, I had hardly taken my seat 
               <br />
               when Mr. Hollett stood up and reeled off a whole 
               <br />
               lot of figures to show how much more prosperous 
               <br />
               our industries are than they were last year. I want 
               <br />
               to ﬁll in some of the gaps left in Mr. Hollett’s 
               <br />
               account of our industries. I want to tell you that 
               <br />
               at this moment many hundreds and thousands of 
               <br />
               producers are experiencing some of the worst 
               <br />
               misery they have ever known. Take a look at our 
               <br />
               biggest industry of all, the ﬁsheries. Only last 
               <br />
               week a man from St. Mary’s tramped Water 
               <br />
               Street, from one end to the other, trying to sell 
               <br />
               1,000 quintals of good quality shore codﬁsh, and 
               <br />
               had failed to sell any of it up to the time I was 
               <br />
               speaking to him. What about the truckloads of 
               <br />
               codﬁsh brought in here last week by the ﬁsher- 
               <br />
               men, and carried back home again because 
               <br />
               nobody would buy it? 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Hollett I rise to a point of order. I have been 
               <br />
               thinking about this ever since Mr. Starkes 
               <br />
               brought it up. Any ﬁgures which I quoted the 
               <br />
               other day were based on this, and were actual 
               <br />
               ﬁgures taken from the report. Why he imputes 
               <br />
               this statement to me I would like to know, and 
               <br />
               more than that, he spoke of somebody coming in 
               <br />
               with a truckload of ﬁsh. I wonder, could we have 
               <br />
               an ofﬁcial report of that? I would like to know. 
               <br />
               These are things we want.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Chairman Ithink 1 must sustain you on the 
               <br />
               first point. By the process of elimination my very 
               <br />
               deﬁnite recollection, Mr. Hollett, is that any 
               <br />
               figures quoted by you were from the Finance 
               <br />
               Report or the Economic Report. Their accuracy, 
               <br />
               of course, would obviously be decided when 
               <br />
               these reports come before the House. On the 
               <br />
               second point, however, I have to sustain Mr. 
               <br />
               Starkes, because I feel that any member must be 
               <br />
               free to express an opinion. I must assume that the 
               <br />
               opinion is honestly expressed, and he shall not be 
               <br />
               required to defend it simply because his opinion 
               <br />
               is not shared universally by other members of the 
               <br />
               Convention. Therefore 1 don’t think he is out of 
               <br />
               order, because I don’t think I can allow this 
               <br />
               Convention to be resolved into a court of judica- 
               <br />
               ture where every member would have to provide 
               <br />
               independent corroboration. That would be a very 
               <br />
               serious state of affairs, Mr. Hollett.

               Mr. Hollett On that point again, if I may. We 
               <br />
               must remember that we are speaking to the 
               <br />
               people when we speak here, and if Mr. Starkes is 
               <br />
               going to make a statement about somebody 
               <br />
               bringing in a truckload of fish and not selling it, 
               <br />
               it will cause alarm in this country. I think, there- 
               <br />
               fore, that any statement of that kind should be

               Mr. Chairman I see the seriousness of what you

               <br />
               prevent consequences which may follow from 
               <br />
               any member’s making an ill—advised statement. I
