               Mr. Higgins I have only a few comments to 
               <br />
               make on this report. It does strike me as outstand- 
               <br />
               ing that the government should be criticised by a 
               <br />
               department of the government. Unless I am 
               <br />
               wrong, I read this into the question outlined on 
               <br />
               page 2. The question was put bluntly to them, “If 
               <br />
               the government told you that hard times are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">im»</span> 
               <br />
               minent, and relentless retrenchment must <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be»</span> 
               <br />
               come the rule of conduct in all departments, what 
               <br />
               would your reactions be? What about your plans 
               <br />

               for a new and improved telegraph service then?" 
               <br />
               Their reply was that in that case they would 
               <br />
               inform the government that they could not under— 
               <br />
               take to carry on the telegraph system as it is 
               <br />
               practically collapsing. It strikes me that this is an 
               <br />
               extraordinary situation. This is the position. It is 
               <br />
               not the Committee’s finding that the telegraph 
               <br />
               system is collapsing, it is the people responsible 
               <br />
               for its upkeep, the people responsible for having 
               <br />
               it in shape. They knew it was collapsing —— it did 
               <br />
               not suddenly fall down and go “boom”. It is a 
               <br />
               most extraordinary policy for the government to 
               <br />
               collect $179,000 profit for the past seven years 
               <br />
               off a service that is dying on its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feet.</span> It seems 
               <br />
               extraordinary that you let your machine, which is 
               <br />
               earning you money, get into such a condition. It 
               <br />
               seems <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stupid,</span> There is no explanation except the 
               <br />
               usual one, indifference.

               On another matter I presume the Committee 
               <br />
               did discuss the matter of this radio-telegraph 
               <br />
               service as compared with the old land line. I 
               <br />
               wonder if Mr. Smallwood would enlarge on what 
               <br />
               the Committee’s ﬁndings on that were, whether 
               <br />
               it is as satisfactory as the old service, and what is 
               <br />
               the comparative cost?

               came and the great policy of retrenchment was 
               <br />
               introduced. You remember when the government 
               <br />
               brought in Sir Percy Thompson and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Penson

               (who afterwards became a Commissioner), and

               they instituted a relentless program of economy 
               <br />
               and retrenchment.1 In that program the postal 
               <br />

               <br />
               ﬁces were wiped out or closed down. Salaries

               were reduced, and the subsidy that the depart— 
               <br />
               ment was paid for carrying mails was reduced 
               <br />
               tremendously. It had been up around $500,000 a 
               <br />
               year, and finally in 1934 it was cut down to 
               <br />
               $150,000.... The operating loss took a clip from
