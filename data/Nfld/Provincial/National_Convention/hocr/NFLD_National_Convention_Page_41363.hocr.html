               <br />
               a special committee, whose duty it would he to

               late an improvement upon our old form of 
               <br />
               responsible government with a View to making it

               more suitable for our peculiar needs, and also in 
               <br />
               studying the confederation issue. I have often 
               <br />
               wondered, Mr. Chairman, whether in actual fact 
               <br />
               party government is necessary at all in a small 
               <br />
               community like ours. There is no party spirit or 
               <br />
               division in our St. John’s Municipal Council, 
               <br />
               although there is lots of bickering and difference 
               <br />
               of opinion; they seem to do very well under the 
               <br />
               chairmanship of a mayor who, whatever his 
               <br />
               faults may be, has a singularity of purpose in his 
               <br />
               devotion to his job of administering, with the 
               <br />

               This royal commission or committee which I 
               <br />
               have suggested would, I hope, also study the

               practicability of forming some arrangement

               <br />
               reasons which I have many times pointed out. It

               aside, at the time they were taking over certain

               bases in the Caribbean and West Indian districts,

               the people of that region that they were going to 
               <br />
               take a special interest in their affairs in return for 
               <br />
               the concessions granted, with a View to improv-

               <br />
               being administered by what is known as the 
               <br />
               Caribbean Commission, and I am informed that 
               <br />
               the Canadian authorities have been also co— 
               <br />
               operating with it. The amount of money set aside 
               <br />
               for the purpose was large, many millions of dol-

               lars. I believe the committee is still sitting and has 
               <br />
               not yet concluded its work. Is not this a precedent 
               <br />
               for Great Britain, the USA and Canada to get 
               <br />
               together to see whether our people are not entitled 
               <br />
               to some consideration with a View to the im-

               provement of our standard of living, in return for 
               <br />
               the concessions which Newfoundland has also 
               <br />
               yielded for the benefit of those countries and of 
               <br />
               democracy in general? The royal commission or 
               <br />
               committee which I have suggested might, per- 
               <br />
               haps, also act as a link between the Commission 
               <br />
               of Government and the people of Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               The absence of such a link has been one of the 
               <br />
               causes of dissatisfaction with the Commission.

               I am not unconscious of the fact that the

               amounts at present being expended by the Com— 
               <br />
               mission appear to be extravagant and I have no 
               <br />
               doubt that this is giving serious worry to our 
               <br />
               Commissioners. If a responsible government 
               <br />
               takes over at an early date, this worry will be 
               <br />
               transferred to their shoulders, and if I were a party 
               <br />
               politician, I would hesitate before taking on the 
               <br />
               job of reducing this expenditure and thereby, 
               <br />
               perhaps, reducing the efficiency of social and 
               <br />
               other services to our people. A part of our surplus 
               <br />
               is certainly disappearing in consequence of the 
               <br />
               necessity of advancing part of our own dollar 
               <br />
               surplus to provide payment in dollars to our 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen for their produce, but to be fair to the 
               <br />
               Commission, it is reasonable to ask, what would 
               <br />
               a responsible government do in such a case?
