               runs its own show in so many things, and the 
               <br />
               federal government runs the rest. I suppose it 
               <br />
               would take us all a little while to get used to it, 
               <br />
               but I don’t doubt that we would get used to it. We 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders are famous for being able to 
               <br />
               adapt ourselves pretty quickly. We’re a smart 
               <br />
               bunch of people. When it was proposed to change 
               <br />
               the rule of the road in Newfoundland last year, 
               <br />
               and make all the cars and trucks drive to the right, 
               <br />
               some people prophesised all kinds of accidents 
               <br />
               and deaths. But it turned out all right. And al— 
               <br />
               though we’ve only been a short year driving to 
               <br />
               the right, and we drove to the left for over half a 
               <br />
               cenmry, we’re so used to it now that we never 
               <br />
               even think of it. That’s how it would be with 
               <br />
               confederation. It looks like a pretty big jump for 
               <br />
               us to take right now, but we’d get used to it.... 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The way I look at this confederation idea, Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, is simply you have to think of the 
               <br />
               majority. It’s not what would suit a few but what 
               <br />
               would suit the many. I suppose some people 
               <br />
               might be hurt a little by confederation —— I see my 
               <br />
               friend Mr. Hickman smiling over there -- espe— 
               <br />
               cially at the start. I would not be glad to see 
               <br />
               anybody hurt. But what comes ﬁrst is the welfare 
               <br />
               of the many, and perhaps a very few would be 
               <br />
               hurt anyway... There’s another thing I like about 
               <br />
               this confederation idea, and mat’s the fact that it 
               <br />
               will give us political democracy. We mustn’t 
               <br />
               forget that. It would give us political democracy, 
               <br />
               just the same as responsible government would 
               <br />
               give it. I can see Major Cashin now up in the 
               <br />
               Houses of Parliament up in Ottawa, the Minister 
               <br />
               of Finance of that great big Dominion of Canada, 
               <br />
               not a little place like this. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I suppose all of us would be inclined to give 
               <br />
               the Commission government system credit where 
               <br />
               they deserve it, and they do deserve some credit. 
               <br />
               We’ve said some very hard things here about the 
               <br />
               Commission of Government, but we must admit 
               <br />
               that they have done some good and they’re 
               <br />
               deserving of a little credit. I’m not swinging on 
               <br />
               the Commission government gate either.... But 
               <br />
               I’m ready to give praise where praise is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">due.</span> But 
               <br />
               we’ve all got to be sensible about these things. In 
               <br />
               the spring we’ll all be going in to vote for a form 
               <br />
               of government we want, for the form of govem- 
               <br />
               ment we want for our country in the future. And 
               <br />
               I think most thinking men know very well that we 
               <br />
               can’t decide that we’ll have the Commission of 
               <br />
               Government here forever. It was never meant to 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               stay here. Commission government gives us no 
               <br />
               voice at all in our public affairs, while confedera- 
               <br />
               tion at least will give us better democratic 
               <br />
               government. We’ll not only elect our seven mem— 
               <br />
               bers to the House of Commons in Ottawa, but 
               <br />
               we’ll also elect our own House of Assembly. It is 
               <br />
               true that our House of Assembly wouldn’t have 
               <br />
               the whole show to run, but still it will have plenty 
               <br />
               to do. We will be electing our own government 
               <br />
               and we’ll also be helping to elect a government 
               <br />
               for the whole federal union. I won’t go any fur- 
               <br />
               ther, Mr. Chairman, with this line of argument, 
               <br />
               because you’ll probably have to rule me out of 
               <br />
               order. Anyway, one of the things I noticed about 
               <br />
               this confederation idea is that it will bring back 
               <br />
               to us a democratic form of government after a 
               <br />
               long and perhaps painful absence. Mr. Chairman, 
               <br />
               I have purposely kept away from discussing 
               <br />
               details of these confederation terms because they 
               <br />
               have been drawn over so often by everybody that 
               <br />
               I’m sure they’ve been worn out. And we don’t 
               <br />
               want the people in the country to forget about it 
               <br />
               just yet. I can assure you that we all appreciate 
               <br />
               the fact that they were handled very ably by Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood.... So there’s nothing further that I 
               <br />
               would add just now. For about ﬁve weeks we’ve 
               <br />
               been debating these details and I guess the Con- 
               <br />
               vention and the country have a fair idea of them 
               <br />
               by this time. I regard the terms as fair and attrac- 
               <br />
               tive. I think that under confederation we would 
               <br />
               get a square deal. I think our country would go 
               <br />
               ahead. I think our people would be better off and 
               <br />
               I think most of our families would live better and 
               <br />
               that, like Mr. Keough said, is the most important 
               <br />
               thing of all. That is the thing which we’re to 
               <br />
               decide. I think the people will know how to 
               <br />
               decide this fact. One last thing I want to em- 
               <br />
               phasise. We may decide to join up with Canada. 
               <br />
               If we do, we would become Canadian citizens, 
               <br />
               and Canada would be one great nation stretching 
               <br />
               from St. John’s right out to Vancouver. We’d 
               <br />
               become Canadian citizens, but we’d never cease 
               <br />
               to be Newfoundlanders. That would be impos- 
               <br />
               sible. To us Newfoundland will always be home. 
               <br />
               To us Newfoundlanders it will always come ﬁrst. 
               <br />
               And if in the referendum I cast my vote for 
               <br />
               confederation, it will not be for Canada’s sake but 
               <br />
               for the sake of the generations yet unborn here in 
               <br />
               our own island home.
