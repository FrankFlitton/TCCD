               Mr. Newell A couple of days ago we reached a 
               <br />
               point where individuals had asked questions to 
               <br />
               which they had not received answers and the 
               <br />
               answers were necessary. We left it to the Steering 
               <br />
               Committee to determine the method of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proce'</span> 
               <br />
               dure. Apparently the Steering Committee did not 
               <br />
               agree <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unanimously.</span> While I cannot agree with 
               <br />
               everything Mr. Crosbie has said, I am certainly 
               <br />
               in sympathy with him On one point. While I 
               <br />
               would like to see this Convention over as quickly 
               <br />
               as anyone else, I do not see the sense of quibbling 
               <br />
               for four or ﬁve days without the information. 
               <br />
               That is all we did this afternoon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~—</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">quibbled.</span> Let 
               <br />
               us adjourn until we have the information to go on

               Mr. Hollett I disagree with Mr, Crosbie and 
               <br />
               Mr. Newell. These two Black Books are sent us 
               <br />
               by Ottawa and we are supposed to do the best we 
               <br />
               can by telling the people of this country their 
               <br />
               contents. Although we have asked some ques- 
               <br />
               tions which have not been answered, and al- 
               <br />
               though we have asked questions which never will 
               <br />
               be answered, I do not believe that is any reason 
               <br />
               why we should hold up the debate. If you will 
               <br />
               bear with me, on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">particular</span> question I asked 
               <br />
               today — a breakdown of the $9.4 million ~— it is 
               <br />
               absolutely immaterial in one sense except that it 
               <br />
               would help us to understand a little more. That 
               <br />
               $9.4 million has to be taken as read; that is not 
               <br />
               going to be changed, as far as we know. If the 
               <br />
               question which I asked today has any bearing on 
               <br />
               holding up the Convention, I here and now 
               <br />
               withdraw that question. Let us tell the people 
               <br />
               what is in the books. Let us get it over with; then 
               <br />
               forget it.

               Mr. Chairman I think Mr. Crosbie was fair 
               <br />
               when he pointed out that it is not possible for Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood to be expected to break down these 
               <br />
               ﬁgures or to give detailed information in respect 
               <br />
               of matters he has not got the information about. 
               <br />
               Either he can or he cannot. Only he can decide 
               <br />
               that. If there are other matters which have no 
               <br />
               direct beating upon the questions which have 
               <br />
               been forwarded, it is rather a pity that the House 
               <br />
               should rise at this particular time. I suppose they 
               <br />
               will have to be touched upon if the report has to 
               <br />

               this debate on this Canadian question, because a 
               <br />
               great many of the figures in this Grey Book are 
               <br />
               grossly wrong. How can we possibly put that 
               <br />
               document or anything like it before the elec- 
               <br />
               torate? To get the information. I am convinced it 
               <br />
               is going to take months. Are we going to sit here, 
               <br />
               keep this Convention sitting all that time, until we 
               <br />
               get it? Or are we going to do what I think should 
               <br />
               be done? These figures have been challenged. If 
               <br />
               we are not going to get the correct information 
               <br />
               within a reasonable time, I am of the opinion that 
               <br />
               we should simply vote this thing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out.</span> I do not see 
               <br />
               how we could put before the country ﬁgures we 
               <br />
               have not approved. Major Cashin pointed out one 
               <br />
               glaring case, these liquor figures, where the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">es.</span> 
               <br />
               timate given by the Canadian government was 
               <br />
               $400,000 and it seems it should be $1.6 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million.</span> 
               <br />
               If Major Cashin‘s contention is correct, those 
               <br />
               figures generally should be increased by 20%. 
               <br />
               Surely the basis upon which the offer has been 
               <br />
               made would be materially <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">changed,</span> They base 
               <br />
               their offer on the fact that they are expecting to 
               <br />
               get from Newfoundland $20 million; that is per- 
               <br />
               fectly clear in the Grey Book. If they are going to 
               <br />
               get $24 million, then surely they could make their 
               <br />
               offer a better <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one.</span> I have great sympathy with 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood, and those people who spent a 
               <br />
               great deal of time on this confederation issue, 
               <br />
               who have it honestly at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">heart.</span> But the confedera- 
               <br />
               tion question would not be dead if we turned it 
               <br />
               down. It would be impossible, in my opinion, for 
               <br />
               this Convention to recommend that confeder- 
               <br />
               ation be placed on the referendum paper, unless 
               <br />
               we are sure that these figures are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">correct...</span> I do 
               <br />
               not want people to think I am against putting this 
               <br />
               before the country. I think there are people inter- 
               <br />
               ested in this and they should have all the infor— 
               <br />
               mation we can give them. If that information is 
               <br />
               incorrect, we have no right whatsoever to put it 
               <br />
               before <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them.</span> I think that is all I have to say about 
               <br />
               it. I do not think if it was turned down, the time 
               <br />
               we have put in on it has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wasted.</span> I think it 
               <br />
               will come in very useful at some future <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">time.</span> I 
               <br />
               think this whole question of confederation must 
               <br />
               be a matter of negotiation between governments; 
               <br />
               it is utterly impossible for us to negotiate, and that 
               <br />
               is what we will be doing if we go back and say.
