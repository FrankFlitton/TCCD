               Mr. Crosbie That is part of my argument. There 
               <br />
               are ﬁsh which have much more value, but that 
               <br />
               runs into tremendous amounts of capital. The 
               <br />
               Icelandic government realised that they could not 
               <br />
               go ahead without government assistance. I think 
               <br />
               in Iceland it is state controlled and private capital.
