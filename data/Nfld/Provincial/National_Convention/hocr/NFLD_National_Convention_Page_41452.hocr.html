               want in order to get what they do want, why the 
               <br />
               responsible government which they reject should 
               <br />
               be imposed upon them in spite of their wishes? 
               <br />
               Why, if a majority of Newfoundlanders want 
               <br />
               confederation today, they must be subject to 
               <br />
               responsible government which they don’t want? 
               <br />
               Will somebody kindly explain that to me? Such 
               <br />
               a proceeding, sir, has about it a very strong smell 
               <br />
               of Hitlerism, of that dictatorship which these 
               <br />
               persons who advocate the idea profess to hate so 
               <br />
               utterly. It is coolly suggested that the people shall 
               <br />
               be forced to vote for what they don’t want in order 
               <br />
               to get what they do want. If that is not the very 
               <br />
               spirit of dictatorship I do not know what it is. 
               <br />
               Again, these anticonfederate addicts have 
               <br />
               another refrain. They tell us that the Ottawa 
               <br />
               delegation had no power to negotiate, and that a 
               <br />
               duly elected government would have authority to 
               <br />
               enter into a bargain with the Canadian govem— 
               <br />
               ment, and that therefore an elected government 
               <br />
               would get better terms. “Oh yes", they say, “these 
               <br />
               terms are pretty good, but an elected government 
               <br />
               would get better.” Let us take a look at that theory 
               <br />
               for a moment. In the first place there are two 
               <br />
               alternatives involved in this idea that an elected 
               <br />
               government should get the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terms.</span> Firstly, that 
               <br />
               having got the deal with Canada the elected 
               <br />
               government would put that deal through without 
               <br />
               consulting the people. The people would then 
               <br />
               have no voice in the terms at all — none 
               <br />
               whatever. Is that what they want? Or second, the 
               <br />
               elected government would, after making the deal, 
               <br />
               submit it to the people, in which case they would 
               <br />
               have had no more authority to speak for the 
               <br />
               people than our Ottawa delegation had. And 
               <br />
               make no mistake about it, sir, it is the voice of the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland that the Canadian 
               <br />
               government wishes to hear, and not that of a 
               <br />
               government forced upon them by Britain or this 
               <br />
               Convention. And let no one imagine that 
               <br />
               Newfoundland’s entry into the Canadian union is 
               <br />
               a matter of horse-trading, or that the statesmen of 
               <br />
               Canada, that greatest dominion of the British 
               <br />
               Conunonwealth, are trying to put a shady deal 
               <br />
               over on this little people who are their own kith 
               <br />
               and kin. I well remember the words of Canada’s 
               <br />
               Minister of External Affairs, the Right <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Honours</span> 
               <br />
               able Mr. St. Laurent, who was chairman of this 
               <br />
               conference - words uttered by him at the very 
               <br />
               outset of our discussions: “What we are trying to 
               <br />
               discover", he said, “is whether union of our two 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
         </div>
         
         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_9" title="bbox 790 176 1327 1863">

               countries will work. Whether it will work to the 
               <br />
               mutual advantage of both. We must discover 
               <br />
               whether confederation under the British North 
               <br />
               America Act will actually work out in practice.” 
               <br />
               And that, sir was the spirit that permeated all our 
               <br />
               discussions. Those are not the words of a truck- 
               <br />
               ling tinhorn politician, but of a statesman who is 
               <br />
               held in profound respect by all shades of opinion 
               <br />
               in Canada, a man who was never a politician, but 
               <br />
               who was called into his country’s counsels in the 
               <br />
               early stages of the war because of his character, 
               <br />
               his skill and his unimpeachable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">integrity.</span> And it 
               <br />
               is with him, and with statesmen of his calibre that 
               <br />
               it is suggested that a delegation sent by a respon- 
               <br />
               sible government no less, a responsible govern— 
               <br />
               ment forced upon the people perhaps against its 
               <br />
               will, might do a little horse-trading. Sir, I wonder 
               <br />
               if those who visualise the making of the terms of 
               <br />
               federal union as something akin to the chattering 
               <br />
               of a housewife over a basket of vegetables in the 
               <br />
               marketplace, I wonder if they appreciate the true 
               <br />
               Canada of today? Do they realise that this Canada 
               <br />
               is a great and a generous nation, the third largest 
               <br />
               exporting country in the world, whose generous 
               <br />
               policy towards the mother country, both during 
               <br />
               the war and ever since, is eloquent testimony not 
               <br />
               only to her great wealth, but to her realisation of 
               <br />
               the high moral obligation which rests upon her as 
               <br />
               a member of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Commonwealth.</span> While the con~ 
               <br />
               flict was in progress she gave and loaned to 
               <br />
               Britain literally thousands of millions of dollars, 
               <br />
               and since then she has continued that policy, as 
               <br />
               well as the policy of supplying that war-tom and 
               <br />
               impoverished land with millions of tons of food 
               <br />
               at amazingly low prices. And yet this is the 
               <br />
               country that the anticonfederates would liken 
               <br />
               unto a housewife haggling over a basket of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">potatoes.</span> Don’t they realise that confederation is 
               <br />
               not the making of a merely commercial bargain 
               <br />
               between a couple of private businessmen? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Con«</span> 
               <br />
               federation is a proposal for political union. A 
               <br />
               partnership between Newfoundland and Canada 
               <br />
               presupposes that we shall become one more 
               <br />
               among the provinces that constitute that union. 
               <br />
               Far from being a trading corporation, those 
               <br />
               nine provinces are bound together by a constitu- 
               <br />
               tion known as the British North America Act. 
               <br />
               This act, which was passed by the British Parlia— 
               <br />
               ment 80 years ago, lays down the terms and 
               <br />
               conditions of that union, and this act must govern 
               <br />
               the entry of any country into that union, be it
