               Mr. Job I am wondering where that information

               came from that the road is going to cost $1.5 
               <br />
               million? I did not get on my feet to refer to that, 
               <br />
               but rather to a statement made by the member 
               <br />
               from Bonavista Centre who yesterday said that a 
               <br />
               little bird gave him some information. I want to 
               <br />
               make clear to the delegates that it was a very 
               <br />
               untruthful little bird. I got this direct from the

               Fisheries Board: the cost of group marketing of 
               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood I would like to congratulate the 
               <br />
               Fisheries Committee upon what I consider to be 
               <br />
               one of the ﬁnest pieces of work in connection 
               <br />
               with a report on ﬁsheries in Newfoundland ever 
               <br />
               compiled. I know of no other document on the 
               <br />
               ﬁsheries so complete, and so accurate on the 
               <br />
               whole... 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I have absolute faith in the basic possibilities 
               <br />
               of the Newfoundland ﬁsheries. We must never 
               <br />
               forget that over half our entire economy consists 
               <br />
               of the ﬁsheries and that half of the population is 
               <br />
               directly affected by the ﬁsheries, and that the 
               <br />
               remainder who are not directly affected, are cer- 
               <br />
               tainly so in an indirect way. Everyone in New- 
               <br />
               foundland stands or falls in the long run by the 
               <br />
               ﬁsheries. We must not make the mistake of 
               <br />
               neglecting the ﬁsheries. We must never forget 
               <br />
               that we cannot have a prosperous Newfoundland 
               <br />
               without prosperous ﬁsheries. So I would like to 
               <br />
               say I have great faith and great belief in the basic 
               <br />
               possibilities of the ﬁsheries of this country, and 
               <br />

               <br />
               I think it is common fairness and common sense

               foundland have been going through what you 
               <br />
               might call a honeymoon. A lot of countries had 
               <br />
               stopped fishing almost completely. Only a 
               <br />
               limited number were ﬁshing in the last few years. 
               <br />
               The result has been a world-wide shortage of fish 
               <br />
               and fish products, including oil and other 
               <br />
               products, and the consequence has been that the 
               <br />
               demand for fish has been great because at the time 
               <br />
               the supply was down, the demand was up and the 
               <br />

               will have to face is perhaps ample supplies and

               more than enough to meet the demand.
