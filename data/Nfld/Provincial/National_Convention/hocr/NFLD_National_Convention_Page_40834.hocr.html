            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I said a moment ago that the budget speech of 
               <br />
               Mr. James is anything but a complete picture of 
               <br />
               the affairs of Newfoundland. Why did I make that 
               <br />
               statement? For the simple reason that it is the 
               <br />
               truth. From information received by the Finance 
               <br />
               Committee, it will be observed that a sum of $3.5 
               <br />
               million was loaned to the St. John’s Housing 
               <br />
               Corporation and other housing associations, and 
               <br />
               which is consequently an asset. Today the St. 
               <br />
               John’s Housing Corporation and other housing 
               <br />
               associations owe the treasury over $4 million; 
               <br />
               $115,000 of this amount was a free grant; 
               <br />
               $625,000 is a recoverable advance but bears no 
               <br />
               annual interest charge, whilst over $3 million is 
               <br />
               bearing interest at an annual rate of 3.5% and 
               <br />
               debentures have been issued or are being issued 
               <br />
               by the Housing Corporation to cover this amount. 
               <br />
               In all, approximately $4 million. Mr. Chairman, 
               <br />
               I consider this particular $4 million asset just as 
               <br />
               good as our interest~free loans to Britain. I will 
               <br />
               go further and say it is better. We have security 
               <br />
               in this instance for our money and we unfor— 
               <br />
               tunately cannot say that with respect to our inter- 
               <br />
               est—free loans to Britain. In addition to these 
               <br />
               amounts, the Savings Bank shows an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accumu«</span> 
               <br />
               lated proﬁt, together with its reserve, of not less 
               <br />
               than $800,000, and I refer delegates to the 
               <br />
               Auditor General’s Report of 1946, wherein it 
               <br />
               states that $7 19,000 is to the credit of that surplus. 
               <br />
               It is reasonable to expect that as at March 31, 
               <br />
               1947 this had increased to $800,000. Then we 
               <br />
               must take into account the amounts owed the 
               <br />
               Department of Public Health and Welfare by the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom government and also the 
               <br />
               amount owed by the British government to the 
               <br />
               Department of Public Utilities on account of the 
               <br />
               operations of the Gander airport, as well as other 
               <br />
               recoverable loans due the government for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advarp</span> 
               <br />
               065 in connection with the development of the 
               <br />
               ﬁsheries, together with the amount that would lie

               <br />
               Now what is the result of this recapitulation? Is

               <br />
               tention to an answer to a question by the Finance 
               <br />
               Committee on January 11 last as to how this 
               <br />
               particular loan stood. The reply given by the 
               <br />
               Secretary for Finance on January 15 last states: 
               <br />
               the total amount of the advances made by way of 
               <br />
               interest~free loans which were outstanding at 
               <br />
               December 31, 1946, was $9,068,000 (London, 
               <br />
               firm figure) and $242,000 (St. John’s, ap- 
               <br />
               proximation only) a total of $9,310,000. If we 
               <br />
               turn to the Finance Report we ﬁnd that the total 
               <br />
               amount of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interest~free</span> loans made to Britain 
               <br />
               amounted to $12,300,000. We have told you that 
               <br />
               $3,232,000 were taken from this amount and 
               <br />
               placed in a special account with the Crown 
               <br />
               Agents in London for the purpose of redeeming 
               <br />
               two loans coming due in 1950 and 1952. This 
               <br />
               should show a balance to our credit on account of 
               <br />
               these loans of $9,068,000. The difference there— 
               <br />
               fore between the two amounts is $1.8 million, and 
               <br />
               this amount should be added to our surplus cash, 
               <br />
               as it represents the purchase of war savings cer- 
               <br />
               tifrcates by our peOple and these certiﬁcates are 
               <br />
               shown as part of our national debt. Therefore the 
               <br />
               total cash surpluses, if we take this particular 
               <br />
               amount into account, is over $39 million. This 
               <br />
               amount has not been considered as a cash surplus
