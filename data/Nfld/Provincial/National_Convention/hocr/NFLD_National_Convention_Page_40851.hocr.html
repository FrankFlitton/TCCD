               Most people have not read the BNA1 Act. The 
               <br />
               British Parliament would pass an act making 
               <br />
               Newfoundland a province. That would be an

               amending act of theBNA. There is no parliament 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland. Your question is, how would 
               <br />
               Newfoundland be made a province if once the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland decide in the referen- 
               <br />
               dum that this should be a province. How would 
               <br />
               it be brought about? I suggest to you there are a 
               <br />

               come someone else. Getting back to Mr. Hollett’s 
               <br />
               question. We have no legislature in New- 
               <br />
               foundland, so the legislature of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               cannot make a joint address to Britain. We have 
               <br />
               not got a legislature, not an elected one. The 
               <br />
               Commission is the legislature of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               at the present time; they are both government and 
               <br />
               legislature, ﬁlling both functions. That is one 
               <br />
               way; to have the purely formal petition go to the 
               <br />
               British Parliament; it would only be a formality 
               <br />
               once the people have pronounced upon it in the 
               <br />
               national referendum; all the rest is a mere for- 
               <br />
               mality, a mere technicality. The real thing is what 
               <br />
               the people want. If the people want confedera- 
               <br />
               tion, one way is to follow the BNA Act and say, 
               <br />
               “All right, there is a legislature in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               now". It was not elected, it is true. But it is the 
               <br />
               legislature. No one is going to deny that... 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Hollett is this the answer, that the Commis- 
               <br />
               sion of Government would do it? Remember that 
               <br />
               the Commission is composed of four Englishmen 
               <br />
