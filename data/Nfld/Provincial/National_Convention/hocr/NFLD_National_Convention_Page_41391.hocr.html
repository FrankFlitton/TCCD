               producing country, and if we continue to produce 
               <br />

               place with the progressive nations of the world. 
               <br />
               In our forest industries we see just such a program 
               <br />
               of activity working out. Our pulp and paper mills 
               <br />
               are being extended, and a similar state of affairs 
               <br />
               exists in our fishing industry — newer methods 
               <br />
               of catching and marketing are being introduced. 
               <br />
               From our industries we are in the happy position 
               <br />
               of being able to produce enough dollars to pay 
               <br />
               for all necessary imports, and consequently our 
               <br />
               standard of living has reached a peak never 
               <br />
               known before.

               Other countries, including Canada, are unable 
               <br />
               to obtain dollars, but with us the position is the 
               <br />
               opposite. For this reason we can be regarded as 
               <br />
               one of the most fortunate countries in the world. 
               <br />
               I have said nothing about our agriculture, or our 
               <br />
               tourist possibilities, but these two sources of in- 
               <br />
               come are ready for greater development. It is my 
               <br />
               opinion that the day is not far away when we will 
               <br />
               be able to produce sufﬁcient to make us inde- 
               <br />
               pendent of foreign markets. As for the tourist 
               <br />
               trafﬁc, we know what this means to countries 
               <br />
               such as Canada which have no greater — if as 
               <br />
               great — attractions as are to be found in New- 
               <br />
               foundland. Under a government of our people I 
               <br />
               see the possibilities of developing all these sour- 
               <br />
               ces of income. Are we to be so foolish as to 
               <br />
               sacrifice all these things for the doubtful 
               <br />
               prospects which may or may not be ours under 
               <br />
               any strange form of goverrunent, so to speak? If 
               <br />
               you had a business, would you be satisﬁed to 
               <br />
               hand it over to some stranger to run for you? 
               <br />
               Would you feel that he could run it better than 
               <br />
               you could? Do you think he would take a greater 
               <br />
               interest in you and your family than you would 
               <br />
               yourself? Of course you would not, you would 
               <br />
               turn your back in contempt on any such offer. Yet 
               <br />
               is that not just what we are being asked to do 
               <br />
               today? Are you going to fall for it? I am sure you

               are not.

               Mr. Chairman, in asking the people to support 
               <br />
               the actions of those of us who are seeking self- 
               <br />

               <br />
               acting in the best interests of our people. I am a 
               <br />
               born Newfoundlander with a stake in this 
               <br />
               country. I have a home and a family which it is 
               <br />
               my solemn duty to safeguard. Their best interests

               are mine. Do you think I would support any form 
               <br />
               of government which I thought for a minute 
               <br />
               would not be best for them? Why shouldI support 
               <br />
               self-government, except for the reason thatI was 
               <br />
               convinced it was best? As founder and president 
               <br />
               of a large union in Newfoundland, I have many 
               <br />
               obligations to contend with. It is my sworn duty 
               <br />
               to f1 ght for the interest of every man in that union, 
               <br />
               and every working man in this country. Do you 
               <br />
               think that I am going to support a cause which I 
               <br />
               think is not in the best interests of the families of 
               <br />
               these union members? It would be absolutely 
               <br />
               senseless. And I say further, that if self—govern— 
               <br />
               ment is best for my union, then it is best for all 
               <br />
               other unions. After all self-government is, I 
               <br />
               believe, the very essence of labour organisations. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I think that it was unfortunate that the motion 
               <br />
               before the Chair is not so worded as to give me 
               <br />
               and other delegates an opportunity of comparing 
               <br />
               the beneﬁts of responsible government with 
               <br />
               other forms of government. Mr. Chairman, it is 
               <br />
               generally recognised these days that New- 
               <br />
               foundland is at a crossroads. For good or ill we 
               <br />
               who are living today have the great responsibility 
               <br />
               of deciding on what road our country will travel. 
               <br />
               I say therefore, that it is the duty of this house and 
               <br />
               indeed the duty of every Newfoundlander listen- 
               <br />
               ing to my voice, to do his part to enlighten his 
               <br />
               fellow men, to assist those who are not fully 
               <br />
               informed on the real situation to see the light. We 
               <br />
               lost our government in 1933 because the people 
               <br />
               were kept in the dark. Let us see that it does not 
               <br />
               happen again. We have now a chance to rectify 
               <br />
               our past mistakes, but this time there will be no 
               <br />
               chance to undo our action. This time it will be for 
               <br />
               keeps. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Reviewing this whole matter, there is one 
               <br />
               feature which we must not overlook, and it is this: 
               <br />
               if in the future it should ever become necessary 
               <br />
               for us to unite with any other country (which I 
               <br />
               trust will never happen), then is it not necessary 
               <br />
               for us to have a free hand to make whatever deal 
               <br />
               we wish? For myself, if such a time ever came, I 
               <br />
               think it would be most advisable that we be able, 
               <br />
               for instance, to discuss matters with the United 
               <br />
               States of America. Do we want to shut ourselves 
               <br />
               off from such a position? 
               <br />

               Mr. Chairman, if the people of our country had
