               Mr. Chairman That is right. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Is not that in connection with 
               <br />
               questions? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman They just laid it down. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Tomorrow is merely a review 
               <br />
               by the commissioner of the position of New- 
               <br />
               foundland as he sees it; it is merely a formal 
               <br />
               address. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Without interrogation, you 
               <br />
               mean. It further has to be remembered that it was 
               <br />
               not the intention, of the United Kingdom govern- 
               <br />
               ment to have officials of the government sub- 
               <br />
               jected to examination by this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Convention.</span> That is 
               <br />
               a deﬁnite statement. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood That is face to face? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I do not know whether it is face 
               <br />
               to face or otherwise; but it was not intended that 
               <br />
               officials of government should be examined by 
               <br />
               this Convention. Furthermore the Commission of 
               <br />
               Government have stated that, whereas or whilst 
               <br />
               it is willing and most anxious to afford this Con— 
               <br />
               vention, and through this Convention the public 
               <br />
               at large, the fullest possible information which 
               <br />
               properly can be and should be disclosed, and is 
               <br />
               further prepared to meet the Convention as a 
               <br />
               committee of the whole, but only in private and

               Mr. Jackman Who drew up the National Con- 
               <br />
               vention Act? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman The National Convention Act 
               <br />
               was passed by the legislative authority of this 
               <br />
               country. I do not think you can go beyond or past 
               <br />
               that. We are faced with facts and we cannot do 
               <br />
               anything about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> We are bound by the terms of 
               <br />
               reference under that authority. We are faced with 
               <br />
               an unalterable fact. We cannot compel people to 
               <br />
               come here... 
               <br />
               Mr. Vardy The commissioners are appointees 
               <br />
               of the home government. We have no jurisdiction 
               <br />
               over them. I think we should accept the facts. We 
               <br />
               cannot dictate to them. They are still in office. 
               <br />
               Mr. Butt I do not think it is a matter of dictating 
               <br />
               to the Commission, but we should ask them for a 
               <br />
               reconsideration with a different spirit. If we dic- 
               <br />
               tated to them they would probably dictate back. 
               <br />
               If we approach them in the spirit that we want to 
               <br />
               get the best we can for this country, they may be 
               <br />
               willing to reconsider it. I suggest further we are 
               <br />
               discussing a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">time‘honoured</span> problem, one that has 
               <br />
               been handled on many occasions. If a minister

               tion he can give. That is all we ask... I suggest 
               <br />
               we approach them in the spirit of wanting the 
               <br />
               information we can get, not for ourselves, but for 
               <br />
               the people of this country, and in that spirit to 
               <br />
               reconsider the position. If there is information 
               <br />
               beyond a shadow of doubt not in the public 
               <br />
               interest, he may withhold it. If I ask a minister <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> 
               <br />
               certain question and he says, “I cannot answer 
               <br />
               that”, and I ask him 20 more questions and he still 
               <br />
               says, “I cannot answer them”, I will not take that 
               <br />
               lying down. 
               <br />
               Mr. Jackman I was notified by a commissioner 
               <br />
               about two years ago on a question put to him that 
               <br />
               we had no authority to call witnesses. He gave 
               <br />
               me to understand his authority came from the 
               <br />
               Dominions Ofﬁce. I understand this act has been 
               <br />
               drawn up by the Commission. If that is so, by 
               <br />
               what authority are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we‘acting?</span> What I want to 
               <br />
               bring out is that if the commissioners refuse to 
               <br />
               meet us in public, let us have them removed and 
               <br />
               others put in. Secondly, the Dominions Ofﬁce 
               <br />
               should be contacted and asked if it is not possible 
               <br />
               to have the commissioners attend here and give 
               <br />
               us what we want in public. The Commission of 
               <br />
               Government is not a secret organisation, nor are 
               <br />
               we a secret body. Every matter to be dealt with 
               <br />
               here should get the fullest possible ventilation. 
               <br />
               Mr. Bradley We had better face the facts. This 
               <br />
               Convention has no authority to compel anyone, 
               <br />
               commissioner or no commissioner, whether he 
               <br />
               be Mr. Wild or Mr. Jones or Captain Murphy of 
               <br />
               one of our sealing steamers, we have no authority 
               <br />
               to compel anybody. That being the case we can 
               <br />
               only ask, and if he lays down conditions upon 
               <br />
               which he will come, we have to comply with the 
               <br />
               conditions. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I will have to ask for a motion 
               <br />
               to suspend the rules if you desire to discuss this 
               <br />
               matter — <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">i.e.</span> the rule in relation to members 
               <br />
               talking more than once —- so as to rcgularise the 
               <br />
               discussion. I do not want to shut off the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discus‘</span> 
               <br />
               sion, but we will have to regularise it, in order to 
               <br />
               allow free expression. 
               <br />
               Mr. Brown I have not spoken on this matter 
               <br />
               before, but it seems to me that we should cross 
               <br />
               ourbridges when we come to them. If they refuse, 
               <br />
               then it is time to jump down their throats. If we 
               <br />
               are bound by that act which you showed us, 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, what is the use of talking about it?
