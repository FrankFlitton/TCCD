               Mr. Smallwood Well, sir, I was under the im- 
               <br />
               pression that I had. Possibly my memory on that 
               <br />
               is defective. We have to find it in one way and 
               <br />
               another, some from the people of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               in taxation, some as I have shown in other ways 
               <br />
               from other sources. Incidentally, it has been 
               <br />
               pointed out to me by Mr. Hollett that I have taken 
               <br />
               the $28 million cash surplus that we have and put 
               <br />
               it on deposit with the Government of Canada at 
               <br />
               2.63% interest, and I have taken the interest for 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst four years as $600,000 a year, and then 
               <br />
               for the second four years I have averaged it as 
               <br />
               $299,000, roughly $300,000 a year. I admit on 
               <br />
               the objection from Mr. Hollett that I won’t have 
               <br />
               $28 million to put on deposit with the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment of Canada. I will go a little further, and say 
               <br />
               that I will have $38 million, which Major Cashin 
               <br />
               has told us is the surplus in this country. I will 
               <br />
               now take the 2.63% interest on that.
