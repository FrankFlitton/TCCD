               The weak part of Commission government, in 
               <br />
               my opinion, has been the control of our affairs by 
               <br />
               a British department (often by subordinates in 
               <br />
               that department) 2,000 miles away from what 
               <br />
               should be the real seat of government. I cannot 
               <br />
               altogether subscribe to the charges that the Com— 
               <br />
               mission has been wilfully wasteful; and in that 
               <br />
               respect they have certainly not been worse than 
               <br />
               many of the former responsible governments, 
               <br />
               whose spending was, in most cases, only limited 
               <br />
               by their revenues, plus the amounts they could 
               <br />
               borrow. True, their revenues were limited. There 
               <br />
               is bound to be an end of lavish expenditures, and 
               <br />
               even amongst our more wealthy neighbours this 
               <br />
               must come to an end —— as witness the present 
               <br />
               so-called austerity programme now in force on 
               <br />
               the mainland. It certainly may be necessary in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland and every other country to reduce 
               <br />
               public expenditures before very long; and it 
               <br />
               would seem to me that any party politicians 
               <br />
               taking charge at the present time and being 
               <br />
               obliged to cut expenditures, would very quickly 
               <br />
               become unpopular.

               Before leaving this question of Commission

               government, which has received some hard 
               <br />
               knocks during our deliberations, I would like to 
               <br />

               amply exposed during our debates, but I think we
