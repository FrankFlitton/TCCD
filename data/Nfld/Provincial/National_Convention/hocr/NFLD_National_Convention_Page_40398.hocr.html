               <br />
               would like to take into consideration some advice 
               <br />
               I noticed in this moming’s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">newspaper.</span> It says, 
               <br />
               “When the reports are introduced it is to be hoped 
               <br />
               that comment will be brief and pointed, designed 
               <br />
               to bring out the truth rather than let constituents 
               <br />
               know that their delegates are doing their job." I 
               <br />
               think that a good remark and I want to set a good 
               <br />
               example by being short.

               I would like to refer to the serious loss this 
               <br />
               Committee sustained by the serious illness of Mr. 
               <br />
               Brown, who was a great strength with his great 
               <br />
               knowledge of ﬁsheries; it was really a bad blow 
               <br />
               when he had to discontinue his work. Then again, 
               <br />
               we were deprived of the services of our present 
               <br />
               worthy Chairman with his knowledge of the

               <br />
               will hear these things in mind and realise we have 
               <br />
               been handicapped. We have not been having the

               Newfoundland Fisheries Board as well as from

               However, it is one thing to arrive at today’s 
               <br />
               valuation, which as we all know is a very much 
               <br />
               inﬂated one, but it is quite another matter to arrive 
               <br />
               at reliable ﬁgures for future years. The Commit- 
               <br />
               tee has (probably very rashly) mentioned a ﬁgure 
               <br />
               of $24 million as a possible average. This is 
               <br />
               actually a pure guess, and by some people may 
               <br />
               be considered on the optimistic side. It will be 
               <br />
               obvious to everyone that there are so many future

               I would like to point out two features of the 
               <br />
               report which I think will be specially interesting 
               <br />
               to members of the Convention, as they may come 
               <br />
               as a surprise. I refer to the sub-committee report 
               <br />
               in the appendix on the matter of subsidiary 
               <br />
               ﬁsheries which shows a value of $2.6 million; 
               <br />
               and also the report on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">try—products</span> which shows 
               <br />
               a value of nearly $1.7 million. These two 
               <br />
               branches of the industry especially seem to be 
               <br />
               capable of very material development. Our hope 
               <br />
               seems to be in the further development of markets 
               <br />
               for fresh and frozen ﬁsh and for canned products, 
               <br />
               as a relief for the salt codﬁsh industry, and also 
               <br />
               in the further development of our herring ﬁshery 
               <br />
               which would seem to have scope for very large 
               <br />
               development if properly encouraged, and by that 
               <br />
