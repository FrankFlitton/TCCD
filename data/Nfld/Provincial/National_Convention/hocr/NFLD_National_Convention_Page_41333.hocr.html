               Parson Harvey’s History of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nettfowtdland1</span> - 
               <br />
               “1812, did today visit the family of William 
               <br />
               Bailey at Little Harbour, and christened his fami- 
               <br />
               ly” — that was my grandfather’s father, New- 
               <br />
               foundland—born. William Bailey’s father 
               <br />
               believed in self-government and swinging a 
               <br />
               Claymore in defence of what he believed was the 
               <br />
               right form of government for him. He did not get 
               <br />
               it there, but in the woods of Newfoundland he 
               <br />
               found it far from ideologies. Today our 
               <br />
               forebear’s theories are right, for apart from a 
               <br />
               minority, all the world plans for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self‘govemment</span> 
               <br />
               ———~ all those who can get it. I know there are 
               <br />
               certain sections of this world where a minority 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rules.</span> They are behind an Iron Curtain. We are 
               <br />
               the only ones in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Anglo-Saxon</span> world who are 
               <br />
               deprived of that right. Power politics are doing 
               <br />
               that to us. Latitude and longitude today determine 
               <br />
               the amount of self-govemment we will have if 
               <br />
               the powers that be have their way, and this is 
               <br />
               contrary to the Atlantic Charter, contrary to 
               <br />
               democracy 2md also to the American way. A cry 
               <br />
               was raised in the 18th century there, about taxa- 
               <br />
               tion without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representation,</span> Britain found out to 
               <br />
               her cost that by not heeding that cry, it had to be 
               <br />
               rammed down her throat, and the operation was 
               <br />
               painful. Had power politics been forgotten then 
               <br />
               and the rights of men taken into account, I wonder 
               <br />
               if the affairs of this world would not have been 
               <br />
               different. I doubt today if we would have had the 
               <br />
               two bloody wars we have had lately and that 
               <br />
               peace would be on this earth. I believe that all 
               <br />
               people should govern themselves. It should be 
               <br />
               the right of any man to do just that. Why deny it 
               <br />
               to me? I have been deprived of that right for 14 
               <br />
               years and a right good mess has been made of it. 
               <br />
               Of that I will speak later. I have paid a little more 
               <br />
               than lip service to democracy. That’s why I 
               <br />
               joined a queue four city blocks long, four deep, 
               <br />
               to put on a uniform August 6, 1914. If anybody 
               <br />
               saw me crowd there that day you would see there 
               <br />
               was a lot of us of one single mind. It is a service 
               <br />
               that all citizens should give, and if you count the 
               <br />
               number in this gathering that have served their 
               <br />
               stint in defence of King and country and look at 
               <br />
               them when the vote is counted, you'll ﬁnd out 
               <br />
               that the great majority of them believe in the 
               <br />
               divine right of self-government. Let the vote

               speak for itself. The world will soon have a 
               <br />
               chance to learn how it will go. Men from this 
               <br />
               island built up a name to the Germans, the “White 
               <br />
               Indians”, a name Newfoundland can cherish, a 
               <br />
               name their sons can be proud of, a name equal to 
               <br />
               the Scotsmen’s name of the “Ladies from Hell". 
               <br />
               You’ll note the enemy gave them both names and 
               <br />
               only two classes of men in the Empire, the 
               <br />
               Scotsman and Newfoundlanders. There must be 
               <br />
               nothing wrong with a country that can produce 
               <br />
               men that even the enemy will name — nothing 
               <br />
               that can’t be cured. Scotland is turning her hand 
               <br />
               today towards making her homeland ﬁt for her 
               <br />
               “Ladies from Hell” to live in. What are we doing? 
               <br />
               I’m fairly, shall I say cosmopolitan, and in touch 
               <br />
               with the outside — and what do I ﬁnd? What is 
               <br />
               being done to make Newfoundland a ﬁt country 
               <br />
               for the “White Indians” of both wars? Why those

               of us who went through the hell of ’ 14 to ’ 18 and 
               <br />

               <br />
               what those “White Indians" who have come back 
               <br />
               have to go through, who know the restlessness of 
               <br />
               settling to a different life, because war with its 
               <br />

               ments of intense fear does something to you. Can

               we who understand war, who understand peace, 
               <br />
               men who are at the age when men are at their best 
               <br />
               in administrative positions, have no say at all? 
               <br />
               Because, in a world torn by an economic crisis 
               <br />
               the like this world had never experienced before, 
               <br />
               Great Britain stepped into the breach. We lost 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selfvgovemment,</span> but buoyed up with the hope 
               <br />
               that when the island was self-supporting, then 
               <br />
               self— government would be restored at the request 
               <br />
               of the people. Although Britain knew our resour- 
               <br />
               ces, our liabilities, she brought us in here in a 
               <br />

               putting in motion cumbersome expensive 
               <br />
               machinery after 14 years of political oblivion, 
               <br />
               beginning with a blackening of all statesmen and 
               <br />
               political institutions, forgetting that her own 
               <br />
               political history was not so bright. She never 
               <br />
               attained her position politically Without civil war.
