               Mr. Hollett Before putting the question, I

               would like to ask what exactly is meant by a

               <br />
               learned from that report are that we are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self-sup»</span>

               done an excellent job under the circumstances;

               <br />
               a pretty tough time. All of us here who are at- 
               <br />
               tempting to study Newfoundland have studied 
               <br />
               other documents besides the Chadwick-Jones 
               <br />
               report and if we are to receive it, I would suggest 
               <br />
               we ﬁle it away amongst other documents; put it 
               <br />
               up against some other documents, or some other 
               <br />

               motion to receive the Chadwick—Jones report, I 
               <br />
               would like to know what that motion means.

               Mr. Chairman It means nothing more than the

               formal reception of the report by the Convention. 
               <br />
               Heretofore it was laid merely on the individual

               tees are not getting replies to some questions 
               <br />
               asked the government departments, and that 
               <br />
               some departments have refused point blank to

               Mr. Chairman From what I understand, the 
               <br />
               government departments are working assiduous- 
               <br />
               ly on replies, and some questions have already 
               <br />
               been answered. In regard to others, all have gone 
               <br />
               to the various committees whose duty it is to 
               <br />
               investigate matters under question. I do not think 
               <br />
               it is true that any department has refused to give 
               <br />
               information.

               file asking for certain leases or timber rights on 
               <br />
               the Labrador. As regards timber rights, we were

               told by Mr. Turner or Mr. McLellan who repre- 
               <br />
