               Department Expenditures”. It took a question 
               <br />
               from Mr. Hollett to get some information on it. I 
               <br />
               have not seen the answer. Here is the position I 
               <br />
               take: the members of the Ottawa delegation 
               <br />
               looked at this $9 million, surely they should have 
               <br />
               asked about it. They took what they gave them 
               <br />
               and brought it home. That is the way it appears. 
               <br />
               We have asked the Ottawa delegation to give us 
               <br />
               some idea of what these expenditures would be, 
               <br />
               and through what particular channels the monies 
               <br />
               will be disbursed, but they have failed to give us 
               <br />
               any concrete answer. They do not know deﬁnite~ 
               <br />
               ly and can only surmise. Again I am forced to 
               <br />
               point out that nearly all the estimates contained 
               <br />
               in these Canadian proposals, given us through the 
               <br />
               efforts of the Ottawa delegation on behalf of the 
               <br />
               Commission government, are absolutely fic- 
               <br />
               titious and most unreliable. They are based on 
               <br />
               nothing concrete. The Ottawa delegation, 
               <br />
               through Mr. Smallwood, has admitted to this 
               <br />
               Convention that these estimates of both revenues 
               <br />
               and expenditures contained in the Grey Book 
               <br />
               were prepared by the federal government of 
               <br />
               Canada months before the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               delegation went to Canada.

               the truth. We will have a showdown on this. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I do recall a statement that 
               <br />
               something was prepared; but frankly, honestly, I

               <br />
               given to us by the Canadians was prepared long 
               <br />
               before we arrived. The ﬁrst public meeting was

               held that afternoon. They presented us with two

               asked the Canadian government to have these 
               <br />
               estimates prepared? On what supposition did the

               <br />

               perts to prepare these estimates at that time? Is it

               not conclusive proof, Mr. Chairman, that this

               facts of history, that it has been the policy of the

               Newfoundland into confederation? Is it not

               quently stated before: that if this is not the case,

               why has not the United Kingdom government 
               <br />
               carried out its solemn agreement made with the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland government in 1933? Lord Ad- 
               <br />
               dison refused to tell us when he was confronted 
               <br />
               with this matter in London last May. Is it a case 
               <br />
               of the British government treating its sacred 
               <br />
               pledges to one of her own dominions as just 
               <br />
               merely another scrap of paper? If that is not so, 
               <br />
               then will someone tell me why this particular 
               <br />
               agreement has not been carried out? I appeal to 
               <br />
               His Excellency the Governor to come out and tell 
               <br />
               the people of Newfoundland why His Majesty’s 
               <br />
               Government in the United Kingdom has failed to 
               <br />
               keep its promise to the Newfoundland people. In 
               <br />
               that agreement there was no mention made of 
               <br />
               confederation with Canada, conventions or pleb-
