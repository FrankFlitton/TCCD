               in the Committee on Rules and Procedure, my 
               <br />
               understanding is that the general principle is that 
               <br />
               all information that they produce to the Conven- 
               <br />

               <br />
               public character is public information, to be

               passed on by the Convention to the press and the 
               <br />
               public, with exceptions. There might be oc- 
               <br />
               casions, we do not know what they might be, 
               <br />

               <br />
               give information on certain subjects. But, given 
               <br />
               these exceptions, all information which commis— 
               <br />
               sioners or public servants deliver to the Conven-

               <br />
               my understanding of the matter. I was one of 
               <br />

               Mr. Crosbie I would like to say that with regard

               <br />
               should be any exceptions. We are here to get facts 
               <br />
               and information, and quite often during the last

               ten years we have heard, “It is not in the public 
               <br />

               <br />

               report which he said was secret, and not yet 
               <br />

               situation still in process of negotiation, and yet

               these negotiations could be dragged on for

               months. They might be prepared to give us that

               information if we did not immediately hand it 
               <br />
               over to the public. If the principle is established

               tion coming before this Convention should come 
               <br />
               before the Newfoundland public. I feel so deeply 
               <br />
               on it that I have come to this conclusion, that if 
               <br />
               things are right and the public of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               gets everything that we get, then before we make 
               <br />
               our report to the public, it, having the same 
               <br />
               evidence will have come to the same conclusions, 
               <br />
               and made up its mind for itself. That can be done 
               <br />
               only if the Newfoundland people get the infor- 
               <br />
               mation that we get. In spite of that there may be 
               <br />
               occasions when that principle might have to be 
               <br />
               waived in the interests of getting information.

               Of necessity the views of the negotiating party on 
               <br />
               the other side might have to be considered. Take 
               <br />
               some public promotion planning the utilisation of 
               <br />
               public resources, in which the government of the 
               <br />
               day is negotiating with some outside concern to 
               <br />
               develop these resources. I can imagine a situation 
               <br />
               where the promoter on the other side says, “No, 
               <br />
               i want these discussions secret and confidential

               <br />
               take into consideration not only the views but the 
               <br />
               directives on the other side, for instance the ques-

               government might be willing indeed to take the
