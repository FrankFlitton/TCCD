               THECONVENTION DEBATES were both recorded electronically and taken down by stenographers. For 
               <br />
               this edition we have used the stenographic record, which is located in the Provincial Archives of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland and Labrador (PANL, series GN 2/10). Our first task was to calendar the transcripts 
               <br />
               in order to ascertain how complete the collection was. We discovered some substantial gaps, which 
               <br />
               were ﬁlled from a variety of sources. Several days’ transcript was found in the LR. Smallwood papers, 
               <br />
               located in Memorial University’s Centre for Newfoundland Studies. Other gaps were ﬁlled from 
               <br />
               newspaper reports or from the electronic recording made by the Broadcasting Corporation of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. Copies of these tapes can be found in PANL, and in the National Archives of Canada. 
               <br />
               Except where indicated in the text, readers should assume that we have used the stenographic record. 
               <br />

               This is not a verbatim transcript of the debates. The stenographers did some editing of their own, 
               <br />
               removing (or ignoring) many false starts, unfinished sentences, and a certain amount of repetition. 
               <br />
               This is clear when their version is compared with the recording. We have continued this process in 
               <br />
               order to make the speeches wherever possible both readable and comprehensible. The result is that 
               <br />
               the speeches as given here read better and more smoothly than the originals. In a few instances, we 
               <br />
               have created lucidity out of considerable muddle. Where the meaning could not be divined, we 
               <br />
               dropped the passage altogether. Readers who want a stronger taste of the original should consult those 
               <br />
               debates which are taken from the recordings. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Apart from the few incomprehensible passages, we have further abridged the debates by omitting 
               <br />
               private and informal sessions, removing all procedural debate, except where relevant and signiﬁcant 
               <br />
               to the overall history of the Convention, and most procedural formalities, such as calling the 
               <br />
               Convention to order and motions to adjourn. Some of the more prolix speakers have had their speeches 
               <br />
               shortened by the removal of repetitions and circumlocutions. In a few instances, speeches or parts of 
               <br />
               speeches have been summarised. Deletions are indicated in the usual way by ellipsis points. Readers 
               <br />
               should note, however, that three ellipsis points at the end of a speech mean that the speaker was 
               <br />
               interrupted. We have imposed a consistent system of spelling, capitalisation and punctuation.

               The other materials printed here have been very lightly edited, and were taken from originals in 
               <br />
               PANL, the Centre for Newfoundland Studies, and the Provincial Reference Library. The only major 
               <br />
               change in the committee reports was to consolidate and simplify some of the statistical tables.

               The glaring omission from this collection is the full report of the Ottawa delegation, and the 
               <br />
               documentation surrounding its talks with the Canadian government during the summer of 1947. To 
               <br />
               have included a representative sampling of this material would have made up a third volume, and we 
               <br />
               therefore decided to include here only the draft terms of union discussed in the Convention -— the 
               <br />
               so-called “Grey Book”. The other part of the delegation’s report, known as the “Black Book”, 
               <br />
               contained a summary of the Ottawa talks, followed by the original documents submitted by each side, 
               <br />
               a compendium of information about the Canadian federal system and answers to questions presented 
               <br />
               by the delegates. Part of this report, as well as some of the minutes and memoranda generated by the

               talks, can be found in the second volume of Paul Bridle <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(6d,),</span> Documents on Relations between
