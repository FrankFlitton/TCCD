               I notice that the Economic Report does not 
               <br />
               mention the serious Labrador fishery. The failure 
               <br />
               of that ﬁshery will bear hardly upon quite a few 
               <br />
               Newfoundland ﬁshermen this year. This is an 
               <br />
               important industry, the Labrador ﬁshery. It has 
               <br />
               been said that it is uneconomic. I do not hold 
               <br />
               that view. No matter what fishery you have, there 
               <br />
               will be years when there are plenty of ﬁsh and 
               <br />
               there will be hard, lean years as well. Unfor- 
               <br />
               tunately we have not been able to work out yet a 
               <br />
               plan whereby in years of plenty the surplus would 
               <br />
               be able to take care of the lean years. I believe 
               <br />
               that the time will have to come when either 
               <br />
               through social legislation or some scheme 
               <br />
               some plan will have to be evolved whereby the 
               <br />
               decline of the fishery with its consequent 
               <br />
               hardship upon those who are engaged at the time, 
               <br />
               would have to be worked out for the beneﬁt of 
               <br />
               the people concerned and also for the beneﬁt of 
               <br />
               the country. I do not know how the government 
               <br />
               would go about it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~—</span> probably the Fisheries 
               <br />
               Board might have some ideas. I feel that some- 
               <br />
               thing special should be done this year for the 
               <br />
               people who have come back from the Labrador 
               <br />
               without their usual voyages... Clearly, if our 
               <br />
               economy is going to be builton solid foundations, 
               <br />
               some such plan should be evolved to take care of 
               <br />
               years such as this year. These men do not want 
               <br />
               dole. They do not want relief. I do not think the 
               <br />
               report speaks very much about relief, but I am 
               <br />
               informed that in September month in the city of 
               <br />
               St. John’s, 314 families got relief at a cost of 
               <br />
               $7,873; in the outports, 401 families at a cost of 
               <br />
               $1,102. That was in September. I feel sure that 
               <br />
               there are sections that probably very soon will 
               <br />
               need some relief. My idea would be to work out 
               <br />
               a plan different from giving relief — something 
               <br />
               so that these men would be able to provide them-

               <br />
               selves with twine and other essential necessities, 
               <br />
               so that their fishery could be carried on next year 
               <br />
               in the accustomed fashion. It is to the producers 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland that we as a country must look. 
               <br />
               These are the men who wrest from the sea and 
               <br />
               from the forest and from the land, the wealth of 
               <br />
               land and sea, and with the surplus that the govern- 
               <br />
               ment has in hand today, I think they might well 
               <br />
               provide a fund to look after these people... I am 
               <br />
               sure that any money spent in helping these people 
               <br />
               would be money well <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">spent,</span> With the surplus the 
               <br />
               government has on hand a considerable easing of 
               <br />
               taxation should be given and, as I said before, this 
               <br />
               would offset the rise in the cost of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">living.</span> I speak 
               <br />
               as a representative of the outports, and our stand- 
               <br />
               ards of living in the outports are different from 
               <br />
               the standards in St. John’s. I know we cannot 
               <br />
               expect all the amenities of city life, but there are 
               <br />
               so many things in the outports that people have 
               <br />
               to do without, that we see, or think we see, a great 
               <br />
               difference between the two ~— between the out— 
               <br />
               ports and the city.

               The people, who are today being taxed to 
               <br />
               provide the revenues, are asking when relief from 
               <br />
               taxation will be forthcoming... What is the use 
               <br />
               of piling up huge surpluses, while the govem- 
               <br />
               ment has to give out relief? We want to know

               where the people of Newfoundland, who are the 
               <br />
               producers, where they are going to balance their 
               <br />
               budgets. It is all very well to say the government 
               <br />
               should balance its budget. If the govemmentdoes 
               <br />
               not balance its budget it has to resort to loans, but 
               <br />
               the ordinary John Citizen has a budget to balance, 
               <br />

               Though dependent on the ﬁsheries, we are

               also dependent upon the forests and other 
               <br />
               natural assets and resources. The question arises 
               <br />
               as to where we are going to get the capital to 
               <br />
               develop our natural resources. If we do not have 
               <br />
               the capital here, we must try to get it outside, and 
               <br />
               in the past we have depended very much upon the 
               <br />
               scientific experience of outsiders, to come in and 
               <br />
               help develop our resources. By our dependence

               our own men are being trained, so much so that
