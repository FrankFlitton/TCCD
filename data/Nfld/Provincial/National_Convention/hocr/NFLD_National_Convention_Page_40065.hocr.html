               <br />

               treasury? In 1942—43 the government borrowed 
               <br />
               $1 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘5</span> million; from 1940-41 up to the end of 1945, 
               <br />
               $3 million was invested in war savings certiﬁ- 
               <br />
               cates with interest at 3% per annum. $8.5 million 
               <br />
               was borrowed altogether. We did not have to 
               <br />
               borrow that money. What was the idea of borrow- 
               <br />
               ing that money? 
               <br />
               Mr. Wild I would like to point out that the 
               <br />
               surplus at the end of March, 1946, was $28.5 
               <br />
               million; since then we have set aside $3 million 
               <br />
               for the redemption of two sterling loans, which 
               <br />
               leaves us a surplus of $25 million. At the moment 
               <br />
               the revenue from April I, 1946, is considerably 
               <br />
               in excess of expenditure; but that surplus at the 
               <br />
               moment is no indication that increases will be 
               <br />
               continuous. Revenue comes in more quickly 
               <br />
               from income tax in the ﬁrst two months of the 
               <br />
               year. It is not a clear indication of the ultimate 
               <br />
               picture. For instance, we budgeted for a deﬁcit 
               <br />
               this year on account of reconstruction expendi- 
               <br />
               ture. Major Cashin’s question was mainly why 
               <br />
               did the government do a certain thing? I do not 
               <br />
               know that it is the intention of the committee that 
               <br />
               the reasons why should be investigated. There are 
               <br />
               certain answers that I could give, but on general 
               <br />
               principle, I would say that your main intention is 
               <br />
               to get the position as it was some years ago. If one 
               <br />
               is to give reasons for every action, I am afraid we 
               <br />
               shall not get very far. I make that as a matter of 
               <br />
               principle. Actually, there were very good 
               <br />
               grounds for the loans we raised during the war. 
               <br />
               The main reason was anti-inﬂation. It was not 
               <br />
               that we wanted money; we didn’t. The question 
               <br />
               was what to do with it when we had it. IfI had 
               <br />
               been able to dispose of the money, I would have 
               <br />
               gone out for bigger borrowing. We had the War 
               <br />
               Savings Committee most of the members were 
               <br />
               residents of St. John’s, but there were also out- 
               <br />
               port members —— we had a committee which used 
               <br />
               to give us advice before borrowing. It was largely 
               <br />
               for the purpose of encouraging thrift, and it had 
               <br />
               been done to a greater extent in other countries. 
               <br />
               What we did was the best thing. We borrowed in 
               <br />
