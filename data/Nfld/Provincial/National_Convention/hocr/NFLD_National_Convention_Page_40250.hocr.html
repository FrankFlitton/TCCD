               Mr. Harrington On page 2, where it says 
               <br />
               “Committees are entitled to grants....”, is that 
               <br />
               grant made annually?.... 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Well, Mr. Chairman, that is the 
               <br />
               amount they give. The experience thatI have had 
               <br />
               with the local road committees leads me to think 
               <br />
               that, although $25 per mile, or 25 cents per head 
               <br />
               of the population, is what the government offi— 
               <br />
               cially says it is prepared to grant to local road 
               <br />
               committees, actually they do grant quite a bit 
               <br />
               more than that. So far as I can learn, if the 
               <br />
               people of a locality show a genuine interest in 
               <br />
               their own local road problem, and in a way that 
               <br />
               the government likes, i.e., by setting up a local 
               <br />
               road board and showing a deﬁnite desire and 
               <br />
               intention to push ahead with local co-operation, 
               <br />
               then in that case, although $25 per mile or 25 
               <br />
               cents per head is the rule, actually the government 
               <br />
               treats them much more generously. For example, 
               <br />
               if Mr. Harrington will look further down on the 
               <br />
               last page1 it says that the total value of the repair 
               <br />
               program for local roads and bridges authorised to 
               <br />
               be performed during last year, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">194546,</span> was 
               <br />
               $179,000. Of this amount the Department of 
               <br />
               Public Works assumed liability for $ 109,000, the 
               <br />
               balance, that is $70,000, being put up by the 
               <br />
               people either in cash or with free labour. In other 
               <br />
               words $109,000 from the government and 
               <br />
               $70,000 from the people in cash or labour. 
               <br />
               Now, at the beginning of the scheme, I under- 
               <br />
               stand the agreement was that the government 
               <br />
               would match the people’s money or labour value 
               <br />
               dollar for dollar, but in actual fact they are doing 
               <br />
               much better than that. Then again of course, as 
               <br />
               Mr. Harrington will appreciate, if a local road 
               <br />
               committee is formed it is only because the condi- 
               <br />
               tion of the local roads in a settlement has become 
               <br />
               so bad that the people in desperation get together, 
               <br />
               either led by one of themselves or an ofﬁcial, and 
               <br />
               form a local road committee. When you get a 
               <br />
               committee formed in that way you get a certain 
               <br />
               enthusiasm which results in much better value 
               <br />
               being gotten for the work done than if it were a 
               <br />
               straight out-and~out government project, with the 
               <br />
               government footing all the bills, hiring men and 
               <br />
               paying them wages. So that it’s not quite as bad 
               <br />
               as it sounds. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Butt I might say $25 a mile is given each 
               <br />
               year provided the committee wants to carry that 
               <br />

               <br />
               means that $50 is spent on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">road.</span> If they spend 
               <br />
               the same amount next yearthey may do so, so that 
               <br />
               over a few years the amount spent on that mile of 
               <br />
               road is much more than $25. When those com- 
               <br />
               mittees are formed, it is probably for a number of 
               <br />
               reasons, but one is that when a man sits in an 
               <br />
               office in St. John’s, and a community applies for 
               <br />
               a grant, obviously that man cannot answer each 
               <br />
               individual in the community; but if there is a 
               <br />
               representative committee, then the man here 
               <br />
               knows he is dealing with a responsible group of 
               <br />
               people who have taken up the matter already with 
               <br />
               the magistrate or roads superintendent, or some- 
               <br />
               one of that kind.

               Mr. Jones How is that 25 cents per head basis

               applied to the tOWn councils and their special 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood I would like the answer to that 
               <br />
               question... I am sure Mr. Butt could answer it. 
               <br />
               Mr. Butt I drink that as far as town councils are 
               <br />
               concerned it is a matter of dollar for dollar. It may 
               <br />
               be $25 per mile, but it may be very much more. 
               <br />
               For instance, a small community has a small 
               <br />
               piece of road, which having $50 per mile per year 
               <br />
               spent on it would be kept in fairly decent shape, 
               <br />
               but if there is in that community a large bridge 
               <br />
               which requires special attention, then the govern- 
               <br />
               ment is prepared, as I remember it, to give very
