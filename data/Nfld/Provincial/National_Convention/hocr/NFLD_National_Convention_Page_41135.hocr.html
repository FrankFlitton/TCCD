               Mr. Cashin Mr. Chairman, when I concluded 
               <br />
               my remarks yesterday afternoon I was about to 
               <br />
               begin the breaking down of Mr. Smallwood’s 
               <br />
               proposed budget. But this afternoon, before I go 
               <br />
               into it any furtherI must crave the indulgence of 
               <br />
               the House and go back a little, and I don‘t think 
               <br />
               it will be tedious repetition, but additional infor- 
               <br />
               mation. I now refer to the general sales tax which 
               <br />
               the Canadian government says they will collect 
               <br />
               in amount of $4 million in Newfoundland should 
               <br />
               we become a province. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I think I showed yesterday conclusively that, 
               <br />
               by the application of a method which they them- 
               <br />
               selves applied here the other day in answer to a 
               <br />
               question, instead of $4 million they would collect 
               <br />
               $8 million. The simple reason is that in 1946—47 
               <br />
               the Canadian federal government collected $328 
               <br />
               million in general sales tax, that is 8%, and work— 
               <br />
               ing it out on a per capita basis it means $25 a head 
               <br />
               for every man, woman and child in Canada; 
               <br />
               applying the same yardstick in Newfoundland, it 
               <br />
               would mean $8 million here. Now, sir, in speak- 
               <br />
               ing of these taxes, my attention has been drawn 
               <br />
               to a small pamphlet which probably contains all 
               <br />
               the information that is in the Black Book and only 
               <br />
               costs 25 cents, whilst our two Black Books and 
               <br />
               the Grey Book cost nearly $30,000. If you will 
               <br />
               turn to page 16 of this book you will ﬁnd “Quick 
               <br />
               Canadian Facts”, and under the section “Hidden 
               <br />
               Taxes" you will see this:

               In addition to personal income tax,

               Canadians pay a number of indirect or

               ‘hidden’ taxes in their normal purchases of 
               <br />
               consumer goods. A pair of shoes, for ex- 
               <br />
