               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood In line with Mr. Butt, my point 
               <br />
               is not that the public would condemn us for not 
               <br />
               meeting daily, they would just lose interest. Now 
               <br />
               on a given night 200,000 people, let us assume, 
               <br />
               are listening in. On that one occasion, in one 
               <br />
               sentence or two, it is said in a broadcast that the 
               <br />
               Convention has adjourned to go into committee 
               <br />
               work. I will agree that if that were said each night 
               <br />
               for a week on the air that fact would then become 
               <br />
               public property in Newfoundland. I am sure that 
               <br />
               my friend Mr. Harrington will agree on that. You 
               <br />
               have got to say the same thing in a number of 
               <br />
               ways at least ﬁve times over that many days 
               <br />
               before it becomes public property. I am afraid 
               <br />
               that the reaction would be, “What’s happened to 
               <br />
               the Convention? I have not heard a word from 
               <br />
               them for some days.” The fact that they divided 
               <br />
               into nine committees, and that they are working 
               <br />
               like nailers to get certain information would not 
               <br />
               be appreciated. My point was not as to whether 
               <br />
               the constituents would blame us or not, my fear 
               <br />
               is that they will not even know that we have 
               <br />
               adjourned or why, and they will think we are 
               <br />
               trying to stretch it out as long as possible. Already 
               <br />
               lots of people have said, “Oh they meet at 3 
               <br />
               o’clock and adjourn at 5 o’clock — $15 gone to 
               <br />
               wing!” They don’t know how we are working . 
               <br />
               that does not make good copy for our friends in 
               <br />
               the press box, and the bare fact that there was a 
               <br />
               committee meeting is not copy at all....

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Brown Mr. Chairman, what is the radio and 
               <br />
               the press for? Surely, the press and the radio can 
               <br />
               inform the general public what is happening. 
               <br />
               Well, if the general public don’t want us to get 
               <br />
               the information that we are seeking today and 
               <br />
               going to seek, how can we reach any decision in 
               <br />
               this Convention? Surely there must be a time for 
               <br />
               the obtaining of this information, and we can’t 
               <br />
               get that information and have this house sit every 
               <br />
               day. Some of us have been sitting on some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com»</span> 
               <br />
               mittee every day, except Sunday, up to the 
               <br />
               present time, and I don’t see how this House can 
               <br />
               sit daily and obtain the information we want to 
               <br />
               give the general public. I think this is only 
               <br />
               prolonging the debate and losing time discussing 
               <br />
               the matter. As far as what my friend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Small- 
               <br />
               wood says about us getting $15 a day, there will

               newspaper men and radio men present have

               enough copy to make them say more than one line
