               collect approximately $500,000 annually from 
               <br />

               However, it will be seen that, for the first three 
               <br />
               years, when we add this $3.5 million annual 
               <br />
               transitional grant to our revenue as outlined 
               <br />
               above, we will have a deﬁcit of over $6 million 
               <br />
               each year; that consequently after the third year, 
               <br />
               this deﬁcit will increase by $350,000 annually. 
               <br />
               These deficits for the ﬁrst three years will be met 
               <br />
               in part, no doubt, by the application of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one</span> 
               <br />
               third of surplus which is to be set aside in trust as 
               <br />
               outlined in the Grey Book, section 9, sub~section 
               <br />
               (1)l — unless extra taxation is imposed on the 
               <br />
               people. Let us see what this will mean in the 
               <br />
               period of eight years which Mr. Smallwood has 
               <br />
               estimated his forecast to cover. It works out as 
               <br />
               follows: eight years’ revenues, as already 
               <br />
               referred to, will amount to $77,376,000. in addi~ 
               <br />
               tion, we will receive an amount of $22,750,000 
               <br />
               in transitional grants from the federal govern— 
               <br />
               ment, making a total, in all, of $100,126,000. 
               <br />
               Now, if we take eight years of expenditures in 
               <br />
               administration of the affairs of the province and 
               <br />
               at the rate of not less than $19.5 million, it will 
               <br />
               amount to $156 million or a deficit of nearly $56 
               <br />
               million. This deﬁcit will be met from the $10 
               <br />
               million trust fund set up at the beginning of union, 
               <br />
               whilst additional taxation of $46 million will 
               <br />
               have to be imposed on our people in the form of 
               <br />
               direct taxation in order to pay our accounts. 
               <br />
               However, Mr. Smallwood in introducing his 
               <br />
               so-called budget uied to avoid, and did avoid any 
               <br />
               reference to the introduction of any new taxation. 
               <br />
               He pointed out that the repayment of our loans to 
               <br />
               Britain would go against these deﬁcits, butI want 
               <br />
               to point out that the repayment of these loans and 
               <br />
               the application of any other outstanding loans is 
               <br />
               not revenue, and it has not been devoted towards 
               <br />
               the repayment of loans which they borrowed, but 
               <br />
               it has been stuck in as revenue to bolster up the 
               <br />
               budget. When Mr. Hickman took Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               to task for including the repayment of the Hous- 
               <br />
               ing Corporation advances and other advances 
               <br />
               outstanding since they were not regular revenue, 
               <br />
               and should not be shown as such, Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               replied by pointing out in so many words to Mr. 
               <br />
               Hickman, that whilst he was a good businessman, 
               <br />
               he did not understand public ﬁnance, and that the 
               <br />
               repayment of such loans would and should be 
               <br />
               considered as revenue. I want to tell Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood that he does not know what he is 
               <br />
               talking about —— that he himself has had no ex-
