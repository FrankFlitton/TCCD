               That seems very good in a way, but the trouble 
               <br />
               was that that was started in 1936. In 1937 the 
               <br />
               department made a review of the units handled in 
               <br />
               every office, and again in 1938 and 1939. Then 
               <br />
               the war came, and from that day until now they 
               <br />
               have never made a review. Well, they did make 
               <br />
               a review in some cases if an outport postmaster 
               <br />
               wrote in complaining that the cost of living was 
               <br />
               going up and his wages were not going up. They 
               <br />
               would then review the units he handled for that 
               <br />
               year and base an increase in his pay on the in- 
               <br />
               crease in the units in his ofﬁce for that year 
               <br />
               alone... But the trouble was that between 1939 
               <br />
               and 1945 or 1946 there was a steady increase in 
               <br />
               the number of units handled, or business done, in 
               <br />
               the whole country and in each individual <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁce.</span> 
               <br />
               That great increase in business you have here on 
               <br />
               the first page of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">report.</span> For example there 
               <br />
               were nine million letters in 1938-39, and in 1945- 
               <br />
               46 there were 13 million letters. Just as the 
               <br />
               country’s business increased, so did that of each 
               <br />
               individual post ofﬁce. That was not taken into 
               <br />
               account, only the one particular year in which a 
               <br />
               man wrote in asking them for God’s sake to give 
               <br />
               him an extra dollar or two to keep him out of the 
               <br />
               poor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">house.</span> Now they have reviewed the whole 
               <br />
               business done in the whole period of the war, and 
               <br />
               they ﬁnd that the business in many places has 
               <br />
               increased <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">26%,</span> and on that general increase of 
               <br />
               the last four or ﬁve years they have computed the 
               <br />
               increase in salaries. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now don’t get excited about the increase, 
               <br />
               because the whole amount for all the outport 
               <br />
               offices is only up from $766,000 a year to 
               <br />
               $880,000. In other words, the total wage bill of 
               <br />
               the department is increased 15%. Now turn to

               <br />
               postmasters, the average increase is 12.5%, but 
               <br />
               the man who is getting $4.80 a week may not get 
               <br />
               anything like 12.5%; a post ofﬁce whose man is 
               <br />
               only getting that, is not doing so much business,

               only 12.5?Well I don’t know, because the system 
               <br />
               is too complicated, and 1 don’t know how they 
               <br />
               make it up. The actual increase in pay is 12.5%, 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Hollett There is not much 1 can say about 
               <br />
               this report. I assume that the members of the 
               <br />
               Committee were satisfied by the Secretary’s 
               <br />
               report that this thing is so dilapidated it has to be 
               <br />
               scrapped and that it will cost another $500,000 to 
               <br />
               replace it. At least that is the impression they give 
               <br />
               in the report. It seems to me that the scale of 
               <br />
               wages is out of date. I suggest that the Depart- 
               <br />
               ment of Posts and Telegraphs think up some new 
               <br />
               scheme whereby those 880 employees could be 
               <br />
               better paid. 1 had a considerable amount to do 
               <br />
               with postal telegraph offices in the outports, and 
               <br />
               I know the scandalous wages paid in the past. I 
               <br />
               had thought that since the war started, they were 
               <br />
               getting something on which to keep body and 
               <br />
               soul together. 1 see in this report that only a few 
               <br />
               in head office can possibly live on what they are 
               <br />
               getting, unless they steal it. Unfortunately, I do 
               <br />
               know that postal clerks have had to steal in order 
               <br />
               to live. Two or three of them came before my 
               <br />
               notice. I know one in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">particular,</span> a case where a 
               <br />
               man had a wife and four children and he was 
               <br />
               getting $25 a month. There are several cases like 
               <br />
               that — where clerks have defaulted only, I say, 
               <br />
               by reason of the fact that they have had such 
               <br />
               miserably poor pay. If a man has a wife and four 
               <br />
               children, I do not see how the postal telegraphs 
               <br />
               can keep him in an ofﬁce where the system can 
               <br />
               pay only $25 a month on which to live ~— or on 
               <br />
               which to die. We have only to look at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">record</span> 
               <br />
               of 534 postmasters, 356 are receiving salaries 
               <br />
               under $500 a year, or under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$9.61</span> a week. Over 
               <br />
               half the total number of postmasters receive 
               <br />
               salaries (God save the term!) of under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$4.80</span> a 
               <br />
               week. It is about time to review the salaries of the 
               <br />
               outport postal ofﬁcials. If 1 were head of that 
               <br />
               department I would not take credit for any surplus 
               <br />
               when so many are receiving salaries of $4.80 a 
               <br />
               week. If that is not worse than slave days, 1 do not 
               <br />
               know what it is, and we are trying to raise the 
               <br />
               standard of living of our people! I do not blame 
               <br />
               this government only; all governments have been 
               <br />
               at fault in this respect. If the government can do
