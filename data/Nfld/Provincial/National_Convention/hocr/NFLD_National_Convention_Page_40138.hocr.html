               <br />
               dereliction of duty on our part to leave any 
               <br />
               avenue of information unexplored. And let me 
               <br />
               say this: that not only do I approve of the sending 
               <br />
               of this delegation to Canada, but that I am equally 
               <br />
               insistent that steps should be taken to obtain from 
               <br />
               the United Kingdom a statement as to what ﬁnan— 
               <br />
               cial and other assistance they would be prepared 
               <br />
               to offer us in case of need. I do not suggest that 
               <br />
               we should send a delegation to the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom. I do not think that is necessary. The 
               <br />
               United Kingdom government is the government 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland and we can communicate with 
               <br />
               them eitherthrough His Excellency the Governor 
               <br />

               United Kingdom should deem it proper that we 
               <br />
               should then send a delegation to England, by all 
               <br />
               means let us send that delegation; but I want it

               clearly understood that should any resolution to 
               <br />

               And now as to the timing of this delegation’s 
               <br />
               visit. There has been much nervousness and fear 
               <br />
               expressed over the prematurity of this resolution. 
               <br />
               Whether these fears arise out of lack of 
               <br />
               knowledge of the real situation, or out of a panic- 
               <br />
               stricken desire to exclude information about any 
               <br />
               form of government which might endanger the 
               <br />
               position of that form to which their closed minds 
               <br />
               cling with fanatical tenacity, I do not know. But 
               <br />
               it is clearly their desire to delay any examination 
               <br />
               of confederation facts for a considerable period. 
               <br />
               That attitude tends to create the impression that 
               <br />
               the appointmentof a delegation now would result 
               <br />
               in an immediate rush to Ottawa by such a delega- 
               <br />
               tion. If anything even remotely approaching a 
               <br />
               resemblance to such a proceeding exists in the 
               <br />
               mind of any delegate, the fact would not even be 
               <br />
               humorous. It would be deplorable Nothing is 
               <br />
               further from the truth. Conferences and discus— 
               <br />
               sions between governments and public bodies are 
               <br />
               not conducted in that way. Let us briefly review 
               <br />
               the probable course of procedure. The resolution, 
               <br />
               if adopted, would at once be sent to the Governor, 
               <br />
               or to the Commission of Government, who in turn 
               <br />
               would communicate with the Dominions Office. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
         </div>
         
         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_6" title="bbox 769 195 1307 1887">
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The latter would then get in touch with the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada. That government has 
               <br />
               already indicated in the House of Commons that 
               <br />
               it would be willing to meet a delegation of this 
               <br />
               Convention. In all probability, the Canadian 
               <br />
               government would either suggest a suitable time 
               <br />
               or enquire what date would be agreeable to us. 
               <br />
               Thus the timing of the delegation’s departure 
               <br />
               from Newfoundland would be delayed for a con- 
               <br />
               siderable period. Does anyone in this Convention 
               <br />
               imagine that any delegation of its members 
               <br />
               would have the temerity, or even the discourtesy 
               <br />
               to rush off to Ottawa at any time without ﬁrst 
               <br />
               advising this body? And is anyone here under the 
               <br />
               impression that any sane body of delegates would 
               <br />
               depart upon such a mission without much pre— 
               <br />
               vious preparation right here in St. John’s?
