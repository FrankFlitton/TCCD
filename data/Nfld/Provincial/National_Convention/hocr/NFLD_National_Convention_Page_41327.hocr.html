               Mr. Cranford Mr. Chairman, in 1934 when the 
               <br />
               Commission of Government took over the affairs 
               <br />
               of this country, a great many people, including 
               <br />
               myself, thought it was a move in the right direc- 
               <br />
               tion. We thought it would be like a father who 
               <br />
               saw that his children had gone astray, and had 
               <br />
               made a move to put things right. The people of 
               <br />
               this country today are greatly disappointed, or 
               <br />
               may I say disgusted to find that such was not the 
               <br />
               case. It was more like a group of people who 
               <br />
               would like to hold the reins of power <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forever.</span> In 
               <br />
               the light and knowledge of the actions of Com— 
               <br />
               mission of Government, and confirmed by this 
               <br />
               National Convention, every action of the Com- 
               <br />
               mission was to make the people of this country 
               <br />
               believe that we could remain solvent only under 
               <br />
               the form of Commission of Government, and that 
               <br />
               government only is honest enough to carry on the 
               <br />
               affairs of this country. That is as I see it, and I 
               <br />
               would like the people of this country to under- 
               <br />
               stand that I am not dictated to by any man, nor 
               <br />
               aml afﬁliated with any ﬁrth or corporation, either 
               <br />
               in business or politics.

               There never was a government that was in a 
               <br />
               better position to do what was best for this 
               <br />
               country than Commission of Government. They 
               <br />
               were under no obligation whatever to the voters; 
               <br />
               therefore there was no pressure that could be 
               <br />
               forced upon them, and no excuse they can give 
               <br />
               for not doing everything that was in the best 
               <br />
               interest of the country. What do we find? From 
               <br />
               1934 to 1939, the only difference between Com- 
               <br />
               mission of Government and responsible govem- 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               ment was that the British government recognised 
               <br />
               the Commission of Government, when they were 
               <br />
               not prepared to recognise responsible govem- 
               <br />
               ment. That is the only difference that I can see; 
               <br />
               they carried along on the same lines as all former 
               <br />
               governments, without any improvement 
               <br />
               whatever. They made no attempt to change our 
               <br />
               method of business to help the ﬁshermen and 
               <br />
               workers, but instead made it worse for them, and 
               <br />
               for the country in general. They put us further in 
               <br />
               debt. In 1939 the Commission of Government 
               <br />
               had a deﬁcit of $4,069,320 as compared with a 
               <br />
               deﬁcit of $1,528,525 in 1934 when they took 
               <br />
               over. I refer you to the Financial Report, pages 
               <br />
               20 and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">30.</span> It can be clearly seen that the Com- 
               <br />
               mission of Government did not handle our affairs 
               <br />
               any better than responsible government in the 
               <br />
               light of our ﬁnancial standing from 1934 to 1939. 
               <br />
               If there had been no world war, what would have 
               <br />
               happened? Would there be any Commission of 
               <br />
               Government to be bothered with today? So far as 
               <br />
               I am concerned I am going to consider the 
               <br />
               stewardship of this caretaker government in the 
               <br />
               light of their actions from 1934 to 1939. Since 
               <br />
               that time illiterate women would have run the 
               <br />
               affairs of this country just as well. For my part I 
               <br />
               cannot see one act of the Commission of Govem— 
               <br />
               ment that could be commendable.

               Mr. Chairman, permit me to make a few 
               <br />
               remarks in connection with just two acts of the 
               <br />
               Commission which, in my opinion, will give a 
               <br />
               fair illustration of all their acts. First, so-called 
               <br />
               free and compulsory education. I say “so-called” 
               <br />
               because there is a 60% duty on exercise books, 
               <br />
               scribblers, pencils, etc. imported into this 
               <br />
               country. Therefore the word “free” is absurd. 
               <br />
               “Inconsistency thou art a jewel!” Second, the 
               <br />
               spending of thousands of dollars preaching co- 
               <br />
               operation, and causing thousands of dollars to be 
               <br />
               lost by the same people that co-operatives would 
               <br />
               benefit. Mr. Chairman, I do not want to be 
               <br />
               misunderstood. I do not want people to think for 
               <br />
               one moment that I am against co-operation, but 
               <br />
               quite the contrary. What I want to point out is the 
               <br />
               inconsistency of the Commission of Govem— 
               <br />
               ment. Thousands of dollars were lost to the 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen and workers of this country by the 
               <br />
               creation of the government’s Supply Depart— 
               <br />
               ment, by killing the trade of the outport importer 
               <br />
               and uprooting the business that had taken them a 
               <br />
               lifetime to establish, and the ﬁshermen and 
               <br />
