               Mr. Hollett This matter of land settlement was 
               <br />
               started in the ﬁrst place as a measure of relief. 
               <br />
               People were taken from the seaport towns where 
               <br />
               they could not get fish, and if they did they could 
               <br />
               not sell it or get any price for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> It was not a case 
               <br />
               of putting a man on the land and expecting him 
               <br />
               to pay the whole amount back. The real complaint 
               <br />
               is that they took the ﬁsherman, who was not a 
               <br />
               farmer, and cleared some land and gave him some 
               <br />
               seed and he grew some vegetables. Then they 
               <br />
               said to him, “Now you are established”, and cast 
               <br />
               him out on the Open market to dispose of his own 
               <br />
               produce without any assistance whatever, and 
               <br />
               consequently he had no means of improving his 
               <br />
               existence. 1 am inclined to think that this agricul~ 
               <br />
               tural business, as far as Newfoundland is con- 
               <br />
               cerned, is as much a local industry as a factory. 
               <br />
               To that end I want to quote some figures which 
               <br />
               were not included in this report.

               Under the heading of plug tobacco, cut tobac- 
               <br />
               co and cigarettes, we find that the cost of the 
               <br />
               material imported to manufacture these articles 
               <br />
               last year was $1,109,571. The excise paid by the 
               <br />
               people who manufacture this amounted to 
               <br />
               $1,057,567. If that manufactured article had paid 
               <br />
               the regular rate of duty the government could 
               <br />
               have received $1,818,000, whereas they only 
               <br />
               received $1,807,000 in excise. You may call that 
               <br />
               a loss to the government of $1 1,000. There were 
               <br />
               engaged in the manufacture about 131 people, 
               <br />
               and the average wage paid was $2,250.29, which 
               <br />
               means of course that that is $533,323.60 gross 
               <br />
               coming in to the directors after all wages are paid. 
               <br />
               I grant there are other overheads which were not 
               <br />
               taken care of, but this means that the industry was 
               <br />
               protected to that extent.

               take it, but they could not get that much. It was 
               <br />
               easy for me to understand why some of these 
               <br />
               people were in distress, here they were with all 
               <br />
               those potatoes in the cellar and they could not sell

               <br />
               this country and being consumed. Here you have

               two local industries, one controlled by a very few

               good at least as far as this country is concerned, 
               <br />
               and can make $533,000 in profits. Here we have

               a settlement Brown‘s Arm, 1 don’t know how

               many are there (yes, 24 men) and the government 
               <br />
               had spent $133,000 to put them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there,</span> Don’t you 
               <br />
               think if they are going to talk protective tariffs 
               <br />
               that these men, on whom the people of this 
               <br />
               country had to spend $1,370,000 to rehabilitate, 
               <br />
               don’t you think they should be protected to the 
               <br />
               extent of making it possible for them to sell their 
               <br />
               products at a reasonable rate?.... We protect local 
               <br />
               industries which are handled by a very small 
               <br />
               number of people and we are sure that their 
               <br />
               employees shall be paid reasonable wages, and 
               <br />
               apparently we are sure that the shareholders will 
               <br />
               make a fair dividend. l have no objection to that 
               <br />
               but I do have objection to the government spend- 
               <br />
               ing $1,370,000 to rehabilitate men and then 
               <br />
               saying, “Here’s your land, and if you can sell your 
               <br />
               produce OK, ifnot we can’t do anything for you.” 
               <br />
               They should do something to make it possible for 
               <br />
               these people to make a fair living. Of course, as 
               <br />
               soon as the war came they went on the bases, and 
               <br />
               in some of the land settlements today the men are 
               <br />
               no more farmers now than they were when they
