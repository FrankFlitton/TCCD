               dollars spent there. I wonder if Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               would be good enough to tell us where he got this 
               <br />
               information and from whom? When it came to 
               <br />
               the question of the exact number of items com- 
               <br />
               prising the purchase by the government of the 
               <br />
               equipment at Gander this ﬁne detail was not 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">available,</span> Surely some sort of inventory was 
               <br />
               made and that self same inventory must now be 
               <br />
               in the possession of the Commission of Govern~ 
               <br />
               ment. Further, it appears to me that if Mr. Small- 
               <br />
               wood had taken the same pains to obtain this 
               <br />
               inventory as he did to get the ﬁgures of the tourist 
               <br />
               trade in Canada, this information would now be 
               <br />
               in our hands. The purpose of this Convention is 
               <br />
               to enquire into the position of this country, and 
               <br />
               no doubt by his figures he intends to show what 
               <br />
               the tourist trade will mean here. That depends on 
               <br />
               the future form of government we may have, as 
               <br />
               the Commission of Government, I understand, 
               <br />
               has already turned thumbs-down on the tourist 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trade,</span> However, Mr. Smallwood’s ﬁgures on the 
               <br />
               value of the tourist trade to Newfoundland <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1929'</span> 
               <br />
               1939 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> small in comparison with Canadian 
               <br />
               figures. I cannot understand why our Commis~ 
               <br />
               sion of Government turned down the aggressive 
               <br />
               policy to encourage this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trade,</span> Certainly an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex</span> 
               <br />
               planation should be forthcoming. It is a question 
               <br />
               of vital public importance. I feel hot under the 
               <br />
               collar when I am reminded of the Gander deal 
               <br />
               whereby the Commission saddled us with $1 
               <br />
               million a year operating cost and then turned 
               <br />
               down a profitable tourist trade. I can only come 
               <br />
               to one conclusion and that is that their only inter- 
               <br />
               est is to run us in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hole.</span> Perhaps we cannot 
               <br />
               expect the Dominions Office to display great 
               <br />
               interest in our welfare, but we should expect and 
               <br />
               demand from the Newfoundland representatives 
               <br />
               their sense of duty to the people of our country.

               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Fudge asks the question as

               <br />
               ﬁgures on tourism in Canada. We did not need to 
               <br />
               look for it; the Bank of Canada in one of its 
               <br />
               monthly circulars gives an article on that very 
               <br />
               topic, and the Tourist Board considered it part of 
               <br />
               their job to know the movement of tourism in
