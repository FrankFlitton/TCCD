               that statement, sir, I contend that you’re wrong. 
               <br />
               We went there representing not a subservient but 
               <br />
               a brave people, a ﬁnancially strong country, and 
               <br />
               a people capable of good government. That 
               <br />
               would be the general tone, I think, of the delega- 
               <br />
               tion which went to Ottawa and worked there for 
               <br />
               three months. We were led in that spirit by our 
               <br />
               Chairman, Mr. Bradley, when he made his two 
               <br />
               masterly replies to the addresses of welcome 
               <br />
               from Mr. Mackenzie King on the first meeting in 
               <br />
               his country club and the next morning when he 
               <br />
               made the ofﬁcial welcome speech. Mr. Bradley 
               <br />
               made two masterly replies to these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speeches.</span> I am 
               <br />
               told that they did not appear in our newspapers in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland If they didn’t, it’s just too bad. 
               <br />
               Those pieces should have appeared in our papers, 
               <br />
               and when the history of Newfoundland is written, 
               <br />
               they should be put into that history to give our 
               <br />
               people something like the Gettysburg address 
               <br />
               that is so respected by the people of America. 
               <br />
               That’s how I feel about these replies that Mr. 
               <br />
               Bradley made, and the spirit of them. He pointed 
               <br />
               out among other things in those replies that we 
               <br />
               were not a crippled people, and we did not come 
               <br />
               to Ottawa looking for economic crutches to lean 
               <br />
               upon, and other things along that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">line.1</span> That 
               <br />
               whole spirit was maintained through~out our dis- 
               <br />
               cussions. We weren’t a subservient people. We 
               <br />
               went there representing a bold, courageous 
               <br />
               people and tried to hold our end up as best we 
               <br />
               could. I think the Major is absolutely wrong, and 
               <br />
               I think he’s unfair. If he’d examine the facts I 
               <br />
               think that he would find that we did not do badly 
               <br />
               and that we did do a good job. Now sir, I don’t 
               <br />
               know if I have more time to continue. Do you 
               <br />
               want to be in till 6 o’clock? I think I’ll be ﬁnished

               Mr. Burry When the committee rose for the 
               <br />

               Major Cashin has made that the delegation went 
               <br />

               as I could see, that had no foundation whatever. 
               <br />
               I think it was altogether unfair that Major Cashin 
               <br />

               to the many, varied arguments made in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Con»</span> 
               <br />
               vention against the terms that we have here in the 
               <br />
               Grey Book. I think that this Ottawa delegation is 
               <br />
               acting the part of wisdom when it allowed Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood to reply to those who had spoken 
               <br />
               on the question. I think that it’s wise to do that, 
               <br />
               not only because he is in my estimation the most 
               <br />
               capable person of doing it, without casting a 
               <br />
               reflection on any other member of the delegation, 
               <br />
               but his doing it naturally limits and conserves 
               <br />
               time in this debate. But there is one matter that I 
               <br />
               would like to draw attention to. As we all know, 
               <br />
               Labrador has played a prominent part in these 
               <br />
               discussions and rightly so. It is an important part 
               <br />
               of our territory, made all the more important 
               <br />
               because of the great iron ore deposits already 
               <br />
               found there and the timber wealth that we know 
               <br />
               it possesses. But I have a feeling, sir, that some- 
               <br />
               times that importance is altogether warped out of 
               <br />
               shape when some member or members are trying 
               <br />
               to make a point and sometimes I feel that we 
               <br />
               are boosting a little too much in making claims 
               <br />
               for the great wealth of Labrador, as much as I feel 
               <br />
               that it is a value to this country and will be in the 
               <br />
               future. It has been said here that Labrador is so 
               <br />
               important that Canada is intending to get it at all 
               <br />
               costs, by hook or by crook. That I am not able to 
               <br />
               follow. My experience at Ottawa and what I 
               <br />
               know about the Canadian ambitions do not lead 
               <br />
               me to that conclusion. We all know that Canada 
               <br />
               has great vast territories to the west and to the 
               <br />
               north and it has great natural resources. The 
               <br />
               resources that we think of as ours in Labrador <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—«</span> 
               <br />
               the mineral wealth there, the iron ore <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that’s</span> found 
               <br />
               there —- one must remember that we only possess 
               <br />
               a part of it. When the Mining Committee brought 
               <br />
               in its report sometime last year we were able to 
               <br />
               say that the deposits were fairly equal. But I 
               <br />
               understand that that would not be true today, that 
               <br />
               the better part of the deposits of iron ore are being 
               <br />
               discovered on the Quebec side. But there are 
               <br />
               great deposits on our side also. I’m not so much 
               <br />
               afraid that we are going to lose the Labrador 
               <br />
               possession as some of the members seem to be.... 
               <br />
               I place my trust, sir, in the Privy Council and also
