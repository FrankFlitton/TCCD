               Mr. Smallwood I think what would likely hap- 
               <br />
               pen is this: we now have courts of justice, these 
               <br />
               courts are mainly magistrates courts around the 
               <br />
               island. Some of them are occupied by magistrates 
               <br />
               who happen to be lawyers. The tendency on the 
               <br />
               part of the provincial governments is to have as 
               <br />
               many county courts as possible, because the 
               <br />
               provincial government would not have to pay 
               <br />
               their salaries. They would try to push as many as 
               <br />
               possible on to the federal government. What 
               <br />
               would happen is, in certain districts where they 
               <br />
               have lawyers as magistrates, they would be con- 
               <br />
               stituted county courts; or if no lawyer, then the 
               <br />
               magistrate would be shifted to a district which 
               <br />
               would still be a magistrate’s district and a lawyer 
               <br />
               put in his place.
