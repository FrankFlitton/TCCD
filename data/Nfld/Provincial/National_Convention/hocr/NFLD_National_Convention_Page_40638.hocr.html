               Mr. Chairman Just a moment; I have some- 
               <br />
               thing to say. A good many of you here present ~— 
               <br />
               and I refer now, of course, to the members of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               “strangers" outside the bar — a good many of you 
               <br />
               will remember that when I was first approached 
               <br />
               to allow myself to be recommended for the posi- 
               <br />
               tion as Chairman, I refused point blank to do so. 
               <br />
               I had no desire whatever to be Chairman. I was 
               <br />
               not sent here for that purpose. I ﬁnally consented, 
               <br />
               and in doing so, I made it crystal clear that I had 
               <br />
               no intention of giving up my rights as an elected 
               <br />
               member. Whatever rights you have, I have. If you 
               <br />
               have a right to believe in this or that form of 
               <br />
               government, I have exactly the same right. If you 
               <br />
               have the right to express, either in private or in 
               <br />
               public. your beliefs or opinions about forms of 
               <br />
               government, I have exactly that same right. These 
               <br />
               facts I made perfectly plain from the outset. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Alv</span> 
               <br />
               though I was not present at the meeting at which 
               <br />
               I was recommended <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~—</span> unanimously, incidental— 
               <br />
               ly — to the government for the ofﬁce of Chair- 
               <br />
               man, I have it from good sources that it was made 
               <br />
               abundantly clear to you all that I would not accept 
               <br />
               your recommendation except upon the deﬁnite 
               <br />
               understanding that all my rights as an elected 
               <br />
               member were preserved to me in their entirety. 
               <br />
               That fact is made perfectly clear in the act which 
               <br />
               authorised my appointment. But, though I for- 
               <br />
               feited no rights when I became Chairman, I did 
               <br />
               take on additional and special duties. What were 
               <br />
               those duties? Simply these: that I would faithfully 
               <br />
               and impartially conduct the proceedings of the 
               <br />
