               <br />
               doubt whatever, and it is also true that New-

               foundland, at least in the official sense, is self-

               But just where and how has that promise of 
               <br />
               Britain been broken? Is there not to be a national

               <br />
               foundland to vote at that referendum? Will not 
               <br />
               responsible government be one of the forms for 
               <br />

               <br />
               majority, request a return of responsible govem- 
               <br />
               merit does anyone here suggest that Britain will 
               <br />
               refuse to carry out that wish? Where, I ask you, 
               <br />
               is the broken promise? What then is it that rouses 
               <br />
               the ire of these responsible govemmentites al- 
               <br />
               most to the pitch of frenzy? I will tell you. It is 
               <br />
               not that Britain has failed to carry out that 
               <br />
               promise of 1933, but that she has done more than 
               <br />
               honour what these people are pleased to term her 
               <br />
               bond. She has not only undertaken to give us back 
               <br />
               responsible government if we want it, but also to 
               <br />
               give us any other form of government (within 
               <br />
               reason, of course) which we may request.

               Let me put the position to you by a very simple 
               <br />
               illustration. Let us suppose a man takes his young 
               <br />
               son to a house which he, the father, owns, and 
               <br />
               says, “Son, when you are 21 years of age I will 
               <br />
               give you this house if you want it.” The boy 
               <br />
               reaches the age of 21, and the father now says to 
               <br />
               him, “Son, some years ago I promised you this 
               <br />
               house if you asked me for it when you became 
               <br />
               21. You are now 21, and I intend to keep my 
               <br />
               promise, but before you ask me for it I want to 
               <br />
               show you two other houses that I own.” There— 
               <br />
               upon he shows the young man these two other 
               <br />
               houses, and says, “Now you can have your choice 
               <br />
               of the three.” Has that man broken his promise to 
               <br />
               his son? He has not, he has enlarged it, he has 
               <br />
               extended it. In exactly the same way Britain has 
               <br />
               fulﬁlled her so~called bond to the people of New— 
               <br />
               foundland. She says to us, in effect, “You New- 
               <br />
               foundland people may have a return of 
               <br />
               responsible government if you want it, or if you 
               <br />
               prefer you may have Commission government, 
               <br />
               or confederation; or tell me what you do want and 
               <br />
               I will give you anything within reason.” Britain 
               <br />
               has given us more than she promised. And so we 
               <br />
               see that the real complaint of these followers of 
               <br />
               responsible government is not that Britain failed 
               <br />

               <br />
               pressed down and running over. She has given us 
               <br />
               more than she agreed to give, and it is that more 
               <br />
               to which the responsible govemmentites object. 
               <br />
               They don’t want anything but responsible 
               <br />
               government. “Give us what we had”, is their cry. 
               <br />
               In their hearts they want no Convention, no 
               <br />
               recommendations, no referendum, no choice for 
               <br />
               the people. In fact their real desire is to thrust a 
               <br />
               return of responsible government on the people, 
               <br />
               whether the people want it or not. They see in this 
               <br />
               free choice a grave danger that their own faith 
               <br />
               may be cast out. They stand in deadly fear that it 
               <br />
               will. These people who profess the democratic 
               <br />

               <br />
               dum by a resolution if they could, and thus wipe 
               <br />
               the people out of the picture, complain bitterly 
               <br />
               that Britain has broken her promise, and is false, 
               <br />
               and is not to be trusted, because she has given the 
               <br />
               people more than she agreed to give.

               Let us have no more of this stupid, and in some 
               <br />
               instances I fear, dishonest chatter about Britain 
               <br />
               having broken faith. Responsible government 
               <br />
               will be on the ballot. The people can, if they wish, 
               <br />
               request its restoration. And if they do it will be 
               <br />
               restored. And if anybody holds that confedera— 
               <br />
               tion should not be discussed, let him not blame 
               <br />
               the British government, nor the Commission 
               <br />
               government, nor the Canadian government. It 
               <br />
               was this Convention, I remind you, that voted 24 
               <br />

               <br />
               conditions of union. Let no one be blamed for 
               <br />
               what we did ourselves by a substantial majority. 
               <br />
               And even more fantastic is the misconception 
               <br />
               that has been stated again and again here and 
               <br />
               elsewhere, that we must get responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern~</span>

               ment before considering confederation at all.

               There are several points that are overlooked 
               <br />
               by those who repeat this absurd contention. First, 
               <br />
               what guarantee have we that the people will vote 
               <br />
               for responsible government? And yet they must, 
               <br />
               according to this contention, before confedera- 
               <br />
               tion can be considered at all. If a consideration of 
               <br />
               confederation is to be postponed until our people 
               <br />
               vote for responsible government, then it will be 
               <br />
               a very, very long day indeed before we come 
               <br />
               around to a consideration of it. And again, assum- 
               <br />
               in g that the people want confederation, will some 
               <br />
               one kindly explain to me just why they should be 
               <br />
               saddled with, why they should have forced upon 
               <br />
               them, a form of government which they don’t
