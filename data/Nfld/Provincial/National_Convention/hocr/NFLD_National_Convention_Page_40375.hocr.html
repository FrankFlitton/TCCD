               in a ﬁghting mood.... I realise I have said some 
               <br />
               things concerning these matters, but i meant them 
               <br />
               and I believe they were true and I have a right to 
               <br />
               stand up and express my opinion without having 
               <br />
               someone jump up and reﬂect on something I have

               With regard to this particular motion, you 
               <br />
               know I have repeatedly expressed the idea that 
               <br />
               we have no mandate whatever to go to Canada 
               <br />
               and look for terms, no mandate under the Con- 
               <br />
               vention Act. Before you take any drastic steps 
               <br />
               with regard to any change in the constitution, you 
               <br />
               must have the mandated power of the people 
               <br />
               behind you. You cannot sneak in the back door 
               <br />
               as this is an attempt to do. I have nothing against 
               <br />
               the Canadian people or government; I have no 
               <br />
               objections to going into confederation, when and 
               <br />
               only when our people have been given'an oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity to say definitely that that is what they want 
               <br />
               I must stand by that strongly. We are told by the 
               <br />
               Commission of Government we cannot talk fis- 
               <br />
               cal things; we cannot talk on economic matters; 
               <br />
               we cannot bring up politics. How can we possibly 
               <br />
               go to the Dominion of Canada to look for terms 
               <br />
               if you cannot talk ﬁscal things, economic matters 
               <br />
               or politics? Is the committee or government so 
               <br />
               anxious because they know they have some very 
               <br />
               attractive terms to lay before us? I fail to see what 
               <br />
               good can be derived by any approach to the 
               <br />
               Canadian government by a delegation from this 
               <br />
               Convention. The Department of External Affairs 
               <br />
               in Ottawa is the department with which a delega- 
               <br />
               tion would have to deal; I fail to see how they can 
               <br />
               possibly talk to a delegation from here if they 
               <br />
               cannot talk about the things pertaining to the very 
               <br />
               matter about which they are going to enquire. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               There are some who want these terms. They 
               <br />
               want to know what Canada is handing out. I 
               <br />
               maintain Canada is handing out nothing. The 
               <br />
               Canadian people and government are too shrewd 
               <br />
               to commit themselves to an absolutely un- 
               <br />
               authorised body like this with terms of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confederat</span> 
               <br />
               tion. I am quite sure any delegation sent from this 
               <br />
               Convention would be wasting its time unless and 
               <br />
               until they have, as I said before, the mandatory 
               <br />
               power of the people behind them. It is immaterial 
               <br />
               to me whether a delegation goes or not, because 
               <br />
               I am convinced they cannot submit final terms to 
               <br />
               this Convention. They may offer terms, broadly 
               <br />
               speaking. I was looking over the discussions of 
               <br />
               1895 when we had a delegation proceed to Ot-

               ldo not want the people to be fooled as in 1932 
               <br />
               when the then Prime Minister promised the 
               <br />
               people of this country that there would be no 
               <br />
               change made in the constitutional status until the 
               <br />
               matter was referred back to the people by way of 
               <br />
               a referendum. It was not, and this status which we 
               <br />
               have now slipped in the back door. I would not 
               <br />
               be surprised if here is not the same sort <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofthing.</span>

               This squandering of money is such that our

               surplus will not last six months, $40 million 
               <br />
               expenditure in this one year. How do we expect 
               <br />
               to have any government of any kind if the Com- 
               <br />
               mission is going to set that standard before our 
               <br />
               people? I pity any government that gets in after 
               <br />
               this government goes out — they will just be a 
               <br />
               clean-up government. I am against the motion on 
               <br />
               principle only. If we are going to deal with our 
               <br />
               country and talk about our country, we must do 
               <br />
               it by proper constitutional <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">means.</span> On any other 
               <br />
               basis you will fail miserably. I shall vote against

               Mr. Fudge There has been quite a lot said about 
               <br />
               “approach." I know something of this question. I 
               <br />
               came up the hard <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">way.</span> There is something I lack, 
               <br />
               but I have tried to make up for it in other ways. 
               <br />
               Some years ago I felt I could be of some assis— 
               <br />
               tance to my fellow men, and realising they had 
               <br />
               conﬁdence in me I took upon myself the respon- 
               <br />
               sibility of leading and helping the underdog. I am 
               <br />
               afraid if I was to take the attitude some members 
               <br />
               advocate, to go along to the employer and say 
               <br />
               “Yes, sir" and “No, sir”, I can assure you 1 would 
               <br />
               not have gotten very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">far.</span> Our people in New- 
               <br />
               foundland should be given a chance to earn their 
               <br />
               living. 1 have some people over on the other side 
               <br />
               in fact I visited some of the old folks in the years 
               <br />
               gone by. I feel that we should go to England 
               <br />
               because I realise that part of the assets belonging 
               <br />
               to this country is over there and it should be on - 
               <br />
               the stock sheet <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">here.</span> We are going to try and 
               <br />
               dicker with an outside concern. I am not at all 
               <br />
               satisﬁed until l am positive all the fittings and 
               <br />
               gear are aboard of this one. Therefore part of the 
               <br />
               ﬁttings belonging to this country is over there and 
               <br />
               I say we should surely see to it that all the gear 
               <br />
               comes back to this little ship before we decide to
