               Edward Island with respect to the advantages

               Mr. Bailey I think our debate yesterday was on 
               <br />
               the ferry and the train service, and the changeover 
               <br />
               from narrow gauge to broad gauge. I‘think that 
               <br />
               was brought in, on what could happen to us if we 
               <br />
               came into confederation with regard to our ferry 
               <br />

               <br />
               to ask you if you will please conﬁne your remarks

               <br />

               <br />
               for the rearrangement of certain taxing powers.
