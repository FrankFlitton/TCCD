               <br />
               yourself, no one else will help you. We had to 
               <br />
               help ourselves and not outsiders, We had no right 
               <br />
               to let them in here at all. And so it is that today, 
               <br />
               after 14 years, we sit here in these same legisla- 
               <br />

               once re-echoed to the voices of our illustrious

               men. Where we sit today the fervent oratory of 
               <br />
               our ancestors urged our people to eternally fight

               and battle for the protection of their democratic 
               <br />
               rights. It is a u'agic twist of fate that in this very

               place we should also sit, and have placed before 
               <br />
               us the strange question as to what form of govern-

               <br />
               any reasonable, any patriotic Newfoundlander 
               <br />
               could think of asking for either himself or his 
               <br />
               people.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               To understand how misguided such a question 
               <br />
               really is, just consider what would be the reaction 
               <br />
               if the same question were put today before the 
               <br />
               parliament of Great Britain or Canada or the 
               <br />
               USA, or for that matter any country, whether big 
               <br />
               or small, whose people know what it is to enjoy 
               <br />
               the priceless privileges of self-govemment. Do 
               <br />
               you think that any of them would consider the 
               <br />
               surrender of their liberties for the boon of any 
               <br />
               form of commission government? That they 
               <br />
               would think of giving a small group of strangers 
               <br />
               a free hand to do as they wish with their treasury 
               <br />
               and their territory? That has been done I have 
               <br />
               already pointed out that the Commission govern- 
               <br />
               ment gave away our territory. Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               said they were honest. Again I am reminded of 
               <br />
               the Labrador mining concession given out in 
               <br />
               1937, whereby certain concessions were given to 
               <br />
               the Labrador Mining Co., and for which New— 
               <br />
               foundland was to receive in return a royalty of ten 
               <br />
               cents a ton on ore when the mine came into 
               <br />
               production, but what happened? Two years ago 
               <br />
               this same company approached the government, 
               <br />
               and what happened? They cancelled this royalty 
               <br />
               and instead took an agreement to be paid 5% on 
               <br />
               the net proﬁts of a company that is going to cost 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$140450</span> million to go into production, and it 
               <br />
               will be years before there are any net proﬁts 
               <br />
               arrived at. What is that but dishonesty? 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Again, I pointed out here during the debate on

               wants to take me up on that I am prepared to meet 
               <br />
               them. The talk is too extravagant, too far-fetched,

               too ridiculous to even contemplate, and yet that 
               <br />
               is the crazy proposition which is put before us

               Can you imagine, Mr. Chairman, what our 
               <br />
               forefathers would have done in such a situation? 
               <br />
               They would have regarded the whole thing as a 
               <br />
               black insult to themselves and their country, and 
               <br />
               would have probably thrown it out of the window 
               <br />
               and those who proposed it after <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them,</span> These men 
               <br />
               are in the cemetery. We must face the facts as we 
               <br />
               find them, disagreeable though they be. We have 
               <br />
               to recognise that we are allowed to sit here at all 
               <br />
               only by the grace and permission of a dictatorship 
               <br />
               government, and consequently that we can only 
               <br />
               move and act to the extent and limits which our 
               <br />
               chains of bondage will allow us. So recognising 
               <br />
               these facts, we ﬁnd that we must include in our 
               <br />
               recommendation, not a form of government mind 
               <br />
               you, but forms.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               My ﬁrst reaction to such a proposition was that 
               <br />
               the terms of reference which contain such a 
               <br />
               stipulation were, and are, absolutely contrary to 
               <br />
               both the letter, spirit and substance of the agree- 
               <br />
               ment made between the government of this 
               <br />
               country and Great Britain in November, 1933. I 
               <br />
               regret to say that such a condition is an absolute 
               <br />
               violation of that contract, and of the laws <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern»</span> 
               <br />
               ing relations between two governments. The 
               <br />
               question has been asked here many times as to 
               <br />
               why the British government did not and does not 
               <br />
               carry out the contract which it made with our 
               <br />
               government in 1933; further, on what grounds we 
               <br />
               are supposed to ignore this solemn international 
               <br />
               pact and allow it to be kicked aside. That question 
               <br />
               has been asked but we are still waiting for the 
               <br />
               answer.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I directed that question the other day to His 
               <br />
               Excellency the Governor through the medium of 
               <br />
