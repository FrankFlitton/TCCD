               I would like to answer some of the points 
               <br />
               brought up in the debate yesterday afternoon and 
               <br />
               last night. Major Cashin asked about the amount 
               <br />
               given for special food orders. The department 
               <br />
               does not give the cost of those food orders per 
               <br />

               <br />
               merchants and they are issued on recommenda- 
               <br />
               tion of the doctor or nurse. The question was 
               <br />
               asked regarding cottage hospitals, whether a doc-

               <br />

               were the amounts different.
