               Mr. Bailey The Prince Edward Island people, 
               <br />
               like ourselves, are on an island. They have been 
               <br />
               paying freight rates over a number of years to the 
               <br />
               Canadian National Railway and also when it was 
               <br />
               a private service. They were paying for service 
               <br />
               they did not get. I can assure you that whatever 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island get, they got it through 
               <br />
               ﬁghting hard. I have been in their parliament. I 
               <br />
               was talking to their men. I have seen their ferries 
               <br />
               going out and the conditions they worked under. 
               <br />
               I am glad they got the service. They deserved it. 
               <br />
               After all, as they pointed out, they have to ship 
               <br />
               out a lot of potatoes and other vegetables. They 
               <br />
               had a very hard ﬁght. If they had the old type of 
               <br />
               service today, it would turn people against con- 
               <br />
               federation. They did not get it before. A $2 mil- 
               <br />
               lion vessel on that strait was not good enough for 
               <br />
               the job she had to do, especially a sea-train. l have 
               <br />
               been on a couple of them. The cost of construc- 
               <br />
               tion of the vessel was way above the ordinary 
               <br />
               class of vessel. They also had to bring along an 
               <br />
               icebreaker with it. They did not get any $2 million 
               <br />
               vessel in 1927, and very little in 1917.
