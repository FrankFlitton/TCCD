               I was thinking yesterday, as I looked at the end 
               <br />
               of this report, if it was only possible to locate a 
               <br />
               modern Witch of Endor who would raise up our 
               <br />
               leaders of the beginning of this century and put 
               <br />
               them in this chamber with a revenue of $40 
               <br />
               million, then they’d do something, they would 
               <br />
               build something, when we see what they built 
               <br />
               with the little they had. I must admit that if they 
               <br />
               did not plan well they built well, and had it been 
               <br />
               followed through the story of our island home 
               <br />
               would have been different today.... More could 
               <br />
               have been done during the past 50 years, but one 
               <br />
               thing we can be thankful for, we have the mis- 
               <br />
               takes of our leaders of the 1920s, l930s and 
               <br />
               19408 to guide us. Experience is a dear school and 
               <br />
               a hard teacher, and if we cannot learn there then 
               <br />
               nothing can teach us. We have a country that we 
               <br />
               can all be proud of, and one of which 1 am proud, 
               <br />
               although I have spent almost a lifetime going to 
               <br />
               and fro in this world. It has been and always will 
               <br />

               I believe all the debts we have accumulated

               <br />
               and can be made more so. I have gone through 
               <br />
               the different reports and have done work on two 
               <br />
               of them. I was a member of the Transportation

               Committee and that has been a revelation to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">me.</span> 
               <br />
               I don’t hold to be an expert. but since I made my

               ﬁrst trip around Cape Bauld in 1902, l have been 
               <br />
               actively engaged in ﬁshing and transportation, 
               <br />
               and a man should learn something about all this 
               <br />
               in 45 years, especially when I have made a study 
               <br />
               of those matters together with the trade of the 
               <br />

               I have gone into marine transportation as 
               <br />
               thoroughly as any layman can and while I’ll 
               <br />
               move over and make room for any man to find 
               <br />
               out, for example, why the railroad doesn't pay, I 
               <br />
               still believe I am capable of putting my ﬁnger on 
               <br />
               a lot of the money that in this one case has gone 
               <br />
               up in the air, through the authorities not being 
               <br />
               able to adjust themselves to change.

               Last week we had to listen to a tirade on why

               we shouldn’t have a mercantile marine because 
               <br />

               <br />
               first time I put this belief forward, then the cry 
               <br />
               from the street was that we could not operate 
               <br />
               ships as cheaply as the Greeks, the Norwegians, 
               <br />
               the Swedes and the Danes. I guess the US would 
               <br />
               have been a sorry country if they had said we 
               <br />
               cannot make tools or machinery as cheap as the 
               <br />
               British or the Germans, and got the latter to make 
               <br />
               the tools and machinery for them.

               Let me try and show you what the lack of a 
               <br />
               mercantile marine cost Newfoundland up to say 
               <br />
               1923. We did not feel it so much as in our local 
               <br />
               foreign-going ﬂeet, we had a fairly good freight~ 
               <br />
               carrying potentiality ~— but the picture after 1925, 
               <br />
               that’s something else again. First I’ll try to get to 
               <br />
               the root of the cry that we can’t carry freight as 
               <br />
               cheaply as other maritime countries. Ignorance 
               <br />
               had a lot to do with it. Let’s take the Railway ships 
               <br />
               and see where their dollars go up in the air. The 
               <br />
               Kyle, built around 1912, is a good example. That 
               <br />
               ship has cost the government of this country an 
               <br />
               average of $12 a ton for the 25 tons of coal she 
               <br />
               has burned daily. Give her 150 steaming days on 
               <br />
               average, every year of her 35 year lifetime, and 
               <br />
               the cost of coal is $1,575,000. Now had this ship 
               <br />
               been converted in 1930 her running cost would 
               <br />
               have been cut from $300 daily to $177, or a 
               <br />
               saving to the country in 17 years of $314,000. 
               <br />
               Then the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northern</span> Ranger, which consumes 18 
               <br />
               tons a day. This could have been cut in propor- 
               <br />
               tion. and so on with the other ships. And I‘m sure 
               <br />
               that those that were sold could have been put 
               <br />
               under diesel propulsion with a stupendous 
               <br />
               saving. The logical thing for the government, 
               <br />
               when it took over the Railway, was to have 
               <br />
               secured a diesel electric engineer and started a 
               <br />
               school at the dock shops. Today we would have 
               <br />
               a trained staff and the most modern and efﬁcient 
               <br />
               kind of transportation which in years would pay 
               <br />
               off. Instead of this, the only solution appears to 
               <br />
               be tojump up the ﬁshermen’s fares and freights. 
               <br />
               There wasn’t any need to sell the ships that were 
               <br />
               sold. Otherinterests bought them and put them in 
               <br />
               the trade and made them pay. Take the little 
               <br />
               Sagona. Foreign interests bought her, changed 
               <br />
               her to oil and the cost to them was $350,000. But 
               <br />
               she paid for herself in three trips in the banana 
               <br />
               trade, while all she had done here was lie up and 
               <br />
               rust for years. “We should not have a merchant 
               <br />
               marine,” says the critic, while the Brigus has
