               that no ofﬁcial report has been issued from any 
               <br />

               mentality has had any part in the preparation of 
               <br />

               <br />
               we Newfoundlanders did something about this, 
               <br />
               and prepared our own report <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> a Newfoundland

               affairs of our own country as some Englishmen 
               <br />
               thousands of miles away? Must we continue to 
               <br />
               meekly accept these biased and self-motivated

               In my estimation the famous Amulree Report 
               <br />
               is a publication whose sole and single aim was to 
               <br />
               pave the way and justify in advance an inex- 
               <br />
               cusable act of political sabotage which had al- 
               <br />
               ready been decided on. The Goodwill report and 
               <br />
               the Gorvin report were simply the usual valueiess 
               <br />
               impressions of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬂy—byvnight</span> transients, whose 
               <br />
               authors wrote their reports under the admonish- 
               <br />
               ing ﬁnger of their masters in Downing Street. The 
               <br />
               latest of these reports, that of June past, I have 
               <br />
               before me. It was obviously written for the en- 
               <br />
               lightenment and guidance of the delegates of this 
               <br />
               Convention, no doubt with the object of inﬂuenc- 
               <br />
               ing their thoughts and decisions. As usual, the 
               <br />
               authors are graduates of the Dominions Ofﬁce in 
               <br />
               London, their names being Messrs. Chadwick 
               <br />
               and Jones and as usual the report bears the im- 
               <br />
               primatur of that ofﬁce.

               <br />
               single criticism or one word of censure against 
               <br />
               those people or bodies at whose instigation they 
               <br />
               were making these reports. This is perhaps only 
               <br />
               to be expected and may be regarded as good 
               <br />
               politics, but it is certainly not honest politics. 
               <br />
               For the purpose of further illustrating what 1 
               <br />
               have said about these reports in general, I propose 
               <br />
               to quote a few extracts from this latest piece of 
               <br />
               Commission propaganda. The opening lines read 
               <br />
               as follows: “In 1933 ﬁnancial difﬁculties com- 
               <br />
               bined with the economic effects of a world-wide 
               <br />
               depression led the Newfoundland Government to 
               <br />
               approach the United Kingdom for assistance.” 
               <br />
               These are just the ﬁrst four lines of this report, 
               <br />
               but let us see how true a picture they represent. 1 
               <br />
               call your attention to the words, “ﬁnancial dif~ 
               <br />
               ﬁculties compelled us to ask for assistance.” It 
               <br />
               fails to explain that the real assistance we asked 
               <br />
               for was bluntly refused. That a gun was put to our 
               <br />
               heads, the demand that we ﬁrst commit political 
               <br />
               suicide before any assistance would be forthcom- 
               <br />
               ing. The report also conveniently fails to state the 
               <br />
               simple facts: that we would never have been in 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial difﬁculties at all, but for the extraordi- 
               <br />
               nary sacriﬁces made by our, what they term back- 
               <br />
               ward people and corrupt politicians, when they 
               <br />
               voluntarily sacriﬁced our national credit to the 
               <br />
               tune of $40 million as our contribution towards 
               <br />
               the winning of World <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Warl.</span> It would therefore 
               <br />
               follow that, in 1933, our normal debt would have 
               <br />
               only been $60 million and this after 78 years of 
               <br />
               strenuous national existence. Would this indicate 
               <br />
               our inefﬁciency in handling our affairs? Does this 
               <br />
               show incapacity on the part of our public men as 
               <br />
               the Amulree Report recklessly states? This report 
               <br />
               does not even hint that, in 1933, the obvious and 
               <br />
               proper course for Newfoundland to follow under 
               <br />
               the circumstances was some form of default. In 
               <br />
