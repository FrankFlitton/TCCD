               There are some statements made by Mr.

               attention to. In replying to Mr. Northcott, who

               asked him what the position would be in respect

               <br />
               ing union with Canada, Mr. Smallwood stated:l

            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               ....I am going to say something about divorce 
               <br />
               in case we become a province of Canada. Sir, 
               <br />
               we have no divorce laws in Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               We never did, and I hope we never will. 
               <br />
               Those provinces of Canada that are in union 
               <br />
               now, some of them had divorce laws, before 
               <br />
               confederation was started in 1867. They took 
               <br />
               their own laws into the union with them... I 
               <br />
               don’t think that any other province since then 
               <br />
               has passed a divorce law of its own. If New- 
               <br />
               foundland goes into confederation, I would 
               <br />
               give it as my opinion that it is highly 
               <br />
               unlikely that our House of Assembly will 
               <br />
               pass a divorce law.... If Mr. Northcott was a 
               <br />
               member of the provincial House of Assemb- 
               <br />
               ly, I don’t think he will vote for it I don’t 
               <br />
               think Mr. Starkes, Mr. Vincent or Mr. 
               <br />
               Jackman or any of us here will ever vote 
               <br />
               to pass a divorce law. That’s very unlikely. 
               <br />
               I say to you that by these words Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               was making a deliberate attempt to deceive the 
               <br />
               members of this Convention and possibly the 
               <br />
               people of this country. He attempted to convey 
               <br />
               the idea that in the event of federal union it was 
               <br />
               a matter for the parliament of the province 
               <br />
               whether a divorce law was passed and divorce 
               <br />
               courts set up here. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               That is deﬁnitely untrue, and Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               when making the statement knew it was untrue. 
               <br />
               The fact is that in the event of union, the matter 
               <br />
               of divorce is taken out of the hands of the parlia- 
               <br />
               ment of Newfoundland. The parliament of New— 
               <br />
               foundland would have no power to either set up 
               <br />
               divorce courts or to prevent them from being set 
               <br />
               up. That is a matter solely and entirely within the 
               <br />
               province of the federal government. I would refer

               Mr. Smallwood said, “Mind you, there are only

               <br />
               and desertion." That is deﬁnitely untrue and Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood knew at the time he made the state- 
               <br />
               ment that it was untrue. I would refer you again 
               <br />

               ful memory, so what are we to understand by 
               <br />
               these nus—statements? I would suggest to you quite 
               <br />
               deﬁnitely that they are deliberately misleading.

               I have pointed out to you the definite fact that 
               <br />
               in the event of federalunion with Canada, the sole 
               <br />
               right and authority to pass a divorce law and to 
               <br />
               set up divorce courts in Newfoundland rests with 
               <br />
               the federal government at Ottawa and with that 
               <br />
               government alone. With union between the two 
               <br />

               <br />
               foundland would have no discretion to say “yes”

            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               no” in this matter. Unless a provision was 
               <br />
               included in the terms of union, clearly stating that 
               <br />
               the federal parliament at Ottawa would forego for 
               <br />
               all time the right to legislate for divorce in New- 
               <br />
               foundland and undertake to have the British 
               <br />
               North America Act amended accordingly, then 
               <br />
               without such provision, such terms would be 
               <br />
               unacceptable to the Catholic people of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New»</span> 
               <br />
               foundland. As no such provision is made in the

               proposals received from the Right Honourable 
               <br />

               Mr. Chairman, that the proposals cannot be ac-

               Mr. Smallwood, during that same debate, 
               <br />
               stated thatI said, “Yes, the terms appear to be fair

               but an elected government could get better 
               <br />

               <br />
               he then went on to explain what wonderful men 
               <br />
               the Ottawa delegation were, and having 
               <br />
               described those having confederate views in the

               <br />
               personal accomplishments, stated:
