               Mr. Hickman I hope this report is not a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forenm‘</span>

               ner of some more expenditure reports coming in. 
               <br />
               I would like to go a little further and, as Mr. Job 
               <br />
               just said, I think we should have refused to 
               <br />
               operate this airport. It should have been operated 
               <br />
               by the joint airlines, and we should have had a 
               <br />
               rental for it of at least $500,000 a year. Instead 
               <br />
               we have a deﬁcit estimated to run for at least ﬁve 
               <br />
               years, and only a slim hope of breaking even. I 
               <br />
               don’t know what the expansion of aviation will 
               <br />
               be, but if it keeps on Gander may be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bypassed,</span> 
               <br />
               and Newfoundland will wind up with big deﬁcits 
               <br />
               until it is ﬁnally decided to close it. How the 
               <br />
               government could make an agreement like that is 
               <br />
               beyond my comprehension. At the end of each 
               <br />
               statement it says that Mr. Neill has no comment. 
               <br />
               That is not satisfactory, but I don’t see how he 
               <br />
               could make any comment after making the deal 
               <br />
               he did.... They were told what to do just the same 
               <br />
               as in the bases deal. The ﬁndings of this report, 
               <br />
               sir, are a disgrace.

               Mr. Penney I want to compliment the members 
               <br />
               of the Transportation Committee for bringing in 
               <br />
               such a ﬁne report, giving us the history of Gander 
               <br />
               and its Operation. The subject has been clear to 
               <br />
               me ever since we had the privilege of having 
               <br />
               Hon. Mr. Neill with us for a meeting of the 
               <br />
               Finance Committee. In talking about the Gander 
               <br />
               airport operation at that time he told us it was 
               <br />
               mnning in the red to the tune of $750,000 and the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland Railway $1 million a year. I 
               <br />
               remarked it was not a very satisfactory picture, 
               <br />
               Mr. Neill remarked he hoped it would be better 
               <br />
               next year, and I answered that I was sure the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland hoped that it would be 
               <br />
               better next year. The overall picture I have from 
               <br />
               your report, read and explained, is that we are 
               <br />
               running in the red to the tune of $500,000 a year 
               <br />
               on the operation of Gander airport. That <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opera»</span> 
               <br />
               tion, is chieﬂy for the convenience and benefit of 
               <br />
               the great powers of the world, and how New- 
               <br />
               foundland came to be forced into a deal that 
               <br />
               would put our poor little country in that position, 
               <br />
               to ﬁnance an airport for the great powers of the 
               <br />
               world, I can’t understand. It surely is not much 
               <br />
               credit to them. I think businessmen, if they were 
               <br />
               considering the future of Newfoundland, should 
               <br />
               consider the matter of leasing the airport to those 
               <br />
               great powers, so that Newfoundland would have

               Smallwood’s attention to page 2, the second 
               <br />
               paragraph, wherein he talks of a great number of 
               <br />
               trucks, etc. How is it, Mr. Smallwood, that you 
               <br />
               do not give us the exact number of trucks, equip-

               buildings been leased, and to whom? And what 
               <br />
               rentals have been paid? Did you inquire into the

               Mr. Smallwood In reply to Mr. Fudge, the 
               <br />
               report says that for the $1 million that the govem- 
               <br />
               ment paid, they got the hangers and other erec~ 
               <br />
               tions the Canadians have put there, as well as 
               <br />
               whatever equipment they left <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there.</span> This equip- 
               <br />
               ment consisted of a large number of trucks, cars, 
               <br />
               bulldozers, tractors, snow plows, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">etc.</span> The report 
               <br />
               might go on to add at least 1,000 other items, 
               <br />
               because it is just beyond counting. I doubt 
               <br />
               whether a complete inventory has been made by 
               <br />
               the Division ofCivil Aviation of the whole of the 
               <br />
               equipment. It is something staggering. I suppose 
               <br />
               in connection with blankets alone there were 
               <br />
               easily 50,000 blankets... The report says that if 
               <br />
               the government had to buy all these buildings and 
               <br />
               equipment new it would mean an outlay of noth- 
               <br />
               ing less than $5 million and probably much more. 
               <br />
               The buildings the Canadians put on Gander and 
               <br />
               the enlarging of the runways ran to $25 million 
               <br />
               capital expenditure. The government of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New.</span> 
               <br />
               foundland, for $1 million, got the enlargements 
               <br />
               that had been made in the runways, the new 
               <br />
               hangers, and dozens of great barrack buildings, 
               <br />
               not counting the almost uncountable number of 
               <br />
               pieces of equipment of every conceivable 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">description...</span> We can get the number of build— 
               <br />
               lugs, and we can get the blueprints. The number 
               <br />
               must run into a couple of hundred <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">buildings.</span> It is 
               <br />
               a vast airport. Mr. Fudge’s third question was 
               <br />
               what buildings have been rented out. Some build- 
               <br />
               ings have been rented to Goodyear and House...1 
               <br />
               The main question was what is the airport costing 
               <br />
               the country from the capital standpoint, and 
               <br />
               second, is the government going to make any 
               <br />
               money on it? The Newfoundland people have to
