               perhaps one of the greatest contributing causes 
               <br />
               was that the Newfoundland people never did 
               <br />
               have a choice of political philosophies. True, they 
               <br />
               did have a choice of political parties, but in es— 
               <br />
               sence the only choice they offered was a choice 
               <br />
               between Tweedledum and Tweedledee, a choice 
               <br />
               of political tenants not poles apart, but only the 
               <br />
               width of the street <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">apart.</span> It was never to distinct 
               <br />
               political faiths that Newfoundlanders had oc- 
               <br />
               casion to give their allegiance. At the best what 
               <br />
               they had was political personalities. There were 
               <br />
               no political parties held together by any bonds 
               <br />
               stronger than the desire to win the next election. 
               <br />
               There were certainly none held together by the 
               <br />
               belief that the political briefs they stood for were 
               <br />
               overwhelmingly right and true and worth holding 
               <br />
               out for against all odds. For if there had been, 
               <br />
               those parties would have held together and 
               <br />
               preserved their identity, but they did not. Not one 
               <br />
               of the old political parties that we used to know 
               <br />
               has survived —— not one. As a matter of fact, none 
               <br />
               survived longer than it took the Commission of 
               <br />
               Government to move in. The Commission was 
               <br />
               appointed and the political parties were never 
               <br />
               heard of again. They had not that within them 
               <br />
               which could hold them together overnight, once 
               <br />
               there was no more chance of winning an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">election.</span> 
               <br />
               And in that connection may I offer this advice to 
               <br />
               my political parties that may subsequently arise 
               <br />
               in this land: if any one of them can appeal to our 
               <br />
               people with a concrete vital platform that can 
               <br />
               touch their lives in terms of three square meals a 
               <br />
               day, they will likely go a long, long way. And if 
               <br />
               in the past responsible government was not all 
               <br />
               that it should be, particularly towards the end of 
               <br />
               its days, it was mostly because what we used to 
               <br />
               have every four years was not an election but a 
               <br />
               revolution. You will remember what would hap- 
               <br />
               pen at election times: brother was set against 
               <br />
               brother, community was set against community, 
               <br />
               class was set against class, deliberately and with 
               <br />
               malice aforethought to serve political ends. 
               <br />
               Hatred was engendered that lasted for years and 
               <br />
               wrought disturbance of the people’s peaceful 
               <br />
               way of life. Then to crown it all, if a new govem- 
               <br />
               ment was elected, almost its first move was in— 
               <br />
               variably to disrupt the civil service with many 
               <br />
               discharges and new appointments of party hacks 
               <br />
               and of the faithful. Irrespective of all the 
               <br />
               whitewash that has lately been spattered around 
               <br />

               is an unassailable fact that for a term of years 
               <br />
               immediately prior to Commission of Govem— 
               <br />

               hope that we have done with all that forever, and 
               <br />
               particularly the spoils system.

               Come what may in the shape of government, 
               <br />
               our people should insist on the civil service being 
               <br />
               placed, as I believe Mr. Hickman suggested 
               <br />
               yesterday afternoon, under a nonpolitical, inde— 
               <br />
               pendent civil service commission, and they 
               <br />
               should keep on insisting upon just that until they 
               <br />
               get it. Otherwise we will never get good govem- 
               <br />
               ment, and every four years the national interest 
               <br />
               will be sacriﬁced so that to the victors may go the 
               <br />
               spoils.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now I have suggested that responsible 
               <br />
               government as we knew it was not at all times all 
               <br />
               that it should have been. I should like to make it 
               <br />
               quite clear that in doing so I am not suggesting 
               <br />
               that responsible government as we knew it was 
               <br />
               never all that it should have been. I think it only 
               <br />
               fair to say that not all our politicians were con- 
               <br />
               cerned only with the grinding of their own axes, 
               <br />
               and the feathering of their own nests. If I had to 
               <br />
               prove that any single one of them was not all that 
               <br />
               he should have been, I am quite certain that I 
               <br />
               should be unable to do so, and again I think that 
               <br />
               a fair verdict is that a great many of our public 
               <br />
               men of yesteryear were sincere men who did the 
               <br />
               best that they could with the little that they had. 
               <br />
               The supreme tragedy was that they did not have 
               <br />
               enough to work with. Otherwise the story of 
               <br />
               responsible government might have been much 
               <br />
               different. I have said before that in the last 
               <br />
               analysis it was not our politicians who failed us, 
               <br />
               it was our economy. Yet notwithstanding the 
               <br />
               meagemess of the resources and the facilities 
               <br />
               drey had to work with, there were men in our past 
               <br />
               who wrought monumental works in this land. 
               <br />
               Men who were born to greatness, and set the mark 
               <br />
               of their greatness upon the causes they espoused, 
               <br />
               men in consequence of whose living we have all 
               <br />
               come to be at great advantage.

               Mr. Miller Mr. Chairman, I take pleasure in 
               <br />
               supporting this motion, and I base my decision 
               <br />
               on the reasonable supposition of our ability to 
               <br />
               maintain self—govemment. A second reason for 
               <br />
               doing so is the fact that the condition for the 
               <br />
               correction of which the Commission of Govem— 
               <br />
