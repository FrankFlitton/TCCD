               them formally. I would draw your attention to 
               <br />
               section 2. It is recommended that the work of the 
               <br />
               Convention be divided up into nine committees, 
               <br />
               each consisting of ten men. We have en- 
               <br />
               deavoured to apportion the work of the members 
               <br />
               as best we could in order to balance them. These 
               <br />
               committees will be appointed by the Chairman in 
               <br />
               accordance with the schedule which is attached 
               <br />
               to this report and which sets out the various 
               <br />
               committees and members of each. As each mem- 
               <br />
               ber of the Convention sits on two committees, we 
               <br />
               suggested a schedule which provides that each 
               <br />
               committee meets three times a week. That does 
               <br />
               not mean that the committees cannot meet of-

               <br />
               that the chairman of each committee is to be one 
               <br />
               of the members of the Steering Committee, in 
               <br />
               order that there might be a connection between 
               <br />
               the Steering Committee and each sub-committee. 
               <br />
               As there are only seven members on the Steering 
               <br />
               Committee and there are nine committees, it is 
               <br />
               obvious, at present, that two chairmen are not 
               <br />
               members of the Steering Committee. It has there- 
               <br />
               fore been suggested we should ask your leave to 
               <br />
               add to the Steering Committee accordingly. It is 
               <br />
               proposed that the work begin at once. It will be 
               <br />
               apparent that very little in the form of formal 
               <br />
               meetings of the Convention will take place, and 
               <br />
               it was thought advisable that after we meet the 
               <br />
               Commissioner for Finance on Tuesday there 
               <br />
               should be an adjournment taken, and that we
