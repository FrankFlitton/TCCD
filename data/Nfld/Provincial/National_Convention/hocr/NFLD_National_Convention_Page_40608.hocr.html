               clear to me that information was the last thing it

               we are up against a stone wall. I could not help 
               <br />
               thinking yesterday, whilst listening to the senior 
               <br />
               member from Grand Falls, how close he was to 
               <br />
               the truth when he said the only reason the delega- 
               <br />
               tion was received was because the powers that be 
               <br />
               wanted a delegation to go to Canada.

               At an earlier date I said we were going into 
               <br />
               confederation with a pull from the front, meaning 
               <br />
               Canada, and a push from the back, meaning Great 
               <br />
               Britain. We got more from the Dominions Ofﬁce 
               <br />
               than I expected, in fact, all that was intended for 
               <br />
               us to get since 1943. It makes my blood boil to 
               <br />
               think we have a body of men elected by the 
               <br />
               people of this country treated in the manner we 
               <br />
               have been treated. I cannot understand how men 
               <br />
               with blood in their veins can put up with it. Every 
               <br />
               way we turn we are up against those cursed terms 
               <br />
               of reference. . .. They encircle us like the scalloped 
               <br />
               shrouds the old folks used to put around a corpse 
               <br />
               in the outports. Who made those terms of refer- 
               <br />
               ence so entangling? Those who wanted it that 
               <br />
               way. The Convention was only intended to show 
               <br />
               the world that what would happen to this country 
               <br />
               would have a show of democracy, while all the 
               <br />
               time an organised minority in the Convention, 
               <br />
               backed by the powers that be, led us, an unor— 
               <br />
               ganised majority, the way they wanted us to go, 
               <br />
               like a horse is led or driven with a curb bit. The 
               <br />
               time has come for us to assert ourselves. I think 
               <br />
               the limit has been reached. No greater insult 
               <br />
               could be heaped on an elected body, than that 
               <br />
               they are not men of honour and discretion, and I 
               <br />
               see no reasonwhy the stenographic report cannot 
               <br />
               be given to the Convention in an informal ses- 
               <br />
               sion. If the whole delegation concurred in this I 
               <br />
               am sure the people would not take it lightly, but 
               <br />
               with only two of seven of that opinion, then it 
               <br />
               looks to me like a plot to keep the Convention aw 
               <br />

               Now the following paragraph in my opinion 
               <br />
               is making trouble for us today. This is where we 
               <br />
               get the pull and push. This makes Britain and 
               <br />
               Canada partners through the ages or until swords 
               <br />
               are beaten into ploughshares. This is why today 
               <br />
               only a small minority in the Convention is in the 
               <br />
               know, and the rest of us are treated like children. 
               <br />
               The iron curtain has nothing on it. This paragraph 
               <br />
               goes on to say.

               The Newfoundland region is of vital strategic 
               <br />
               importance to Canada, both for its direct 
               <br />
               defence and, if it so decides, for despatching 
               <br />
               air to Great Britain in the event of war. It 
               <br />
               would be ignominious to Canadians to leave 
               <br />
               to the United States responsibility for the 
               <br />
               direct defence of Canada’s eastern frontier as 
               <br />
               would be the case were the United States 
               <br />
               alone able to operate in the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               region. And now that Canada has become a 
               <br />
               substantial air and naval power in her own 
               <br />
               right, it would be equally ignominious to 
               <br />
               Canadians to leave to Great Britain sole 
               <br />
               responsibility for protecting the North Atlan- 
               <br />
               tic trade routes if Canada were an active 
               <br />
               partner in war. Freedom to operate for 
               <br />
               defence purposes in the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               region is thus an important consideration of 
               <br />
               Canadian defence.

               I see nothing wrong with this, being British 
               <br />
               and a believer in the old navy axiom, “Twice blest 
               <br />
               is he who has his quarrel just, but four times blest 
               <br />
               is he who gets his blow in ﬁrst.” The only thing 
               <br />
               wrong with it is that we are treated like children. 
               <br />
               We are the oldest colony, yet with our record 
               <br />
               behind us, ashore and aﬂoat, we are shuffled 
               <br />
               around like pawns on a chess board. Why could 
               <br />
               not that which has been taken from us have been 
               <br />
               given back? And with a government of our own, 
               <br />
               meet both the imperial and the Canadian 
               <br />
               authorities and let us take our share of the burden. 
               <br />
               If we haven’t the cash, we have the men, and I’ll 
               <br />
               wager my life that we will keep up our end of the 
               <br />
               stick. We did it before and we can do it again. We 
               <br />
               manned the ships for Canada in World War I, and 
               <br />
               our record speaks for itself. Everything has been 
               <br />
               done by certain members to vilify and cheapen us 
               <br />
               in the eyes of the world. This paragraph speaks
