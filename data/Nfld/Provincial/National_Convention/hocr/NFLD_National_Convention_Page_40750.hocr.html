               a few days ago, a ﬁrm from Fogo proper acquired 
               <br />
               in Bay Bulls all the extensive naval buildings, 
               <br />
               dockyards and piers. I do not know what they 
               <br />
               paid for them. And what they have done it for? Is 
               <br />
               it for fun, as Mr. Higgins said? They are going in 
               <br />
               for the development of fresh ﬁsh, frozen ﬁsh, 
               <br />
               canning and all the rest. There is going to be a 
               <br />
               very big development in Bay Bulls in a few years. 
               <br />
               Earle and Sons are the business people who are 
               <br />
               doing it and they are men of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vision,</span> Now are we 
               <br />
               to take that as meaning our fish industry is 
               <br />
               doomed to failure? I hardly think so. We have 
               <br />
               men like Messrs. Crosbie and Job investing 
               <br />
               thousands in the ﬁshery —— not for now, but for 
               <br />
               the future. Is that a criterion that our ﬁshery is 
               <br />
               doomed? One thing that was brought up here 
               <br />
               about the Labrador ﬁshery —— men going to 
               <br />
               Labrador and not bringing home any fish. No 
               <br />
               person can say how much each individual 
               <br />
               schooner is going to bring home. The ﬁshermen 
               <br />
               would like to know it. What a person can do is to 
               <br />
               look around the world in which he lives and see 
               <br />
               what can be done for the ﬁsheries with capable 
               <br />
               handling and administration. New processing, 
               <br />
               new ways of improving existing processing, 
               <br />
               especially in fresh and frozen ﬁsh industry, there 
               <br />
               I contend lies the future for our ﬁshing industry. 
               <br />
               Another thing that can be done is ﬁnding bigger 
               <br />
               and more proﬁtable markets. That brings me to a 
               <br />
               subject which has been discussed by Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               Job at great length; but to quote our absent friend, 
               <br />
               Professor Wheare, “at the risk of being an echo", 
               <br />
               I wish to mention this question of markets in the 
               <br />
               USA. I firmly believe that there is a market big 
               <br />
               enough to take just about every ﬁsh we produce, 
               <br />
               and that that market could be secured if we could 
               <br />
               get at it. I think we can, providing we had the 
               <br />
               proper government and we are going to get that 
               <br />
               government in the future. The USA was granted 
               <br />
               territories in this country for 99 years for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">practi»</span> 
               <br />
               cally nothing without the consent of the people. 
               <br />
               It is my belief that when we get our own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govem~</span>
