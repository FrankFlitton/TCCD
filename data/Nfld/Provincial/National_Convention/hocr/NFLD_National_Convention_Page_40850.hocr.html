               I do not want it to be unfairly alleged against

               <br />
               to remind you, Mr. Smallwood, the manner in 
               <br />
               which information is disseminated must depend, 
               <br />
               in the first instance, according to the explanation 
               <br />
               given by you yourself... Let me also suggest that 
               <br />
               whether the explanation as given by you is 
               <br />
               universally accepted by the house, or whether it 
               <br />
               is taken from the Black Books and accepted by 
               <br />
               the house, the fact is that whichever modus 
               <br />
               operandi is employed, the country has the ad- 
               <br />
               vantage of having you read the clause and give 
               <br />
               an explanation. I do not feel that reverting to the 
               <br />
               Black Books is necessary to explain the context 
               <br />
               or meaning of any clause, unless your interpreta- 
               <br />
               tion of that clause is challenged, in which event 
               <br />

               for the Newfoundland people to decide, Mr. King 
               <br />
               goes on to say, “On the part of Canada, no final 
               <br />
               decision would, of course, be taken without the 
               <br />
               approval of Parliament”. I would like to ask Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood, what body makes the ﬁnal decision 
               <br />
               with regard to Newfoundland? In Canada no final 
               <br />
               decision would, of course, be made without the 
               <br />
               approval of Parliament, but assuming that the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland vote for confederation 
               <br />
               at the referendum, who makes the agreement 
               <br />
               with the Government of Canada?

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Smallwood Let me repeat the question, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> 
               <br />
               may. “In the case of Canada, the decision to 
               <br />
               receive Newfoundland as a province is made by 
               <br />
               the elected Parliament of Canada. In the case of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, who makes the decision that 
               <br />
               Newfoundland become a province?" The answer 
               <br />
               is, the decision to have Newfoundland become a 
               <br />
               province or not is a decision to be made, if it is 
               <br />
               made at all, by the people of Newfoundland in the 
               <br />
               referendum. I am sure Mr. Hollett will agree that 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland we have various institutions — 
               <br />
               magistrates‘ courts, Commission of Government, 
               <br />
               National Convention, etc. Over and above all 
               <br />
               these institutions are the people. They are 
               <br />
               supreme and they are sovereign. You cannot go 
               <br />
               higher than the people. In deciding what form of 
               <br />
               government we shall have, they are the last word 
               <br />
               of all. If anyone decides, the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland will decide that Newfoundland shall 
               <br />
               become a province, or Newfoundland shall not 
               <br />
               become a province. 
               <br />

               Mr. Hollett Mr. Smallwood has missed the 
               <br />
               point. I am aware that the people of any country 
               <br />
               are the people to decide the approved policy. 
               <br />
               Assuming the people of Newfoundland decided 
               <br />
               by referendum that they would like to go into 
               <br />
               union with Canada under proper terms, I am 
               <br />
               asking what body in Newfoundland would 
               <br />
               approve any terms of agreement which may be 
               <br />
