               present form of government the best for this

               country, because it means taxation without rep- 
               <br />
               resentation. I will say that the present form of 
               <br />
               government, since it came into power, has done 
               <br />
               much to build up the public and social services. 
               <br />

               <br />
               also remember that they have during the past six 
               <br />
               or seven years been helped greatly by the highest 
               <br />
               revenues in our history, which were due almost 
               <br />
               wholly to the effects of the war and to the high 
               <br />
               cost of imported goods. How long these condi- 
               <br />
               tions will continue is anybody’s guess.

               You may ask why, if I do not consider either 
               <br />
               of these forms the best for us, do I support the 
               <br />
               motion that they be placed before the people for 
               <br />
               their choice, and my answer is that we were sent

               here to recommend suitable forms and not to

               decide them. I know that there are many people

               who do think that one of these forms would be 
               <br />
               best, and I think it is our duty to see, as far as it 
               <br />
               lies in our power, that they are given the chance

               Mr. Watton Mr. Chairman, we have here a 
               <br />
               resolution introduced by Mr. Higgins, covering 
               <br />
               two forms of government to be submitted to the 
               <br />
               people of this country in the forthcoming <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">referenv</span> 
               <br />
               dum. It will be the duty of all of us tonight to 
               <br />
               register our vote as to whether we are in favour 
               <br />
               of it or not. I want to say that I am in favour of it 
               <br />
               and that I shall vote for it, because I feel that it is 
               <br />
               the only logical thing for me to do. The chief 
               <br />
               reason why I vote for it is that for the past 16 
               <br />
               months this Convention has been studying the 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial and economic position of this country, 
               <br />
               and has come to the conclusion that we are again 
               <br />
               self~supporting. The reason why we are self~sup~ 
               <br />
               porting has been stated over and over again, and 
               <br />
               the conclusions of all the reports presented to this 
               <br />
               Convention have pointed to that fact. In view of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> all the circumstances, and because I believe in the 
               <br />
               resolution, I feel duty bound to support it.

               As for the forms of government dealt with in 
               <br />
               this resolution, I will make my comments as brief 
               <br />
               as possible. The ground has been very ably 
               <br />
               covered by previous speakers. Personally, Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, I believe in the restoration of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respon»</span> 
               <br />
               sible government. I believe that the greatest good 
               <br />
               for the greatest number can be achieved by the 
               <br />
               immediate restoration of that form of govem-

               ment. Our principal industries are today in a 
               <br />
               better condition than they ever were in our his- 
               <br />
               tory. Our fisheries, which are and always will be 
               <br />
               the backbone of our economy, have made enor- 
               <br />
               mous strides in the last few years. They have 
               <br />
               become more diversiﬁed, more modern in some 
               <br />
               respects; we have a better system of marketing, 
               <br />
               and we are producing a better product as a result 
               <br />
               of proper <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inspection.</span> Indications point to the fact 
               <br />
               that the future for our ﬁsheries can and will be, 
               <br />
               under the proper administration, put on a sounder 
               <br />
               basis than it ever was before. What I mean by 
               <br />
               “proper administration” is that if we can only get 
               <br />
               the chance to use the great bargaining power that 
               <br />
               is ours. Our forest industries have grown to a 
               <br />
               considerable degree and are still <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">growing.</span> Mil— 
               <br />
               lions of dollars are now being spent on the expan- 
               <br />
               sion of existing paper mills, and it is not 
               <br />
               improbable that in the near future another such 
               <br />
               industry will be started meaning more employ- 
               <br />
               ment for our people. Our mining industry is in a 
               <br />
               ﬂourishing condition with every prospect for it to 
               <br />
               continue so in the future, with the possibility of 
               <br />
               future mineral development. Agriculture shows 
               <br />
               great promise. We are, Mr. Chairman, in a more 
               <br />
               favourable position than we ever were in our 
               <br />
               history; and our position can be made much better 
               <br />
               by taking advantage of the tremendous bargain~ 
               <br />
               ing power that is ours, due to our strategic posi- 
               <br />
               tion which has been stressed so often inside this 
               <br />
               Convention and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out,</span> We can only reap the full 
               <br />
               advantage of this by an immediate return to self— 
               <br />
               government. It has been ours for the asking for a 
               <br />
               long time now, and nothing has been done about 
               <br />
               it, and nothing will ever be done about it until the 
               <br />
               people take over the management of their own 
               <br />
               affairs. We should take advantage of it by starting 
               <br />
               negotiations with our good friend the United 
               <br />
               States of America, and by getting closer to that 
               <br />
               country economically, especially with regard to 
               <br />
               our fishery products. So much has already been 
               <br />
               said about this matter that it is unnecessary for 
               <br />
               me to elaborate. The same applies to the potential 
               <br />
               mineral and forest wealth of Labrador. Here we 
               <br />
               have something which can be of tremendous 
               <br />
               beneﬁt to us if handled properly, and it has not 
               <br />
               been handled properly up to the present. I think 
               <br />
               the Mining Committee, of whichI was a member, 
               <br />
               pointed out that fact. It is my opinion that we will 
               <br />
               never reap the full beneﬁts until we get our own 
               <br />
               government. The quicker we can get that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govem'</span>
