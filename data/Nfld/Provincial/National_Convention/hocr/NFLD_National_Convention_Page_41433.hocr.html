               <br />
               additional taxation on our people to do so? Did 
               <br />
               not Mr. Crummey tell us that under the present 
               <br />
               laws of Canada there did not exist any legislation 
               <br />
               which would permit our Fishery Board to carry 
               <br />
               on as it is doing at the present, and that conse- 
               <br />
               quently it would be abolished, and that our 
               <br />
               fishery products would then come under the 
               <br />
               federal authorities, and that the present system of 
               <br />
               our marketing would cease to exist? Is it not a fact 
               <br />
               that some members of the Ottawa delegation 
               <br />
               advocated a subsidy of $8 million instead of the 
               <br />
               $3.5 million transitional grant, and were turned 
               <br />
               down? Other matters of great national impor— 
               <br />
               tance were also given attention and were not 
               <br />
               reported to this Convention because it does not 
               <br />
               suit the plan of the pro—Confederates. Ihave stated 
               <br />
               in this assembly that the estimate of possible 
               <br />
               revenues which the Canadian experts made that 
               <br />
               Canada would derive from union of our two 
               <br />
               countries, amounting to slightly over $20 million 
               <br />
               annually, are fraudulent; that in my opinion the 
               <br />
               amount they would receive would be over $30 
               <br />
               million. And this does not take into consideration 
               <br />
               the possible increase in revenues that would ac- 
               <br />
               crue from the development of the Labrador iron 
               <br />
               ore project. I repeat that statement today, Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, I repeat that the deficit on the 
               <br />
               proposed provincial budget would be not less 
               <br />
               than $9 million annually, and that in order to 
               <br />
               balance that account increased taxes would have 
               <br />
               to be placed on our people in the way of further 
               <br />
               sales tax, hospital tax, property tax, educational 
               <br />
               tax, municipal tax, and God knows how many 
               <br />
               other kinds of taxes.

               I know that the advocates of confederation do 
               <br />

               <br />
