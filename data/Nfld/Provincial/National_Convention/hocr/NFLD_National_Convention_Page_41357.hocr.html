               Of course, the relative merits of the Commis- 
               <br />
               sion’s worth must ever remain a matter of dis— 
               <br />
               pute. The Commission has been in ofﬁce during 
               <br />
               two abnormal periods of our history, an abnormal 
               <br />
               period of depression and an abnormal period of 
               <br />
               what some have been pleased to call prosperity. 
               <br />
               It has not been in office during what might be 
               <br />
               termed a normal period. In consequence it is 
               <br />
               difﬁcult to make comparisons, and therefore dif- 
               <br />
               ﬁcult to judge of the absolute value of its work. 
               <br />
               That is not a good and sufﬁcient reason for with- 
               <br />
               holding credit where it is due, and in many mat- 
               <br />
               ters the Commission did act with advantage to 
               <br />
               this island and to its people, and I think that a fair 
               <br />
               verdict is that we have had good value from the 
               <br />
               Commission, and I think that will be the verdict 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">history</span>

               It has been suggested to me that aside from the 
               <br />
               fact that Commission is government without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rep</span> 
               <br />
               resentation, that there is a further reason why this 
               <br />
               Convention should not recommend Commission 
               <br />
               for referendum purposes. The Commission sys— 
               <br />
               tem carries with it the guarantee of Britain to 
               <br />
               meet our deﬁcits, but for seven years now we 
               <br />
               have been able to balance our budget and have 
               <br />
               something over and to spare. It is contended 
               <br />
               therefore that it would be perhaps immoral of us, 
               <br />
               and certainly would not be honourable, to seek a 
               <br />
               continuation of the Commission system and 
               <br />
               thereby hold Britain to a promise given in al-

               together different circumstances. To put it blunt- 
               <br />
               ly, it is held that we should be without honour to 
               <br />
               forego self-govemment merely to have the as- 
               <br />

               The validity of that argument any fair man 
               <br />
               must admit, and I have to commend it to the 
               <br />
               conscience of the people for their consideration 
               <br />
               at the time of the referendum. But it is a matter 
               <br />
               for the conscience of the people, it is not a matter 
               <br />
               of honour with us. We have no choice but to let 
               <br />
               the people have a choice among other forms of 
               <br />
               government — Commission. True, the thing was 
               <br />
               loaded upon our people in the beginning without 
               <br />
               consultation, but they did accept it. Not only does 
               <br />
               silence give consent, but so too does acquies- 
               <br />
               cence. Indeed, nobody doubts now but had the 
               <br />
               people been consulted during those grim Geth- 
               <br />
               semane days of 1933, that they would have ac— 
               <br />
               cepted Commission. In fact it was welcomed on 
               <br />
               every hand with open arms, and there is no doubt 
               <br />
               that most of our people have found it good. In any 
               <br />
               case, if we are going to give the people a choice 
               <br />
               of anything, we must surely ask them if they want 
               <br />
               to keep what they already have. To propose alter- 
               <br />
               natives you must begin with what you already 
               <br />
               have. A great many people believe that the 
               <br />
               speciﬁc term of years for which Commission is 
               <br />
               to be retained, if it is to be retained, should be 
               <br />
               decided in advance. They argue that any retention 
               <br />
               of Commission that may materialise from the 
               <br />
               referendum should be conditional upon review of 
               <br />
               the whole position at the end of ﬁve or ten years. 
               <br />
               I really cannot see much point in making such a 
               <br />
               proviso. If the Newfoundland people decide to 
               <br />
               retain the Commission system, and at the end of 
               <br />
               a term of years want to examine the situation, 
               <br />
               they will have merely to take the necessary steps 
               <br />
               to bring about such review; if there is no popular 
               <br />
               feeling and agitation for re-opening the question, 
               <br />
               then the people should not ﬁnd themselves corn~

               responsible government at the request of our
