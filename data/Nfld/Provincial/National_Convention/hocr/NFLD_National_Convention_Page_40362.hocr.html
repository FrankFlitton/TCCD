               England at one stage there was a ﬁne balance 
               <br />
               between agriculture and industry. Great Britain 
               <br />
               found she could make more money by going into 
               <br />
               industry to the neglect of agriculture. At the 
               <br />
               present time she is going back and spending a lot 
               <br />
               of money to try and build up her agricultural 
               <br />
               possibilities. It seems to me that if we could build 
               <br />
               up a lot of industries which would return to us 
               <br />
               greater wealth than farming, then maybe we 
               <br />
               should not do much farming. My opinion is that 
               <br />
               we should always do so much, because if one of 
               <br />
               your vital industries sadly failed, you would have 
               <br />
               something to fall back on. Do you not agree? 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins Definitely. 
               <br />

               Mr. Butt It is a question of the whole economy 
               <br />
               and stability. I believe in 1870, France, because 
               <br />
               of the ﬁne balance between industry and agricul— 
               <br />

               <br />
               she came back quicker than if she had depended 
               <br />
               on industry.

               Mr. Higgins That is likely what is happening in 
               <br />
               England today. I am sure your Committee gave 
               <br />
               thought to the matter. 
               <br />

               Mr. Butt Yes, we thought of the soil which is 
               <br />
               rocky and rough; but you read the history of 
               <br />
               agriculture in Norway, and it is almost word for 
               <br />
               word the description of the soil in Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               If you read the history of the founding of the New 
               <br />
               England states, almost word for word would be 
               <br />
               the language used about the soils when they took 
               <br />
               over ﬁrst. It seems to the Committee we are 
               <br />
               starting agriculture 300 years too late. We have 
               <br />
               the advantage now, of course, we will be able to 
               <br />
               use modern machinery, whereas before, it was 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood I could add to that. l was talking 
               <br />
               to a farmer in the west end of St. John’s; he grew 
               <br />
               2,000 barrels of potatoes. He did not grow them 
               <br />
               on his own land, he did not have enough, but he 
               <br />
               got the use of two or three farms and he grew 
               <br />
               2,000 barrels, sold them and made money on 
               <br />
               them. He himself said the trouble is that if you 
               <br />
               plant out five or ten acres in potatoes, you have 
               <br />
               not got enough land to do it on a large <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scale.</span> Your 
               <br />
               unit of production is very low; and your cost per

               bushel or barrel naturally is going to be high. You 
               <br />
               have to get a high price to make it pay. The only 
               <br />
               way to get a good price is through the customs 
               <br />
               tariff which will make the price of competing 
               <br />
               potatoes artiﬁcially higher. If you get away from 
               <br />
               the small unit, and turn out at the rate of 2,000 
               <br />
               barrels, you can make <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">money...</span>
