               the truth, sir, I was expecting Major Cashin to 
               <br />
               come out and agree with me. He knows it was the 
               <br />
               stone sober truth. He knoWs that our people have 
               <br />
               been plundered and looted. I was glad to see that 
               <br />
               Mr. Cranford agreed with me. He hates those 
               <br />
               monopolists. But Major Cashin actually 
               <br />
               defended those looters, he had kind words for 
               <br />
               them. He stated strongly that it was communistic 
               <br />
               to talk the way I did. It was not communistic to 
               <br />
               expose the profits made out of a handful of 
               <br />
               people. If anything is communistic or fascistic, it 
               <br />
               is the conduct of those who looted our people 
               <br />

               Major Cashin said I used hard words. Perhaps 
               <br />
               I did. But what really matters is this: did I use true 
               <br />
               words? Were those proﬁts made, or were they 
               <br />
               not? Was the Tax Assessor lying to us when he 
               <br />
               told us ofﬁcially of that $15.5 million cleaned up 
               <br />
               in clear proﬁts in just one short year? Are our 
               <br />
               people being plundered and looted, or are they 
               <br />
               not? That is the thing that matters. If they are, then 
               <br />
               no language is too hard to use to expose the fact. 
               <br />
               Sir, when you run up against a brutal fact like that 
               <br />
               it is no time for soft words, for pussy-footing, but 
               <br />
               for plain speaking. It was not I, Mr. Chairman, 
               <br />
               who said this, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">”There</span> are too many middlemen 
               <br />
               and commission agents in Newfoundland who 
               <br />
               are really only parasites on the community." I did 
               <br />
               not say that, sir. It was our late Governor, Sir 
               <br />
               Humphrey Walwyn, in his farewell address to 
               <br />

               <br />
               my way I’d burn every local factory to the 
               <br />
               ground.” I did not say that, sir. It was Mr. Cashin 
               <br />
               who said it, in this chamber. If my words were 
               <br />
               hard, sir, what would you call the words of 
               <br />
               Governor Walwyn and Mr. Cashin? 
               <br />

               Major Cashin told us about the large proﬁts ~— 
               <br />
               hundreds of millions, I think he said <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">--</span> made by

               <br />
               that. But can he not see any difference in corpora— 
               <br />
               tions making large proﬁts out of 12 million 
               <br />
               people, and making them out of our tiny handful 
               <br />
               of people in this country? As I said before, there

               I was greatly amused by Major Cashin’s 
               <br />
               repetition of his former exaggerated, extravagant 
               <br />
               and totally erroneous statement that under con— 
               <br />
               federation we would pay $80 million in taxes. He 
               <br />
               does not say how we would pay that amount. He 
               <br />
               won‘t condescend to tell us. He just makes this 
               <br />
               outrageous statement and apparently expects the 
               <br />
               faithful followers of his form of government to 
               <br />
               take it down, hook, line and sinker. The Canadian 
               <br />
               government itself says they will collect $20 mil- 
               <br />
               lion from us, and tells us in detail how they will 
               <br />
               do it. Major Cashin doesn’t double it and make it 
               <br />
               $40 million. He does not treble it and make it $60 
               <br />
               million. No, he quadruples it and makes it $80 
               <br />
               million -— exactly four times as much as the 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial experts of the Canadian government 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">estimate.</span> It would not be so bad if only he gave 
               <br />
               us one single word of proof, just one little word. 
               <br />
               Is he quite sure it would not be $79 million or $81 
               <br />
               million? It wouldn’t be $815 or $80.75 million 
               <br />
               now, would it? Or perhaps Major Cashin is $4 
               <br />
               million out, as he was in one of his budgets that 
               <br />
               he brought in here when he was Finance Minister. 
               <br />
               Now I remind you that the first time he spoke on 
               <br />
               the question, he quarrelled seriously and violent— 
               <br />
               ly with the Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government’s</span> estimate of 
               <br />
               $20 million a year. He said it was 20% out, that 
               <br />
               estimate, and drove it up to $24 million. That was 
               <br />
               the first time he spoke about it. The next time he 
               <br />
               spoke about it, he raised the ante, he put it at $32 
               <br />
               million. Then he spoke for the third time, and that 
               <br />
               time he raised it again, to $75 million. Now, in 
               <br />
               his latest speech, he has it up to $80 million. What 
               <br />
               is he doing, playing auction with himself? He has 
               <br />
               given us four different estimates ~— $24 million, 
               <br />
               $32 million, $75 million and $80 million. I 
               <br />
               daresay before the referendum rolls around he 
               <br />
               will have it up to $100 million. What’s he trying 
               <br />
               to do, make the handful of souls in Newfoundland 
               <br />
