               provision for sinking fund. In 1947, as at 31 
               <br />
               March, the interest payment was $3,545,000, and 
               <br />
               it included a sinking fund provision of $903,380. 
               <br />
               The point I am making is that there is a permanent 
               <br />
               and continuous benefit as at today of over $2 
               <br />
               million, the amount that we will not have to pay 
               <br />
               out for interest. If we had had that $2 million 
               <br />
               which we were paying out prior to that time it 
               <br />
               would have made a very great difference to the 
               <br />
               future of this country. I suggest that on that point 
               <br />
               alone we ought to watch very carefully, because 
               <br />
               we now have a continuous beneﬁt of something 
               <br />
               like $2—2.5 million, and it is being reduced all the 
               <br />
               time. Further than that, it looks as if the sinking 
               <br />
               fund payment can be kept up for the foreseeable 
               <br />
               future. I am not going to try to deﬁne the foresee— 
               <br />
               able future, but we are reducing our debt by 
               <br />
               $8—900,000 a year, and we only have to ﬁnd, as 
               <br />
               at March 31, $2.6 million against $5 million in 
               <br />

               Mr. Hollett Major Cashin, may 1 ask a question 
               <br />
               through you to Mr. Butt? What was the sinking 
               <br />
               fund provision in 1947? 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Butt The sinking fund provision for 1947 
               <br />
               was $903,000.... The real point is that we have a 
               <br />
               continuing beneﬁt. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Cashin I think I ought to further explain this 
               <br />
               sinking fund. When the Financial Act was passed 
               <br />
               in 1933 the sinking fund was to be paid in 1937, 
               <br />
               amounting to 1% of the total sterling indebted— 
               <br />
               ness. The total sterling indebtedness is 
               <br />
               £17,790,000, therefore the annual sinking fund 
               <br />
               amounted to £177,950, or in dollar exchange (at 
               <br />
               that time it was $4.80) it amounts to $854,160, 
               <br />
               but the point I am trying to make is this, that each 
               <br />
               year the sinking fund went across to Great 
               <br />
               Britain. It was invested, as we are told in the 
               <br />
               Auditor General’s report at any rate, in the actual 
               <br />
               payment of the debt. In other words they got it in, 
               <br />
               but the following year that amount was not taken 
               <br />
               off the principal. I agree with that to a point, but 
               <br />
               the following year we sent over more money 
               <br />
               paying interest on the debt we had redeemed, and 
               <br />
               what is the result? Today I estimate, sometimes I 
               <br />
               make mistakes, but I estimate that Newfoundland 
               <br />
               has lost $1 million on that sinking fund loan 
               <br />
               during the past ten years, because if you take 
               <br />
               £177,000 and compound it annually at 3% you 
               <br />
               will ﬁnd that if you work it out at present dollar 
               <br />
               exchange it will go over $9 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million...</span> In all, we 
               <br />
               have paid in sinking fund approximately $l0

               on the other side, consequently Newfoundland 
               <br />
               has lost by the handling of that sinking fund $1.5

               You have a note agreement for $1,000 and at the

               end of the month you pay $100 and you renew it

               for another month. Is the bank going to charge 
               <br />
               you interest on $1,000 when you go to pay it the 
               <br />
               next time? No, on $900, but we have been paying 
               <br />
               it out, sending the actual interest on the sinking 
               <br />
               fund overto England. 1 will explain in my opinion 
               <br />
               what is happening: the money was sent across to 
               <br />
               England and it bought in our principal; when it 
               <br />
               went over the next time they were not able to buy 
               <br />
               it in, and they did not invest the sinking fund to 
               <br />
               bear interest, and that’s where we lost money, and 
               <br />
               they did not reduce it from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">principal,</span> You can 
               <br />
               take these estimates for the last ten years and 
               <br />
               under the consolidated fund services you will 
               <br />
               find that the 3% guaranteed stock for this 
               <br />
               amounts to £17,790 to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">date...</span> I hold that when 
               <br />
               that stock was bought in, that the next year when 
               <br />
               we bought in £177,950 worth, it should have been 
               <br />
               deducted off here, and that's where 1 say we lost 
               <br />
               $1 million at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">least.</span>
