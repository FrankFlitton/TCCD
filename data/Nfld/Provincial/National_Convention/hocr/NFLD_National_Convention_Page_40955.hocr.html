               <br />
               There we have a deﬁnite, clear-cut statement by 
               <br />
               the Ottawa government. Yet here we have at the 
               <br />
               same time the Quebec provincial government, 
               <br />
               representative, mind you, of approximately one- 
               <br />
               third of the population of Canada, and repre— 
               <br />
               senting a political balance of power in the 
               <br />
               Canadian Parliament, saying that they deny this 
               <br />
               statement — that they refuse to acknowledge 
               <br />
               Newfoundland as being the legal owner of this 
               <br />
               territory, and that they are going to do everything 
               <br />
               in their power to take it from us. If the cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances were different, my first impulse 
               <br />
               would be to ask the Commission government 
               <br />
               what this whole thing means. But I know that I 
               <br />
               would be only wasting my time, because they 
               <br />
               would not tell me. Only a few days ago, they were 
               <br />
               asked whether we could regard the agreement 
               <br />
               made between the Government of Great Britain 
               <br />
               and our own government in 1933 as being at 
               <br />
               present valid and effective, and if it were to be 
               <br />
               followed out, and they came back with the reply 
               <br />
               that in effect it was none of our business. Here we 
               <br />
               have a solemn agreement made between two 
               <br />
               governments, whereby we surrendered our 
               <br />
               sovereignty upon certain specific terms and 
               <br />
               which provided for the return of our lost political 
               <br />
               life; and we are told that we should not talk about 
               <br />
               it, that it is not within the province of us repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives of the Newfoundland people even to 
               <br />
               discuss it. Using the words of Winston Churchill, 
               <br />
               “What kind of people do they think we are?” Do 
               <br />
               they think we are so many children to be trifled 
               <br />
               with? Do they think we do not know the nature 
               <br />
               of a contract, and the sacred moral and legal 
               <br />
               obligations which it entails and which are im- 
               <br />
               posed upon the parties? It seems to me that it is 
               <br />
               time we ceased to allow ourselves, or our people, 
               <br />
               to be used for the foolish purposes of this debat-

               ing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">society.</span> It is time that we realised that we have

               greater duties, greater responsibilities, greater

               its narrower terms of reference. How can we

               <br />
               rob us of our rich Labrador territory. I ask my 
               <br />
               fellow delegates: are they prepared to consider 
               <br />
               doing business on that basis? Are they prepared 
               <br />
               to discuss terms with a people who have openly 
               <br />
               shown their unfriendliness — who declare that 
               <br />
               regardless of all laws, their purpose is to wrest 
               <br />
               from us that which is ours?

               Under the circumstances, if we have respect

               We are witnessing a spectacle which has been 
               <br />
               repeated many times in the history of small 
               <br />
               countries. It is the old story of the covetous eyes 
               <br />
               and the greedy hands of bigger and more power— 
               <br />
               ful countries coveting the wealth and the assets 
               <br />
               of the smaller country. Sometimes the big fellow 
               <br />
               gets what he wants by political trickery, some- 
               <br />
               times he gets it by threats and pressure; and 
               <br />
               failing these, he takes it by brute force. In our 
               <br />
               Labrador possession, through the goodness of 
               <br />
               Providence, we have been given a source of 
               <br />
               untold wealth, a means by which this country can 
               <br />
               obtain and hold a continued prosperity. How 
               <br />
               long, I ask you, do you think this Wealth will be 
               <br />
               ours if we once found ourselves in the hands of 
               <br />
               the Canadian government? I tell you that it would 
               <br />
               be only so long as diey could rig up the necessary 
               <br />
               legal machinery to euchre us out of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span>

               It is all too clear now that the key to this whole 
               <br />
               mystery is the desire of Canada to take from us 
               <br />
               our Labrador wealth. It explains everything — 
               <br />
               baby bonuses, old age pensions and all the rest of 
               <br />
