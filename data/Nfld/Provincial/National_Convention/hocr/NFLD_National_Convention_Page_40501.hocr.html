               large amount into the income tax, and I would 
               <br />
               like to know and feel that there are a good many 
               <br />
               other mines in Newfoundland that can produce 
               <br />
               the wealth that Buchans has produced. Whether 
               <br />
               or not we have these mines I do not know, but I 
               <br />
               know that I stood on my feet 20 years ago when 
               <br />
               this company’s bill went through the House,1 and 
               <br />
               I believe they were looking for 20 years free 
               <br />
               customs duty, is that right? Were they given that? 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins I don’t think so. They did have a 
               <br />
               special rate, but I can’t tell you what it is. 
               <br />

               Mr. Higgins I believe there were provisions in 
               <br />
               the Crown Lands Act of 1930. There may be 
               <br />
               special provisions for Buchans, I don’t know, do

               Mr. Hollett The title to the Buchans mine 
               <br />
               comes from the 1905 act, and the duty rates are 
               <br />
               deﬁned in that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">act.</span>

               Mr. Ashbourne As my memory serves me they 
               <br />
               were looking for exemption for 20 years from 
               <br />
               that time. The argument put up was that they did 
               <br />
               not know exactly how much ore was there, but it 
               <br />
               seemed to be limited. My argument is that if we 
               <br />
               have mines in this country of good grade ore, gold 
               <br />
               and other things, they have to be prepared to pay 
               <br />
               a higher rate of tax than a mine of a doubtful 
               <br />
               nature. The answer given me was that I should 
               <br />
               not “balk” a certain company. I agree with 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood that this has been a very rich 
               <br />
               mine, and I realise that they have paid out a lot of 
               <br />
               money, but the question is, has the country reaped 
               <br />
               the beneﬁt that it should from its natural resour- 
               <br />
               ces? We have these assets, we know that every 
               <br />
               ton of ore taken out of the country is one ton less, 
               <br />
               and we have to be careful, and our governments 
               <br />
               have to be very careful when they give such 
               <br />
               sweeping terms and leases of millions of acres of 
               <br />
               land to any company. That’s a point we want to 
               <br />
               try and stress and impress upon any government 
               <br />
               that takes power in this country. They are dealing 
               <br />
               with the natural resources and assets of New- 
               <br />
               foundland, and, whilst it is only right that these 
               <br />
               companies that put their capital there should have 
               <br />
               a just return, yet the mineral that’s in the earth 
               <br />
               belongs to Newfoundland and that is where we,
