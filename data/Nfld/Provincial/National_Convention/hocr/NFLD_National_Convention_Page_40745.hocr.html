               Mr. Hickman Mr. Chairman, when I first came 
               <br />
               to this House I had a very different opinion of 
               <br />
               what was to be done and how we were to do it. 
               <br />
               As I understood it, the Convention was to be 
               <br />
               something like a royal commission. There was 
               <br />
               certain work to be done of a fact-finding nature 
               <br />
               and I assumed that it was our duty to get these 
               <br />
               facts, examine and check, and then use them as a 
               <br />
               basis for hard and fast opinions that would be 
               <br />
               useful in deciding the state of the country and its 
               <br />
               prospects. I thought we would get down to that 
               <br />
               job like a group of businessmen and that our 
               <br />
               debates would be chieﬂy like the discussions that 
               <br />
               go on around a council table. I thought that once 
               <br />
               we had agreed on the question of fact, we would 
               <br />
               enter into a digniﬁed discussion of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constitu~</span> 
               <br />
               tional question. I have been surprised at the dif- 
               <br />
               ference between my ideas of what would happen 
               <br />
               and what has actually occurred, and I regret that 
               <br />
               issues were injected into this Convention, before 
               <br />
               we had been here long enough to ﬁnd our feet, 
               <br />
               that have given a different and, in my opinion, an 
               <br />
               unfortunate turn to our proceedings. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               When we come down to the practical problem 
               <br />
               that was put before the Finance Committee, it 
               <br />
               must be admitted that it amounted to a matter of 
               <br />
               getting what facts we could and doing our best to 
               <br />
               try and draw the correct conclusions from them. 
               <br />
               I have listened with impatience to a good deal of 
               <br />
               silly talk about the report being full of estimates, 
               <br />
               guesses and so on. But, Mr. Chairman, neither 
               <br />
               you nor I nor any member of this House can say

               together, examine it in the light of such 
               <br />
               knowledge as we have of general conditions, and 
               <br />
               say, “In our opinion the position of this country 
               <br />
               for the next three years should be so and so”....

               the restoration of self-govemment, which is the

               meant by that term of self-support may be 
               <br />
               debatable. The Finance Committee recognised 
               <br />
               that, and tried to limit its predictions to inferences 
               <br />
               that seemed completely reasonable, and to a 
               <br />
               period that might lend itself to sensible predict-

               ability. That was the only systcm we could work 
               <br />
               by and it was my understanding that our report, 
               <br />
               when it had been completed to our satisfaction, 
               <br />
               would be considered in the light of the problems 
               <br />
               it involved and in a decent and impartial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">way.</span> The 
               <br />
               business of the Convention was that of taking the 
               <br />
               report, examining it, correcting it if it was found 
               <br />
               we had made some mistakes, and then of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agree</span> 
               <br />
               ing in the end either on our conclusions or an 
               <br />
               amendment to them. Nothing could have 
               <br />
               astonished me more than to hear the attack on the 
               <br />
               report by the member for Bonavista Centre. I 
               <br />
               resented that attack, Mr. Chairman. It was un- 
               <br />
               called for, and it was uttered in language so 
               <br />
               insulting to the Committee and so bitter that I 
               <br />
               cannot help wondering just what was the motive 
               <br />
               behind it. I am not a politician and I came to this 
               <br />
               Convention to try and give some service to the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country,</span> I have no axe to grind and in helping to 
               <br />
               frame the report, I did my best within my personal 
               <br />
               limitations. The report presents a completely 
               <br />
               honest view of the country‘s position and its 
               <br />
               prospects so far as any person with some 
               <br />
               knowledge of business and finance can foresee 
               <br />
               them. Nothing was farther from my mind that I 
               <br />
               should have to come and hear that report tom to 
               <br />
               shreds in the destructive and discourteous speech

               rying out a job that had been given to us by the 
               <br />
               Convention, and the surest way to kill all thought 
               <br />
               of personal service of a public nature, is to have 
               <br />
               honest efforts subjected to the violent type of 
               <br />
