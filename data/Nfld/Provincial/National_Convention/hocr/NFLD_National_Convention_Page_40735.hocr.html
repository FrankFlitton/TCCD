               — and on examining the matter further we 
               <br />
               found that a great portion of our present 
               <br />
               revenue is coming to us because of the 
               <br />
               growth of our main industries. Now, these 
               <br />
               industries are wholly peace industries and are 
               <br />
               not dependent for their prosperity on war 
               <br />
               conditions. It is clear therefore that we can 
               <br />
               properly regard our present revenues as being 
               <br />
               anything but a result of war <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">boom,”</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett I insist that he did not state the 
               <br />
               paragraph at the first: 
               <br />
               “Now, making every allowance for the 
               <br />
               momentum of war expenditures carrying on 
               <br />
               after the close of hostilities and allowing for 
               <br />
               the gradual recession of this boom period, it 
               <br />
               is yet an obvious fact that our present 
               <br />
               revenues cannot be something dependent on 
               <br />
               war boom.” 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I have no wish to impede the 
               <br />
               progress of the House, but if you are going to 
               <br />
               draw any inference, is it too much to ask that you 
               <br />
               should quote correctly and in extenso the para- 
               <br />
               graph to which you ultimately intend to infer? 
               <br />
               Never mind paraphrasing, because any clause 
               <br />
               may be capable of several interpretations.

               Mr. Starkes On page 43 of the Economic 
               <br />

               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               “In this connection we have the following 
               <br />
               observations to make. in the first place the 
               <br />
               war has now been over for two years and we 
               <br />
               find our revenues even greater than our 
               <br />
               highest war time revenues. Now, making 
               <br />
               every allowance for the momentum of war 
               <br />
               expenditures carrying on after the close of 
               <br />
               hostilities, and allowing for the gradual 
               <br />
               recession of this boom period, it is yet an 
               <br />
               obvious fact that our present revenues cannot 
               <br />
               be something dependent on war boom. There 
               <br />
               must be some other cause, and on examining 
               <br />
               the matter further we found that a great por~ 
               <br />
               tion of our present revenue is coming to us 
               <br />
               because of the growth of our main industries. 
               <br />
               Now, these industries are wholly peace in— 
               <br />
               dustries and are not dependent for their 
               <br />
               prosperity on war conditions. It is clear there- 
               <br />
               fore that we can properly regard our present 
               <br />
               revenues as being anything but a result of war 
               <br />
               boom.”

               <br />

               Mr. Cashin I will sit down when the Chairman

               tells me to do so, and not you. You cut it out.

               Mr. Chairman However members may differ

               midway between yes and no. Therefore in reserv- 
               <br />

               <br />
               clusions, however erroneous, or ridiculous or 
               <br />

               time. Will you please go ahead, Mr. Starkes. 
               <br />
               Mr. Starkes l for one do not believe that, and 
               <br />
               the people of this country do not believe it, for 
               <br />
               they know different. We might as well face the 
               <br />
               truth that Newfoundland was in a very poor state 
               <br />
               up to the day the war broke out. Tens of thousands 
               <br />
               of our people were on the dole all the years from 
               <br />
               1930 to 1940. Then the war came and prosperity 
               <br />
               with it. Now the war is gradually passing away 
               <br />
               and in another two or three years it might be that 
               <br />
               its biggest effects will come to an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">end.</span> Will the 
               <br />
               government be raking in the millions of revenue 
               <br />
               that it is taking in today? Where will the govern- 
               <br />
               ment get the $30 million a year that this report 
               <br />
               says it will get‘.’.... Why should we be so anxious 
               <br />
               to bluff ourselves, to build up a house of cards 
               <br />
               that would collapse at the very first icy blast of 
               <br />
               depression? For some of our people this first icy

               breath of depression has already come.
