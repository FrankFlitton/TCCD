               <br />
               in the last year. We know that herring are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">avail»</span>

               able in vast quantities, and amounts already

               of the herring exported in this last year or two

               growing industry at its present level, new markets 
               <br />
               must be found. I did not hear Mr. Gushue’s

               <br />
               and his board have done a good job in respect to 
               <br />
               the herring industry.

               Getting back to the cold storage industry, you 
               <br />
               will note that there is not a cold storage or quick- 
               <br />
               freezing plant on the west coast, north of Port- 
               <br />
               aux-Basques or Isle—aux—Morts. It would seem 
               <br />
               that where the herring are in abundance, as in the 
               <br />
               Bay of Islands, would be the most logical place 
               <br />
               to have such a plant, since bait could be obtained 
               <br />
               not only for our own ﬁsheries, but exported for 
               <br />
               the same purpose. We do, during the winter 
               <br />
               months export quite a lot of herring to Canada, 
               <br />
               frozen by natural process. It is probable these 
               <br />
               matters have been gone into by the Fisheries

               ring to mention the importance of fish meal

               <br />
               that this phase of the herring industry can be 
               <br />
               developed on a far greater scale if given aid and 
               <br />

               important than the apparent subject matter of the

               <br />
               by the majority of the members of the Conven— 
               <br />

               <br />
               in particular, a clear picture of how in her struggle 
               <br />
               to establish herself, Newfoundland had to grow 
               <br />

               <br />
               great nations tended to depress the struggling

               tual wealth of her ﬁsheries, were treated as just 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               looked upon as the chief preoccupation of 
               <br />
               government. In our studies of the problem of 
               <br />
               governing Newfoundland we are almost in- 
               <br />
               variably faced with the fact that the greatest prob- 
               <br />
               lem of government is the dispersal of our people. 
               <br />
               People may vary in their interpretation of the 
               <br />
               reasons for our having settled so far apart from

               each other, but if my reading of Newfoundland
