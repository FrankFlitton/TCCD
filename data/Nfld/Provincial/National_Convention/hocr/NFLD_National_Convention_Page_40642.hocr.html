               impartially and fairly discharge my duties to His 
               <br />

               without fear and prejudice discharge my duties to 
               <br />

               My task is none too easy. It was a duty I did

               the most important of all, he is a good man.

               I am not underestimating the extent of my

               duties. May I remind members that the lamented 
               <br />
               late Hon. Mr. Justice Fox, because of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exacti»</span>

               tudes of his ofﬁce, in the opinion of many of us 
               <br />
               who were close to him, laid down the burdens and 
               <br />
               cares of this life at the untimely age of 54 because 
               <br />
               he had accepted the ofﬁce which I am now about 
               <br />
               to assume. I feel duty bound to say that Mr. 
               <br />
               Justice Fox sacriﬁced his life for his country just 
               <br />
               as truly as if he had laid it down on the battleﬁelds 
               <br />
               of Europe. This country is under an irreparable 
               <br />
               debt to him and to his family. Then again, as a 
               <br />
               great lawyer, and a judge of the Supreme Court,

               The high standards set by the Hon. Mr. Justice 
               <br />
               Fox will indeed be very difﬁcult for me to attain,
