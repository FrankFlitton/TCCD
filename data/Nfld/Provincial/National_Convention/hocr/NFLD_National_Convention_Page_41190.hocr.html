               <br />
               Books is an indirect tax. Its effect on the con- 
               <br />
               sumer is exactly the same as a customs duty. For 
               <br />
               example, if an article cost 50 cents either from the 
               <br />
               importer or the manufacturer to the retailer, the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst thing he does is add on the 8% tax, which 
               <br />
               would make the article 54 cents. After that it’s on 
               <br />
               the 54 cents that the retailer puts his markup or 
               <br />
               proﬁt. An article which cost 50 cents would 
               <br />
               cost 76 cents. I’ve taken one item at 50 cents, but 
               <br />
               that is the principle that we must have in mind 
               <br />
               when we think of a sales tax. It is exactly the same 
               <br />
               in principle as a customs duty. It should be borne 
               <br />
               in mind that there has been in the last 16 months 
               <br />
               a considerable amount of discussion on the proﬁt 
               <br />
               that is made on customs duties. and on the proﬁt 
               <br />
               on proﬁt. That’s the way it’s been said, exag- 
               <br />
               gerated beyond words to my mind.

               I was referring to the things we would give up, 
               <br />
               and in doing that I really moved on to clause 5 of 
               <br />
               the proposed arrangements. But there is clause 4 
               <br />
               and some people may have thought that I 
               <br />
               proposed to avoid clause 4, which concerns we]- 
               <br />
               fare services. Nothing was further from my mind. 
               <br />
               The welfare services enumerated in clause 4 are 
               <br />
               all good. Some such schemes must in the future 
               <br />
               be applied to Newfoundland if we are to keep 
               <br />
               abreast of the times. Any scheme however, that 
               <br />
               is applied to Newfoundland must be consistent 
               <br />
               with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">....l</span> national minimum standards, for the 
               <br />
               sole purpose of avoiding want, when the earnings 
               <br />
               of parents with large families for example, are 
               <br />
               either cut off or insufﬁcient to avoid that want. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, it is wasteful and unjustiﬁed to 
               <br />
               pay family allowances, for example, to a man 
               <br />
               earning $5,000-$10,000 a year. I’ll put this on a 
               <br />
               personal basis. I have never been able in my life 
               <br />
               to earn very much more then $3,000 a year. I have 
               <br />
               two children, and family allowances on the scale 
               <br />
               given by the Canadian federal government would 
               <br />
               be very nice. But I honestly feel that I am not 
               <br />
               entitled to family allowances as long as there are 
               <br />
               people in this country who earn way less than 
               <br />
               $3,000 a year, especially when I can offset my 
               <br />
               family allowances against what I would normally 
               <br />
               pay in income tax, which is the principle applied 
               <br />
               in the family income allowances in Canada. 
               <br />
               People in the same category may or may not face 
               <br />
