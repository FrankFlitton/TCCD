               I am not going to enter into a long argument 
               <br />
               for or against the Ottawa proposal. I think the

               pros and cons have been thoroughly dealt with by 
               <br />
               previous speakers during the recent debates. Al—

               though I have been absent during the past ten days 
               <br />
               due to temporary illness, I have listened in to the 
               <br />
               broadcasts with very much interest. I was par-

               ticularly struck by the fine argument of my co- 
               <br />
               member for St. John’s East, Mr. Higgins, and 
               <br />
               especially with the strength laid by him upon the 
               <br />
               enormous value of the strategic position of New— 
               <br />
               foundland. The point overlooked by many is that 
               <br />
               we have a very strong bargaining card in the 
               <br />
               undoubted fact that the use of Newfoundland’s 
               <br />
               strategic position is vital for the welfare and 
               <br />
               protection of not only Canada, but also of the 
               <br />
               United States of America and of Great Britain. I 
               <br />
               entirely agree with Mr. Higgins that much better 
               <br />
               terms than those offered should be obtained by 
               <br />
               reason of our strategic position. I feel quite cer-

               tain that with skillful negotiation by properly 
               <br />
               authorised authorities, better terms would have 
               <br />
               been ﬁnally, and perhaps grudgingly given by 
               <br />
               Canada.

               being a very strong supporter of confederation.

               He has already inﬂuenced thousands of voters in 
               <br />
               this small country to share his extreme views, 
               <br />
               even before any indication was received as to the 
               <br />
               basis upon which, in Canada’s view, we should 
               <br />

               of this Convention and probably for many 
               <br />
               months before, he has been advocating con- 
               <br />
               federation without even knowing what terms 
               <br />
               were available. Above all things, this conception 
               <br />
               of confederation is a matter of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terms.</span> Are we 
               <br />
               going to barter away our valuable strategic posi— 
               <br />
               tion without endeavouring to obtain something 
               <br />
               really worthwhile? I ask you sir, when a ﬁsher- 
               <br />
               man wants to sell his fish, what does he do? Does 
               <br />
               he sell it to the ﬁrst bidder? Or if there’s only one 
               <br />
               bidder, does he accept the ﬁrst offer that comes? 
               <br />
               In my experience he is shrewd enough to try very 
               <br />
               hard to secure a better price, and he uses every 
               <br />
               argument he can think of to do so. Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               and his supporters, however, appear to think it is 
               <br />
               sound business to jump at this unnegotiated and 
               <br />
               undiscussed offer.

               Now, sir, there are several good reasons for 
               <br />
               deferring this question of confederation until we 
               <br />
               have our own elected government. One of these 
               <br />
               is that, in my opinion, there is a strong tendency 
               <br />
               in the country for a trusted relationship with the 
               <br />
               United States of America, and the possibility 
               <br />
               should be carefully and closely investigated 
               <br />
               before the country is projected into the irretriev- 
               <br />
               able step of confederation with Canada. Our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fu«</span> 
               <br />
               ture prosperity, and particularly the pmSperity of 
               <br />
               our ﬁshermen, is mainly dependent upon recipro- 
               <br />
               cal trade with the United States of America, and 
               <br />
               this would receive its death blow by our entering 
               <br />
               into confederation. Some people, including my 
               <br />
               friend Mr. Bradley, who I’m sorry to see is ab- 
               <br />
               sent, apparently believe that the prospects of ob— 
               <br />
               taining anything by approaching to the United 
               <br />
               States of America are unfounded. But surely to 
               <br />
               goodness this cannot be ascertained until some 
               <br />
               approach is made. The recent arrangement dealt 
               <br />
               with the Geneva conference has made very little 
               <br />
