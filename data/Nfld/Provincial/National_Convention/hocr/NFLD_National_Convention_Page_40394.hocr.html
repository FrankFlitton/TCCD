               have to enter into a study period. We entered into 
               <br />
               that last <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">September.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Idid not say that, Mr. Miller. 
               <br />
               Mr. Miller Well you did, Mr. Hollett, and I 
               <br />
               think it is about time we got it over and not spend 
               <br />
               any further time in study on the matter. In 
               <br />
               presenting this report today without the least bit 
               <br />
               of information, I can only say that I can’t think so 
               <br />
               highly of the Steering Committee. It is as well to 
               <br />
               be frank. It does not appear that our opinion on 
               <br />
               this thing is worth anything. As members, must 
               <br />
               look at it in this way: we know the Steering 
               <br />
               Committee has met several times and what did 
               <br />
               they do? Bring back the same thing as they went 
               <br />
               out with. As far as I can see they threw a smoke- 
               <br />
               screen around the whole thing. I don’t think this 
               <br />
               should go through this afternoon. I think we 
               <br />
               would be very foolish to make a snap judgement. 
               <br />
               As I see it the thing is not even plain. “Interest- 
               <br />
               free loans” — what loans, those that we are going 
               <br />
               to look for in the future free of interest, or loans 
               <br />
               in the past? “Development loans” — what do we 
               <br />
               want them for? If we have no particular thing in 
               <br />
               mind we don‘t want it. Surely we are not going 
               <br />
               to go out and ask the world to support us. “The 
               <br />
               position arising out of the base deals.” What can 
               <br />
               we gather out of that? Perhaps something, per~ 
               <br />
               haps nothing. I would like to ask if there is a 
               <br />
               supplementary lease being applied for. I don’t 
               <br />
               think I would get an answer to that, because I 
               <br />
               don’t think the information is up to date. I don’t 
               <br />
               think we entered into the ﬁnancing of any airport 
               <br />
               except Gander, and I don’t think the British 
               <br />
               government is in a position to make a statement 
               <br />
               on that even <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now.</span> I don’t intend to elaborate, I 
               <br />
               think the Steering Committee should have done 
               <br />
               that. The Steering Committee has presented this 
               <br />
               with the attitude of “Here‘s something, and it will 
               <br />
               go across without a word.” 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, I don’t intend to 
               <br />
               delay the House on this, but I think perhaps the 
               <br />
               key to the whole thing lies in a remark you made 
               <br />
               a moment ago yourself. This list has got to be read 
               <br />
               and considered in the light of Mr. Hollett’s mo- 
               <br />
               tion of a week ago. That motion said that this 
               <br />
               House desired to send a delegation to the United 
               <br />

               <br />
               The same resolution went on to say that a detailed 
               <br />
               list of the points that the delegation would take 
               <br />
               up with the British government should be drawn 
               <br />
               up by the Steering Committee and brought into 
               <br />
               the Convention for confirmation. This is the 
               <br />
               detailed list. First, the public debt. Someone 
               <br />
               wants to know what were they trying to find out 
               <br />
               about that. This surely, that at the moment and 
               <br />
               since 1934 the British government is guaran- 
               <br />
               teeing our public debt, the principal and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in.</span> 
               <br />
               terest. Now the people of Newfoundland, before 
               <br />
               they vote in the referendum, surely need to know 
               <br />
               just what the position is and will be in regard to 
               <br />
               the public debt. Britain is now behind the debt. If 
               <br />
               we go back to responsible government will 
               <br />
               Britain be behind our public debt as to principal 
               <br />
               and interest? If we continue under Commission 
               <br />
               government, will Great Britain be behind the 
               <br />
               public debt? We do not know. Undoubtedly the 
               <br />
               delegation retuming from London will know and 
               <br />
               will pass the information on to the Convention, 
               <br />
               and through the Convention to the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. That is all there would be about 
               <br />
               the public debt... The interest-free loans, that can 
               <br />
               only refer to one thing, the loans made to Great 
               <br />
               Britain in the last four or ﬁve years. They are over 
               <br />
               there in England now, not paying us any interest, 
               <br />
               what will happen to them? We know that there is 
               <br />
               a terrible dollar situation. If they cannot pay the 
               <br />
               loan in dollars, in what way will we get it back? 
               <br />
               Development loans. Since Commission of 
               <br />
               Government, Great Britain has made loans for 
               <br />
               development <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">purposes.</span> What is the position in 
               <br />
               regard to that? It may be that Britain cannot make 
               <br />
               any more loans, but the population of New- 
               <br />
               foundland has got to know. With regard to the 
               <br />
               position arising out of the base <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deals.</span> If there are 
               <br />
               some we are not concerned over, there is no harm 
               <br />
               in getting the details anyhow. But about control 
               <br />
               over Gander, let us have the story. There is no 
               <br />
               need to go into details under the different head- 
               <br />
               ings. I do not care what the Convention does, if 
               <br />
               they wish they can make the list ten times longer, 
               <br />
               but to my mind, the ground is covered. I believe 
               <br />
