               Take note of the fact that Mr. Bradley makes 
               <br />
               no discrimination in the manner in which he 
               <br />
               placed the responsibility for the evils of which he 
               <br />
               complains. He conveniently combines the mis- 
               <br />
               deeds of Commission government with those of 
               <br />
               our previous responsible government. Mr. Brad- 
               <br />
               ley made much of the fact that our present 
               <br />
               prosperity is the result of war boom. He is ap- 
               <br />
               patently unable to see the real position, which is 
               <br />
               this: from an economic angle it does not matter a 
               <br />
               tinker’s curse why or how our prosperity began. 
               <br />
               All we are concerned with are these two ques- 
               <br />
               tions, ﬁrst: do we enjoy favourable economic 
               <br />
               conditions? and secondly: what are the prob- 
               <br />
               abilities in favour of their continuance?.... All this 
               <br />
               talk of how they came about has nothing to do 
               <br />
               with the case. Let us be done with such childish 
               <br />
               quibbling. 
               <br />

               There is another point in Mr. Bradley’s speech 
               <br />
               which I feel I cannot allow to pass. In drawing up 
               <br />
               his picture of this country he has actually wiped 
               <br />
               off the years from 1939 to 1947, with the idea of 
               <br />
               showing how our economy would have looked 
               <br />
               without the beneﬁts of the war. Now I am going 
               <br />
               to take a similar liberty, and remove another war 
               <br />
               from our history.... I refer to the ﬁrst world war, 
               <br />
               1914-18. Now as the speaker has fancied ita good 
               <br />
               idea to tie up war with ﬁnance in the years 1939- 
               <br />
               47, let us apply the same measure to the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               world war, and see what effect it had on our 
               <br />
               economic life. What do we ﬁnd? We ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               this country would be the richer by some $45 
               <br />
               million. I am speaking now from the wholly 
               <br />
               economic standpoint, and would not dare to 
               <br />
               presume to put any value on the priceless lives of 
               <br />
               those who made the supreme sacriﬁce, and whose 
               <br />
               maimed and crippled bodies are still with us, 
               <br />
               some of whom are in this very chamber. I suggest 
               <br />
               that the speaker put that in his calculations, and 
               <br />
               he will ﬁnd that the picture he sought to make is 
               <br />
               not so favourable to his cause as he fondly hoped 
               <br />
               it would be.

               For myself, I can see as far through a stone 
               <br />
               wall as Mr. Bradley, and I expressed my ﬁrm 
               <br />
               belief that there is every reason to believe that we 
               <br />
               will be able to make satisfactory arrangements

               <br />
               proper form of government in this country. I 
               <br />
               would remind Mr. Bradley of another interesting 
               <br />
               event which took place in his 50 year period I 
               <br />
               refer to the Bond-Blaine treaty. At that time 
               <br />
               America had no bases in Newfoundland. We had 
               <br />
               nothing to give her by way ofa quidpro quo, and 
               <br />
               she was prepared to accept our product, she was 
               <br />
               prepared to do business with us on favourable 
               <br />
               terms, but what happened? Canada interfered, 
               <br />
               she skilled the deal, she destroyed our high hopes. 
               <br />
               I ask Mr. Bradley how this deal would have 
               <br />
               compelled him to change his economic picture, 
               <br />
               and what this country would have been like 
               <br />
               today, praticularly for our ﬁshermen in every 
               <br />
               section of the country if this deal had not been 
               <br />
               deliberately sabotaged by the interference of the 
               <br />
               Canadian government.

               This speech I regard as an effort by one who 
               <br />
               is politically partisan. It is a demagogic appeal to 
               <br />
               stir unrest and dissatisfaction among our 
               <br />

               <br />
               all other countries. Canada was throwing out dole 
               <br />
               money by the millions. The USA was doing the

               nonsense! Look at England today, look at all of 
               <br />
               Europe... In our case we should thank Almighty 
               <br />
               God that things were no worse with us. We were 
               <br />
               one of the most fortunate countries in the world 
               <br />
               all things considered, and lam inclined to repeat 
               <br />
               Mr. Bradley’s words about marching to Zion. 
               <br />
               There is no Zion in this fallen world, where man 
               <br />
               must earn his bread by the sweat of his brow, and

               Mr. Chairman, I believe I have dealt with the 
               <br />
               several matters contained in this report which 
               <br />
               seem to call for some additional information. But 
               <br />
               before I go any further there is one matter that 
               <br />
               was referred to me outside this House the other 
               <br />
               day, which I think I should like to speak about. A 
               <br />
               member of this Convention asked me to explain 
               <br />
               something to the best of my ability about what 
               <br />
               happened in 1932, or 1931 Ithink, in connection 
               <br />
               with the gold standard. I have told it many times,
