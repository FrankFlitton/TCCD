               <br />
               Mr. Butt 1 was wondering if we need go so far 
               <br />
               in discussing this matter, if we could not get the 
               <br />
               basic principles to tie in closely with our terms of 
               <br />
               reference. As I see it, some years ago we had 
               <br />
               some territory on the Labrador which was, at that 
               <br />
               time, worthless. As the world market developed 
               <br />
               we began to realise that we had some potential 
               <br />
               wealth; later, as the market developed further, 
               <br />
               that there was a possibility there of real wealth. 
               <br />
               Now, if we had had the experience, and ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               resources, and the political climate, it is just 
               <br />
               possible that we might have been able to take our 
               <br />
               potential wealth and develop it solely for our own 
               <br />
               beneﬁt, and the proﬁt would stay entirely in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland; but we have neither the ex— 
               <br />
               perience, the ﬁnancial resources, nor the political 
               <br />
               climate, that is the whole thing. Therefore we say 
               <br />
               to outside capital, “You have found this potential 
               <br />
               wealth, if you will come in and spend a couple of 
               <br />
               hundred million dollars, dig out the hole and turn 
               <br />
               it into real wealth, the people of this country will 
               <br />
               get value in the form of wages, the government 
               <br />
               of this country will take from the company a 
               <br />
               certain percentage of its proﬁts, which in this case 
               <br />
               turns out to be 40%." I am certainly not a com— 
               <br />
               petent person to discuss matters arising out of this 
               <br />
               law. For example, I have the temerity to question 
               <br />
               the principle of royalties altogether, but who am 
               <br />
               I? It seems to me that we can’t expect to get any 
               <br />
               more than we are getting, and for our purpose it 
               <br />
               ought to be enough for us to know that we are 
               <br />
               going to get real wealth in the form of wages, and 
               <br />
               that we are going to get from the company a 
               <br />
               definite percentage of its proﬁts. But we can add 
               <br />
               something to this, because shares are sold to 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders, so that we can share further in 
               <br />
               the proﬁts which this company may make. 
               <br />

               materially affect the economy of Newfoundland

               and its people for all time. No doubt there are 
               <br />
               other important factors hiding behind the profuse 
               <br />

               <br />
               royalty on net proﬁts. The former is, to my mind, 
               <br />
               tied up literally for a song. The other is a joke if 
               <br />
               it were not so tremendously important; for 5% net 
               <br />
               proﬁts, as you all know, can be smothered out so 
               <br />

               that iron ore should be figured in cents for

               <br />
               Newfoundland, and in regard to this I say that 
               <br />
               clause in the agreement should be changed to 
               <br />
               provide a straight royalty of so much per ton for 
               <br />
               the ore exported.

               In regard to that key asset in the great Grand

               <br />
               Quebec that could be used instead of the Grand 
               <br />

               ly, is a subtle argument, yet so plain that I am sure

               delegates will not fail to take note; for if that is 
               <br />
               so, we may be quite sure that it cannot be obtained

               add Labrador also, if it can be gotten so cheap and
