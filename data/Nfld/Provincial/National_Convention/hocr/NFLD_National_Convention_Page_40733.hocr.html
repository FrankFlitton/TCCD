               <br />
               with rich soil is a rich country, and our soil is not 
               <br />
               rich, and it is a handicap. But to compensate, we 
               <br />
               have the rich seas at our doors, and there we have 
               <br />
               to look for our needs. As I see it, we have to 
               <br />
               produce more fish. We think we are a fish 
               <br />

               <br />
               produce, Iceland produces 30 pounds, so we are 
               <br />
               not doing nearly as much as we should. Except 
               <br />
               for the Bank ﬁshery, our shore and Labrador 
               <br />
               fisheries are carried on about four months in 12, 
               <br />
               and people just cannot live for 12 months on what 
               <br />
               they produce in four. Fishing time has to be 
               <br />
               lengthened. Fishermen have to be equipped so 
               <br />
               that winter ﬁshing can be carried on, the way it

               <br />
               large area of the Burin Peninsula prosperous. I 
               <br />

               It may sound strange to some, but to my mind, 
               <br />
               in order to make a proper beginning towards 
               <br />
               making our people more industry conscious, we 
               <br />
               have to begin in the schools. We need a course in 
               <br />
               economies with particular regard to New- 
               <br />
               foundland, to be taught in every school and in 
               <br />
               every grade. The course can tell the story and 
               <br />
               point out the causes of our past reverses It can 
               <br />
               suggest the remedies, or at least indicate the 
               <br />
               course along which the solution lies. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scholare</span>

               ships can be set up to encourage the study of this

               subject, and everything should be done to make 
               <br />
               our children economics conscious. Our schools 
               <br />
               should have boys’ and girls’ brigades, such as 
               <br />
               Boy Scouts and Girl Guides — even if the 
               <br />
               government contributed something toward the 
               <br />
               cost of the little uniforms for the children. i think 
               <br />
               navigation should be compulsory in all CHE 
               <br />
               exams, and that an increase in the educational 
               <br />
               grant to carry this into effect should be made, 
               <br />
               because it will be an investment that will pay 
               <br />
               better dividends to Newfoundland than all the

               sion of Government started a good thing with the 
               <br />
               town councils; the only thing wrong with them is 
               <br />
               that they are far too few. We need more and more 
               <br />
               of them, because from them will come the men 
               <br />
               and women legislators of tomorrow... Yes, more 
               <br />
               education is essential, and from it will come a 
               <br />
               consciousness and understanding for the need of 
               <br />
               great individual effort, and I believe that we are 
               <br />
               capable and worthy of such a programme, and if 
               <br />
               we carry out this programme we will be able to 
               <br />
               deal with our economic problems, so that we will 
               <br />
               make Newfoundland not only better known to 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders but better known the world 
               <br />

               <br />
               will not be lured into the waters of the Cabot
