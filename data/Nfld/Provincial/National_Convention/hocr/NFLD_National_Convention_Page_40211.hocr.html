               that free speech is limited on the Corporation’s 
               <br />
               stations, and that censorship is exercised over 
               <br />
               broadcasting by the Corporation. The point was 
               <br />
               put bluntly to the Chairman and General 
               <br />

               a deliberate falsehood. In denying that there is

               <br />
               they claimed were libelous because they 
               <br />
               reﬂected on the Commission of Government.

               <br />

               <br />
               go over the air would the Railway take an action

               not. They would be going to law with themselves,

               Mr. Cashin May I be permitted to turn back to 
               <br />
               page 3, subsection 1, where it says: “To erect a 
               <br />
               suitable building etc.” Where are they going to 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that building, and how much will it cost? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood A little further up on the same 
               <br />
               page you will see that at the end of 1945 the 
               <br />
               Corporation’s current assets amounted to 
               <br />
               $75,000, consisting of $68,000 cash, which 
               <br />
               amount included $9,800 accounts receivable, 
               <br />
               which have since been collected. In other words, 
               <br />
               at the end of 1945 they had cash on hand of 
               <br />
               roughly $68,000. You will notice a little further 
               <br />
               on in this report, they have been making $10,000 
               <br />
               to $20,000 a year, in fact it was up around 
               <br />
               $26,000 last year. I suppose what they intended 
               <br />
               to build the broadcasting house out of is their 
               <br />
               current assets, perhaps even getting a loan for the
