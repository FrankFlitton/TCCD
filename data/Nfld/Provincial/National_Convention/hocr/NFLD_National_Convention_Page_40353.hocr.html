               like to make one query. I note two settlements 
               <br />
               were started in 1934, Markland and Lourdes; 
               <br />
               Markland had 73 holdings at a cost of $644,000 
               <br />
               which was $8,000 plus; and Lourdes had 27 
               <br />
               holdings at a cost of $86,000 which was $3,000 
               <br />
               plus. Since both started in the same year, I was 
               <br />
               wondering if the Committee had anything to say 
               <br />
               on that point? 
               <br />

               Mr. McCarthy I might be able to clear that up. 
               <br />
               In the $644,000 spent in Markland we included 
               <br />
               equipment which was afterwards transferred to 
               <br />
               other land settlements. When Lourdes started 
               <br />
               there was no equipment except two old horses. 
               <br />
               Mr. Keough As Mr. McCarthy has said, they 
               <br />
               had considerable equipment at Markland, 
               <br />
               whereas at Lourdes the stumps were pushed out 
               <br />
               with cattle.

               <br />
               $5,400 per family; and this new settlement is 
               <br />

               Mr. Higgins While on the subject of the upper 
               <br />
               Humber — possibly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Keough could revert to 
               <br />
               this more because it is his district and he is pretty 
               <br />
               well aware of the situation. It strikes me that 
               <br />
               instead of having the land settlement in the upper 
               <br />
               Humber, breaking new ground, bringing new 
               <br />
               people together where there are no experienced 
               <br />
               farmers located, it would have been inﬁnitely 
               <br />
               better to have settled them on the numerous acres 
               <br />
               in Codroy Valley not being farmed by anybody. 
               <br />
               It is true that these acres, though not used, are 
               <br />
               owned usually by the people around there; great 
               <br />
               quantities are also owned there by people in St. 
               <br />
               John’s and it has never been used. You will agree 
               <br />
               that some of the best soil is situated in that valley, 
               <br />
               Would it not have been better and cheaper to have 
               <br />
               that new settlement in the Codroy Valley? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> 
               <br />
               Job and I had a talk with Mr. James Tompkins of 
               <br />
               Tompkins; he is a practical farmer and he was 
               <br />
               strong on the idea that the settlement would have 
               <br />
               been much more profitable to the settlers them- 
               <br />
               selves had the land in the Codroy Valley been 
               <br />
               used. He said he and a number of his neighbours 
               <br />
               would have been prepared to advise these set- 
               <br />
               tlers, not only with local knowledge, but to give 
               <br />
               them if necessary actual help in developing their 
               <br />
               holdings. It is right on the railway line and has 
               <br />
               everything to make a perfect land settlement. Did 
               <br />
               the government make a mistake in that matter?

               visages the settling of 300 families on the soil 
               <br />
               with a minimum of 50 acres per family; I do not

               Mr. Butt That was where they found the most

               soil; it is cheaper to work machinery in one area. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins The point is you have to break the 
               <br />
               soil, absolutely new; it is miles away from local 
               <br />
               habitation; you are putting men in the bush... It 
               <br />
               strikes me as being inﬁnitely more suitable to 
               <br />
               have steady farmers there than to put in a crowd
