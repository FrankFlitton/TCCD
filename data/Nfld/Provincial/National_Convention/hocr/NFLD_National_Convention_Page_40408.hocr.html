               Mr. Vardy I think there is some mistake. l 
               <br />
               believe this price started in 1937 with the FPU 
               <br />
               and the ﬁshermen in Bonavista Bay —— that is 
               <br />
               where this ﬁnding out what we were going to get 
               <br />
               for the ﬁsh started. I think Mr. Brown had some- 
               <br />
               thing to do with it. I have some recollection of 
               <br />
               that.

               Mr. Job I do not think it was as far back as that. 
               <br />
               I hesitate to say whether you are right or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not.</span> If 
               <br />
               we had notice of such questions, we could look 
               <br />
               up the information. I think it happened during the 
               <br />
               war. I do not think there was any ﬁxed price for 
               <br />
               ﬁsh in the spring of 1937 or 1938. Maybe Mr. 
               <br />
               Ashboume could tell us something about it? 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashboume I cannot remember at that time 
               <br />
               what the procedure was; but as far as I am con- 
               <br />
               cerned, i think we have to thank the people for 
               <br />
               the high prices of fish; those who put the money 
               <br />
               here in Newfoundland — the consumers, those 
               <br />
               are the people we have to thank —— people who 
               <br />
               were prepared to open up credits in New- 
               <br />
               foundland and give us the money before the ﬁsh 
               <br />

               Mr. Ashbourne The people who bought our

               <br />
               Combined Food Board, but that does not say that 
               <br />
               the people had to buy it; but they have been able 
               <br />

               <br />
               production is concerned, the Food Control Board 
               <br />
               would look after that; I believe within the near

               future probably there will be meetings of the

               Another matter mentioned by Mr. Newell, 
               <br />
               about the Newfoundland Fisheries Board inspec- 
               <br />
               tion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">——</span> that this should be extended to fishing 
               <br />
               vessels and all premises where fish is handled. As 
               <br />
               far as I know the Board does not have to inspect 
               <br />
               any fishing vessels on the Labrador or on the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Banks.</span> The idea is that it might be advisable for 
               <br />
               some fishery inspector to examine these vessels 
               <br />
               before they go to the Banks and also see them 
               <br />
               when they come back; also Labrador fishing ves-

               <br />
               consumption and the better the quality the higher 
               <br />
               the price we will get. And the more satisfaction 
               <br />
               from our buyers, naturally, will be when we give 
               <br />
               the best quality of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fish,</span> The government is to 
               <br />
               inspect the exporters’ premises; whether this 
               <br />
               would extend to every fisherman’s stage, I do not 
               <br />
               know.

               Mr. Hickman I cannot see that there is any 
               <br />
               credit due the Commission of Government any 
               <br />
               more than any other government which may have 
               <br />
               been in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">power,</span> It was purely the circumstances 
               <br />
               brought about by the war when the supply was 
               <br />
               shorter than the demand. They could guarantee to 
               <br />
               take any production and could guarantee prices 
               <br />
               because it could not be possible to fill the demand 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">required.</span> But with Norway getting back and 
               <br />
               Iceland and Great Britain in the producing and 
               <br />
               exporting market — Great Britain was a com~ 
               <br />
               petitor in Brazil, in Rio and other places —— when 
               <br />
               they get back, the supply will be greater than the 
               <br />
               demand; and I cannot see any possibility of being 
               <br />
               able to continue the setting of prices except 
               <br />
               through an international trade agreement. If all 
               <br />
               countries can establish a price then perhaps the 
               <br />
               fishermen will know what they will get. Until that 
               <br />
               agreement is made, I do not see how they can
