               that we have much to worry about in the fear that 
               <br />

               <br />
               there is such a high sense of justice. I feel that we 
               <br />
               might have more reason to be afraid of losing our 
               <br />
               Labrador territory not so much from anyone out- 
               <br />
               side taking a hold of it, not so much that Quebec 
               <br />
               will come and take it from us but perhaps there 
               <br />
               might be some weakness within our own selves, 
               <br />
               or in our governments of the future which might 
               <br />
               succumb to offers made for Labrador and we 
               <br />
               might lose it in that way. We are reminded here 
               <br />
               this afternoon that a deal was contemplated in 
               <br />
               selling it for $15 million. We had a question 
               <br />
               asked here the other day whether there was an 
               <br />
               offer made recently for the sale of Labrador at 
               <br />
               $150 million. These are very attractive ﬁgures, 
               <br />
               and there is a possibility that sometime our own 
               <br />
               government might succumb to accepting such an 
               <br />
               amount as that and thereby lose a great posses-

               I am very proud to represent that great 
               <br />
               country, that great territory in the north which 
               <br />
               means will mean so much to us as a country. But 
               <br />
               the concern that has been expressed so far in this 
               <br />
               National Convention about Labrador has been a 
               <br />
               concern about the iron ore deposits and the great 
               <br />
               timber resources that we have there. We must not 
               <br />
               forget that there is in Labrador a population of 
               <br />
               over 5,500 human souls... These great people in 
               <br />
               the north have received very little consideration 
               <br />
               from governments of this island in the past. They 
               <br />
               have been sadly and wilfully neglected by our 
               <br />
               responsible governments in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">past.“</span> It might 
               <br />
               almost be described as a shame and a disgrace on 
               <br />
               past governments, the way that Labrador has 
               <br />
               been neglected, until we found some iron ore 
               <br />
               deposits and became conscious of its great timber 
               <br />
               resources and so forth. If we as delegates were to 
               <br />
               go to the people of Labrador and ask them what 
               <br />
               they think of governments of Newfoundland in 
               <br />
               the past, I’m afraid that we would get answers 
               <br />
               that would humiliate us, as I have been 
               <br />
               humiliated very often when talking to people in 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               for the way that they have been treated... Why I 
               <br />
               bring this matter up, sir, is that recently two 
               <br />
               members of the Convention pointed out that 
               <br />
               when Mr. Smallwood brought in his budget for 
               <br />
               provincial expenditure, he omitted to put in 
               <br />
               $10,000 for dole for the Labrador people. That 
               <br />
               was pointed out by two members of the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion and I was asked on one occasion what I 
               <br />
               thought of it. It was pointed out also on that 
               <br />
               occasion that responsible governments in the past 
               <br />
               made provision for dole for Labrador and that’s 
               <br />
               very true... But very little other consideration 
               <br />
               was given to these people. Now in the plan that 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood had for the government of the 
               <br />
               future, there was preparation made for the health 
               <br />
               of the people in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Labrador....</span> There were plans 
               <br />
               made for the people of Labrador in that govern- 
               <br />
               ment envisaged by Mr. Smallwood as he brought 
               <br />
               in that provincial budget. Now dole, it is true, was 
               <br />
               something that legitimately belongs to them and 
               <br />
               some plansmade for them whereby they might 
               <br />
               be able to earn a decent living. From the family

               the daily press on December 27. My position was 
               <br />
               stated unequivocally, and I have never seen any
