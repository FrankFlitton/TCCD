               1 have wondered during the course of this 
               <br />
               debate, what has been in the minds of our ﬁsher- 
               <br />
               men and other working classes as they heard from 
               <br />
               speaker after speaker that their country is 
               <br />
               prosperous, has been prosperous, and will be 
               <br />
               prosperous. I have thought of the way of life of 
               <br />
               these men, of their unending struggle against the 
               <br />
               mounting prices of everything they buy, and the 
               <br />
               fear which they must entertain of a drop in the 
               <br />
               prices of what they sell. I have thought of the 
               <br />
               decades and even centuries of the grim battle they 
               <br />
               have had to wage with life. Is it supposed, Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, that these people are impressed by all 
               <br />
               this discussion in terms of millions, all this sup- 
               <br />
               posed prosperity of today? $40 million is roughly 
               <br />
               the amount being presently wrung out of our 
               <br />
               production annually — roughly half our whole 
               <br />
               export trade. But is there any indignant shout in 
               <br />
               this chamber over these terrible ﬁgures? Is there 
               <br />
               even an exclamation of disgust at this crushing 
               <br />
               burden placed upon the shoulders of our people? 
               <br />
               On the contrary, the govemment’s revenue is 
               <br />
               hailed with delight and cited as evidence to show 
               <br />
               how prosperous and self-supporting the people 
               <br />
               are.

               True, the government is prosperous, and it 
               <br />
               cannot be denied that Newfoundland as an ofﬁ-

               cial entity, a corporate body, is self~supporting 
               <br />

               <br />
               Newfoundland prosperous? Does that make the 
               <br />
               people prosperous? Or are the people poor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> 
               <br />
               cause of that very prosperity? And yet it is their

               prosperity, or the lack of it, which makes up our 
               <br />
               economy. They are the measure of that economy.

               They are that very economy itself. Their 
               <br />
               prospects are the prospects of that economy. The

               <br />
               Newfoundland’s economy. And what are those 
               <br />
               prospects? Those trends of today? Little con-

               sideration has yet been given to the possibilities 
               <br />
               which have agitated the minds of many states~

               men, economists, manufacturers, ﬁnanciers and 
               <br />
               merchants for the past two years, and which are 
               <br />
               regarded by many as an imminent probability, 
               <br />
               and by some as a practical certainty. I refer to the

               The chaotic conditions of world trade today 
               <br />
               are already plain to be seen. Nearly the whole of 
               <br />
               Europe lies prostrate in the aftermath of the most 
               <br />
               devastating war in human history. World states-

               men arc struggling with hope, but hardly with 
               <br />
               conﬁdence, to solve problem after problem aris~ 
               <br />
               ing from day to day. And in the ofﬁng —— we hope

               upon that world for any degree of prosperity, for

               no control at all over the prices we pay for what 
               <br />
               we buy. Already we see indications that all is not
