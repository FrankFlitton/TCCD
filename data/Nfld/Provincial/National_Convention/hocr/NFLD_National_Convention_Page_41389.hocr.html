               <br />
               I wish to make a few brief comments on the 
               <br />
               motion before the Chair. This motion is to the 
               <br />
               effect that in the forthcoming plebiscite, the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland be asked whether they 
               <br />
               want as their future form of government either 
               <br />
               the responsible government which they lost in 
               <br />
               1933, or a continuation of the present form of 
               <br />
               Commission government. Now although I may 
               <br />
               support this motion recommending that these two 
               <br />
               forms of government be placed on a ballot, that 
               <br />
               must not be taken to mean that I think these two 
               <br />
               forms are equally good, and that whichever form 
               <br />
               our people choose we will be just as well off with 
               <br />
               one as we would be with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">other,</span> Not at all. I 
               <br />
               mean anything but that. I have long ago come to 
               <br />
               my own conclusions as to what is the best form 
               <br />
               of government to recommend to the people of this 
               <br />
               country, and further, sir, I am prepared to give 
               <br />
               sound reasons for my decision. 
               <br />

               In my opinion there should be no need for any 
               <br />
               election at all over this matter. It should be simply 
               <br />
               a matter of giving back to this country something 
               <br />

               <br />
               give credit where credit is due. The Commission
