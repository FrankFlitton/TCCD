               tonight we can go ahead with the election 
               <br />

               Mr. Newell I am entirely in accord with the 
               <br />
               sentiments of Mr. Job. Sometime ago we decided 
               <br />
               we would send a couple of delegations, and when 
               <br />
               the letter was brought in here informing us that 
               <br />
               one such delegation would be received we went 
               <br />
               ahead and elected it. I don’t see why we should 
               <br />
               waste any further time. We have known that we 
               <br />
               were going to send a delegation to Ottawa, and 
               <br />
               frankly I did not know that today might be the day 
               <br />
               of the election, but I have known that we would 
               <br />
               be sending a delegation, and I have in mind who 
               <br />
               I should like to see on that delegation. I don’t 
               <br />
               need any further consideration or advice, and I 
               <br />
               don’t see why the matter should not be disposed 
               <br />
               of and then get on with our regular business. 
               <br />
               There has been altogether too much pussy-foot- 
               <br />

               there would be a delegation to Ottawa, and there 
               <br />
               was no comment last time when the delegation 
               <br />
               was elected to go to London. According to the

               <br />
               London and the other should proceed to Ottawa 
               <br />
               there was nothing in that motion to say that the 
               <br />
               delegation could not be elected before the other
