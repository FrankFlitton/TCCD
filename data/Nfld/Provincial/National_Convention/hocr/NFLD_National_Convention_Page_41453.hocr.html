               Sir, that has been done by the Ottawa delega- 
               <br />
               tion, and the Prime Minister of Canada himself 
               <br />
               tells us plainly in his letter to His Excellency the 
               <br />
               Governor, that on the ﬁnancial side the proposals 
               <br />
               he has laid before us are the best that Canada can 
               <br />
               offer. No delegation of an elected government, or 
               <br />
               any other government could do more. But not- 
               <br />
               withstanding all these hard facts the anticon- 
               <br />
               federates continue their refrain. “Give us back 
               <br />
               what we ha ”, they insist, “and in the ﬁrst general 
               <br />
               election the confederates can enter a political 
               <br />
               party. If they win a majority they will be the 
               <br />
               government, and they can go to Ottawa and 
               <br />
               negotiate terms.” That is the plan they have rather 
               <br />
               clumsily worked out. Let us take a look at that. I 
               <br />
               have already pointed out that responsible govem- 
               <br />
               ment might not Win at the referendum. The 
               <br />
               people may refuse to vote for it, for the simple 
               <br />
               reason that they don’t want it. In that event con— 
               <br />
               federation would not be submitted to the people 
               <br />
               at all, if the anticonfederate plans were worked 
               <br />
               out. Thus would they cheat the people out of their 
               <br />
               right to consider confederation by forcing them 
               <br />
               to vote for what they don’t want in order to get 
               <br />
               what they do want.

               sideration to such a vital matter is not in the heat 
               <br />
               and bitterness of a general election, where can-

               didates are vying with each other to get votes, but 
               <br />
               in the far cooler and more rational atmosphere of 
               <br />
               a referendum, where there are no candidates 
               <br />
               seeking election, and where the people themsel-

               <br />

               In this connection there is another point which 
               <br />
               is of great importance. This plan might easily 
               <br />
               bring a decision contrary to the wishes of the 
               <br />
               majority. I want to repeat that, sir. This plan 
               <br />
               might very well bring a decision contrary to the 
               <br />
               wishes of the majority. What guarantee have we 
               <br />
               that the party which secures the majority of the 
               <br />
               seats in the House of Assembly will have a 
               <br />
               majority of the total vote polled? I have seen 
               <br />
               candidates elected by ﬁve votes, and others by
