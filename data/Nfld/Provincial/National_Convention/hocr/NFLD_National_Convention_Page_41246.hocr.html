               are over, for them these terms would bring a little 
               <br />
               sunshine in the evening of their years, a little 
               <br />
               holiday from the grinding poverty they have 
               <br />
               known most of their days — a last gentle stand 
               <br />
               of comparative ease and comfort. For the people 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland these confederation terms 
               <br />
               would mean a happier land, a land of hope and 
               <br />
               progress. The people would come at last into their 
               <br />
               own. For the country in general, these terms 
               <br />
               would mean hitching Newfoundland’s wagon to 
               <br />
               the rising, shining star that we call the great 
               <br />
               British nation of Canada. It would mean linking 
               <br />
               our own dear Newfoundland to the third largest 
               <br />
               land in the world —- a land where the common 
               <br />
               people get a break, where they get a decent 
               <br />
               chance to live and rear their families. For New- 
               <br />
               foundland these terms mean security and political 
               <br />
               freedom. I support them with all my heart. I 
               <br />
               commend them to my fellow Newfoundlanders 
               <br />
               for their serious and solemn consideration. God
