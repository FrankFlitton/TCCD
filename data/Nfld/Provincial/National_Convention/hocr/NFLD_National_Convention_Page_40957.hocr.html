               <br />
               It came to the point where it could be submitted 
               <br />
               to a court... Finally the governments of New— 
               <br />
               foundland and Canada agreed to submit the mat-

               <br />
               Quebec was not in it; she had nothing to do with

               it. The Government of Canada engaged its 
               <br />
               lawyers and the Government of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               engaged its lawyers. I have read every word of 
               <br />
               that evidence. The Judicial Committee handed 
               <br />
               down its verdict 20 years ago. What was the 
               <br />
               verdict? They could see exactly where the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bound</span> 
               <br />
               ary lay in some respects but there was one part 
               <br />
               they could not see where the point was, and they 
               <br />
               said, “The height of land: ﬁnd that height of land 
               <br />
               and you have the boundary.” The Government of 
               <br />
               Canada accepted that verdict. They had no 
               <br />
               choice...

               it, but from the purely parliamentary standpoint 
               <br />
               he had no right to referto it. After all, a newspaper

               the thing is. When Major Cashin referred to it l 
               <br />
               did not know his purpose, but I think I should
