               Previous to the introduction of the original 
               <br />
               motion the various committees were working 
               <br />
               harmoniously on the primary task. The motion by 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood was not startling in itself, as most 
               <br />
               delegates seemed to take it for granted that we 
               <br />
               would want to know eventually the terms Canada 
               <br />
               was willing to offer under confederation. What 
               <br />
               was startling was the fact that it was brought in 
               <br />
               at that stage in our proceedings. Its introduction 
               <br />
               disrupted the work of the committees, and what 
               <br />
               is more, the tirade delivered by the mover tended 
               <br />
               to resolve the debate into an issue on confedera- 
               <br />
               tion.

               The amendment offered by Mr. Penney 
               <br />
               seemed a logical thing at the time. Nothing has 
               <br />
               changed since, despite well—prepared speeches 
               <br />
               and the masterly way in which many of them 
               <br />
               have been presented. I must confess that I am not 
               <br />
               impressed with the points made, and have not 
               <br />
               been inﬂuenced by them to alter my original

               The fact that several delegates reiterated, too 
               <br />
               convincingly, that they were not confederates, 
               <br />
               makes one feel we would do well to exercise the 
               <br />
               suspicions for which we are becoming prover~ 
               <br />
               bial, and look for underlying motives. Mr. Brad- 
               <br />
               ley, in a very logical address, presented with the 
               <br />
               ability of a master, has expressed concern over 
               <br />
               the time which might elapse in the setting up of 
               <br />
               machinery and the consequent delay in obtaining 
               <br />
               information. I cannot be persuaded, even by Mr. 
               <br />
               Bradley, that the setting in motion of machinery 
               <br />
               would entail such delay as would warrant our 
               <br />
               rushing to Canada without necessary facts about 
               <br />
               our own country. He talks of January lst, which 
               <br />
               gives us a mere six weeks. What does a little time 
               <br />
               or the expenditure of a few thousand dollars 
               <br />
               amount to, when we consider the momentous task 
               <br />
               confronting this Convention?

               <br />
               primary task, discovering not whether we are 
               <br />
               self-supporting, but rather to what degree we are 
               <br />
               self-supporting, and for how long a period we can 
               <br />
               reasonably hope to remain so, keeping in mind 
               <br />
               the unprecedented and unpredictable condition 
               <br />
               of world affairs. We would then be in a position 
               <br />
               to seek terms of federal union and should do so 
               <br />
