               as we had not given sufﬁcient study to the 
               <br />
               problems, we were without proper assistance and 
               <br />
               above all, we had no power to negotiate. I say, 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood in his reply in that same 
               <br />
               debate stated positively that if we entered federal

               this statementhas been proved to you quite amply 
               <br />
               by Hon. Mr. Job. I would quote to you further 
               <br />
               from the book by Professor Wheare: “It is indeed 
               <br />
               signiﬁcant that the one modem government 
               <br />
               claiming to be federal which grants the right to 
               <br />
               secede, the USSR, is the one where the exercise 
               <br />
               of the right is least likely to be permitted.” Yet 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood says we can always leave the 
               <br />
               union if we join up with Canada -—— maybe it is 
               <br />
               Russian.

               the Convention, and the question of discussing 
               <br />
               union with the USA as raised by Mr. Jackman‘s

               motion. Only two members of the Convention to 
               <br />
               my recollection supported this motion — Mr.

               <br />

               too late now for this Convention to explore the

               important matter in considering confederation 
               <br />
               with Canada arises. We have listened for many, 
               <br />
               many months to the advantages of joining with 
               <br />
               this land of heart’s desire — Canada. Would Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood in his reply care to state why so many 
               <br />
               Canadians are leaving Canada to reside in the 
               <br />
               United States? In the 90 years between 1851 and 
               <br />
               1941, 6,700,000 people immigrated to Canada. 
               <br />
               With all the hard work put in by the Canadian 
               <br />
               government, and all the money spent in 90 years 
               <br />
               to encourage immigration, the net gain was 
               <br />
               400,000 people. In the last boom period from 
               <br />
               1920 to 1930, Canada lost some 500,000 of her 
               <br />
               citizens to the United States, an average of 50,000 
               <br />
               a year. Since the end of the war in Europe in 1945, 
               <br />
               it is stated that about 40,000 Canadians per year 
               <br />
               have made applications to emigrate to the United 
               <br />
               States. How many Canadians go across the bor- 
               <br />
               der without being granted permission is impos- 
               <br />
               sible to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">estimate.</span> It is stated that two-thirds of all 
               <br />
               those emigrating to the United States from 
               <br />
               Canada are under 37 years of age. Due to United 
               <br />
               States immigration requirements, those granted 
               <br />
               permission are usually a picked group, and the 
               <br />
               result is Canada is losing her best type of citizens, 
               <br />
               the thrifty and better-trained people. The chief 
               <br />
               reason for the immigration appears to be the 
               <br />
               better wages paid in the United States. The cam- 
               <br />
               ings in manufacturing in the United States 
               <br />
               averaged $1.20 per hour to the Canadian 78 cents 
               <br />
               per hour. The statement that the increased wages 
               <br />
               in the United States is equalised by the higher
