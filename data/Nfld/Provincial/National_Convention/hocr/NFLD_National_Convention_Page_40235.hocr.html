               Mr. Hickman We have all had this report for

               three or four weeks and have had an opportunity 
               <br />
               to read through it. I move that it be taken as read. 
               <br />
               Mr. Reddy I would like to see the report read. 
               <br />
               It is going to the outports and they are interested. 
               <br />
               Mr. Job I second Mr. Hickman’s motion. This 
               <br />
               has been published in the newspapers and to read 
               <br />
               it would be a waste of time. There are other

               Mr. Smallwood It is true that this report has 
               <br />
               been published in the Daily News and in the 
               <br />
               Evening Telegram. I do not think it has been 
               <br />
               published in the weekly newspapers; and even if 
               <br />
               it had been in all the papers put together they do 
               <br />
               not reach more than a certain fraction of the 
               <br />
               population of Newfoundland. On the other hand, 
               <br />
               the radio does. It seems to me that all the people 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland and Labrador are entitled to all 
               <br />
               the information in this report and in all the other

               <br />
               seems to me, not only desirable, but necessary, 
               <br />
               that it should come before the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland. I know of no other way it could be

               done.

               how many employees they have, what income tax

               Mr. Smallwood It may be the real position 
               <br />
               when you take the nine reports and find out what 
               <br />
               is going back to the government in taxes out of 
               <br />
               the wages they pay. But why do it in a particular

               Mr. Job I think Mr. Higgins is right. We know 
               <br />
               that the Railway is costing us money, but it is not 
               <br />
               costing us as much as we imagine it is. It would 
               <br />
               be of beneﬁt if we could ﬁnd what it is costing 
               <br />
               the country in an absolutely net way. It may be 
               <br />
               difﬁcult for the Committee to get all details. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood If you do that, if you draw up 
               <br />
               an account and on the left hand side you show the 
               <br />
               total amount of money the government spent on 
               <br />
               wages, and on the right side you show the total 
               <br />
               income, if you show in that total income the part 
               <br />
               that is paid by their own employees in taxes, 
               <br />
               surely you would have to reduce it on the other 
               <br />
               side. Where would you end?
