               Before the Christmas recess, Mr. Hollett, in a 
               <br />
               masterly way I thought, summed up the history 
               <br />
               of the Canadian confederation from its beginning 
               <br />
               with the Quebec resolutions of 1864 down to the 
               <br />
               failure of the Dominion-provincial conference a 
               <br />
               few years ago, which was held as an outcome of 
               <br />
               a famous royal commission. When the British 
               <br />
               North America Act providing for the confedera- 
               <br />
               tion of the British North American colonies was 
               <br />
               drawn up, there was a clause in it, and it is still in 
               <br />
               it, that allowed for Newfoundland’ 5 entry into the 
               <br />
               union. Newfoundland representatives attended 
               <br />
               the Quebec conference of 1864, when the 
               <br />
               framework of the union was set up. Mr., after— 
               <br />
               wards Sir Frederic Carter and Sir Ambrose Shea, 
               <br />
               were members of a government which was 
               <br />
               favourably inclined to the entry of New- 
               <br />
               foundland into confederation. Out of this Quebec 
               <br />
               conference terms were drawn up as a fair and 
               <br />
               equitable basis under which Newfoundland and 
               <br />
               the other colonies might confederate. Quebec, 
               <br />
               Ontario, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia did 
               <br />
               confederate in 1867. Newfoundland was next to

               Now let‘s consider ﬁrst the position of New— 
               <br />
               foundland in relation to the other British colonies 
               <br />
               of North America in those far-off days. In 1864 
               <br />
               all those colonies were much of a muchness, but 
               <br />
               Newfoundland was in a unique position, as she 
               <br />
               has been all through her history. Nova Scotia and 
               <br />
               the others were ﬂourishing colonies under the 
               <br />
               system of responsible government, which they 
               <br />
               had had for several years. Previous to this event, 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, Newfoundland was still feeling 
               <br />
               her oats as far as her problems were concerned. 
               <br />
               She had only won responsible government in 
               <br />
               1855, nine years before; she had only been 
               <br />
               granted a representative form of government 
               <br />
               some 32 years before, while colonies like Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia and the rest of them had been enjoying 
               <br />
               such institutions for several generations, far back 
               <br />
               into the previous century. 
               <br />

               The history of Newfoundland up to that time 
               <br />
               had been one of repression by the mother 
               <br />
               country. The story of retarded colonisation is so 
               <br />
               well known now to all of us, or should be, that 
               <br />
               there is no need to labour it, but while New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders were loyal to the mother country 
               <br />
               they still could not forget the wrong that was done 
               <br />
               them, and just ten years before, when the French 
               <br />
               had been given concessions on their coast, a great 
               <br />
               outcry had been raised, and there was some talk 
               <br />
               of joining the United States. Imperial inﬂuence 
               <br />
               was a touchy point with Newfoundlandcrs, espe- 
               <br />
               cially when it impinged on their independence so 
               <br />
               hard bought and so recently gained, and they 
               <br />
               were jealous of it, and they chose their in- 
               <br />
               dividualism, and on that rock confederation 
               <br />
               foundered in 1869. There was too much <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sugges»</span> 
               <br />
               tion of doing what Britain wanted about the

               whole matter in Newfoundlandcrs’ eyes, half of 
               <br />
               whom at that time were Irish, and full of the 
               <br />
               wrongs of Ireland. To show you what I mean:

               no secret that the British government wanted a
