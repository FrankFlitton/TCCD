               of each member. But in brief the story is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this:1</span> it 
               <br />
               is not the Government of Canada which pays the 
               <br />
               old age pension to the people of Canada. it is the 
               <br />
               provinces — each one of the nine provinces pays 
               <br />
               the pension, and it pays it according to its own 
               <br />
               provincial law.... The province can pay $1,000 a 
               <br />
               month if it likes, but if the provincial pensions 
               <br />
               authority enters into an agreement with the 
               <br />
               federal government, the federal government 
               <br />
               says, “We will hand over to you 75% every 
               <br />
               month of $30 ($2250) a month.” But if the 
               <br />
               federal government hands over $22.50 to be paid 
               <br />
               out in old age pension, the provincial government 
               <br />
               must put $7.50 with it, making it up to $30 per 
               <br />
               month for people who have reached the age of 70 
               <br />
               years. It is not paid to everyone as the family 
               <br />
               allowance is. There is a means test. You can get 
               <br />
               $30 a month old age pension if you need <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> You 
               <br />
               can get it and still have a private income of your 
               <br />
               own from any source whatever of $240 a year, 
               <br />
               $600 altogether.... If you earn over that much, 
               <br />
               here is what happens. If you get $250 a year, $10 
               <br />
               will be taken off the pension. If I should have a 
               <br />
               private income of $300 a year, then my old age 
               <br />
               pension is not $360 a year, it is cut down to $310. 
               <br />
               If I have a wife, the same thing applies. If she is 
               <br />
               70 she gets $30 in just the same way. That is $60 
               <br />
               a month from old age pensions between the two. 
               <br />
               The only difference is that when the man and wife 
               <br />
               get a pension of $720 a year, they are not allowed 
               <br />

               <br />
               maybe he cannot work; maybe he cannot get a 
               <br />
               job. He does not get $240 a year; maybe he does 
               <br />
               not get 240 cents. But he has a house; if he did 
               <br />
               not have a house, he would have to pay rent. So 
               <br />
               the provincial pensions authority has the right to 
               <br />
               say this, “If you did not own that house you 
               <br />
               would have to pay rent, that is worth $96 a year 
               <br />

               <br />
               If it is worth $10 a month, that is $120 a year. He 
               <br />
               is still under the $240 ~— $20 a month is counted 
               <br />
               as income. How many homes in the outports that 
               <br />
               are worth up to $20 a month rent and occupied 
               <br />
               by persons of 70 and over, 1 do not know.... If 
               <br />
               they are, that is $240 a year income. If the rental 
               <br />
               value be $260, then that is $20 taken off the old 
               <br />
               age pension. It is not taken off his wife’s pension 
               <br />
               -—- it is taken off the person who owns the house. 
               <br />
               One other point: the pension is paid starting at the 
               <br />
               age of 70 only to those who need it; 75% comes 
               <br />
               from the Government of Canada and 25% from 
               <br />
               the provincial government. $750,000 a year 
               <br />
               would be our share of the old age <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pensions.</span> We 
               <br />
               now pay $260 a year for old age pensions, be- 
               <br />
               cause we do not pay until a man is 75 and then 
               <br />
               only $30 a quarter for two -— man and wife — 
               <br />
               $10 a month, that is what we pay.... <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> 
               <br />
               But this must be made <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">very</span> clear. If a person 
               <br />
               reaches the age of 70 and gets the old age pension, 
               <br />
               until he dies his property is his own. No one else 
               <br />
               owns it but himself. When he dies it is his 
               <br />
               widow‘s; nobody gets it but her. When she dies, 
               <br />
               if no one has contributed to their support, the 
               <br />
               government steps in, and out of the estate, if it is 
               <br />
               worth $2,000 or more, the government takes back 
               <br />
               the pension it paid. The idea is this: the old age 
               <br />
               pension is only paid to those who need it. It was 
               <br />
