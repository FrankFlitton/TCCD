               We asked Mr. Russell if he could give us any 
               <br />
               idea —- making allowances for all kinds of things 
               <br />
               that can happen in the world and in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span>

               foundland in the next eight or ten years — when 
               <br />
               the Railway might balance its budget. Perhaps it 
               <br />
               was not a fair question, but Mr. Russell gave his 
               <br />
               opinion that perhaps in about ten years time the 
               <br />
               Railway might break even. Until then, obviously, 
               <br />
               there will be an operating deficit. He is not pes- 
               <br />
               simistic about it. At the end of the last war (1914- 
               <br />
               1918) there was a great deal of pessimism over 
               <br />
               the losses on the Railway when people thought 
               <br />
               that for years to come the operating deﬁcit would 
               <br />
               be greater and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">greater.</span> It did not turn out that way. 
               <br />
               After a number of years the operating deficit of 
               <br />
               the Railway was brought down, and he thinks the 
               <br />
               same thing can happen again in the years ahead.

               Another point raised was this question of 
               <br />
               shunting individual cars of newsprint paper 
               <br />
               brought in from Grand Falls to the paper shed on 
               <br />
               the dock at St. John‘s. The cost of that shunting 
               <br />
               is included in the rental paid on the shed and

               Then we come to the question of what we call 
               <br />
               special rates. Mr. Russell and the General Freight 
               <br />
               Agent, Mr. Forsey, both objected to the use of the 
               <br />
               term “special rates." They produced for us CNR 
               <br />
               and CPR tariffs to show, in connection with 
               <br />
               pulpwood, paper, ore, oil and things like that, that 
               <br />
               the tariff charged is not called “special.” They 
               <br />
               have “Pulpwood ~— Carload"; “Pulpwood ~— 
               <br />
               Trainload.” This business of hauling ore by the 
               <br />
               trainload only happened since Buchans began. it 
               <br />
               is a new thing. The hauling of paper happened 
               <br />
               only in recent years, also the hauling of 
               <br />
               pulpwood. The Railway went after those com~ 
               <br />
               parties to persuade them to haul pulpwood and 
               <br />
               paper by the trainload to provide traffic in the 
               <br />
               winter months. Then the Railway had to give the 
               <br />
               companies a rate for hauling that. The only thing 
               <br />
               they had to go by was the rate charged for the 
               <br />
               same kind of work in Canada and the United 
               <br />

               [Mr. Smallwood gave detailed ﬁgures showing 
               <br />
               that the freight rates on the Newfoundland <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Rail.</span> 
               <br />
               way for pulpwood and newsprint were higher

               In connection with newsprint, the Railway is 
               <br />
               negotiating right now to get the paper companies 
               <br />

               <br />

               hauling of pulpwood, but their costs rose rapidly, 
               <br />
               so they were not making a proﬁt, but losing 
               <br />
               money on hauling. They negotiated and got an 
               <br />
               increase which came into effect on January 1. On 
               <br />
               oil, they got an increase in 1943, and after the 
               <br />
               present deal expires, they are looking for an 
               <br />
               increase of 30% from the oil companies. On ore, 
               <br />
               they got a 30% increase from the Buchans Mini- 
               <br />
