               Mr. Ashboume I am unable to give that break- 
               <br />
               down this evening, but we may be able to get 
               <br />
               those ﬁgures. As regards the inspection of hotels 
               <br />
               and restaurants, the department has supervision 
               <br />
               over restaurants and the people who work in 
               <br />
               them. As regards isolation wards on steamers, I 
               <br />
               think that is an excellent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">point,</span> I think there is a 
               <br />
               sick bay on the Kyle.1 I think in the construction 
               <br />
               of the new boats now in process of being built it 
               <br />
               would be a good idea to have places on them for 
               <br />
               sick people. We are a maritime country — lots of 
               <br />
               people cannot get to a doctor in hospital without 
               <br />
               taking passage by boat and it is sometimes very 
               <br />
               necessary for them to try and reach hospital to see 
               <br />
               whether or not they can be cured. They have no 
               <br />
               way of travelling, oftentimes, except by these 
               <br />
               boats. As pointed out by Mr. Miller, it is certainly 
               <br />
               too bad when these people who are going to seek 
               <br />
               hospitalisation are, through no fault of their own, 
               <br />
               forced to occupy staterooms with other pas- 
               <br />
               sengers who are travelling. When I see the 
               <br />
               manager of the Railway, Mr. Russell, I will make 
               <br />
               that suggestion.

               Mr. MacDonald Page 27 of this report — Vet- 
               <br />
               erans’ Affairs —- something struck me very for— 
               <br />
               cibly: “With regard to the men of the merchant 
               <br />
               navy, they appear to have been discriminated 
               <br />
               against. Those who were not recruited through 
               <br />
               the agents of the Ministry of Shipping received 
               <br />
               no consideration whatsoever, while those who 
               <br />
               were so enlisted for foreign service for the dura- 
               <br />
               tion, unless disabled, received only a small frac- 
               <br />
               tion of the beneﬁts of other units, many of them 
               <br />
               as low as one ﬁfth of the lowest amounts given 
               <br />
               other members of the forces...” It just shows 
               <br />
               what short memories governments have. Here 
               <br />
               you have a body of men whose help was largely 
               <br />
               instrumental in the winning of the war. These 
               <br />
               men carried quantities of munitions, food, etc. 
               <br />
               without which no war could have been won. I do 
               <br />
               not think any member of any other service will 
               <br />
               deny that they took exceptional risks in doing this 
               <br />
               work. Yet when the war is all over, they are 
               <br />
               forgotten. I wonder if the Committee asked why 
               <br />
               the men of the merchant navy were discriminated 
               <br />

               same uniform, they fought on the same front and 
               <br />
               still they are only entitled to $500 to $700. I 
               <br />
               wonder if your Committee enquired as to why 
               <br />

               From the very start I kept up my interviews and

               consultations with various men in connection

               with this scheme. As far as the merchant navy

               men are concerned, Mr. MacDonald will be

               surprised to know that out of 3,000 men, only 
               <br />
               about 60 received anything, and some of them as 
               <br />
               low as $20. We have that evidence from no less

               Mr. Vardy Yes, 60. Now they have the scheme 
               <br />
               changed. They give these men, if they are on 
               <br />
               relief, a limited amount of unemployment 
               <br />

               <br />
               served from 1939-45, is $700. That is the top 
               <br />
               limit. These men signed the same articles that
