               a guide as a cool head. But the cool head, the 
               <br />
               analytical mind, the wide vision, all will be 
               <br />
               necessary. I realised this clearer than ever the 
               <br />
               other day. When re—reading that classic on repre- 
               <br />
               sentative govemmentby John Stuart Mill, I came 
               <br />
               across a passage not inappropriate to this oc- 
               <br />
               casion, apassage worthy of serious consideration 
               <br />
               by each member of the Convention. It reads as 
               <br />
               follows: “To determine the form of government 
               <br />
               most suitable to any particular people”, says Mill, 
               <br />
               “we must be able, among the defects and 
               <br />
               shortcomings which belong to that people, to 
               <br />
               distinguish those that are the immediate impedi- 
               <br />
               ment to progress; to discover what it is which, as 
               <br />
               it were, stops the way. The best government for 
               <br />
               them is the one which tends most to give them 
               <br />
               that for want of which they cannot advance, or 
               <br />
               advance only in a lame and lopsided manner. We 
               <br />
               must not, however, forget”, John Stuart Mill con- 
               <br />
               tinues, “the reservation necessary in all things 
               <br />
               which have for their object improvement, or 
               <br />
               progress; namely that in seeking the good which 
               <br />
               is needed, no damage, or as little as possible, be 
               <br />
               done to that already possessed.”
