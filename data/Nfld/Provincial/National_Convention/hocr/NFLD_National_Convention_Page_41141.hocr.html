               tion of the word “Revenue”. It is as follows: “The

               <br />

               Now sir, I have shown that for a period of eight 
               <br />
               years, under union with Canada, and administer- 
               <br />
               ing this country as a province, that we would have 
               <br />
               to find in extra money $46 million after using up 
               <br />
               the $10 million trust account. That means that an 
               <br />
               annual average amount of almost $6 million will 
               <br />
               have to be found. How? What form of taxation 
               <br />
               has Mr. Smallwood in mind through which he 
               <br />
               could collect this extra money? However, let us 
               <br />
               suppose that Mr. Smallwood was in a position to 
               <br />
               cash in the money now held in sterling funds, 
               <br />
               amounting to some $16 million, and let him also 
               <br />
               take the $4 million cash surplus held in dollars, 
               <br />
               he would ﬁnd that he would have to ﬁnd at least 
               <br />
               $26 million. That would leave nothing in the 
               <br />
               treasury. It would leave no new hospital com- 
               <br />
               pleted at Corner Brook; there would be no new 
               <br />
               roads to encourage the tourist trafﬁc. What would 
               <br />
               be our position? The Province of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               would be bankrupt. Then what happens? What 
               <br />
               happens to any bankrupt concern? The creditors 
               <br />
               step in and wind up the business. And so we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               on referring again to the Grey Book, section 14 
               <br />
               under the heading of Reassessment of 
               <br />

               What does this section really mean? It means 
               <br />
               that when the Canadian government experts 
               <br />
               compiled these proposals and forwarded them to 
               <br />
               us, they knew that as a province, Newfoundland 
               <br />
               would be unable to balance its provincial budget 
               <br />
               without the imposition of extra taxation on our 
               <br />
               people, and that it would be necessary for them 
               <br />
               to make further arrangements as to our continued 
               <br />
               existence as a province. The Canadian govem- 
               <br />
               ment knows that if and when we enter union with 
               <br />
               them, we can never recover our former status. 
               <br />
               The British government knows this also. 
               <br />
               Everyone knows the result of investigations by 
               <br />
               royal commissions in this country, and for that 
               <br />
               matter in Canada. New arrangements would have 
               <br />
               to be made so that Newfoundland would be able 
               <br />
               to carry on. Either the people would have to find 
               <br />
               additional revenue in the form of direct taxation, 
               <br />
               or a deal would have to be made, possibly forced 
               <br />
               upon us, whereby the 1 10,000 square miles of our 
               <br />
               Labrador possession would be mortgaged or 
               <br />
               taken over on a rental basis by the Canadian 
               <br />
               federal government or by the French Province of
