               Mr. Cashin It is a matter which the Ottawa

               <br />

               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I will be honest about this. Ido 
               <br />
               not remember whether it was at one of our plen- 
               <br />
               ary sessions or whether it was in conversation 
               <br />
               with the Minister of Justice, but in one of these I 
               <br />
               know that I, for one, did deﬁnitely raise the 
               <br />
               question, under confederation, who would own 
               <br />
               the Newfoundland Savings Bank and who would 
               <br />
               control it and who would get the proﬁts... I think 
               <br />
               the profits of the Savings Bank up to now are over 
               <br />
               $800,000 or $900,000 accumulated profits. I 
               <br />
               raised the question, under confederation who 
               <br />
               would own the proﬁts? The answer was clear; no 
               <br />
               hesitation about it. It would be the same as now. 
               <br />
               The Newfoundland government would operate 
               <br />
               it; it will go on owning it; it will set the rates; it 
               <br />
               will own the proﬁts. The answer was not put in 
               <br />
