               our present prosperity to war conditions. I submit

               that We are looking at the picture upside down. if

               they said our prosperity began with the war, they 
               <br />
               would be more correct. The question is not what 
               <br />
               caused our prosperity, but will it continue? Is it 
               <br />
               stable? What we have to deal with here are not 
               <br />
               causes, but effects, If the discovery of oil in a 
               <br />

               <br />
               say that she is not really rich because she owes 
               <br />
               her prosperity to the lucky discovery? If America 
               <br />
               based her start to greatness on a war of inde- 
               <br />
               pendence, are we going to charge her with having 
               <br />
               obtained a false independence and prosperity? If 
               <br />
               something like a war happens in this country, 
               <br />
               which gives a new life to our industries, are we 
               <br />
               going to concern ourselves with the cause, does

               not the fact remain that we are prosperous and 
               <br />
               promise to remain so? Is not that the whole ques—

               <br />
               In 1949 they will be about $25 million. The total

               the total exports of our paper from 1909 to 1946. 
               <br />
