               the circumstances which have produced these

               figures. The answer is, I suppose, in the fact that

               the countries buying our newsprint are wealthy 
               <br />

               <br />
               from all accounts will get poorer. The answer is 
               <br />
               obvious. We must get fish markets in rich

               Like other speakers, I cannot subscribe to the 
               <br />
               theory that our continually increasing revenues 
               <br />
               are due to the war. Anyone who heard Mr. 
               <br />
               Hollett’s capable discussion on that point will 
               <br />
               agree. And for that matter, even if they were 
               <br />
               partly caused by that fact, isn’t it oppositely true 
               <br />
               that our expenditures are also high for the same 
               <br />
               reason, and that a decrease in one will mean a 
               <br />
               decrease in the other?

               I don’t think either that this report tries to 
               <br />
               claim that all is right with the world. But it does 
               <br />
               show, as well as it can be shown, that things look 
               <br />
               pretty good for Newfoundland. I grant you that 
               <br />
               there are genuine cases of hardship in the 
               <br />
               country. There are lots of men unemployed in St. 
               <br />
               John’s today, besides ﬁshermen in our bays who 
               <br />
               may not have made a good season. But am I to 
               <br />
               say Newfoundland is not ﬁnancially sound and 
               <br />
               has good prospects because of these facts? It is 
               <br />
               the job of government to provide avenues of 
               <br />
               employment for its people, and if there are more 
               <br />
               hands in St. John’s than work to go around, or if 
               <br />
               the Labrador ﬁshery is failing, then it is up to the 
               <br />
               government to give the necessary leadership for 
               <br />
               people affected by these conditions to turn to 
               <br />
               other sources of industry, or other areas.

               I should like now to refer to the conclusions 
               <br />
               of the Committee. They state that Newfoundland 
               <br />
               is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selfvsupporting</span> country, based on sound 
               <br />
               economic factors; and that all the evidence avail-

               opinion the Committee‘s second conclusion is of 
               <br />
               far more importance than their ﬁrst. As the Com-

               <br />
               merely to labour the obvious. I think it safe to say 
               <br />
               that the majority of delegates when they came to 
               <br />
               this Convention had a closed mind on this sub- 
               <br />
               ject. They believed, I know I did, that the country 
               <br />
               was then self-supporting, and I feel sure that a 
               <br />
               great many of the people of Newfoundland and 
               <br />
               Labrador believed it also. However, while ldid 
               <br />
               not exactly have doubts, I did have a lack of 
               <br />
               understanding as to just how far this condition of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selfusupport</span> was due to wartime conditions. l

               confess I was eager for enlightenment on this

               <br />
               removed from the minds of our people and enable
