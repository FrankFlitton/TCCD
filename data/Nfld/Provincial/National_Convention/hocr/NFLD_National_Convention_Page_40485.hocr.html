               all, but a minute ago Mr. Jones referred to that 
               <br />
               amount of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1.1</span> million as being dole. That’s not 
               <br />
               quite the case. It is $1.1 million for this year, but 
               <br />
               it is not all able—bodied relief or dole; it is for the 
               <br />
               sick poor, for widows, children, for special food 
               <br />
               orders, extra nourishment that is, and coal and 
               <br />
               clothing. That $1.1 million is for this year to the 
               <br />
               end of March. Now if you take the report and add 
               <br />
               up the different things under the different head- 
               <br />
               ings it is astonishing, and I am sure if Major 
               <br />
               Cashin has not already done it he will be 
               <br />
               astonished when he sees what the total comes to 
               <br />
               —— $1.1 million for those items I have just men- 
               <br />
               tioned. Widows and orphans, including board 
               <br />
               and lodging, is another $450,000; old age pen- 
               <br />
               sions $250,000; grants to orphanages $40,000 
               <br />
               odd; aged and inﬁrm $78,000 - that’s a total of 
               <br />
               $2 million this very year for relief of one kind and 
               <br />
               another —if you can call old age pensions relief, 
               <br />
               and perhaps you should not, but it is in that 
               <br />
               general classiﬁcation -— $2 million a year. Now 
               <br />
               in the old days the sick poor and widows and 
               <br />
               children of widows and special food orders, coal 
               <br />
               and clothing, that was all called dole. You take 
               <br />
               the ﬁgures today and you can ﬁnd there are only 
               <br />
               300-400 people on the dole. That seems to com- 
               <br />
               pare very well with six or eight years ago, but the 
               <br />
               reason is this, that they have changed the system. 
               <br />
               What is now called dole is only able~bodied 
               <br />
               relief, but in the old days up to the war everything 
               <br />
               was called dole, and if you included everything 
               <br />
               today in the year that ended yesterday the govem- 
               <br />
               merit spent $2 million on public relief. It is an 
               <br />
               astonishing ﬁgure.

               <br />
               Public Health and Welfare, especially with the 
               <br />
               relieving ofﬁcer. As I see it this widow that was

               <br />
               the relieving officer can support herself. I 
               <br />
               remember a case or two where the widow has 
               <br />
               been living with the son, and the son has a large 
               <br />
               family, and in the opinion of the relieving ofﬁcer 
               <br />
               the son could very well look after the mother as 
               <br />
               well as his wife and children, and the OK from 
               <br />
               the relieving ofﬁcer did not go on the form. If

               that’s the principle of the Department of Public

               Health and Welfare, that this poor old soul must

               there are ofﬁcials of this department who have

               <br />
