               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Butt has touched loosely 
               <br />
               on a philosophical question which is receiving a 
               <br />
               great deal of debate in Canada and the United 
               <br />
               States; that is, on the alleged trend towards 
               <br />
               centralisation. He is overlooking something. The 
               <br />
               royal commission which lasted three years, and 
               <br />
               which scoured Canada from one end to the other 
               <br />
               holding hundreds of hearings, went into the 
               <br />
               whole question of dominion-provincial relations. 
               <br />
               One of the members was Mr. MacKay, editor of 
               <br />
               a book which each member has, a book to which 
               <br />
               contributions were written by a number of 
               <br />
               people. That Rowell-Sirois Commission inves- 
               <br />
               tigated the whole story. Wilfred Eggleston was 
               <br />
               one of the members of that commission It was a 
               <br />
               most complete, most exhaustive examination of 
               <br />
               the country. Three thundering volumes, which 
               <br />
               perhaps Mr. Butt consulted. That commission 
               <br />
               recommended very strongly the very idea which 
               <br />
               was put into effect in part in the wartime tax 
               <br />
               agreement, and which has been put into effect in 
               <br />

               provincial conference which was held beginning

               universal at the age of 65, regardless of their 
               <br />
               means. A national health programme, calling for

               expenditure of $300 million to be distributed 
               <br />

               <br />
               clinics, all kinds of activities for public health. A

               conference harped upon the increasing tendency 
               <br />
               towards centralisation in Canada. In studying 
               <br />
               Canadian history, we should not only look at the 
               <br />
               things said by Messrs. Duplessis and Drew, both 
               <br />
