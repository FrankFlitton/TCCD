               with the views of the Convention, be put forward. 
               <br />
               We cannot alter these terms.

               Mr. Chairman Perhaps I should say “may not”. 
               <br />
               Mr. Jackman Here is another matter. Possibly 
               <br />
               we can’t do it, but I would suggest that we should 
               <br />
               discuss the matter here with a view to an amend- 
               <br />
               ment of the terms. We could send it in at any rate, 
               <br />
               and at least it would give us a chance to say that 
               <br />
               we are not going to sit here and have our hands 
               <br />
               tied and do as we are told to do. We should have 
               <br />
               a deﬁnite stand on matters like this. As far as I 
               <br />
               can see, it is just boiled down to a question of 
               <br />
               forms of government. We don’t have the ﬁnal 
               <br />
               choice, but at least we should be able to try them 
               <br />
               out on the matter anyway. When we are told that 
               <br />
               we can’t do this or that, why don’t we try it? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Will you consider whether or 
               <br />
               not, if your motion is acceded to, it would have 
               <br />
               the effect of limiting the choice of the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, and tying their hands, by giving 
               <br />
               them only two forms of choice instead of several? 
               <br />
               I don’t think we should deal with that phase of 
               <br />
               the matter. We are acting under certain statutory 
               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. Hollett If we read that section 39, those are

               <br />

               ment in this country. I fail to see how he can have 
               <br />
               two minds about it. He may be satisﬁed to have 
               <br />
               other forms of government, but there is nothing
