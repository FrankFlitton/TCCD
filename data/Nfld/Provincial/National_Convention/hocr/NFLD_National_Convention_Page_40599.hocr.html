               that in this house two members had asked <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard“</span>

               ing discussions with the United States, and the 
               <br />
               late Chairman of that time gave the answer, “Yes, 
               <br />
               it was a matter that could be discussed." And 
               <br />
               Professor Wheare concurred I think I brought 
               <br />
               out that in my opinion there were more people in

               <br />
               than in confederation with Canada. That is what 
               <br />
               I said, and I‘m prepared to defend it. I am <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some»</span>

               what surprised at my friend across the row there,

               Mr, Keough..., I’m not looking for a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">handout.</span> I 
               <br />
               never had always a silver spoon and I don’t know

               <br />
               I’ve had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bad.</span> People call us poor, and plenty over

               there, but that’s more than the British people got 
               <br />
               over there. They haven’t got food in plenty — far 
               <br />
               from it. Now I’m of the opinion that when the 
               <br />
               matter was referred to in connection with bases, 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               of this Convention. There are things brought out 
               <br />
               in the conversation which this Convention should

               Mr. Chairman The two alternatives, either a

               free discussion or a formal discussion, were 
               <br />
               presented to all present. And Lord Addison made 
               <br />
               the statement that he assumed if we agreed to 
               <br />
               conduct our negotiations or our conversations, 
               <br />
               whichever you like to call them, freely, it would 
               <br />
               be essential that all statements made by in- 
               <br />
               dividual members should be regarded as com- 
               <br />
               pletely conﬁdential. I agreed. No one so far as I 
               <br />
               know dissented. Consequently, Lord Addison 
               <br />
               wasjustiﬁed in assuming thateverything that was 
               <br />
               said would be kept conﬁdential. Now, if there’s 
               <br />
               any particular statement that was made by 
               <br />
               anyone present, that any member of that delega- 
               <br />
               tion thinks should be laid before this Convention, 
               <br />
               there is a way for him to get <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> And that is obtain 
               <br />
               the permission of Lord Addison to disclose it. But 
               <br />
               until that is done, no member of that delegation 
               <br />
               has any right to disclose a single statement made 
               <br />
