               There is a new contract coming up in 1949. 
               <br />
               When the last contract came up, I remember the 
               <br />
               company approached the Monroe1 government 
               <br />
               to pass this new contract. The government did not 
               <br />
               like it, they were ashamed of it. What did they 
               <br />
               do? They sent over to the Wabana Mineworkers’ 
               <br />
               Union and asked them to send over a delegation 
               <br />
               so that the government could explain the 
               <br />
               proposed contract to them. The delegation came 
               <br />
               and met the government, and the proposed agree- 
               <br />
               ment was read out and there was a dead silence 
               <br />
               when they ﬁnished. The government then said 
               <br />
               that if the mineworkers of Bell Island were satis- 
               <br />
               fied with the agreement, the government might 
               <br />
               feel justiﬁed in bringing it before the House of 
               <br />
               Assembly and getting itpassed, but if the workers 
               <br />
               were not satisﬁed then they would not bring it 
               <br />
               before the House. That was in 1927, I think, or 
               <br />
               1926. I don’t think any agreement was signed, at 
               <br />
               least it was not passed, and it rode on without any 
               <br />
               agreement until 1929, when this present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agree</span>

               satisﬁed with the taxation we are getting out of 
               <br />
               Bell Island. I would rather see that corporation

               pay it — if it can be done without hurting the

               ask Mr. Higgins. On page 1 1, the breakdown of 
               <br />
               employees’ earnings for 1946; 1,182 men, most- 
               <br />
               ly casual labour, earned less than $1 ,000, and 509 
               <br />
               regular employees earned from $1,000 to $1,500, 
               <br />
               etc., a total of 2,807 men. Actually there were not 
               <br />
               that many employed, were there? 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Higgins There were a certain number of

               ﬂoaters, if you can call it that. They come in for 
               <br />
               a period and then they leave and there are others 
               <br />
               taken on. In other words, to have something like

               800 working men constantly employed you really 
               <br />
               have to employ about 1,200 during the year. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Is that it? Is it that there is such

               a turnover of labour? Is it that, or is it because in

               <br />
               explanation. Here is the position: we mine ore in 
               <br />
               wintertime and stockpile. That means that we 
               <br />
               have a certain number of men who service the 
               <br />
               ships during the shipping season, and that starts 
               <br />
               around the middle of April, and continues from 
               <br />
               then till December. While we are taking this ore 
               <br />
               in stockpiles off the surface, we have around 300 
               <br />
               seasonal workers. At the end of the year that’s
