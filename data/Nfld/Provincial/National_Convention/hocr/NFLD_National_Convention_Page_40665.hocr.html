               you know what happened at our meeting this 
               <br />
               morning in connection with these ﬁgures, that is

               think that we produced sufﬁcient evidence this 
               <br />
               morning to show that no such thing took place, 
               <br />
               and that the Finance Committee has been upheld. 
               <br />
               Under such circumstances Mr. Chairman, I 
               <br />
               would ask you to make an ofﬁcial ruling on this 
               <br />

               Cashin has raised this matter, and as it refers to 
               <br />
               my remarks on Friday past, I would like to say 
               <br />
               that at no time since the report was tabled have I

               finest reports laid before this Convention, and 
               <br />
               one of the most important. At no time have I

               thought that the Finance Committee has mis-

               <br />
               asked for a ruling. I think we should have this 
               <br />
               ruling.

               Steering Committee I am obligated to make a

               I should brieﬂy recapitulate to members what 
               <br />
               took place, the reason for convening the meeting

               It has been reported to the Steering Committee 
               <br />
               that some of the remarks made by the member for 
               <br />
               Bonavista Centre Friday afternoon last created in 
               <br />
               the minds of the public some opinions which 
               <br />
               unquestionably affected the integrity and honesty 
               <br />
               of the Finance Committee, who are responsible 
               <br />
               for that report... The position brieﬂy is this. 
               <br />
               Members will recall that approximately some six 
               <br />
               months ago a Finance Report was tabled, and on 
               <br />
               pages 112 and l 13 certain ﬁgures had been com- 
               <br />
               piled and set forth. In the course of the debate 
               <br />
               which occurred on Friday last, Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               questioned the correctness of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁgures</span> I want 
               <br />
               to draw a distinction here. The question with 
               <br />
               which I have to concern myself is whether or not 
               <br />
               the ﬁgures had been independently corroborated 
               <br />
               to the satisfaction of the Steering Committee as 
               <br />
               being correct and unimpeachable.... In Steering 
               <br />
               Committee the ﬁgures for the years 1897-98 to 
               <br />
               1918-19, both inclusive, were accepted by both 
               <br />
               parties to the controversy as being correct. From 
               <br />
               the period 1919-20 to 1934-35 these were shown 
               <br />
               to be correctly copied from the Auditor General‘s 
               <br />
               reports... I therefore rule that for the period 1919- 
               <br />
               20 to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">193435</span> the independent corroboration to 
               <br />
               be found in the Auditor General’s reports leaves 
               <br />
               me no alternative than to conclude that these 
               <br />
               ﬁgures were correctly copied and taken from the 
               <br />
               Auditor General’s reports. With regard to the 
               <br />
               remaining period, that is to say from 1935-36 to 
               <br />
               Dec. 31, 1946, no evidence one way or the other 
               <br />
               was submitted to us this morning, perhaps for the 
               <br />
               excellent reason that it is not available; but I am 
               <br />
               forced to the conclusion that these figures are 
               <br />
               correct for two reasons: in the ﬁrst place all 
               <br />
               ﬁgures prior to the year 1935-36 were found 
               <br />
               correct... If, therefore, it is found that two-thirds 
               <br />
               of a report is correct, then I am driven to the 
               <br />
               conclusion that the remaining one—third must be 
               <br />
               likewise correct, unless there has been evidence 
               <br />
               adduced to warrant my reaching a contrary con— 
               <br />
               clusion.... It becomes my duty to hold that the 
               <br />
               ﬁgures were correctly copied, and they should 
               <br />
