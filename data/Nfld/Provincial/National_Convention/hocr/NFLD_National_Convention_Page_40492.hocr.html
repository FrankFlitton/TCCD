               Mr. Vardy We did make numerous inquiries

               tee knows I was strong on it. The only answer to 
               <br />
               these enquiries was that this scheme was framed 
               <br />
               by the Commissioner for Finance and the Com-

               <br />

               costs have lifted three times or more. I was
