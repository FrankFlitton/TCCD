               Mr. Smallwood I do not want to prolong this

               discussion, but this happens to be a popularly

               to deal with it. There is a matter I would like to

               Would this be a matter for the committee ——

               could it be arranged through the issuance of tick-

               ets or through delegates, so that anyone who 
               <br />
               wishes to attend a particular session may do so?
