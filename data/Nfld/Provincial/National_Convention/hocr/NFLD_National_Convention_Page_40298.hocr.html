               ploited us, and that the British government were

               traitors to us. I won’t say any more on that, but if 
               <br />
               I think that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Smallwood is bound, as a New— 
               <br />
               foundlander, to incorporate this in the general

               <br />
               is are two different things. It was necessary to 
               <br />
               spend more money to change over to a peace- 
               <br />
               time basis. Who is to ﬁnd that money? New- 
               <br />
               foundland. Who is to find it next year? 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. Who is to get the accommoda- 
               <br />
               tion? The British government. I am quite sure that 
               <br />
               Great Britain will recover her economic security 
               <br />
               in the near future, and I don’t see why we should 
               <br />
               go on year after year spending money to keep 
               <br />
               Gander alive. What is more, it is still a big ques- 
               <br />
               tion as to whether Gander will be a success or not. 
               <br />
               Are we going to pay for the experiment? If it is a 
               <br />
               ﬂop, we are a ﬂop with it.

               Mr. Smallwood I am very much in sympathy 
               <br />
               with what Mr. Miller says, but I don’t think he 
               <br />
               quoted me <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">right,</span> I did not say that the British

               cause I did not think it. If the British government 
               <br />
               is footing the bills, and if 1,000 or 1,200 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span>

               foundlanders are getting work and decent wages, 
               <br />
               that is not exploitation. If it is, God send a lot 
               <br />
               more like it. If we get work at Gander under 
               <br />
               decent conditions, and there is a loss of a million 
               <br />

               <br />
               Newfoundland, that is not exploitation...

               Mr. Higgins I am still in doubt if he really feels 
               <br />
               that we can get $300 as a landing fee or not. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I will say this very brieﬂy. If we 
               <br />
               had our own government, responsible govern-

               ment, and I am opposed to it just as much as 
               <br />
               Major Cashin is for it, but if we had it, we could 
               <br />
               charge what we liked to land at Gander. We could 
               <br />
               charge $5,000, or $5 million or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$300,</span> If we 
               <br />
               charged $300, the airlines would pay it and use

               <br />

               <br />
               it? It’s a question of gas, from New York to 
               <br />
               Gander, the number of extra passengers that a 
               <br />

               true that in December, you may remember, some

               planes overﬂew Gander, nonstop from New York 
               <br />
               to Ireland, which they did because they only had 
               <br />
               a part load of passengers. They are always filled 
               <br />
               coming from Europe to America, but sometimes 
               <br />
               they are only half full going from America to
