               I should like to refer to a very important state- 
               <br />
               ment made by Mr. Crosbie some few days ago. 
               <br />
               He said, Mr. Chairman, that our sales of ﬁsh to 
               <br />
               Spain and Italy were only possible because of 
               <br />
               trade arrangements made through the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom government. In the event of confedera— 
               <br />
               tion these arrangements would not apply, conse— 
               <br />
               quently Newfoundland would be unable to make 
               <br />
               a sale to these countries. Last night, in an address 
               <br />
               at Btuns Night, Mr. Gushue, Chairman of the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland Fisheries Board, said that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New«</span> 
               <br />
               foundland produces for export around a million 
               <br />
               quintals of salt cod per year. At least half, at times 
               <br />
               more than half, is sold to European markets. The 
               <br />
               loss of these markets would be a death blow to 
               <br />
               the industry. Our trade has been made possible 
               <br />
               by the use of sterling convened into dollars. 
               <br />
               Before the war, when two of these countries were 
               <br />
               short of pounds, our exports were able to be 
               <br />
               continued as a result of our being included in 
               <br />
               trades and payments agreements made between 
               <br />
               these countries and the United Kingdom. As a 
               <br />
               result we received payment in dollars. Whilst Mr. 
               <br />
               Gushue did not say so last night, I know for a fact 
               <br />
               that Canada wanted to sell ﬁsh to these countries 
               <br />
               at that time and could not. Mr. Gushue admitted 
               <br />
               that due to abnormal after-war conditions, we 
               <br />
               could not convert the sterling into dollars and the 
               <br />
               government had to step in and help out the situa- 
               <br />
               tion. Then he said we must satisfy ourselves 
               <br />
               which of the forms of government under discus- 
               <br />
               sion can make sure the continuance of this trade, 
               <br />
               without which we would be in a very awkward 
               <br />
               position. That, said Mr. Gushue, was one prob-

               <br />
               suited to Newfoundland. Newfoundland is tied to

               the Canadian dollar and the Canadian exchange 
               <br />

               dollars which the Canadian exchange control got 
               <br />
               the beneﬁt of. Canada has a huge recurring deﬁcit 
               <br />
               in its dollar account with the United States. If 
               <br />

               ves which currency is best suited to the complex

               man or body of men in Newfoundland today who 
               <br />
               can answer that question, but the question cannot 
               <br />
               be ignored as probably the whole future of the

               I would suggest to Mr. Smallwood, who is 
               <br />
               most anxious to be prime minister of Canada’s 
               <br />
               tenth province, that there is no reason why he 
               <br />
               cannot realize this announced ambition of his. 
               <br />
               Canada, as he has told us so often, is the third 
               <br />
               largest country in area in the world, yet only has 
               <br />
               a population of 12.5 million. Even now she is 
               <br />
               bringing in immigrants, displaced persons, from 
               <br />
               Europe, and any others that she can encourage to 
               <br />
               enter Canada. I would imagine with the contacts 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood has with the Canadian govem- 
               <br />
               ment that he might very well have an area set 
               <br />
               aside from which a new province could be 
               <br />
               founded. As was suggested before in one of our 
               <br />
               local papers, this province might very well be 
               <br />
               named <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SmallnBrad—land.</span> He might take with him 
               <br />
               all those people who want to be Canadians. He 
               <br />
               could be the prime minister and those in this 
               <br />
               Convention who adhere to his ideas could very 
               <br />
               well be his cabinet. Then with the government of 
               <br />
               his heart’s desire, as he described it, in his new 
               <br />
               province he might very well exercise all the 
               <br />
               power he is so anxious to acquire. Why, he might 
               <br />
               be even as powerful as the gentleman he 
               <br />
               described as that Fascist, that Nazi, that slimy 
               <br />
               person, the Premier of Quebec. There then he and 
               <br />
               his supporters could really ascertain if a fair and 
               <br />
               equitable basis for union is present. He could give 
               <br />
               a true account of the taxes that would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">neces‘</span> 
               <br />
               sary to be paid and the value of all the wonderful 
               <br />
               services. After ten years he could come back to 
               <br />
               us here in Newfoundland and tell us the real 
               <br />
               picture of life in that wonderful country, and then 
               <br />
               we will make up our minds on the whole idea. To
