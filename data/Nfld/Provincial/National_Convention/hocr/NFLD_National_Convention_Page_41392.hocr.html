               them long. Soon their keen minds see through the

               sham. Soon they see the story behind the story, 
               <br />
               and when they do, they act quickly and with 
               <br />

               <br />
               ever get back the money shipped to England? 
               <br />
               How different things would be if we had had a 
               <br />
               government of Newfoundlanders! Yes, Mr. Chair-

               enough to satisfy the mind of every real New-

               <br />
               have to try to resolve this problem, which is of a 
               <br />
               twofold nature under standing orders 24 and 39. 
               <br />
               Rule 24 provides, “No member may speak to any 
               <br />
               question after it has been put by the Chairman and 
               <br />
               the voices have been given in the afﬁrmative or 
               <br />
               negative thereon.” And in that connection, Sir 
               <br />
               Erskine May, pages 418-19: “No member may 
               <br />
               speak to any question after the same has been 
               <br />
               fully put by the Speaker; and a question is fully 
               <br />
               put when he has taken the voices of both the 
               <br />
               ‘ayes’ and the ‘nos’.” Now, if the present motion 
               <br />
               or resolution is either carried or negatived, it 
               <br />
               precludes thereafter any discussion on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Commis</span> 
               <br />
               sion government or responsible government. 
               <br />
               Once it is disposed of one way or the other, it is 
               <br />
               over and done with and that is the end of it. 
               <br />

               Mr. Bradley and of Mr. Hollett, is to determine
