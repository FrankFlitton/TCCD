               Mr. Cashin There’s around 50 million feet of 
               <br />
               lumber cut annually by our OWn sawmills, and we 
               <br />
               had gentlemen on the Committee who had a good 
               <br />
               idea of the price of lumber, sawing, loading, etc. 
               <br />
               They ﬁgure about $35 a thousand, and lumber is 
               <br />
               selling today in St. John’s for about $65. By the 
               <br />
               time you pay freight, etc., the man who actually 
               <br />
               produces it, if he had to do all these things, cut, 
               <br />
               saw, etc., would make $35 a thousand on it. That

               <br />
               Cashin would pass a comment on this. I notice in 
               <br />
               today’s issue of the Evening Telegram that the 
               <br />
               editor comments on the report and says it is very 
               <br />
               fine in every way, he says:

               In one important particular, however, the 
               <br />
               ﬁgures quoted are at least open to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question,</span> 
               <br />
               It states that there are in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               22,000 square miles of timberland under 
               <br />
               leases. Out of the total area of 42,000 square 
               <br />
               miles, that would represent ﬁfty percent or, 
               <br />
               excluding the area comprised of lakes and 
               <br />
               rivers, given in the report as one third of the 
               <br />
               total, seventy-ﬁve per cent of the whole land 
               <br />
               area in the island. So far as this paper is 
               <br />
               aware, there are no survey ﬁgures available 
               <br />
               to show what proportion of Newfoundland’s 
               <br />
               surface is timberland, but if the surveys made 
               <br />
               in Canada to determine the extent of its 
               <br />
               forested lands may be regarded as a criterion, 
               <br />
               either the forest growth in this country is 
               <br />
               phenomenal or the ﬁgures are fantastic.

               Mr. Cashin In connection with that, I think it is

               <br />
               lakes, rivers, etc., and a lot of these are included 
               <br />

               <br />
               gave us an idea, as closely as they could, on the

               amount of timber on these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lands,</span> It is ﬁgured

               today that the two pulp and paper companies,

               who control practically all the leasehold land in 
               <br />
               the country, have roughly between 45 and 50 
               <br />
               million cords of wood in these areas. The two 
               <br />
               companies have between them around 20,000
