               <br />
               advocate it in another debate. I am in favour of 
               <br />
               submitting both these forms to the people, not 
               <br />

               Mr. Burry I rise to support the motion before 
               <br />
               you. I am heartily behind putting these two forms 
               <br />
               on the ballot paper to form part of the choice in 
               <br />
               the coming referendum. In doing so I want to say 
               <br />
               I am not able to support either one of these 
               <br />
               choices from my own point of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">view,</span> I do not feel 
               <br />
               that I could support a return to responsible 
               <br />
               government, and I do not feel that Commission 
               <br />
               of Government should continue any longer in this 
               <br />
               country than it already has. There are many, 
               <br />
               many reasons I could give to back those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">state»</span> 
               <br />
               ments up, but the time is short and the arguments 
               <br />
               against responsible government have been 
               <br />
               repeated here so often, I do not want to go over 
               <br />
               them again. They have been very impressive, 
               <br />
               some of them; they impressed me and I am sure 
               <br />
               they impressed the people of this country. I may 
               <br />
               also say that some of the arguments in favour of 
               <br />
               the return of responsible government have been 
               <br />
               impressive. That is, theoretically they are correct 
               <br />
               and they impress us, but they fall down when they 
               <br />
               are tested. I do not think they could be practically 
               <br />
               applied to this small country with our system of 
               <br />
               taxation, and for the reasons which have been 
               <br />
               gone over so often in this Convention. I am 
               <br />
               wholeheartedly in favour of having political 
               <br />
               freedom for our people. I would not think of 
               <br />
               voting for anything in the referendum if it did not 
               <br />
               involve political <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">freedom.</span> I am all for it.

               I feel about the return to responsible government. 
               <br />
               The very thought of it puts fear into my bones, to 
               <br />
               think of this country going back to responsible 
               <br />
               government again... These are no idle words. I 
               <br />
               have a reason to fear the consequences of respon-

               <br />
               rightly or wrongly, I have associated the political

               <br />
               tions we have had. I know that the one may not 
               <br />
               be wholly responsible for the other, but there has 
               <br />
               been very close connection between the two. It is 
               <br />
               generally agreed that for the majority of our 
               <br />
               people life has been a terriﬁc struggle all down 
               <br />
               through the years, and I was caught up in that 
               <br />
               struggle myself in my youth. My father was one 
               <br />
               of the primary producers and he suffered <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tremen»</span> 
               <br />
               dously as one of them. I had a struggle in my early 
               <br />
               days, my earliest recollections are those of 
               <br />
               hardship and privation. It is a long story and one 
               <br />
               which I am not going to trouble you with. I do 
               <br />
               recall the early struggles and also the struggles to 
               <br />
               get an education... I know the struggle my 
               <br />
               parents had to ﬁnd a school for me to go to. After 
               <br />
               I grew up, through my chosen profession I 
               <br />
               worked and came in close contact with men and 
               <br />
               women, families, who were having the same kind 
               <br />
               of struggle to get along. Then for the past 15 
               <br />
               years, as you know, I worked in our northern 
               <br />
               dependency and I was up against the same strug- 
               <br />
               gle among the people of that country. Apart from 
               <br />
               a few places such as Northwest River and 
               <br />
               Cartwright, the struggle was terriﬁc and I shared 
               <br />
               it with them intimately. Mr. Harrington a few 
               <br />
               days ago told of us of the days he worked as a 
               <br />
               civil servant in the Department of Public Health 
               <br />
               and Welfare. He told us that day after day he sat 
               <br />
               before his desk reading letters from different 
               <br />
               parts of the country telling tragic stories of priva— 
               <br />
               tion and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">struggle,</span> During those years I was in the 
               <br />
               field, and I was actually in the homes from which 
               <br />
               those letters came. Knowing Mr. Harrington as I 
               <br />
               do, he must have been moved with compassion 
               <br />
               as he read those letters. I am sure that Mr. Har- 
               <br />
               rington will agree that it is one thing to sit before 
               <br />
               a desk in a nice comfortable room, having had 
               <br />
               one square meal or two square meals, and to read 
               <br />
               these letters; it is another thing to be in the ﬁeld, 
               <br />
               making contacts, going into the homes of these 
               <br />
               people and seeing their bare cupboards and hear~ 
               <br />
