               I grant you that the Letters Patent of 1934 did 
               <br />
               provide for the administration of Newfoundland 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               the Great Seal at Westminster. And that locates 
               <br />
               the headache at Westminster. The burden of 
               <br />

               British Parliament had decided to foist the

               responsibility for determination of the question

               <br />
               thing was written into the Convention Act. What 
               <br />
               we were told to do was examine into the ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               and economic changes that have taken place 
               <br />
               since 1934. The Economic Report before us, 
               <br />
               undoubtedly not without good reason, has seen 
               <br />
               fit to go beyond that commitment and bring the 
               <br />
               matter of whether or not the island is again self— 
               <br />
               supporting before this assembly. It has gone fur— 
               <br />
               ther and suggests that we are self—supporting.

               During the deliberations of the Finance Com- 
               <br />
               mittee in preparation of the Economic Report, I, 
               <br />
               together with another member of the Committee, 
               <br />
               did resign therefrom. By that time it was evident 
               <br />
               that the other members of the Committee were of 
               <br />
               one mind upon an approach to the matter in hand 
               <br />
               with which I was not in accord. Reappointed to 
               <br />
               the Committee by you, Mr. Chairman, I thought 
               <br />
               that the Committee would make more rapid 
               <br />
               progress if I did not attend further meetings. It 
               <br />
               was just as well that I did not. For to this report 
               <br />
               in its entirety I would not have been able to 
               <br />
               subscribe, and my presence at meetings at which 
               <br />
               it was prepared could only have led to further 
               <br />

               I see it this way. The proper function of the

               Economic Report, as is self-evident from the 
               <br />

               <br />
               in the island since 1934, and as is implicit in those

               <br />
               asked for a decision on the speciﬁc question of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selﬂsupport.</span> That is a decision that it will make 
               <br />
               for itself —~ for it has made that condition for 
               <br />
               itself. To be fair, it must be said that the report 
               <br />
               did have some justification for addressing itself 
               <br />
               to the question, in that it was popularly expected 
               <br />
               to make a pronouncement. Rightly or wrongly, 
               <br />
               the people have been led to expect this Conven- 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">port...</span> And I do think that that makes the matter 
               <br />
               of self-support legitimate for our concern. In that 
               <br />
               belief I have already discussed the matter in 
               <br />
               Convention. And in that belief, now that this 
               <br />
               report has formally brought the matter before this 
               <br />
               Convention, I intend to discuss it further today. 
               <br />
               However, I cannot see that any useful purpose is

               <br />
               to have any credibility it would have to be predi- 
               <br />
               cated upon a more accurate measure of our

               To begin with, there is not in the Convention 
               <br />
               anyone equipped with the specialised knowledge 
               <br />
               necessary for making a conclusive evaluation of

               composite financial wizard and mathematical

               have had available to him few reliable statistical

               indices, no reliable ﬁgure of national income,

               <br />
               a good guess. One of the most urgent needs is for 
               <br />
               an efﬁcient bureau of statistics. If we had had 
               <br />
               such a bureau to turn to this Convention would 
               <br />
               have been over in half the time. Even if we had 
               <br />
               had foresight enough at the beginning to call in a 
               <br />
               competent statistician-economist, I am con-
