               economic survey, and the second paragraph deals 
               <br />
               only with a special effort of the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada to collect and make available scientiﬁc 
               <br />
               data. It is that which is to be done as soon as 
               <br />
               practicable after union. The other thing is done 
               <br />
               when the provincial government institutes the 
               <br />
               survey. The reason is this: that if it were not 
               <br />
               left to the Government of Newfoundland to in— 
               <br />
               stitute and initiate the economic survey, and the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada stepped in on its own, 
               <br />
               immediately what we would be hearing would 
               <br />
               be, “Oh, I see, so without a by your leave the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada is going to walk in and 
               <br />
               begin surveying your resources”. Should the 
               <br />
               government of the province start it, then the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada will step in and do the 
               <br />
               job, so that no one can say they will ride in here 
               <br />
               roughshod, or without permission. It’s up to the 
               <br />
               Government of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland...</span> The other point 
               <br />
               is as to Prince Edward Island. We have said a lot 
               <br />
               about PEI in the Convention in the last few days. 
               <br />
               Is there any need for me to say once more that 
               <br />
               PEI, although it is a province, is a little island of 
               <br />
               2,000 square miles, one-twentieth the size of the 
               <br />
               island of Newfoundland. It is only a large farm. 
               <br />
               It has no industries, no natural resources apart 
               <br />
               from the soil and the ﬁsh in the water. It has no 
               <br />
               minerals, no oil, no timber, has no natural resour- 
               <br />
               ces except its very ﬁne soil and the ﬁsh surround— 
               <br />
               ing its coast. Therefore, what happens is this: a 
               <br />
               man who had a farm in PEI of 50 acres 30 or 40 
               <br />
               years ago, inherited it from his father who had 
               <br />
               owned 300 acres, and the various sons took 50 
               <br />
               acres each. Now he is married and has sons, and 
               <br />
               there is not enough land for four or ﬁve sons to 
               <br />
               live on, so what happens is the oldest sons stay 
               <br />
               on, and the younger ones have to get off. When 
               <br />
               the population grows to the point where the land 
               <br />
               cannot support them, they emigrate to other parts 
               <br />
               of Canada, and a good thing it is that they have 
               <br />
               other parts to immigrate to. Let’s hear no more 
               <br />
               about this tiny little Island of Prince Edward’s... 
               <br />
               Now one other point Mr. Hollett raised on this 
               <br />
               clause. Take the second paragraph: “As soon as 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
         </div>
         
         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_7" title="bbox 768 184 1314 1877">

               may be practicable after union”. Any member of 
               <br />
               the Convention, or any member of the public may 
               <br />
               care to think that the Government of Canada is 
               <br />
               just putting up a big bluff, only a cod, that they 
               <br />
               are a crowd of cheapskates who are trying to bluff 
               <br />
               this country; if anyone wishes to believe that he 
               <br />
               has a perfect right to believe it. If Mr. Hollett 
               <br />
               wishes to believe it, he has a perfect right to, and 
               <br />
               if he says that the words, “As soon as practicable 
               <br />
               after union the Government of Canada will do 
               <br />
               such and such” are not worth the paper they are 
               <br />
               written on, he is entitled so to believe.

               Mr. Smallwood I am convinced of this, and it

               foundland as a province of Canada is either going 
               <br />

               <br />
               is going to pay her way. One or the other. Which 
               <br />
               would Canada want?... She would want to step in 
               <br />
               and give us a lifting hand that would help us stand 
               <br />
               on our own feet and be independent ﬁnancially 
               <br />
               and otherwise. That is what I believe.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Higgins I would like to make a short com- 
               <br />
               ment on that paragraph, particularly with respect 
               <br />
               to the ﬁrst part. I am a little disappointed in the 
               <br />
               wording, and in the interpretation that we were 
               <br />
               given in Ottawa, and the interpretation that Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood has given today. In reading the first 
               <br />
               part of the ﬁrst paragraph, it is clearly stated that 
               <br />
               should the Government of Newfoundland iii— 
               <br />
               stitute an economic survey and request the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada, then the latter will make 
               <br />
               available technical personnel or agencies to assist 
               <br />
               in the work. It does not say, as I was led to believe, 
               <br />
               that the Government of Canada would pay for the 
               <br />
               work. It merely says to assist in the work. Now 
               <br />
               how much assistance it is going to be, and who is 
               <br />
               going to pay for it, is questionable — very ques- 
               <br />
               tionable. They may merely provide the personnel 
               <br />
               and the agencies, and we will have to pay for it. 
               <br />
               That is the meaning of the paragraph, and I would 
               <br />
               challenge <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Smallwood to interpret it other- 
               <br />
               wise.

               Mr. Smallwood I will very gladly do that. If Mr.

               Higgins can point to one single solitary case in 
               <br />
               the 80 years of Canadian history where the 
               <br />
