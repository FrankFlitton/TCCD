               Mr. MacDonald After listening to the eloquent 
               <br />
               and sometimes somewhat lengthy speeches from

               the gentlemen who preceded me, it is with some 
               <br />
               hesitation I rise to speak on the report which 
               <br />
               generally speaking reﬂects great credit on the

               <br />
               a certain amount of optimism which I cannot 
               <br />
               wholly share. Take as a precedent what happened 
               <br />
               after World War I — it may not happen again, I 
               <br />
               hope it will not, but affairs in the world at present 
               <br />
               do not tend to foster a wholly optimistic view. I 
               <br />
               hope you do not think I am not an optimist. They 
               <br />
               say the difference between an optimist and a 
               <br />
               pessimist is that the former sees the doughnut and 
               <br />
               the latter sees the hole. But there is always the 
               <br />
               little word “caution". I do not know what Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood would mean by realism, but I know 
               <br />
               it is a hard word to utilise in foretelling the future.

               “Today therefore, we can deﬁnitely state that

               <br />

               <br />
               mittee I want to call their attention to a statement 
               <br />
               made in one of the local papers asserting that for 
               <br />
               the year 1947-48 the accumulated surplus was 
               <br />
               $28,789,000. These are the ﬁgures according to

               <br />
               explain how the difference has arisen?
