               any members of this Convention feel sufficiently

               This Convention has already sent a delegation 
               <br />
               to London, the result of which is now known to 
               <br />
               all, and are sending a delegation to Ottawa in the

               <br />
               send a delegation to Washington also. In fact I 
               <br />
               feel we should not fail to do so, looking to the 
               <br />
               future prospects of Newfoundland, and with a 
               <br />
               belief that the Government of the USA would 
               <br />
               receive and welcome such a delegation warmly. 
               <br />
               May I ask you, then, to arrange for a delegation

               any party politics involved, for it does not run 
               <br />
               contrary to any political party. it can, however,

               Mr. Fudge Mr. Chairman, 1 have very great 
               <br />
               pleasure in seconding the motion. We have very 
               <br />
               considerable trade with the United States, par- 
               <br />
               ticularly in the export of paper, and recently in 
               <br />
               cod ﬁllets and other ﬁshery products. In connec- 
               <br />
               tion with the export of cod ﬁllets, it is desirable 
               <br />
               that we should be aBle to extend our market 
               <br />
               substantially in that country. We have the 
               <br />
               product, and we know that there is a very substan- 
               <br />
               tial market in the United States for it. and it is a 
               <br />
               matter for negotiation on a mutually beneﬁcial 
               <br />
               basis, in order that our ﬁshermen may beneﬁt 
               <br />
               from having the very extensive market that is 
               <br />
               there available, and that the people of the United 
               <br />
               States may be able to get our product at a 
               <br />
               reasonable price. We must reasonably expect that 
               <br />
               if we hope to get our ﬁshery products into the 
               <br />
               United States free of duty, they will want to send 
               <br />
               some of their products to this country either free 
               <br />
               of duty or at a substantially reduced rate of duty, 
               <br />
               and this is of great concern to the lower income 
               <br />
               classes. We all realise that many of our working 
               <br />
               people have a low standard of living due to the
