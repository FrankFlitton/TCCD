               hovering over this debate, I assure you thatl will

               that there are matters of great importance yet 
               <br />
               demanding the consideration of this Convention. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, at ﬁrst I had not intended to say 
               <br />
               anything in this debate, because I considered too 
               <br />
               much had already been said. But as it has been 
               <br />
               my custom since this Convention opened to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">brief.</span> 
               <br />

               <br />
               make my position clear regarding them, I decided 
               <br />
               to make a few general observations on this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">issue.</span> 
               <br />
               They are as follows. First, I contend that the 
               <br />
               matter of confederation should never have been 
               <br />
               the business of this Convention and that respon- 
               <br />
               sible government should have been restored in 
               <br />
               accordance with the agreement of 1934.

               Mr. Chairman You can’t do anything about 
               <br />
               that. You have no jurisdiction over that matter at 
               <br />
               all. In the ﬁrst place if the matter is to be debated 
               <br />
               at all it comes within the purview of the different 
               <br />
               forms of government, which is not yet before the 
               <br />
               Chair. You must conﬁne yourself to business

               Mr. Fowler If confederation is to be a live issue, 
               <br />
               let the people interested form a party, go to the 
               <br />
               country, preach their doctrine and if given a 
               <br />
               mandate from the people, go as honourable men 
               <br />
               and negotiate the terms of union on equal footing 
               <br />
               with the Canadian government. Gentlemen, I 
               <br />
               contend that in contrast to this, we should look at 
               <br />
               what really happened. Mr. Smallwood asked this 
               <br />
               Convention to send somebody, anybody to 
               <br />
               Canada to discuss terms of union. First we said 
               <br />
               no. Then sometime later some of us got soft- 
               <br />
               hearted and by a scant majority agreed to send 
               <br />
               seven individuals to Ottawa. No qualiﬁcations 
               <br />
               were required, and as we all know that delegation 
               <br />
               consisted of every type of gentleman with the 
               <br />
               notable exception of an expert. And it must be 
               <br />
               borne in mind that the people of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               were not asked if they wanted a delegation to go 
               <br />
               to Ottawa or not. Much less were they asked to 
               <br />
               select the members of this delegation. It is doubt- 
               <br />
               ful if any delegation would have been wined and 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               ly, we have these one-sided terms or proposals 
               <br />
               here. They are one-sided. That must be evident 
               <br />
               to all, because scores of questions of prime im— 
               <br />
               portance to Newfoundland have been asked and 
               <br />
               the answers could not be found in these costly 
               <br />
               documents we have before us. Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               has attempted to explain them. But with all due 
               <br />
               respect to Mr. Smallwood, what right has he to 
               <br />
               speak for the Canadian government? What 
               <br />
               authority has he? How does he know what any 
               <br />
               government of Canada may or may not do in the 
               <br />
               future? Mr. Chairman, we know only what is 
               <br />
               contained in the Grey Book. And that document, 
               <br />
               sir, will be longer remembered for what it does 
               <br />
               not contain than it will for what it does contain. 
               <br />
               Gentlemen, one of the things our people want 
               <br />
               to learn is the truth about this burning question of 
               <br />
               taxation. All I can say is that it is like the truth 
               <br />
               about the next world: we hear a lot about it, but 
               <br />
               we will never know the real truth until we go 
               <br />
               there. We will never know the real truth about 
               <br />
               taxes under confederation until we become the 
               <br />
               tenth province of Canada. But always remember, 
               <br />
               that if things do not turn out as you expected, you 
               <br />
               will never be able to do anything about it. Third- 
               <br />
               ly, people should disabuse their minds of the idea 
               <br />
               of getting something for nothing, and realise that 
               <br />
               whatever form of government you have, you pay 
               <br />
               for what you get in one way or another. If you 
               <br />
               don’t pay indirect taxes, you will pay direct taxes. 
               <br />
               If the federal government does not collect them, 
               <br />
               the provincial government will. If the provincial 
               <br />
               government does not collect them then the 
               <br />
               municipal government will. And remember, that 
               <br />
               under confederation we will be subject to all three 
               <br />
               forms of taxation ~—- federal, provincial and 
               <br />
               municipal. The other nine provinces have them, 
               <br />
               how can we expect to escape them? Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood labours the point that we will not be 
               <br />
               compelled to have land taxes, property taxes and 
               <br />
               the like. He tells us that it will be entirely up to 
               <br />
               the province. But that is the point. Nobody <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">comv</span> 
               <br />
               pels me to eat, but I must eat in order to exist. And 
               <br />
               in order for Newfoundland to exist at all as the 
               <br />
               tenth province of Canada, it will be necessary for 
               <br />
               her to avail of every known means of taxation. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, I cannot see why we should 
               <br />
               join Canada or any other country at this time. It 
               <br />
               is common knowledge that the eyes of the North
