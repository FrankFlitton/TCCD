               Mr. Fowler Mr. Chairman, if I recall correctly 
               <br />
               some speakers in the early stages of this debate 
               <br />
               called for an end to oratory and the beginning of 
               <br />
               the real business of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Convention</span> I think that 
               <br />
               this was not the end but the beginning of such 
               <br />
               oratory, and while I realize that it is a great 
               <br />
               temptation to any delegate, conscious of his 
               <br />
               ability, to burst forth in ﬂowery speech, yet I also 
               <br />
               contend, sir, that the sooner we get down to real 
               <br />
               business the better. 
               <br />

               I agree that the people of this country are very 
               <br />
               much concerned over this business of eating in 
               <br />
               the future, but feel sure the great majority are also 
               <br />
               gravely concerned over the way they will vote, 
               <br />
               and as to whether they will have that precious 
               <br />
               right restored to them in future years. You need 
               <br />

               We are about to discuss the report of the 
               <br />
               Dominions Ofﬁce. This, I hope, will be an inter~ 
               <br />
               esting study, and give us a ﬁrst class picture of 
               <br />
               our financial and economic position at the 
               <br />
               present. But how this Convention or any other 
               <br />
               body can determine whether Newfoundland will 
               <br />
               be self-supporting in say ten years from now, 
               <br />
               regardless of what form of government we adopt, 
               <br />
               is more than I can understand; and since the basis 
               <br />
               of our economy is by no means stable, a chance 
               <br />
               on the future must be taken in any event. There- 
               <br />
               fore, in order to justify ourselves before posterity, 
               <br />
               we owe it to them as well as to ourselves, to 
               <br />
               secure if possible a form of government which 
               <br />
               will embody the highest ideals of democracy and 
               <br />
               permit of the greatestopportunities for all. To this 
               <br />
               end, gentlemen, let us take up the work at hand 
               <br />
               in harmony and unity. Let us not strike the note 
               <br />
               of discord too loudly, for there are eager ears 
               <br />

               had an opportunity to hear all shades of opinion.

               also of making sure of three meals a day. In order

               <br />
               time that could be used to better advantage. How-

               apparently expected by many, I now ask for your

               tolerance.

               Few of us came here with this so-called open 
               <br />
               mind, and as was to be expected, the proponents 
               <br />
               of the different forms of government are already 
               <br />
               showing their partiality to those whom they look 
               <br />
               to as leaders. I believe, however, that all are 
               <br />
               motivated with a sincere and honest desire to 
               <br />
               arrive at recommendations which will be of 
               <br />
               greater beneﬁt to the many rather than to the few. 
               <br />
               It should be remembered meantime that each one 
               <br />
               of us expects to form conclusions from facts 
               <br />
               obtained, rather than from oratory in debate 
               <br />
               before these facts are obtained. The Steering 
               <br />
               Committee is to be complimented in this connec- 
               <br />
               tion in dividing the work between the different 
               <br />
               committees and we may now hope for more 
               <br />
               expediency in obtaining the information relative 
               <br />
               to our work.

               Many questions have been tabled, most of 
               <br />
               them relevant, but not all of them absolutely 
               <br />
               necessary, the replies to which may be difficult 
               <br />
               to obtain, and, as the Hon. Mr. Wild suggested, it 
               <br />
               would be well to conﬁne them to essentials, 
               <br />
               otherwise the compilation of replies will outlive 
               <br />
               the Convention itself. Surely we can arrive at an

               enough to meet our requirements without seeking

               dividual incomes is available from the majority, 
               <br />
               and even those would not contain supplementary 
               <br />
               income. I might refer to a large number 
               <br />

               <br />
               regularly or otherwise from friends or relatives 
               <br />
               within the United States and Canada, I would

               suggest, in this connection, that Convention
