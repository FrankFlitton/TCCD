               had oil on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deck.</span> After I had landed it I left the 
               <br />
               vessel, and one day went into an oil manufacturer 
               <br />
               to see a friend of mine. I saw the oil we landed. 
               <br />
               Happened to speak about it to the manager, he lit 
               <br />
               in to me, and asked if we were gone crazy down 
               <br />
               here in Newfoundland. I asked, “Why?” “I paid 
               <br />
               $360 per ton for that oil." “Well," I said, “I can’t 
               <br />
               enlighten you much, but I know the ﬁshermen got 
               <br />
               $89 per ton, but some day I’ll ﬁnd out." Fifteen 
               <br />
               months later I came home and I found out the 
               <br />
               price was $123 ex-wharf. And who got the dif- 
               <br />
               ference? I tried two firms, it was the same price. 
               <br />
               I went back to Boston, saw my friend and found 
               <br />
               out his agent got $237 less expenses. Not a bad 
               <br />
               proﬁt to make with a pencil, and that’s how it 
               <br />
               goes, gentlemen. In Canada the woods are full of 
               <br />
               them. We will have to do more than confederate 
               <br />
               to get clear of the mule skinner. The only answer 
               <br />
               to it is the co-op. Get a good large wholesale 
               <br />
               import and export co—operative society. Your 
               <br />
               small retails might change your charter, so 
               <br />
               money can be ploughed back in the business. Get 
               <br />
               the people together, then we can lick the mules- 
               <br />
               kinner. You can lick them all, but you have to 
               <br />
               organise... There is the answer to it. I agree with 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood’s ﬁnding the disease, but he is a

               the Chair, fervently believing it to be an evasion

               of the rights due to our people under the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1933~</span>

               1934 act. We have not at this time, nor have we 
               <br />
               had in Newfoundland since 1933 a government 
               <br />
               representative of the people. Any decisions 
               <br />
               reached by the Commission of Government 
               <br />
               entertained no more consideration nor respect for 
               <br />

               <br />
               whom at that time were paying for the defending

               <br />
               my generation has had the right to ﬁght for New-

               <br />
               her, much less voting. In some of the speeches 
               <br />
               given in support of this motion reference has been 
               <br />
               made not only to post-Convention propaganda, 
               <br />

               disgust in the use of this chamber and the radio

               as a medium for this post-Convention propagan- 
               <br />
               da. It has been said by acertain speaker in support 
               <br />
               of the motion, that this Convention has not been 
               <br />
               able to give the full <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">truth</span> concerning confedera-

               tion to the people. If this be so, then the pilot of

               this report should be ashamed, and consider him- 
               <br />
               self incapable, that during the past weeks of 
               <br />
               debate, he has been unable to ice the cake of 
               <br />
               confederation sufﬁciently attractively to hide the 
               <br />
               sour dough that lies beneath it. Nothing that Mr.

               Smallwood or any other pro-confederate may 
               <br />
               concoct or serve to the people can alter the fact 
               <br />
               that the terms as sent to us from Canada are ﬁnal. 
               <br />
               No amount of surmising or imagination can give 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood or anyone else the power to 
               <br />

               As far as I am concerned I am interested in no 
               <br />
               figures or estimates of our country supplied by 
               <br />
               Canadians, or outsiders who have never set foot 
               <br />
               in this country to see how the ordinary New- 
               <br />
               foundlander lives or wishes to live. I will accept 
               <br />
               only the concrete figures given to me by New-

               <br />
               Today in Newfoundland, her native sons have no

               freedom to employ these ﬁgures, and until such 
               <br />
               time as we have any negotiation with any 
               <br />
               country, it is bound to be one—sided and that side 
               <br />
               is not likely to be ours. I have no intention of 
               <br />
               asserting that the majority or minority of mem- 
               <br />
               bers in this Convention represent the greater or 
               <br />
               lesser proportion of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people,</span> This has just been 
               <br />
               another example of naive conjecture on the part 
               <br />
               of certain members, but I wish to put on record 
               <br />
               that hundreds of men from the district that I 
               <br />
               represent have worked and ﬁshed with men from 
               <br />
               the Dominion of Canada, and as a majority or 
               <br />
               minority, they are more adverse to union with 
               <br />
               Canada than they ever were. I maintain that no 
               <br />
               member in this house has the right to speak for 
               <br />
               every individual Newfoundlander who will cast 
               <br />
               his vote, regardless of the beliefs of Mr. Starkes 
               <br />
               or myself. We have been given no proof that new 
               <br />
               taxes will not be enforced on us and I, Mr. Chair- 
               <br />
               man, cannot conceive that the three types of 
               <br />
               government that union will bring us will be run 
               <br />
               at a lower cost than the one that responsible 
               <br />
               entails, if it ever comes into force.
