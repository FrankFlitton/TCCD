               lies must be shown, like everybody else, that

               there was far more to the reputation of the Carter

               away to bleach their bones on the desert sands of 
               <br />
               Canada. Undoubtedly there was exaggeration on 
               <br />
               both sides. There always is and always has been 
               <br />
               in election campaigns, as I have pointed out, but 
               <br />
               let us consider the nature of the times. The North 
               <br />
               American continent was still shaken by the ef- 
               <br />
               fects of the civil war in the United States, and all 
               <br />
               sorts of subversive movement was afoot in that 
               <br />
               country and in Canada. “The Province of Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia, one of the four which had been inveigled 
               <br />
               into adopting the resolution, was regretting it 
               <br />
               already ...“ says one author, “so much so that on 
               <br />
               the 22nd of February, 1868, the House of As- 
               <br />
               sembly of Nova Scotia sent an address to the 
               <br />
               British Crown, declaring that the Province was 
               <br />
               adverse to the measure of Union, and, on an 
               <br />
               unsatisfactory reply being received on the 4th of 
               <br />
               June the Executive Council sent a further 
               <br />
               despatch in which they threatened the possibility 
               <br />
               of the Province not only leaving Confederation, 
               <br />
               but seceding from the British Empire as well, 
               <br />
               observing that there was no change in their politi- 
               <br />
               cal relations which they would not prefer to their 
               <br />
               present place in the Confederation”. That was 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia’s attitude on confederation in 1868.

               Prince Edward Island’s attitude was plain — 
               <br />
               she would stay out. As for British Columbia, as 
               <br />
               late as March, 1870, a few months after the ‘69 
               <br />
               election, a speech delivered in the Legislative 
               <br />
               Council said, “The people of this colony have, 
               <br />
               generally speaking, no love for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada,</span> They 
               <br />
               care, as a rule, little or nothing about the creation 
               <br />
               of another empire, kingdom or republic. They 
               <br />
               care little about the distinctions between the 
               <br />
               forms of government of Canada and the United 
               <br />
               States”. And in that connection, Professor Walter 
               <br />
               Sage declared in 1945 that, “In the colonial war, 
               <br />
               and even for a time before confederation, 
               <br />
               Canadians were unpopular. They were known as

               I mentioned too the subversive movements in 
               <br />
               the United States and Canada, among which was 
               <br />
               the famous Fenian organisation made up of Irish- 
               <br />
               men driven from their homeland, and who were 
               <br />
               determined to take a blow at England whenever 
               <br />
               and wherever they could. In 1866 they made an 
               <br />
               unsuccessful invasion of Canada, a raid it was, 
               <br />
               and fought in 1870 from the United States, being 
               <br />
               joined by their compatriots in Canada, and in 
               <br />
               addition to this movement there was a famous 
               <br />
               uprising of the Métis, the French—Indian half- 
               <br />
               breeds in Manitoba, under Louis Riel in 1869, 
               <br />
               known in Canadian history as “Riel’s rebellion"; 
               <br />
               add to that dissension and open warfare the 
               <br />
               supreme fact that the French Canadians in 
               <br />
               Quebec, the real Canadians, believed that con- 
               <br />
               federation was an attempt to submerge their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iden»</span> 
               <br />
               tity, and although they accepted the arrangement 
               <br />
               in principle, were to leave few stones unturned in 
               <br />
               after years to my to wreck the union. That was the 
               <br />
               union that Newfoundland repudiated, and the 
               <br />
               reasons I have given were principally at the bot— 
               <br />
               tom of the mother country’s desire why it should 
               <br />
               be effected. Confederation was for protection in 
               <br />
               the middle of the last century if nothing else. It 
               <br />
               was to get the colonies of British North America 
               <br />
               under a central government which could be 
               <br />
               delegated with the responsibility of defending its 
               <br />
               interest against the many internal advances from 
               <br />
               races and wolves, and against the external 
               <br />
               dangers, principal among which was the growing 
               <br />
               republic to the south. Furthermore, at that time 
               <br />
               there was little or no communication between the 
               <br />
               provinces apart from the few commercial con- 
               <br />
               tacts between the provinces of Ontario and 
               <br />
               Quebec and the Maritimes, but the total value of 
               <br />
               trade between them was very small, and between 
               <br />
               either Canada or the Maritimes and the farther 
               <br />
               west there was practically no commercial 
               <br />
               enterprise of any kind, and it was such a hap- 
               <br />
               hazard, loose conglomeration of colonies cover- 
               <br />
               ing a vast and potentially valuable territory, that 
               <br />
               made the British government anxious to see them 
               <br />
               brought together under a central government. No 
               <br />
               wonder, sir, that the anticonfederate party of 
               <br />
               1869 was able to convince the electorate that 
               <br />
               union would not be conducive to their essential 
               <br />
               interest — union with a Dominion in the future
