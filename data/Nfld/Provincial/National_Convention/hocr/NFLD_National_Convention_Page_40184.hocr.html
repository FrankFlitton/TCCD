               Mr. Smallwood I wonder if the production of 
               <br />
               cellulose is contemplated by the AND Company, 
               <br />
               as I know they had it under consideration in years 
               <br />
               past. I have here the wages and ﬁgures given by 
               <br />
               the AND Company showing that from 1907 to 
               <br />
               1940 the expenditure in wages and salaries in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland was $76 million; local purchases 
               <br />
               $14 million; railway freights $41/z million and so 
               <br />
               forth. Now I happen to know that that company 
               <br />
               has been giving these ﬁgures year by year from 
               <br />
               the beginning and they could give them up to the 
               <br />
               present year. The same thing applies with 
               <br />
               Bowaters at present. Their ﬁgures under wages 
               <br />
               and salaries and under other headings for the 
               <br />
               years 1923 to 1940 amounted to $86 million, as 
               <br />
               compared with $105 million by the AND Com- 
               <br />
               pany in expenditure from 1907 to 1940. Would

               the convenor of this committee undertake to get

               Mr. Cashin When we were preparing this report

               body and soul together." That is correct. in 1937

               when I came into the union which I represent,I 
               <br />
               the wages paid for a 10 hour day were $1.60; and 
               <br />
               the cutting of wood by contract was from 90 cents 
               <br />
               to not exceeding $150 per cord. The wages in 
               <br />
               1945—46 were $5.30 a day for a 10 hour day; 
               <br />
               cutters $3.60 per cord. All other rates were jacked 
               <br />
               up in proportion. If i remember, the board rate 
               <br />
               was 75 cents per day, and out of $1.60 you have
