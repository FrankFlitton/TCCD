               In view of all the circumstances, Mr. Chair- 
               <br />
               man, all that is necessary now is for us to take 
               <br />
               over the management of our own affairs, and I 
               <br />
               feel sure that we have the men capable of doing 
               <br />
               the job and doing it well. The argument that if we 
               <br />
               get responsible government back it would mean 
               <br />
               an almost immediate recession to where we were 
               <br />
               in 1933, and that we would again be on our knees 
               <br />
               to the mother country in a few years, is one to 
               <br />
               which I cannot subscribe in View of our present 
               <br />
               position, and how that position can be improved 
               <br />
               under the proper <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">administration</span> It is the argu- 
               <br />
               ment of a defeatist and does not smack of the true 
               <br />
               blood and guts of the Newfoundlander. We have 
               <br />
               the resources, we have the bargaining power, and 
               <br />
               above all, we have the men —— men of vision and 
               <br />
               courage, capable of taking this country through 
               <br />
               whatever the future may hold in store for us. All 
               <br />
               we need are courage and faith in ourselves, and I 
               <br />
               think our people have them in abundance.

               As far as Commission of Government is con- 
               <br />
               cerned, I do not think it can do for us what we can 
               <br />
               do for ourselves. It was never meant for any 
               <br />
               freedom-loving people, and it will always remain 
               <br />
               a black chapter in our history. Admittedly it has 
               <br />
               done a lot of good for this country -— I will not 
               <br />
               deny that, but in my opinion its sins of omission 
               <br />
               are very great, too great to be allowed to continue, 
               <br />
               because they are still continuing. Sufﬁciently 
               <br />
               good reasons have been put forward why the 
               <br />
               present form of administration should not be 
               <br />
               continued, and it will be only labouring the point 
               <br />
               if I deal with it any further.

               What I have stated with regard to the two 
               <br />
               forms of government dealt with in this resolution 
               <br />
               are strictly my own views, and are perhaps not 
               <br />
               likely to be shared by many people. Therefore, in 
               <br />
               fairness to them, I am going to vote for these two

               impatience mingled perhaps with disgust, that 
               <br />
               our leaders at that time were unable to ﬁnd a

               <br />
               practically all other world governments who 
               <br />
               were under no less burden or stress. As one of the

               <br />
               our independence for a type of honour that our

               and inferiority on account of what has gone 
               <br />
               before. We have been told directly by the past

               <br />
