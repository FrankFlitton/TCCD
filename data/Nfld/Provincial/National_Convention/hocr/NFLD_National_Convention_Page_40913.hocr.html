               her, and without a doubt he received a copy of it 
               <br />
               also. What was it? It was merely a small extract 
               <br />
               from that very large report provided to the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada by its own experts. It was 
               <br />
               the Government of Canada which compiled these 
               <br />
               two Black Books, and it was the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada which decided what should go in these 
               <br />
               books and what should not. It was their choice. If 
               <br />
               the Government of Canada chose, in inserting 
               <br />
               into this Black Book, part of the report they had 
               <br />
               received from their own ofﬁcials, it was their 
               <br />
               right to do so. What we have is the same as you 
               <br />
               have here, with the very signiﬁcant exception 
               <br />
               that one or two clauses have been dropped from 
               <br />
               the Black Book that were in the original report. 
               <br />
               Why is it signiﬁcant? The original <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">report.</span> the 
               <br />
               copies of which were handed to the three of us, 
               <br />
               contained the clause which Mr. Higgins has read 
               <br />
               out this afternoon. You don’t ﬁnd that clause in 
               <br />
               the Black Book. The Black Book is what the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada compiled, what their own 
               <br />
               ofﬁcials compiled as their report to them. What 
               <br />
               we go by is this Black Book.

               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood I was referring to the paragraph 
               <br />
               that Mr. Higgins read concerning the railway of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, a paragraph which he read from 
               <br />
               a document, which paragraph does not appear in 
               <br />
               the Black Book. What I say is this: that so far as 
               <br />
               concerns our Newfoundland Railway service, 
               <br />
               which includes the steamships, we have here a 
               <br />
               document, put in this Black Book by the Govem- 
               <br />
               ment of Canada. Mr. Higgins quotes a paragraph 
               <br />
               from another document, which was written by 
               <br />
               officials of the Government of Canada. What we 
               <br />
               must take as being official is what the Govem- 
               <br />
               ment of Canada itself put in this Black Book, not 
               <br />
               another document which has not been put in the 
               <br />
               Black Book at all.

               Mr. Chairman I am afraid we have to part 
               <br />
               company on that point. I said that the fact that we 
               <br />
               have to accept that as ofﬁcial, as you put it, by no 
               <br />

               <br />
