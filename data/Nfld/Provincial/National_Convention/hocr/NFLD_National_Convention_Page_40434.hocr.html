               <br />
               ﬁshermen should have some protection. Our 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen begin ﬁshing at the age of 18 and ﬁsh 
               <br />
               until they can no longer get into a boat and in 
               <br />
               many cases it has been brought to my notice, 
               <br />
               when they can no longer get into a boat they are 
               <br />
               very much in the same position as when they

               began. When the ﬁrst meeting was held I asked 
               <br />
               permission to mention that social security 
               <br />
               scheme. I had in mind something in the nature of 
               <br />
               retiring allowances; that is, a man on reaching the 
               <br />
               age of 60 would receive a retiring allowance so 
               <br />
               that for the remainder of his days he would be 
               <br />
               looked after, and in the case of sickness would 
               <br />
               not have to fall back on the government. There 
               <br />
               have been cases where men in the prime of health 
               <br />
               have been called across the bar. They have noth- 
               <br />
               ing to leave to their wives and families. The wife 
               <br />
               and family is completely dependent upon, I think, 
               <br />
               $10 a quarter — the widow’s mite. I felt that 
               <br />
               should not be. There should be something to 
               <br />
               provide for his family. Therefore I introduced the 
               <br />
               idea that there should be some quarterly contribu- 
               <br />
               tion made by the ﬁshermen so that their families 
               <br />
               could be looked after. The insurance scheme 
               <br />
               before us applies in the case of death; there is no 
               <br />
               provision in the case of sickness and both the man 
               <br />
               and his family must fall back absolutely upon the 
               <br />
               government and I do not think that is good 
               <br />
               enough. I have here a social security scheme 
               <br />
               drawn up by Mr. Bannikin which was presented 
               <br />
               to the Department of Natural Resources in 1943. 
               <br />
               I think it is a good one. My plan was to collect 
               <br />
               from the ﬁshermen and that is not so easy. His is 
               <br />
               to collect so much yearly from the exporters of 
               <br />
               our products, place it in the hands of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment and from that to pay yearly to ﬁshermen on 
               <br />
               pensions. If it is in order. 1 would ask the 
               <br />
               Secretary to read that scheme.
