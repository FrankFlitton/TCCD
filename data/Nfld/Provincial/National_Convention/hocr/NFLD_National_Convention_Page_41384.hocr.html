               At this juncturel take it we are at the parting of 
               <br />
               the ways in this country. Our people have the 
               <br />
               power and the authority, or will have in May, to 
               <br />
               select a government of their own choosing, and 
               <br />
               it is most important that they give their every 
               <br />
               consideration to which of the two forms of 
               <br />
               government, or more if they are submitted, which 
               <br />
               will best serve their interests, and to which we 
               <br />
               can be most loyal. I am of the conﬁrmed opinion 
               <br />
               that an elected government, responsible to the 
               <br />
               people, is the best form of government which this 
               <br />
               or any other country can achieve, and I hope and 
               <br />
               trust that when our people come to make up their 
               <br />
               minds they will also consider that too.

               I might say that I am against Commission 
               <br />
               government. One thing about us, we have a bar- 
               <br />
               gaining power today, and we must use it. We can 
               <br />
               produce ﬁsh, ores and wood products. There will 
               <br />
               always be a world demand for these products. 
               <br />
               Our job is to sell, and to the highest bidder. If we 
               <br />
               have other tangible or intangible assets, such as 
               <br />
               a strategic position, let us sell that too, and to the 
               <br />
               highest bidder compatible with the best interests 
               <br />
               of the country. We have got to face facts, Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman. We have just fought one war, and 
               <br />
               anybody can see that we are likely to have to ﬁght 
               <br />
               another war sometime; how soon we do not 
               <br />
               know, but we have been told day in and day out 
               <br />
               that we occupy a strategic position, and it is as 
               <br />
               well for us to be realistic. People who live in 
               <br />
               strategic positions run the risk of dying a sudden 
               <br />
               death, especially in these days of atomic ﬁssion. 
               <br />
               We know our position in the Atlantic Ocean, and 
               <br />
               it is just as well for us to be realistic and face these 
               <br />
               facts. Our people are going to live in a strategic 
               <br />
               position. All right, let us elect a government and 
               <br />
               get for the people who are doing enough to live 
               <br />
               in this country, the best possible living that there 
               <br />
               is in it.

               Mr. Chairman, once upon a time we were 
               <br />
               proud to call ourselves the cornerstone of Empire. 
               <br />
               I wonder now, cannot we visualise a prouder 
               <br />
               place in the new world structure to be? Cannot 
               <br />
               we aspire to be the keystone in the arch of 
               <br />
               freedom and friendliness between Canada, the 
               <br />
               United States and the western democracies of 
               <br />
               Europe? We can only become this keystone if we 
               <br />
               recover and retain our independence, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">en»</span>

               I was referring to the Labrador. We are told 
               <br />
               that we have vast potential timber wealth there. 
               <br />
               What are we going to do about it? There’s one 
               <br />
               thing about it, if we do not keep control of it 
               <br />
               ourselves it will do us no beneﬁt whatsoever.

               Recently I read in the Atlantic Reporter in 
               <br />
               Canada, which has just been issued a few days 
               <br />
               ago, under the heading of “Iron and Lumber for 
               <br />
               Export”: “The new discoveries of iron ore in 
               <br />
               Quebec and Labrador promise the largest source 
               <br />
               of this vital raw material since the discovery of 
               <br />
               the Mesabi deposits in Minnesota. Preliminary 
               <br />
               explorations of this ore body have gone far 
               <br />
               enough to invite both Canadian and United States 
               <br />
               governmental and industrial interest. The United 
               <br />
               States needs Canadian ore desperately, and the 
               <br />
               new mines open up challenging opportunities for 
               <br />
               investment of United States capital.” I ask you to 
               <br />
               apply that statement to Newfoundland <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> New- 
               <br />
               foundland ore and Newfoundland timber that’s 
               <br />
               there on the Labrador. Let us ask ourselves, can 
               <br />
               we recommend any other form of government 
               <br />
               than one of the two in the motion of Mr. Higgins?

               The United States of America, sir, needs all 
               <br />
               the timber she can get, and needs it badly. I ask 
               <br />
               you again to think of the potential market for ﬁsh 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               foundlanders. By them the great majority of our

               housetops the praises due to the Fisheries Board 
               <br />
               under the able chairmanship of Mr. Ray Gushue, 
               <br />
               and those enterprising ﬁrms in St. John’s and 
               <br />
               elsewhere in the country for their initiative in 
               <br />
               regard to marketing, and their faith in the fresh 
               <br />
               ﬁsh business. Take a walk over to the Southside 
               <br />
               and have a look at Job Bros. plant, and see one of 
               <br />
               the ﬁnest on the Atlantic seaboard. It is the only 
               <br />
               one I have seen, but there are many others in the 
               <br />
               country. Think on these things and again, I ask 
               <br />
               you, what other form can we vote for except one 
               <br />
               of the two in the motion? Come with me to Corner 
               <br />
               Brook and Grand Falls, or go with Mr. Fudge to

               Curling and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr,</span> Jackman to Bell Island, or go to 
               <br />
               Gander and Harmon Field, and back to Fort Pep- 
               <br />
               perrell by way of Argentia, and count the New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders as they toil, and the men who will 
               <br />
               make good money at the seal ﬁshery. Let us think

               on these things.
