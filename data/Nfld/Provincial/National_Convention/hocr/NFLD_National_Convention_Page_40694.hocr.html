               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, I want to say at 
               <br />
               the outset everything that I can say complimen- 
               <br />
               tary about this report. I happen to be one who has 
               <br />
               a great respect for hard work. Major Cashin, who 
               <br />
               wrote this report, is a hard worker, and I take my 
               <br />
               hat off to a hard worker any time. Secondly the 
               <br />
               report shows this, if nothing else did, that he is a 
               <br />
               man of great optimism, and I take my hat off to 
               <br />
               him for his great optimism also... I am afraid that 
               <br />
               what I have got to say from this point on is not 
               <br />
               very complimentary. But Major Cashin has been 
               <br />
               a Minister of Finance. He has introduced three 
               <br />
               budgets before, and it won’t be a new experience
