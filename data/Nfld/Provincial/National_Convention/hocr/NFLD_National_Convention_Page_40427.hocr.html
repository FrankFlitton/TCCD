               Job! Seriously, further back in your report here, 
               <br />
               dealing with codﬁsh alone you said that the future 
               <br />
               value of exports might be $10 million, and to be 
               <br />
               on the safe side you had better put it at $8 million. 
               <br />
               Well, if you take the production last year, $34.5 
               <br />
               million, counting the million that was eaten here 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland, you will ﬁnd that nearly $17.5 
               <br />
               million of that was salt codfish alone, and you 
               <br />
               ﬁgure for the future $8 million, less than half. 
               <br />
               Incidentally in this total for last year, have you 
               <br />
               got the oils?

               <br />
               going to be worth a lot less than $2.5 million, 
               <br />
               unless the fall in price is more than made up by 
               <br />
               the increase in output? We might still have $2.5 
               <br />
               million worth to export in that case, but all 
               <br />
               through this long table making up $3.5 million, 
               <br />
               surely to goodness in the next three or four years 
               <br />
               there is going to be considerable decline in value 
               <br />
               of a great many items, even if there is an increase 
               <br />
               in the value of many others, and to make a total

               <br />
