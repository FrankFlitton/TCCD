               All I want to say about that clause is this. In 
               <br />
               Newfoundland we have had for many years, 
               <br />
               before any of us was born, a system of education 
               <br />
               that has grown up based on the beliefs and the 
               <br />
               ideas and the needs of our people... It is a system 
               <br />
               under which the various religious denominations 
               <br />
               have their own school system. Each denomina- 
               <br />
               tion has its own schools and these schools are 
               <br />
               supported by the government out of the public 
               <br />
               funds, most of them. They also raise money of 
               <br />
               their own, as we all know... Clause 19 says that 
               <br />
               ﬁrst of all, only the legislature of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               can pass any laws concerning education if we 
               <br />
               become a province... Secondly, they could not 
               <br />
               pass any law which would affect the rights of the 
               <br />
               different denominations to have their own 
               <br />
               schools; their rights are protected and they can go 
               <br />
               on as long as time lasts because no law can be 
               <br />
               made to change <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that.</span> If any two denominations 
               <br />
               or more should ever wish to unite their schools 
               <br />
               into one system, their right is protected here and 
               <br />
               it is left entirely to the people and the legislature 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland, and no one else can interfere 
               <br />
               in it. In other words, this clause protects our 
               <br />
               present school system, leaves it just like it is. 
               <br />
               unless we Newfoundlanders should ever wish to 
               <br />
               change it ourselves...

               Mr. Smallwood Yes, by uniting any two or

               <br />
               right is guaranteed in clause 19. The Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister has made it quite clear that if Newfoundland 
               <br />
               wishes to change that clause, if this Convention 
               <br />
               desired to ask the Government of Canada if they 
               <br />
               would change it in some way, they are open to 
               <br />
               receive the request. If far more responsible 
               <br />
               people than this Convention wish to take up the 
               <br />

               Canada what our school system is, they were 
               <br />
               most anxious to protect our rights as they stand 
               <br />
               today. So they put in a clause to do that. It does 
               <br />
               exactly that. But the Prime Minister says, “With
