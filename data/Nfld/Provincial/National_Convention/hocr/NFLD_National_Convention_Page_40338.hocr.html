               which indicates beyond doubt that the financial

               policy of the present government is to dissipate 
               <br />
               the treasury wealth of this country in a manner so

               <br />
               we ﬁnd that it is the intention of the government

               to run our expenditure up to the colossal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unheard»</span>

               of total of nearly $40 million, more than half our

               <br />
               come to one conclusion: that it is part of a callous 
               <br />
               and deliberately planned campaign to bleed the 
               <br />

               <br />
               will be impossible for us ever to stand on our own 
               <br />
               feet; to so weaken us, that we will have no other 
               <br />
               recourse, but to remain forever at subservient and 
               <br />
               penurious people.

               Now if, in view of this extraordinary spending, 
               <br />
               there was any commensurate arrangements to

               is no such justiﬁcation. Another thing I would 
               <br />
               like to point out is that the proposed expenditure 
               <br />
               would, on the face of it, appear as the ordinary 
               <br />
               and necessary expenditure incidental to the 
               <br />
               proper operation of government, but such is not 
               <br />
               the case. Because out of this $40 million the sum 
               <br />
               of only $23 million is required for the administra-

               <br />
               as a creative, an artificial expenditure, and to that 
               <br />
               extent the budget of the Commission is both false 
               <br />
               and misleading:

               In a previous address on September 18, 1946,

               <br />

               indicated that the Commission government had a

               Mr. Chairman, I may have possibly wandered
