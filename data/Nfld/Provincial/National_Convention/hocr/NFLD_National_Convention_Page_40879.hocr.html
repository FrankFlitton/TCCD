               house that might fetch $3,000 in St. John’s would 
               <br />

               Mr. Vardy To give the true position, it is exactly 
               <br />
               this: I have never yet seen an application for old 
               <br />
               age pension where they valued their property at 
               <br />
               more than $2,000. Now the question arises of 
               <br />
               course, and the question we should ask ourselves 
               <br />
               in fairness to these people is this: Will the pension 
               <br />
               authorities under a provincial government place 
               <br />
               a different value on an applicant’s property in the 
               <br />
               outports or in St. John’s from the value placed by 
               <br />
               the applicant himself? You see we must look at 
               <br />
               both sides of it. Here is the applicant. Here is the 
               <br />
               authority. I have many times seen application 
               <br />
               forms for various kinds of assistance questioned 
               <br />
               on the grounds that the means test may be perhaps 
               <br />
               coloured a little. An old age pensioner goes to a 
               <br />
               clergyman and gets his form ﬁlled out and then 
               <br />
               he goes to a J P and two or three others and gets 
               <br />
               them to sign it, and someone has to pull a few 
               <br />
               strings or do a little scratching down in the 
               <br />
               department in the course of the next six months 
               <br />
               to get his name on the list. Now I honestly feel 
               <br />
               that while on a forced sale the average old age

               <br />
               have to show both sides of the picture. The 
               <br />
               average outport home, as we know the property 
               <br />

               <br />
               I have stated for the average person who would 
               <br />
               be applying for an old age pension and submitting 
               <br />
               to a means test. His property would not be worth 
               <br />
               more than around $500 to $1,500. That is the real
