               It is interesting to note that the Geological 
               <br />
               Survey has to date investigated some 27 different 
               <br />
               metals and/or minerals, and have published some 
               <br />
               25 bulletins, maps and circulars on these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inves»</span> 
               <br />
               tigations, some of which have been supplied you 
               <br />
               by the Committee. It has been shown that mining 
               <br />
               is the most highly paid industry in the country as 
               <br />
               far as the average wage is concerned Over 3,000 
               <br />
               men ﬁnd employment, about 2,800 of these in the 
               <br />
               two major operations at Bell Island and Buchans, 
               <br />
               the remainder at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">St.</span> Lawrence and Aguathuna. 
               <br />
               Last year these 3,000 men earned approximatley 
               <br />
               $6 million. It is therefore evident how important 
               <br />
               it is that no efort be spared in developing our 
               <br />
               known mineral assets.

               It is encouraging to note that the LaManche 
               <br />
               mines may again go into production after lying 
               <br />
               dormant for some 23 years, and the possibility of 
               <br />
               a townsite near the asbestos desposit on the west 
               <br />

               <br />
               employed. This augurs well for the future and I 
               <br />
               feel that if we had more holes in the ground like 
               <br />
               those at Buchans and Bell Island, we need have 
               <br />
               no fear about being self—supporting. We have in

               Labrador one of the greatest known mineral 
               <br />

               <br />
               can see at the present time, there is every 
               <br />
               likelihood that it will be in operation in two or 
               <br />
               three years’ time. It is difﬁcult for us to realise 
               <br />
               the magnitude of this proposed operation. We 
               <br />
               have never had anything approaching it before in

               In view of all that has been said here these last 
               <br />
               few days, it is evident that there is some dif- 
               <br />
               ference of opinion regarding the amount by 
               <br />
               which the treasury of this country is to beneﬁt 
               <br />
               directly. As our chairman has pointed out to you, 
               <br />
               the information regarding the Quebec agreement 
               <br />
               came into the possession of the Committee since 
               <br />
               our report was presented, therefore we have not 
               <br />
               given you our considered opinions, but instead 
               <br />
               have presented you with all the facts at our dis- 
               <br />
               posal. Anything I may say is not necessarily the 
               <br />
               opinion of the Mining Committee. I am still in— 
               <br />
               clined to believe that the 1938 act contained more 
               <br />
               advantages than does the 1944 act, insofar as 
               <br />
               Newfoundland is concerned. But then that is only 
               <br />
               a personal opinion, and personal opinions are apt 
               <br />
               to be prejudiced, and in fact we have had legal 
               <br />
               and expert advice on the subject and all tend to 
               <br />
               discredit that belief.

               It is quite possible, that conscious of past 
               <br />
               experiences, we may be loath to believe the true 
               <br />

               ever, those who are supposed to know, and in my 
               <br />
               opinion should have the best interest of this 
               <br />
               country at heart, state emphatically that our 
               <br />
               agreement of 1944 compares favourably with the 
               <br />
               Quebec agreement, and that under the l938 
               <br />
               agreement the company could not operate. If we 
               <br />
               were to have this major development in our ter-

               ritory it could only under the terms of the 1944 
               <br />
               act, and if we can believe this we would be 
               <br />
               justiﬁed in accepting this agreement in the best 
               <br />
               interests of the country as a whole. I fear that any 
               <br />
               arguments l have heard expressed in this assemb-
