               have gone through this Veterans‘ Act of Canada, 
               <br />

               far as I am concerned because Lam not personally

               <br />
               some war veterans were trying to get at. There 
               <br />
               are a few other items here. Medical care and 
               <br />
               treatment is next. I don’t know if members wish 
               <br />

               that the Canadian one is a good bit better than
