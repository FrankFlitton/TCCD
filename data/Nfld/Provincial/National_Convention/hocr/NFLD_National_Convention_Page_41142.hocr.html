               these iron areas in Labrador. We know that

               during the present session of Congress in the 
               <br />
               United States legislation is being brought before 
               <br />
               the House of Representatives to facilitate the 
               <br />
               passing of the St. Lawrence waterway project, 
               <br />
               designed for the purpose of deepening the canals 
               <br />
               leading from the St. Lawrence River into the 
               <br />
               Great Lakes, so that ships which carry 10,000- 
               <br />
               12,000 tons of cargo and draw 30 feet of water 
               <br />
               can navigate safely. We know that Canada is 
               <br />
               under control from the United States, that her 
               <br />
               finances are controlled from there, that her 
               <br />
               military policy is controlled from there, and that 
               <br />
               right at the present time the Canadian military 
               <br />
               authorities are making preparations for military 
               <br />
               emergencies. This high grade steel necessary for 
               <br />
               military purposes, as well as the high grade ore is 
               <br />
               obtainable in Labrador. If Canada could control 
               <br />
               the iron ore industry of North America she would 
               <br />
               be in a position to dictate terms to the USA, as 
               <br />
               America uses 100 million tons of iron ore annu—

               In all this planning the hand of the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom is seen. We see the concessions given 
               <br />
               the Labrador Mining Company being changed to 
               <br />

               <br />
               of this Labrador agreement giving <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New»</span> 
               <br />
               foundland absolutely nothing. For instance, we 
               <br />
               find that this great water-power in Labrador is 
               <br />
               handed over to the Labrador Mining Company 
               <br />
               for nothing -- its development ultimately would 
               <br />
               bring Newfoundland only 15.75 cents per 
               <br />
               developed horsepower, whilst similar projects in 
               <br />
               the Province of Quebec pay to the Quebec 
               <br />
               government not less than $1 per horsepower, and 
               <br />
               in this instance the Quebec Labrador pays in 
               <br />
               rental to the Quebec government $100,000 a year 
               <br />
               gratis. Let me point out that the hydro-electric 
               <br />
               development at Deer Lake in the Humber area 
               <br />
               does not pay anything in the way of royalties to 
               <br />
               the Newfoundland treasury. On the other hand, 
               <br />
               the Buchans mining company is paying the 
               <br />
               Bowater company at the rate of $4 per horse— 
               <br />
               power for the necessary electric energy to operate 
               <br />
               their industry, and that the Buchans mining com- 
               <br />
               pany pay all told to the Corner Brook company 
               <br />
               almost $50,000 yearly for electric power. In view 
               <br />
               of this experience, are we, as a people, justiﬁed 
               <br />
               in standing idly by and permitting the Commis-

               Mr. Chairman, I have repeatedly stated that 
               <br />
               the only interest from an economic standpoint 
               <br />
               that Canada has in Newfoundland is to obtain by 
               <br />
               either fair means or foul our Labrador possession. 
               <br />
               Proof of this statement has been frequently given 
               <br />
               by both Premier Duplessis of Quebec, and former 
               <br />
               Premier Godbout of the same province. When I 
               <br />
               brought this matter up sometime ago, Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood got up and abused Premier Duplessis. 
               <br />
               He termed him a Nazi and a Fascist, and I don’t 
               <br />
               know what else. Well I have just come from 
               <br />
               Canada, and I venture the opinion that the provin- 
               <br />
               cial election in Quebec will return Duplessis by 
               <br />
               a larger majority than ever, and that there is a 
               <br />
               great probability of the reform of the Liberal 
               <br />
               party in Ottawa. Prime Minister King is about to 
               <br />
               retire, and his successor is very difﬁcult to find. 
               <br />
               I predict that you will ﬁnd in 18 months or two 
               <br />
               years another leader of the federal opposition in 
               <br />
               Ottawa, and I think Colonel George Drew will 
               <br />
               head the Conservative party, and together with 
               <br />
               Duplessis will lead the party at the next general 
               <br />
               election. Mr. Smallwood laughs and thinks he 
               <br />
               knows all about it! 
               <br />

               During the past year the Quebec government 
               <br />
               has issued an ofﬁcial map of that province show— 
               <br />
               ing the entire Labrador, including the 110,000 
               <br />
               square miles of Newfoundland territory, as part 
               <br />
               of the Province of Quebec. Quebec has been 
               <br />
               disappointed ever since the judgement of the 
               <br />
               Privy Council in 1927 gave Newfoundland this 
               <br />
               particular <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">territory,</span> They are disgruntled because 
               <br />
               they did not avail of the opportunity given them 
               <br />
               in 1925 by our Monroe government. I think Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood said that no efforts were made, but I 
               <br />
               know that Prime Minister Monroe, Sir John Ben- 
               <br />
               nett, Mr. Justice Higgins, and Mr. Patrick Mc- 
               <br />
               Grath went to Quebec as representatives of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, to try to settle it out of court as it 
               <br />
               were; and if my memory serves me right — if I 
               <br />
               see Mr. Monroe tomorrow I will ask him <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> they 
               <br />
               offered to settle with the Quebec government that 
               <br />
               they could take the Labrador, and we would only 
               <br />
               retain our fishing rights on it, and Quebec would 
               <br />
               pay the Newfoundland government $15 million. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood $10 million. 
               <br />

               Mr. Cashin Well, that’s worse. Quebec thought

               they had the case sewed up. They have been sore
