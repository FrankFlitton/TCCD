               <br />
               Iceland ﬁsh and not ours. They could very well 
               <br />
               take our fish. Could you enlarge on it?

               Mr. Cashin As I gathered from the conversation 
               <br />
               they had ﬁnished negotiations for 12,000 tons 
               <br />
               of Iceland fish. They were asked what the mean— 
               <br />
               ing of “soft money” was, and the answer did not 
               <br />
               materially change the situation. It was merely a 
               <br />
               name. They were buying ﬁsh from Iceland and 
               <br />
               not from us. They put the dollar business right 
               <br />
               over to us again, and when we brought up that we 
               <br />
               had advanced $2.5 million for three ships they 
               <br />
               were building over there, they could not see why 
               <br />
               we could not send the cash over and not the ﬁsh. 
               <br />
               They were indignant that we should question the 
               <br />
               matter of us sending the cash and their not buying 
               <br />
               the fish. Furthermore they were buying a lot of 
               <br />
               ﬁsh from Norway and not from here. They gave 
               <br />
               them ﬁsh for that. There was some kind of a deal 
               <br />
               in that respect. It was just another brush-off.

               Mr. Cashin It is the same old story. As a matter 
               <br />
               of fact the Mining Committee brought up that 
               <br />
               contract of 750,000 tons for this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">year.</span> We were 
               <br />
               pushing them to get a continuous contract for a 
               <br />
               number of years. It came out in our talks that the 
               <br />
               actual money for this year’s iron ore has not been 
               <br />
               approved by the Treasury at the present time. 
               <br />
               Whilst they are negotiating, and are prepared to 
               <br />
               take the ore, it is still in the hands of the Treasury. 
               <br />
               We were told that the Commission of Govern- 
               <br />
               ment had been pushing that matter —— the Com- 
               <br />
               mission has been pushing everything. They 
               <br />
               pointed out the freight rates were somewhat high 
               <br />
               in connection with the transportation of ore. The 
               <br />
               British Ministry of Shipping controls freight 
               <br />
               rates. They make or break them. I feel we are 
               <br />
               going to have that contract for 750,000 tons of 
               <br />
               ore, but for next yearl would not bank on it. Even 
               <br />
               though the steel industry is going to be 
               <br />
               nationalised, even when we pointed that out, they 
               <br />
               would not say whether or not they would buy the 
               <br />
               ore. You will notice from the last memorandum, 
               <br />
               the matter came up and we were told we were not 
               <br />
               the government. In other words we were given a 
               <br />
               smack on the hand, and told to go home and be 
               <br />
