               now put. 
               <br />
               [The motion carried] 
               <br />
               Mr. Bradley I move that the report of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">comv</span> 
               <br />
               rnittee as a whole be adopted. 
               <br />
               Mr. Jackman I would like to speak on a per— 
               <br />
               sonal matter that applies to all of us. I refer to a 
               <br />
               report in the Daily News regarding yesterday’s 
               <br />
               proceedings. 1 notice that the report says some of 
               <br />
               the delegates were absent and it does not give the 
               <br />
               names. I am from an outpott and I am certain that 
               <br />
               my supporters at home are watching the papers 
               <br />
               daily and when they see a report that some of the 
               <br />
               delegates were absent, it is quite possible that 
               <br />
               they are going to mark me down as being off the 
               <br />
               job. I do not think a delegate should absent him- 
               <br />
               self from a session unless under circumstances 
               <br />
               beyond his control. When a member is unable to 
               <br />
               attend he should notify the Secretary and in future 
               <br />
               the names, as regards absenteeism, should be 
               <br />
               given in the reports. 
               <br />
               Mr. Brown I would be the ﬁrst to disagree with 
               <br />
               that. If this Convention lasts six months, six 
               <br />
               weeks or two years, I am not going to be here 
               <br />
               every sitting and there are few members of this 
               <br />
               Convention who have not business that will not 
               <br />
               permit their attending all sittings. I may have to 
               <br />
               go to a meeting of the Woods Labour <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Bomd</span> or 
               <br />
               some other such convention; I cannot be in both 
               <br />
               places at the one time and one thing is just as 
               <br />
               important as the other. Down through the years 
               <br />
               there never was anything in the rules, to my 
               <br />
               knowledge, that prevented a man’s being absent. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Quite right. 
               <br />
               Mr. Brown Why should we adopt a rule saying 
               <br />
               a man must be in his seat at every session? I know 
               <br />
               that the people whom I have the honour to repre— 
               <br />
               sent will not expect me to be here every sitting. I 
               <br />
               have as much interest in my country and as much 
               <br />
               interest in this Convention as anyone else, but it 
               <br />
