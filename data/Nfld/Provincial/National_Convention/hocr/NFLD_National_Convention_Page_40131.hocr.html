               and his family lives. Even in these so-called

               <br />

               not. Are we, this National Convention, sent here

               by these very people who are at this moment

               suffering untold hardships, are we going to deny 
               <br />
               them the facts concerning confederation, or any— 
               <br />
               thing else for that matter? If I did such a thing I 
               <br />
               would consider myself a traitor to the cause I 
               <br />
               have taken up. If I became a party to such a

               <br />
               stand on my feel and call myself a true New- 
               <br />
               foundlander? I think not. At this time we have to 
               <br />
               be realistic, we have to face the facts, however 
               <br />
               distasteful they may appear. We have to acquit 
               <br />
               ourselves like men, and be strong; we must not

               <br />
               to have an overriding inﬂuence over our better 
               <br />

               <br />
               not from any selﬁsh motives, but from an intense 
               <br />
               desire to see that this land of ours has a ﬁghting

               chance, that our people have a chance to live 
               <br />
               decent lives. And in that spirit, I support the 
               <br />
               motion now before the Chair. 
               <br />
               Mr. Fogwill Mr. Chairman, I am in accord with 
               <br />
               the principle embodied in this resolution al- 
               <br />
               though I am not in accord with the method, that 
               <br />
               of sending a delegation to Ottawa. What could a 
               <br />
               delegation possibly accomplish except to confer 
               <br />
               with the government ofﬁcials of that country? 
               <br />
               Whatever is done will have to be reduced to 
               <br />
               writing and presented to this Convention. Could 
               <br />
               not the terms of confederation be ascertained in 
               <br />
               another way? Is it not possible for this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion to ﬁnd out those terms by transmitting its 
               <br />
               enquiry to the Canadian government through the 
               <br />
               regular diplomatic channels which exist between 
               <br />
               the governments of both countries? If that is 
               <br />
               possible then, why send a delegation at all? 
               <br />

               As regards the time of ascertaining the terms, 
               <br />
               in my opinion it does not matter whether those 
               <br />
               terms arrive now or in January. We have the 
               <br />
               ruling of the Chair that it is within the scope of 
               <br />
               this Convention to ﬁnd out those terms. But we

               I did not come here with a deﬁnite opinion in 
               <br />
               support of any particular form of government. 
               <br />
               But I did come here with the opinion that Com- 
               <br />
               mission of Government must go and an elected 
               <br />
               government be restored; we should never have 
               <br />
               lost the rights of responsible government. Before 
               <br />
               I closel would like to make an observation. Since 
               <br />
               I sat in this House I have not said very much, but 
               <br />
               a couple of weeks ago I did object to some words 
               <br />
               which were embodied in a report that was 
               <br />
               presented here, and for my objection I was as- 
               <br />
               sociated with radicalism by someone who 
               <br />
               probably does not know the meaning of the word 
               <br />
               “radical". I was born and reared in New- 
               <br />
               foundland and have lived all my life in the City 
               <br />
               of St. John’s, and during that time I have worked 
               <br />
               for the period of 29 years, and in that 29 years I 
               <br />
               have been fortunate to enjoy six weeks vacation 
               <br />
               with pay. If that is a deﬁnition of a radical then I 
               <br />
               should be proud to be a radical, and I would think 
               <br />
               that there are many more people of the same 
               <br />
               category in this country who would think in the 
               <br />
               same terms as I. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               In conclusion, and I hope I am right in saying 
               <br />
               this, I believe the question of federating with the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada is a question that must be 
               <br />
               left to a duly elected government of this country, 
               <br />
               and they should have a clear mandate from the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland before any steps are 
               <br />
               taken to implement any terms of union that may 
               <br />
               be considered.

               Mr. Jones Mr. Chairman, in the opening days 
               <br />
               of this Convention when the Chadwick-Jones 
               <br />
               report was up for discussion, I said that all forms 
               <br />
               of government should be set aside until the 
               <br />
               desired facts had been collected and examined. I 
               <br />
               am sorry that suggestion has not been adhered to. 
               <br />
               I saw then, as some of us see now, that it was bad 
               <br />
               policy to introduce a discussion on the different 
               <br />
               forms of government before the facts had been 
               <br />
               ascertained. At the present time we know very 
               <br />
               little of the economic conditions of this country, 
               <br />
               and I think it is a mistake to send a delegation to 
               <br />
               Ottawa from this Convention until we know its 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial condition. I would not wish to be one of 
               <br />
