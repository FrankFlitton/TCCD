               the ﬁrst six years of Commission government we 
               <br />
               had no economic prosperity or security or 
               <br />
               stability. Then the war broke out, and hundreds 
               <br />
               of millions of dollars poured in here from Canada 
               <br />
               and the United States to build all those bases. 
               <br />
               There was lots of work then. You could sell 
               <br />
               anything. Now since the war ended, and with the 
               <br />
               whole world short of this and that, we could still 
               <br />
               sell our ﬁsh and our oil and ore, and we don't feel 
               <br />
               like thanking the Commission government for 
               <br />
               that. They did not start the war. We can’t praise 
               <br />
               or blame them for that. We have had Commission 
               <br />
               government for the past 14 years — six years 
               <br />
               before the war, six years during the war, and two 
               <br />
               years since the war, and what economic stability 
               <br />
               have we had? We had a bit during the war, and a 
               <br />
               lot less since the war, and already it has started to 
               <br />
               wear very thin for a lot of our people. It has 
               <br />
               started to wear very thin, this wonderful 
               <br />
               prosperity, for the 13 or 15,000 of our New— 
               <br />
               foundland people who are on the dole <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tonight,</span> 
               <br />
               Prosperity is wearing very thin for them, but if 
               <br />
               Commission government gave us full economic 
               <br />
               security up to now, what chance is there that they 
               <br />
               will give us economic security in the future? 
               <br />
               None at all, Mr. Chairman, not a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bit.</span> The Corn- 
               <br />
               missioners would be the ﬁrst themselves to admit 
               <br />
               it. There is only one thing that the Commission 
               <br />
               government can promise us or guarantee us, and 
               <br />
               that is that they will collect taxes from us and they 
               <br />
               will spend the money honestly. That is, they 
               <br />
               won’t rob the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">till,</span> They can’t even promise that 
               <br />
               they will do these two things wisely: wisely col- 
               <br />
               lect the taxes, and wisely spend them. As for 
               <br />
               guaranteeing economic security in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> 
               <br />
               foundland, it is out of the question altogether. So 
               <br />
               you see, Mr. Chairman, the Commission govern- 
               <br />
               ment means neither political freedom nor 
               <br />
               economic security, neither one or the other, and 
               <br />
               responsible government does not mean political 
               <br />
               freedom without economic security, because 
               <br />
               there can’t be such a thing as political freedom 
               <br />
               without economic security, and in any case, what 
               <br />
               I want in this country and for our people is a form 
               <br />
               of government that will mean political freedom 
               <br />
               and economic security, both, for one is useless 
               <br />
               without the other. I can tell you that is what our 
               <br />
               people are looking for. First and foremost our 
               <br />
