               <br />
               volume of business; but I believe the federal sales 
               <br />
               tax is 8%. Let us see how this tax works out with 
               <br />
               regard to Mr. Smallwood’s assertion that the rich 
               <br />
               would pay for this family allowance. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               This most vicious tax hits every man, woman, 
               <br />
               child and babe in arms after they collect from 
               <br />
               those citizens, old and young. First we have a 
               <br />
               sales tax income of $325 million which will pay 
               <br />
               for the family bonus of $260 million and the old 
               <br />
               age pension of $82 million within $17 million of 
               <br />
               both expenses. Now in heaven’s name, how can 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood say that this is soaking the rich; 
               <br />
               it even soaks the family allowance itself, for if a 
               <br />
               woman with one child buys $5 worth of essentials 
               <br />
               per month, she chips back into the family al— 
               <br />
               lowance ante 40 cents. Is that soaking the rich? I 
               <br />
               think this should clear up this matter of who soaks 
               <br />
               who. The unassailable fact is that the cents are 
               <br />
               taken from everybody. The man who has his 
               <br />
               family dragged up, and wants to go a little easier, 
               <br />
               every time his wife goes to the shop to spend a 
               <br />
               buck, she chips in eight cents towards the raising 
               <br />
               of somebody else’s kids; even if he is 60 and ﬁnds 
               <br />
               it hard to do a day’s work. It’s simple for us to 
               <br />
               have a baby bonus that way. So, to me at least, 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood’s plan is not so good. He has 
               <br />
               made a wonderful table of all the places by dis— 
               <br />
               tricts. Let us take the shops in those districts and 
               <br />
               find out the volume of business they do. Put on 
               <br />
               the sales tax and see what they will send out to 
               <br />
               Ottawa. Remember it will be taken from the 
               <br />
               earnings of the berries, the rabbits, the spuds you 
               <br />
               sell, also the few dozen eggs. Everything goes in 
               <br />
               the ante, as I see <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> Just ﬁgure to yourself. Just 
               <br />
               count the number of dollars you spend in a year 
               <br />
               and take eight cents out of each of them, and 
               <br />
               you’ll ﬁnd out what the baby bonus and the old 
               <br />
               age pension will cost <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">you,</span> Remember this bonus 
               <br />
               doesn’t come from the federal government of 
               <br />
               Canada. It comes from the people... Sorry this is 
               <br />
               so long, but I want the people to know....

               They have also in Canada what is known as

               <br />
               to handle it here, only to point out that added to 
               <br />
               the sales tax of $325 million it brings in $615 
               <br />
               million, enough to pay for the family allowance 
               <br />
               and the old age pension and leave a balance of 
               <br />
               $273 million. This excise tax is a superduper 
               <br />
               sales tax of which I will have more to say later. 
               <br />
               The reason for referring to it now is to show that 
               <br />
               it is not the rich who are paying for those services, 
               <br />
               but the very poor as well. It is a case of passing it 
               <br />
               from one pocket to another. 
               <br />

               I think in all honesty, the next time we send a 
               <br />
               delegation to Canada, in light of this, we should 
               <br />
               get a ﬁnancial expert, for had I been there I would 
               <br />
               have pushed it down their throats that this was 
               <br />
               anything but a bargain. They may be able to fool 
               <br />
               all their people, and we may be too green to burn, 
               <br />
               but they can‘t fool a green Newfoundlander. 
               <br />
               Some people take umbrage at the word “baby 
               <br />
               bonus" but to my mind I can call it nothing else 
               <br />
               — an inducement for people to have children, but 
               <br />
               it’s not ﬁnancially sound and tends not to the 
               <br />
               betterment of a people. If the money could be 
               <br />
               raised by another way but by a sales tax, then I 
               <br />
               could see the good of it, but this way it’s a 
               <br />
               detriment to a man who is trying to get ahead, 
               <br />
               while it subsidises those who look on life as a 
               <br />
               period of procreative activity. I don’t give much 
               <br />
               credit for the ﬁnancial brains of this Dominion if 
               <br />
               they can’t devise a better way to produce the 
               <br />
               funds to pay for those great services. Let us have 
               <br />
               them. I know it can be done, and of that I will 
               <br />
               speak later. I think this is a good argument against 
               <br />
               our turning our country over again to remote 
               <br />
               control. It seems we have been pikers in the past 
               <br />
               in the art of tax collection. See how easy it is. 
               <br />
               Anybody who has a shop is a tax collector. 1 can
