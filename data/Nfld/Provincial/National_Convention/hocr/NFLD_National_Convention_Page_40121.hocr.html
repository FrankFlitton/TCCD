               Mr. Banﬁeld Mr. Chairman, whether we are 
               <br />
               confederates or anti-confederates, I don’t see that 
               <br />
               it enters into the picture when it comes to voting 
               <br />
               on this motion. It is not a motion that makes 
               <br />
               confederates of us, nor anti-confederates of 
               <br />
               us, that takes any stand in the matter —- it is not 
               <br />
               a pro-confederation motion, nor an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anti—con»</span>

               federation motion. If I were the strongest and 
               <br />
               bitterest anti-confederate in this Convention, I 
               <br />
               would vote to get the terms of confederation, 
               <br />
               even if it was only for the purpose of attacking 
               <br />
               the terms. I cannot see that this Convention has 
               <br />
               any moral right to vote against the resolution, 
               <br />
               because it means voting against getting infor- 
               <br />
               mation that the people want. The people are 
               <br />
               expecting us to be fair and square, to get all the 
               <br />
               facts about confederation or any other form of 
               <br />
               government. There will be precious little respect 
               <br />
               for us if we close our ears and our minds to any 
               <br />
               proposal that may be for the good of the people. 
               <br />
               Who knows? Confederation may turn out to be 
               <br />
               the best thing that ever happened to us. It may 
               <br />
               also turn out to be the worst thing. We don’t know 
               <br />
               which it would be, because we don’t know what 
               <br />
               we’re talking about. We can’t be confederates 
               <br />
               today, any more than we can be anti-con- 
               <br />
               federates. The ﬁrst thing to do is get the facts, and 
               <br />
               that’s all the resolution asks. I am one of the many 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders anxious to get at the facts. I 
               <br />
               want to make up my mind on this confederation 
               <br />
               question that has been kicked about in this 
               <br />
               country as long as I can remember as a political 
               <br />
               football. We were never told the truth -— we were 
               <br />
               never given the facts about it. We all want to do 
               <br />
               the best possible thing for the country. When we 
               <br />
               know the terms and conditions, then we can form 
               <br />
               a sensible opinion. We will know if it is worth 
               <br />
               recommending, and the people will know if it’s 
               <br />
               worth voting for. I am not afraid of the people, of 
               <br />
               their fairness or common sense. I trust their sound 
               <br />
               judgment. It is not for this Convention to say 
               <br />
               whether we shall have confederation or not, that 
               <br />
               is not our job. That is up to the people. It is for 
               <br />
               them to decide whether we’ll have confederation 
               <br />
               or any other form of government. This resolution 
               <br />
               asks us to agree that we want the facts about 
               <br />
               confederation. I agree and if Mr. Smallwood had 
               <br />
               not moved this resolution I would have moved it 
               <br />
               myself, because I think it is our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">duty.</span> I think we 
               <br />
               owe it to our Newfoundland people so I am going 
               <br />
               to vote for this resolution when the vote is taken. 
               <br />
               Mr. Miller Mr. Chairman, I had not any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intenx</span> 
               <br />
               tion of discussing the present question, nor do I 
               <br />
               consider it calls for any lengthy debate; therefore 
               <br />
               I shall be as brief as possible. I will refer to a 
               <br />
               remark made by Mr. Butt earlier. He said: “We 
               <br />
               don’t seem to be quite clear on many things”, and 
               <br />
               I would say that we don’t seem to know where 
               <br />
