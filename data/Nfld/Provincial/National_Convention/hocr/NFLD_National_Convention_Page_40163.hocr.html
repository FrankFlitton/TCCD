               <br />
               and I think the pattern seems to fall clearly. What 
               <br />
               is wrong? We are going to ﬁnd the terms under

               we don’t want to go to Canada to get the terms. 
               <br />
               The terms have been right here in St. John’s for 
               <br />
               a long time. Newfoundland has been used as an

               nearly two years ago. Everybody wants the terms

               Mr. Hollett In introducing this Report of the 
               <br />
               Committee on Education, I wish to state that the

               Committee consisted of Messrs. Harrington, 
               <br />

               <br />
               Smallwood. Newell and myself. Each and every 
               <br />
               one of these members gave full attendance to all 
               <br />
               sessions of the Committee and gave great aid in 
               <br />

               ticular names might be invidious, but I am bound 
               <br />
               to mention the name of Mr. Newell, the secretary 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood It seems to me that the Conven—

               cism. One is the second paragraph which 
               <br />
               describes the Committee’s whole approach to the 
               <br />
               subject of its investigation; the other would be the

               final conclusions of the Committee, section 11. 
               <br />
               In section 2 it says:

               The Committee decided at the outset that 
               <br />
               its approach to the subject of education must 
               <br />
               be strictly limited in character. It felt its own
