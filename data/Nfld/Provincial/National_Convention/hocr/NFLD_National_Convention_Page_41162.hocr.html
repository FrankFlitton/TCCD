               that an elected government of Newfoundlanders, 
               <br />
               pledged to undertake this investigation into con- 
               <br />
               federation, is the only proper solution of the 
               <br />
               confederation issue. That is my advice to those of 
               <br />
               you who feel that confederation is the best solu- 
               <br />
               tion for Newfoundland. However, I want to say 
               <br />
               quite emphatically, that I am far from convinced 
               <br />
               that we can’t do a better job running our own 
               <br />
               affairs. You hear the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oftvrepeated</span> question, “Oh, 
               <br />
               we have not the men, where are we going to get 
               <br />
               the leaders?" That is nothing else but pure pop- 
               <br />
               pycock. The more contacts I have had with 
               <br />
               people outside Newfoundland, the more it makes 
               <br />
               me realise that we have in this country ample 
               <br />
               material to provide the type of men to do the job 
               <br />
               properly. Remember, if we had federal union 
               <br />
               with Canada, we would have to provide the men 
               <br />
               to go to Ottawa, and to man the provincial parlia— 
               <br />
               merit here, and if we have to get that number of 
               <br />
               men, surely we can get the number of men re- 
               <br />
               quired to run responsible government. I see no 
               <br />
               reason at all why we have to enter confederation. 
               <br />
               We are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self'supporting</span> at the present time, we all 
               <br />
               admit that, and it is up to us as a people to 
               <br />
               continue to be self-supporting. We have been told 
               <br />
               that under confederation there would be great 
               <br />
               advantages to Newfoundland. That may be so, 
               <br />
               but you gentlemen are old enough to know that 
               <br />
               you never get something for nothing, and that for 
               <br />
               this country to continue its present standard of 
               <br />
               living, and to increase that standard, is dependent 
               <br />
               primarily on the resources of the country itself. 
               <br />
               That is one inescapable fact. If our own resources 
               <br />
               are unable to produce a good livelihood for the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland, then no form of 
               <br />
               government is going to do so. That is one basic 
               <br />
               fact that nobody can dispute, nobody in this Con- 
               <br />
               vention or out of it. It may be true that some of 
               <br />
               our services would be improved, but essentially 
               <br />
               the country itself must provide for the people of 
               <br />
               the country, and all over the world today you have 
               <br />
               people ﬁghting for the right to govern themsel— 
               <br />
               ves. Here in Newfoundland some of us are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁghb</span> 
               <br />
               ing against the right to govern ourselves. What 
               <br />
               manner of people are we at all? Have we lost the 
               <br />
               courage of our forefathers, have we forgotten the 
               <br />
               value of our country? Do we want to be pen- 
               <br />
               sioners, to live off the charity of some other 
               <br />
               country? Someone has to provide a living for us, 
               <br />
               and this at a time when our country is in the 
               <br />
               strongest position it has ever been. To my card-

               Gentlemen, it would be the worst form of mad-

               <br />
               assume our own rightful obligation of governing 
               <br />
               ourselves. I don’t believe the fact can be repeated 
               <br />
               too often that the arrangements made with the 
               <br />
               British government, by the inauguration of the 
               <br />
               Commission government, was that responsible 
               <br />
               government would be restored to Newfoundland 
               <br />
               when we were self-supporting, and upon request 
               <br />
               of the Newfoundland people. Is this not the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               step? With all my heart and mind I recommend 
               <br />
               you to the adoption of that course. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Once again I would refer you back to that 
               <br />
               Atlantic Charter signed August 12, 1941, by the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister of Great Britain, at that time 
               <br />
               Winston Churchill, and the President of the 
               <br />
               United States, the late Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
               <br />
               Quoting that paragraph: “They respect the right 
               <br />
               of a people to choose the form of government 
               <br />
               under which they live, and they wish to see 
               <br />
               sovereign rights and self~government restored to 
               <br />
               those who have been forcibly deprived of them.” 
               <br />
               Well, if we have not been forcibly deprived of 
               <br />
               self-government, we went very close to that par- 
               <br />
               ticular point. There is an old Latin tag that I 
               <br />
               remember, “Wrong is done by force or fraud”. If 
               <br />
               we did not lose our government by force we lost 
               <br />
               it by the wrong of fraud.
