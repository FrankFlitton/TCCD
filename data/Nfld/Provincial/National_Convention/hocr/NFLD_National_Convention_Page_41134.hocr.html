               brainless thing with some money, and an old

               <br />
               presume, sir, it was the desire and intent of Mr.

               J.R. Smallwood to blast a man’s character be-

               <br />
               dalous charges, because I am not looking for 
               <br />
               recommendations of character from Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood or anyone. Imuch prefer to leave that 
               <br />
               to the people of the District of Carbonear, and the 
               <br />
               town of Carbonear in particular, where I have 
               <br />
               lived all my life. They sent me here to represent 
               <br />
               them, and as far as I am concerned, unsolicited 
               <br />
               According to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Smallwood, however, they sent 
               <br />
               here a brainless thing, unfit to represent anything;

               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, I have no com-

               <br />

               <br />
               and I believe now, to be fully merited because 
               <br />
               Mr. Penney, possibly he was unconscious of the 
               <br />
               fact and unaware of it, but Mr. Penney was most 
               <br />
               grossly and inexcusably rude to me on that oc- 
               <br />

               <br />
               that Mr. Penney presumes to be insulting to me, 
               <br />
               whether he realises it or not, he is going to get just 
               <br />
               as hard as he sends. Now I want to add one word. 
               <br />
               WhatI said was to him and not to the people of 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               prove before you in a private session, or in your

               Mr. Chairman I have tried to emphasise time

               and time again the maxim that “words are 
               <br />
               dangerous things”...it is very distressing that I 
               <br />

               <br />
               dignity of members of this chamber, to which

               they must surely have been entitled, otherwise

               they would never have been sent here by the

               Penney, that this thing occurred some consider-

               able time ago, I wonder if you would have any

               objection to my deferring a ruling until tomor-

               <br />
               the exact remarks before me, rather than to deal 
               <br />
               with the matter in the abstract now.... Would you 
               <br />
