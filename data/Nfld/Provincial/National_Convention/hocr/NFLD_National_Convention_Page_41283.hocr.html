               the basic economic maladjustments from which 
               <br />
               arises the necessity for a wider distribution of the

               cake. Not that that is anything to confederation’s 
               <br />
               detriment. To adjust those maladjustments you 
               <br />
               have to do more than change the form of govem- 
               <br />
               ment, you have to change the economics that men 
               <br />
               live by. In other words, as far as I can honestly 
               <br />
               and in conscience go at this moment is to say this: 
               <br />
               that I think that confederation is part of the

               <br />
               but that it is still not the complete and final 
               <br />
               answer. No form of government can be that. The 
               <br />
               complete and ﬁnal answer to a more spacious 
               <br />
               destiny can come only from among the people 
               <br />
               themselves.

               I look in the ﬁrst instance to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cooperative</span> 
               <br />
               movement to set to rights the basic economic 
               <br />
               maladjustments of this land. Someone, in a rather 
               <br />
               obvious attempt to smear the movement, called 
               <br />
               the co-operative movement communist. It hap~ 
               <br />
               pens to be the very antithesis. The co-operative 
               <br />
               movement is private enterprise carried to its logi— 
               <br />
               cal conclusion, for the aim of private enterprise 
               <br />
               is ownership, and what the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cooperative</span> move- 
               <br />
               ment seeks is the widest ownership for the 
               <br />
               greatest number. I am convinced that New- 
               <br />
               foundland cannot afford not to have a largely 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cooperative</span> economy, but I know that such an 
               <br />
               economy is not going to emerge next year, or the 
               <br />
               year after, or the year after that. All we have to 
               <br />
               show for ten years of effort is a few hundred 
               <br />
               organisations from the first 10,000 disciples. 
               <br />
               That is a creditable showing. Butl nevertheless 
               <br />
               doubt that the co-operative movement can take 
               <br />
               up the slack in our economic and social system 
               <br />
               fast enough.

               That leaves only one other acceptable formula 
               <br />
               immediately available that could be employed to 
               <br />
               achieve a more equitable division of the cake; 
               <br />
               that is participation by labour, through owner- 
               <br />
               ship, in that margin of return from commerce and 
               <br />
               industry up till now earmarked for the recom— 
               <br />
               pense of capital and management. Various labour 
               <br />
               and protective unions have done much to have 
               <br />
               the cake and pass it around more generously, by 
               <br />
               securing a greater return to the labourer for his 
               <br />
               hire and to the producer for his produce. But there 
               <br />
               are real economic limits to just how far that can 
               <br />
               be carried, particularly in a country of primary 
               <br />

               hold their own in the rough and tumble of world 
               <br />
               competition. There is just so far that collective 
               <br />
               bargaining and mutual assistance associations 
               <br />
               can go to achieve wage increases for the labourer, 
               <br />
               and price increases for the primary producer, and 
               <br />
               thereby increase the common man’s share in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               are well along toward that point of just-so-far 
               <br />
               already. But even if further increases could be 
               <br />
               achieved, they would not alter the basic in-

               <br />
               permanently a larger slice of the cake. That can 
               <br />
               come only in consequence of ownership.

               It could very easily be that we shall shortly 
               <br />
               witness a great translation of most of our people 
               <br />
               into wage earners in consequence of an industrial 
               <br />
               revolution in our ﬁshing industry. Predominant~ 
               <br />
               ly, our people have always been and still are of 
               <br />
               considerable personal independence in industry. 
               <br />
               That independence has been founded upon their 
               <br />
               ownership of their own instruments of produc— 
               <br />
               tion, upon their ownership of their own ﬁshing 
               <br />
               boats, their own ﬁshing gear and their own ﬁsh- 
               <br />
               ing rooms. But we have now come to the point 
               <br />
               where a considerable mechanisation and 
               <br />
               centralisation of our fishing industry is in— 
               <br />
               evitable; either we shall have that, or we shall 
               <br />
               have no fishing industry. It is easy to foresee how 
               <br />
               such mechanisation and centralisation could lead 
               <br />
               to the creation of a large ﬁshing proletariat 
               <br />
               employed as wage earners on draggers, at 
               <br />
               processing plants, at central curing stations and 
               <br />
               canneries, but not participating in the ownership 
               <br />
               and earnings of those new fish enterprises. The 
               <br />
               creation of such a ﬁshing proletariat is something 
               <br />
               to guard against at all costs It could lead only to 
               <br />
               great dissatisfaction, great unrest, maybe even 
               <br />
               strife. I am convinced that it can be avoided only 
               <br />
               if some formula be worked out to provide par— 
               <br />
               ticipation for fishermen in the ownership and 
               <br />
               earnings of such new fishing structures as may 
               <br />
               emerge.
