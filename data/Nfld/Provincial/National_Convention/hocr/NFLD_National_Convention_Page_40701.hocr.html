               Mr. Smallwood I will read the whole thing from 
               <br />
               the beginning. “Our task in the preparation of this 
               <br />
               report was in fact, somewhat similar to that of 
               <br />
               persons appointed to examine a business con- 
               <br />
               cern. We had to find out if the business was 
               <br />
               solvent. We had to examine the assets and 
               <br />
               liabilities. We had to see how much it costs to run 
               <br />
               the business, and we finally had to satisfy oursel— 
               <br />
               ves that the business would continue to be a 
               <br />
               paying proposition in the foreseeable future. 
               <br />
               Now in conclusion, with our use of the phrase 
               <br />
               ‘foreseeable future’, we think we should explain 
               <br />
               what we mean. We are conscious of the fact that 
               <br />
               there may be delegates who will be satisﬁed with 
               <br />
               nothing less than an absolute gilt-edged guaran- 
               <br />
               tee of our solvency for the next 20 years before 
               <br />
               they will accept the fact that Newfoundland is 
               <br />
               self-supporting. ‘Things are all right now,’ they 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood The point I want to make is this: 
               <br />
               the Committee sets a period of three years as 
               <br />
               being the “foreseeable future”. Three years ex- 
               <br />
               actly, and they say that some delegates may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ob</span> 
               <br />
               ject to that, and may want an absolutely 
               <br />
               gilt-edged guarantee of Newfoundland’s solven~ 
               <br />
               cy —— for the next three years? No. The next five 
               <br />
               years? No. For the next 20 years? I don’t know, 
               <br />
               I can't speak for other delegates, and there may 
               <br />
               be some who demand an absolute guarantee of 
               <br />
               this country’s solvency for the next 20 years. I 
               <br />
               don’t. I am not that unreasonable, but I do insist 
               <br />
               that I shall look further ahead than three years. 
               <br />
               I think it is my duty so to do. Whether I do it or 
               <br />
               not, whether the Finance Committee does it or 
               <br />
               not, whether this Convention does it or not, take 
               <br />
               this from me, that the people will look ahead 
               <br />
               much more than three years when they come to 
               <br />
               decide what kind of government they want. I say 
               <br />
               not 20 years, nor three years, but eight or ten or 
               <br />
               12 or 15 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years.</span> I don’t know that actually 20 years 
               <br />
               is very far to look ahead. We have looked back 
               <br />
               for 50 years, and I think we might justly look 
               <br />
               ahead to 15 or 20 years, because when we come 
               <br />
               to recommend forms of government it will not be 
               <br />
               for the next three years. Here is a report which 
               <br />
               sets out to give a forecast of what Newfoundland 
               <br />
               will be like in the next three years. If that’s all we 
               <br />
               have to go by, are we going to say to the New- 
               <br />
               foundland people before this Convention ends, 
               <br />
               “Look, we have had the report of the Finance
