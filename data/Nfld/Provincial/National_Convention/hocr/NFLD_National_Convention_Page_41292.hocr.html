               <br />
               think our delegation to Ottawa did a fairly good 
               <br />
               job under the circumstances, and that their report 
               <br />
               as contained in the Black Books shows they did 
               <br />
               the best they could and most decidedly as good 
               <br />
               as any delegation we might have sent. I thank 
               <br />
               you, Mr. Chairman, for your forbearance and 
               <br />
               wish to say that any further remarks I may make 
               <br />
               on this matter now before the Chair may be left

               Mr. Penney May I ask you, if in case the motion 
               <br />
               is adopted, will the delegates be allowed to com- 
               <br />
               ment on confederation under the heading of 
               <br />
               forms of government?

               Mr. Chairman Yes, Mr. Penney, I’ve given 
               <br />
               considerable thought to the question. Mr. Higgins 
               <br />
               has a motion on the order paper, covering respon— 
               <br />
               sible government or Commission government. 
               <br />
               As far as Mr. Higgins’ motion is concerned, it 
               <br />
               follows that discussion will have to be conﬁned 
               <br />
               to the two forms of government. In addition to 
               <br />
               this, Mr. Smallwood has given notice of motion 
               <br />
               covering three forms of government including 
               <br />
               confederation with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada...</span> In other words, the

               to move the following amendment to the motion

               of Mr. Higgins, namely that the following words 
               <br />
               be added: “Provided that under this system the

               <br />

               <br />
               of the country’s public services.” It would then

               read:

               Be it resolved that this Convention recom—

               <br />
               time to move the amendment is when the motion 
               <br />
               is made. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I think it is perfectly well prece-

               dented in parliamentary practice when motions 
               <br />
               appear on the order paper, for other members to 
               <br />
               give notice of amendment. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I would not accept an amend-

               ment without notice. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins Should it not be after the motion is 
               <br />
               made? The motion may be withdrawn. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman If the motion is withdrawn, ob- 
               <br />
               viously there will not be an amendment to a 
               <br />
               motion not made. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins I move on behalf of Mr. Hollett 
               <br />
