               <br />
               seeing it from inside this chamber and seeing it

               from outside is different; and 45 men getting

               together here, knowing human nature as I do, I 
               <br />
               don‘t think that we have done so badly. I am 
               <br />
               bound to say that there’s been too much politics 
               <br />
               in it. I didn’t bargain for that when I came to this 
               <br />
               Convention. I didn’t think there was going to be 
               <br />
               any politics at all associated with it. But that 
               <br />
               shows just how innocent I was, and just how 
               <br />
               ignorant I was about politics. But on the whole, 
               <br />
               while I have had to hang on to my chair some- 
               <br />
               times to keep myself from rising in protest at the 
               <br />
               way that some of the members have acted, yetI 
               <br />
               have allowed discretion to be the better part of 
               <br />
               valour and I have held my chair, although I have 
               <br />
               been much criticised for not sometimes rising...

               I want no part of politics in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">future,</span> There- 
               <br />
               fore I don’t think that the decision that I have been 
               <br />
               able to make has been prejudiced I have come to 
               <br />
               that decision as a result of a careful and intelligent 
               <br />
               analysis of the facts that I have been able to 
               <br />
               gather; and of the experience that I gained with 
               <br />
               the Ottawa delegation, the study that we were 
               <br />
               able to make of the British North America Act 
               <br />
               and of the federal system of government in 
               <br />
               general... I have come to the conclusion that this 
               <br />
               country’s future should be tied up to the great 
               <br />
               country to the west of us.... I feel certain that I am 
               <br />
               right, and I have a reason to say it, that this 
               <br />
               country’s future is definitely tied up within the 
               <br />
               federal system of government that we have so 
               <br />
               close to us.... Long before this Convention 
               <br />
               started, in the days of Commission of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govemn</span> 
               <br />
               ment — I believe with all my heart that we’ve 
               <br />
               seen the best days of government in this country 
               <br />
               under the Commission of Government, they’ve 
               <br />
               done some very, very ﬁne things, but I’ve always 
               <br />
               thought that it is not the form of government that 
               <br />
               we should continue to have. While we were under 
               <br />
               the Commission and before the National Conven- 
               <br />
               tion was thought of, I was thinking that when the 
               <br />
               time came to think of getting back to a more 
               <br />
               democratic form of government, that at least we 
               <br />
               should give this federal system an opportunity to 
               <br />
               be surveyed. When the National Convention was 
               <br />
               announced and it came to my notice, I thought 
               <br />
               that this was a splendid opportunity to do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that...</span> 
               <br />
               I have made the study, and as I say, as faithfully 
               <br />

               and as carefully as I can, and I have come to the 
               <br />
               conclusion that my thoughts along that line have 
               <br />
               many things to justify them. Our destiny, our 
               <br />
               future, if we are to have anything better than we 
               <br />
               have had in the past, is deﬁnitely tied up with a 
               <br />
               federal system of government.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I’m encouraged by the fact that some of my 
               <br />
               friends within the city and around this country, 
               <br />
               men and women who could not be said to be 
               <br />
               biased in any way, who are detached from politics 
               <br />
               and business life, whose minds have been trained 
               <br />
               to think things through objectively, many of them 
               <br />
               think the same as I do. My mind is made up. It 
               <br />
               has been made up for a few months now, since I 
               <br />
               have been able to study it with the Ottawa delega~ 
               <br />
               tion. I will admit that it is not made up in such a 
               <br />
               way, closed in such a way that it is incapable of 
               <br />
               being changed... If anyone can show me why we 
               <br />
               should not go into federal union with Canada, and 
               <br />
               if anyone can show me that this country will be 
               <br />
               worse off, that our people will suffer more under 
               <br />
               confederation, I am perfectly willing to change 
               <br />
               my mind and to work just as hard for that form of 
               <br />
               government which will give our people the very 
               <br />
               best that they deserve. Having made up my mind 
               <br />
               and done it as seriously as I can, with as much 
               <br />
               thought as I am capable of, I think I am in a 
               <br />
               position to advise the delegates here, and through 
               <br />
               them the country in general, to give this type of 
               <br />
               government a careful consideration. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               We have done it here as carefully as we can. 
               <br />
               We’ve all been serious about it. There have been 
               <br />
               some arguments against it, but I have not been 
               <br />
               swayed to the point that I am able to make a 
               <br />
               change in the position that I have taken. There 
               <br />
               have been some arguments that have had some- 
               <br />
               thing to justify them. But they can be refuted... 
               <br />
               Some of the arguments, and I don’t say it unkind- 
               <br />
               ly, have tended to drive me into confederation, 
               <br />

               going to be put into the hands of the people, and 
               <br />
               I would say to my fellow delegates that we ought 
               <br />
               to see to it, whatever our opinions are, that the 
               <br />
               people get the opportunity to express themselves 
               <br />
               on this matter. And not only that, but we ought to 
               <br />
               see to it that they get the opportunity to express 
               <br />
               themselves on other forms of government as well. 
               <br />
               They are the ﬁnal judges and they have a right to 
               <br />
               have the ﬁnal say. Perhaps never before have they 
               <br />
               had, or will they have such a fair opportunity to 
               <br />
