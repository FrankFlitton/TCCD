               Sir, our country is fast becoming a land of 
               <br />
               festering monopoly. Freedom of trade is becom- 
               <br />
               ing rapidly a thing of the past. I am not at this 
               <br />
               moment speaking of free made; but of ordinary 
               <br />
               freedom of trade, the ordinary right, as it used to 
               <br />
               exist, of any man to engage in trade, to import his 
               <br />
               own merchandise and sell it direct to the people. 
               <br />
               That freedom is fast dying in Newfoundland, and 
               <br />
               is fast being replaced by monopoly. A new race 
               <br />
               of traders has arisen in our midst. They have 
               <br />
               secured exclusive agencies all to themselves, 
               <br />
               agencies for this and that necessary and desirable 
               <br />
               article of merchandise. (1 am not talking now 
               <br />
               about our regular wholesale firms). What do they 
               <br />
               do, these exclusive agents? Do they add one cent 
               <br />
               of true value to the things on whose distribution 
               <br />
               they have a close monopoly in Newfoundland? 
               <br />
               No, they do not. Do they reduce the price of these 
               <br />
               articles to our people? No, they do not -— on the 
               <br />
               contrary you will ﬁnd that in many cases an 
               <br />
               article becomes dearer the moment some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">monopv</span> 
               <br />
               olistic trader secures the exclusive agency for it. 
               <br />
               A new race of monopolists has arisen in our

               Sir, I have done my share of pointing to the 
               <br />
               shame and infamy of certain tariff-protected in- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               high tariff that drives up our cost of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">living,</span> But 
               <br />
               these industries have at least this merit: that they 
               <br />
               produce something. They do bring in the raw 
               <br />
               material, they do employ a few people, changing 
               <br />
               the shape and appearance of those raw materials. 
               <br />
               They make something. These monopolistic 
               <br />
               traders make nothing, they produce nothing, they 
               <br />
               create nothing. They are traders, pure and simple. 
               <br />
               They manage to get themselves wedged in be- 
               <br />
               tween the ordinary traders and the people; not, 
               <br />
               please note, between the goods and the people, 
               <br />
               but between the traders who sell the goods and 
               <br />
               the people who buy the goods. By getting these 
               <br />
               monopolistic agencies, they set up toll—gates of 
               <br />
               their own, and they collect their own special fee 
               <br />
               that is piled onto the cost of the articles they sell. 
               <br />
               It only means that one additional and one com~ 
               <br />
               pletely unnecessary item of expense is piled onto 
               <br />
               the cost of the things we must buy. If, sir, I seem 
               <br />
               to be paying a lot of attention to these modern 
               <br />
               monopolists, it is because I know how they are 
               <br />
               driving the high cost of living still higher. We 
               <br />
               have seen some of these men become rich and 
               <br />

               <br />
