               There is not much to explain on that. The first 
               <br />
               one is that Canada would operate a steamship 
               <br />
               service between North Sydney and Port-aux- 
               <br />
               Basques, with suitable provision for the carriage 
               <br />
               of motor vehicles; but that would not be done 
               <br />
               until the road between Corner Brook and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Port-</span> 
               <br />
               aux~Basques is completed. What is in mind <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">w</span> 
               <br />
               what you want is a ferry on which a car which 
               <br />
               started, say, in Texas or in any part of Canada, 
               <br />
               could drive along the road, drive to North Syd- 
               <br />
               ney, drive on to the motor ferry, land in Port-aux- 
               <br />
               Basques.... The other point is clear, the railway 
               <br />
               rates would be regulated by the Board of 
               <br />
               Transport Commissioners. It is made clear in 3(a) 
               <br />
               that trafﬁc moving back and forth across the Gulf 
               <br />
               will be treated as a railway. The Maritime 
               <br />
               Freight Rates Act passed in 1927 and in force 
               <br />
               ever since was to this effect, that freight hauled 
               <br />
               anywhere within the region is hauled at the 
               <br />
               regular rate, but the government pays 20% of the 
               <br />
               freight rate; the man who ships it or receives it 
               <br />
               pays 80%. By making Newfoundland part of the 
               <br />
               Maritime region, any freight put aboard 
               <br />
               anywhere in Newfoundland, shipped to 
               <br />
               anywhere in Canada would be shipped at a 
               <br />
               reduction of 20% in the freight rates. In the same 
               <br />
               way, any freight that originated anywhere in the 
               <br />
               Maritime region on the mainland of Canada 
               <br />
               coming to Newfoundland by rail would be hauled 
               <br />
               at a reduction of 20% in the freight rate. There is 
               <br />
               another act, an act under which feeds, animal and 
               <br />
               poultry feeds shipped to the extremities of 
               <br />
               Canada are free of charge, no freight charges 
               <br />
               on any amount, from Fort William or Port Arthur 
               <br />
               all the way down to Halifax or St. John. If New- 
               <br />
               foundland became a province, feeds for animal 
               <br />
               and poultry would be hauled here without 
               <br />
               costing one cent for freight, which is a very 
               <br />
               important item in any Consideration of livestock 
               <br />
               or poultry raising. I do not know if there is 
               <br />
               anything else I can add.
