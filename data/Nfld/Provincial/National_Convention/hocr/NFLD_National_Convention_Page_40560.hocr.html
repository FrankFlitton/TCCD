               <br />
               built of more than 25,000 souls. To compare this 
               <br />
               with any other undertaking in this country would 
               <br />
               be like trying to explain a costly modem motor

               car by talking about, or describing a wheelbar- 
               <br />
               row. If the mines are worked some $125 million 
               <br />
               must be expended, and that is a lot of money. To 
               <br />
               use Mr. Smallwood’s superlative, “a monumen- 
               <br />
               tal sum”. I take it we all need money, we would 
               <br />
               like to have more money, even my good friend 
               <br />
               and fellow Bonavistonian, Rev. Burry. Can you 
               <br />
               assume then that a corporation which puts in 
               <br />
               distribution in this country hundreds of millions 
               <br />
               of dollars isn’t a nice thing to have around? Now, 
               <br />
               I am going to base my next statement on the 
               <br />
               predication that this Labrador Mining corpora- 
               <br />
               tion will make some proﬁts. Assuming that they 
               <br />
               do, 40% of such proﬁts will accrue to the beneﬁt 
               <br />
               of the Newfoundland treasury. Of course we 
               <br />
               might be pessimistic, as some implied yesterday, 
               <br />
               and darkly hint that some very astute chartered 
               <br />
               accountants could doctor those ledgers so that 
               <br />
               there won‘t be any net proﬁts to collect that 5% 
               <br />
               on. This, we must not forget, would be rather 
               <br />
               regrettable for our local shareholders. Their ob~ 
               <br />
               jective like yours and mine, is to make proﬁts. No 
               <br />
               corporation, no company, can long operate if it 
               <br />
               had to operate at a loss, and I cannot subscribe to

               ages. Not one cent ever came out of it prior to

               it appears logical, is, to say the least, unfair, for 
               <br />
