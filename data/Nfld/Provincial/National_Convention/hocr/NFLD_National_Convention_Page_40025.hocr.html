               from that point of view it is an obligation which

               Mr. Brown Mr. Chairman, I quite agree with

               Mr. Ashboume Gentlemen, I support the 
               <br />
               remarks of Mr. Bradley and Mr. Brown in this 
               <br />
               connection. I think that considerable work may 
               <br />
               have to be referred to certain committees. The 
               <br />
               steering or business committee is one of the most 
               <br />
               important committees which will be appointed, 
               <br />
               and we should have that committee at the very 
               <br />
               earliest moment. A certain timetable should be 
               <br />
               devised by this steering or business committee 
               <br />
               which might form a blueprint for the members of 
               <br />
               the Convention, in order that we can get down to 
               <br />
               certain deﬁnite business. We need a plan, and 
               <br />
               realising the amount of work which confronts us, 
               <br />
               it seems to me that only by appointing different 
               <br />
               committees and studying the different estimates 
               <br />
               which bear upon the ﬁnancial and economic con~ 
               <br />
               dition of the country, shall we get down to some- 
               <br />
               thing whereby we can intelligently study the 
               <br />
               various reports of the committees Otherwise it

               <br />
               difﬁcult task. I believe that a lot of this work 
               <br />
               could be referred to various committees who 
               <br />
               would meet in the morning, or after the adjoum- 
               <br />

               <br />
               some of this work apportioned to the various 
               <br />
               committees, I believe that the task will be most 
               <br />
               difﬁcult and the sittings unduly prolonged. I am

               prepared to vote for the adoption of this section.

               Mr. Smallwood In joining with the shower of 
               <br />
               tributes being paid to you, I would like to express 
               <br />
               a word of gratitude to you for the great en- 
               <br />
               thusiasm and loving care with which you have 
               <br />
               seen to the restoration of this chamber to some- 
               <br />
               thing approaching, equalling, and perhaps even 
               <br />
               surpassing its former glory. It is an achievement 
               <br />
               for which we owe you deep gratitude. Anyone 
               <br />
               who is at all familiar with the chamber as it was, 
               <br />
               and who has any feeling for the glories of the past, 
               <br />
               must have deep gratitude to you for the 
               <br />
               meticulous care you have given to getting the 
               <br />
               chamber back to what it used to be. The mere 
               <br />
               physical job of gathering desks and chairs that 
               <br />
               have disappeared, never to be recovered some of 
               <br />
               them, carpets that have been sold by auction and 
               <br />
               could not be replaced, great draperies that have 
               <br />
               disappeared to be replaced by the best that could 
               <br />
               be obtained, the paintings that have been restored 
               <br />
               by our own Clem Murphy, I believe. You have 
               <br />
               done all within your power, and as far as the $34 
               <br />
