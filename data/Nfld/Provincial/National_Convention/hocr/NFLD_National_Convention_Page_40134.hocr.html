               While men in this House today may come to 
               <br />
               the chamber for the first time, I know even more 
               <br />
               about what I speak than people whose fathers 
               <br />
               before them have spent their lifetime in connec— 
               <br />
               tion with the ﬁsheries of this country. I am not 
               <br />
               one of those. I feel that we came here to do a duty 
               <br />
               to the people. I don’t feel as Mr. Watton felt this 
               <br />
               afternoon that some are here with an ulterior 
               <br />
               motive. I have no ulterior motive. I was elected 
               <br />
               by acclamation. I was called out by the people in 
               <br />
               my own district, and not only one crowd but 
               <br />
               several. I never intended to run as a delegate to 
               <br />
               this Convention, but I did intend, if I was spared, 
               <br />
               to run in whatever election might come forward 
               <br />
               at a later date. I was called by my people, like it 
               <br />
               was said of me one time when I was called for 
               <br />
               another district. My reply was that it was not that 
               <br />
               I can’t go there, I was not afraid to go there. I have 
               <br />
               never feared a political election or a political 
               <br />
               fight. I loved it, and I love it today. Therefore, 
               <br />
               when we come down to supporting this motion I 
               <br />
               feel that I can’t do it in sincerity.

               I have been practically 30 years representing 
               <br />
               labour in this country. My younger days were 
               <br />
               spent in the Paciﬁc coast fishery business in 
               <br />
               Alaska. I know all about ﬁshing — more than 
               <br />
               many who have had so much prate on it. I was 
               <br />
               there with frozen ﬁngers, on the Banks and in the

               <br />
               average man in this House has gone. Yet I don’t 
               <br />
               come here pretending that I know it all. I have 
               <br />
               handled labour in this country for 29 years. I have 
               <br />
               led strikes and settled strikes, and got wages 
               <br />
               increased, and I have done many things for the

               people of this country, and I am not ashamed of 
               <br />
