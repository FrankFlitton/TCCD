               <br />
               that is the standard practice in any up—to-date 
               <br />
               hospital and I presume the same thing is done in 
               <br />
               the Sanatorium. There is a need to follow up these 
               <br />
               cases, to ﬁnd out how they are getting on. Unless 
               <br />
               we have these statistics with regard to the number 
               <br />
               of active TB cases and the number of cures ef-

               fected and of people who can enter into proﬁtable 
               <br />
               employment, how do we know what progress we 
               <br />
               are making? I hope and trust that Public Health 
               <br />
               and Welfare will in future make an annual report, 
               <br />
               so that the people would have a clear and 
               <br />
               thorough picture of the activities of the depart— 
               <br />
               ment and the inroads it is making upon disease... 
               <br />
               I believe that the work of the Committee on 
               <br />
               Public Health and Welfare would have been 
               <br />
               greatly helped if we had had annual reports. It is 
               <br />
               a practice of certain sub-divisions of government 
               <br />
               to make annual reports to the Commissioner in 
               <br />
               charge. I strongly suggest that this matter should 
               <br />
               be taken up.... We are laymen when it comes to 
               <br />
               making reports on these things We do the best 
               <br />
               we can. But when it comes to medical terms and 
               <br />
               disease terms, it is the doctors themselves who 
               <br />
               can put in black and white the facts of the inroads 
               <br />
               on disease.

               Mr. Newell I wonder if that is entirely what Mr. 
               <br />
               Butt had in mind I take it he was not referring to 
               <br />
               people coming back to the hospital to get sub- 
               <br />
               sequent treatment. I wonder if he had in mind the 
               <br />
               economic condition - the means of earning a 
               <br />
               living. An arrested case of TB has to go back to 
               <br />
               engage in a type of work not conducive to the 
               <br />
               good health of persons who have just come out 
               <br />
               of TB hospital. I do not think it is done in this 
               <br />
               country along these lines. In one or two cases I 
               <br />
               know they have been provided employment, but 
               <br />
               that has been done on their behalf by other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or</span> 
               <br />
               ganisations in the north. This is another case 
               <br />
               where the whole public health and welfare sys— 
               <br />
               tem ties up with the economic position. I think 
               <br />
               we have the wrong outlook towards the expendi- 
               <br />
               ture of public monies. Take cottage hospitals — 
               <br />
               if they do cost $20,000 to $25,000 a year, what is 
               <br />
               that? I suppose there are households, not to men- 
               <br />
               tion hospitals, who get through that amount of 
               <br />
               money a year. The question we have to face, and 
               <br />
               very soon, is why do we have so much TB? Why 
               <br />
               do we have relief? And somebody says it is partly 
               <br />
               attributable to the standard of living. The stand- 
               <br />
               ard of living is low, why? Is that something that

               <br />
               it goes even deeper than that. Our whole 
               <br />
               economic system is antiquated and whenever you 
               <br />

               <br />
               always need to spend huge sums on both. I sug- 
               <br />
               gest that whether or not we can afford it, if we are 
               <br />
               not prepared to get to work and change the 
               <br />
               economic position of this country, at least the 
               <br />
               economic system, if we are not prepared to do 
               <br />
               something drastic. then we had better make up 
               <br />
               our minds that we have to afford these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expendi»</span> 
               <br />
               tures. The people do not want anybody’s sym- 
               <br />
               pathy, but we have to tackle this problem from a 
               <br />
               realistic point of view. When we can provide an 
               <br />
               economic system that will give a decent standard 
               <br />
               of living we may be able to look forward to lower 
               <br />
               expenditures on public health and welfare. Until 
               <br />
               we do that, we have to make up our minds that it 
               <br />
               must come from somewhere; even if we have to 
               <br />
               do without some things to provide $6 million, it 
               <br />
               has to be provided.

               Mr. Northcott Speaking of TB, we have to get 
               <br />
               at the root of it. First, the government should see 
               <br />
               that every hotel, boarding house and restaurant 
               <br />
               has hot and cold water. Where there are no toilets 
               <br />
               inside, the ones outside should be treated with 
               <br />
               chlorine which will kill flies which carry the 
               <br />
               germs. I think if the chairman of the Committee 
               <br />
               would stress that point to the Public Health and 
               <br />
               Welfare Department, they will have done some- 
               <br />
               thing worthwhile.
