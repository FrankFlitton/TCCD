               <br />
               no accident; and 50 cents per hour if he had an

               <br />
               was doing the same job for $1.10. Now the

               powers that be could not get around that. They 
               <br />
               had to keep the Newﬁe down. It’s a crime for a 
               <br />
               Newﬁe to have or get a dollar. How easy to let

               <br />
               a 20% income tax. If trafﬁc was dislocated on the

               <br />

               1 put in from 1931 to 1933 in the depression 
               <br />
               days in the United States. I was ﬁshing and my 
               <br />
               wages as a ﬁsherman were $387.78 a year. My 
               <br />
               family ate dole under responsible government. 
               <br />
               Then I went to Halifax. It was the same thing 
               <br />
               there. I came back here. We had an insurance 
               <br />
               policy. We ate that. In 1937 Iheaded three miles 
               <br />
               for the dole. I expect I am the only man on the 
               <br />
               ﬂoor who ate the dole. I went through it. I had 
               <br />
               spent my lifetime at sea. As long as there was any 
               <br />
               place where I could make a living, I did not care 
               <br />
               where it was, whether it was Patagonia or Geor- 
               <br />
               gia, I felt that the world was behind me. There 
               <br />
               came a time when every part of the world was 
               <br />
               alike and wherever I went, the most I could hope 
               <br />
               to get was $25 a month, if I got that. I was ﬁshing 
               <br />
               out of the United States and we had 88,000 
               <br />
               pounds of ﬁsh in the hold waiting for a chance to 
               <br />
               dump it. I had to take a crust of bread out of the 
               <br />
               gum box and dry it on the stove and eat it. I have 
               <br />
               seen it done. When I came back here, I struck the 
               <br />
               same thing. I had never looked after my land or 
               <br />
               anything else. Our family was small. My land 
               <br />
               was down, but I said, “If I can live so long, 
               <br />
               nobody can starve me now.” I went to work on 
               <br />
               the land. I know the feeling of getting up in the 
               <br />
               morning and taking two slices of that black mink 
               <br />
               and wash it down with switchel tea; then swing a 
               <br />
               pick on the rocks, trying to clear the land. I tell 
               <br />
               you, after two hours of that, I have seen the ﬂying 
               <br />
               saucers before anyone else ever saw them. It is 
               <br />
               no laughing matter. This is the reason I am here 
               <br />
               - that is why I came in through that door — if I 
               <br />
               do not go through it one of those days. I am in 
               <br />
               earnest. I know what it is like. Icannot only stand 
               <br />
               up here and tell about John Doe’s beri-beri. I 
               <br />
               know what it is myself. I know what the ﬁsher- 
               <br />
               men went through. The Commission government 
               <br />
               lost as $2 on every quintal of ﬁsh we caught, 
               <br />
               through the rate of exchange. It was power 
               <br />
               politics. We went through it. I went on until the 
               <br />
               war broke out. I came over here with 50 cents in 
               <br />
