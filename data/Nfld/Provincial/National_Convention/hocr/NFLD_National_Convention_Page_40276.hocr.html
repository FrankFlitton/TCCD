               <br />
               ly, man for man, should condemn this treatment 
               <br />

               <br />
               beyond the Dominions Ofﬁce, and ask that a 
               <br />
               delegation from the present Labour government 
               <br />

               <br />
               particularly in respect to our injustices. I feel that 
               <br />
               we should not go on alone, since the situation has 
               <br />
               arisen mainly as a result of the war policy of other 
               <br />
               countries, and those other countries must assist 
               <br />
               us to mend the damage. I feel, sir, that we are 
               <br />
               spending too much time discussing reports which 
               <br />
               in the long run amount, as my friend Mr. Newell 
               <br />
               said yesterday, to cutting our garment to suit the 
               <br />
               cloth, without considering how we can enlarge 
               <br />
               the cloth. Bigger matters vitally concerning us are 
               <br />
               being passed by, and time goes on. We have 
               <br />
               assisted these countries in their problems, we 
               <br />
               have worked together in war — let us now boldly 
               <br />

               Mr. Butt Mr. Chairman, I have not trespassed 
               <br />
               too much on your time, and now that the cross- 
               <br />

               <br />
               good time to sum up my impression of what we 
               <br />
               have learned so far. As a member of the Transpor-

               tation and Communications Committee it would 
               <br />
               not come with good grace from me to be critical 
               <br />

               it is on these that I wish to offer a few comments. 
               <br />
               My reason for doing this is twofold: I would like 
               <br />
               to clarify my own thinking now that the debates 
               <br />
               in committee have ﬁnished, and I would like to 
               <br />
               pass on to the public and the other members of 
               <br />
               the Convention my thoughts, in the hope that they 
               <br />
               may be of some assistance in helping us all to 
               <br />
               reach the best possible conclusion when we come 
               <br />

               <br />
               income is likely to be in the foreseeable future. I 
               <br />
               visualised our getting out a sort of overall picture

               what percent of that yearly income we should

               <br />

               <br />
               example, education. The other part is services
