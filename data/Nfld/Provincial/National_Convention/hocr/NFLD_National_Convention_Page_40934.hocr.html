               on the basis of population, but in any case is 
               <br />
               not to be less than the number of senators to 
               <br />
               which the province is entitled. Under these 
               <br />
               provisions, the Province of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               will be represented by six members in the 
               <br />

               It is fairly clear, Newfoundland would be entitled 
               <br />
               to full representation in the Senate by six senators 
               <br />

               fall. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I have not got that far yet. They 
               <br />
               are appointed by the Govemor-General; but per-

               haps Icould appoint some senators -— if everyone 
               <br />
               is very nice, I may say I want some special friends 
               <br />
               appointed to the Senate. You are appointed for 
               <br />
               life. You do not have to go out and get elected.

               <br />
               by the people and for that purpose Newfoundland 
               <br />
               would be divided into seven districts; they will 
               <br />
               be big districts, of course... Members of the

               government of the day in Canada happened to be 
               <br />
               Conservative, and if at least one man elected from 
               <br />
               Newfoundland was a Conservative, he would be 
               <br />
               a member of the cabinet. If the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada happened to be Liberal, and there was 
               <br />
               one elected Liberal from Newfoundland, he 
               <br />
               would be a member of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁle</span> cabinet. It is an under- 
               <br />
               stood thing, it is not in the bond. As New- 
               <br />
               foundland is such an important ﬁshing country, 
               <br />
               the most important fishing country in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               ically fall in for the job of Minister of Fisheries. 
               <br />
               I do not expect to be Minister of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Fisheries.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Fudge What about Mr. Crosbie? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Crosbie would make one. 
               <br />
               We cannot decide that here. If Mr. Crosbie 
               <br />
               wanted the job, he will be Canada’s Minister of 
               <br />
               Fisheries a year or so from now. Incidentally, you
