               I have a divided opinion. In some instances, yes; 
               <br />
               in others, deﬁnitely no. Could a continuation 
               <br />

               of things, and I believe would be borne out by 
               <br />
               deeper investigation, that a government so con-

               When the British government adopted the 
               <br />
               recommendations of the Amulree Commission, I 
               <br />
               believe they did so in the best interests of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. If in some way their own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inter‘</span>

               association with us, were protected, in thatl see 
               <br />
               no great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wrong.</span> Viewed in these later years, the 
               <br />
               recommendations they submitted have helped us 
               <br />
               along and we are willing to give credit where 
               <br />
               credit is due. I feel quite certain we will be glad 
               <br />
               to see continued much of the organisation they 
               <br />
               set in place and it was meant to be that way. For 
               <br />
               they were to undertake to strengthen our 
               <br />
               economic and ﬁnancial structure which would, in 
               <br />
               time, put our country in good standing and having 
               <br />
               done that, the government would be passed back 
               <br />
               to the people.

               Many things have been said about that trans- 
               <br />
               action. As it came into effect it displeased many, 
               <br />
               if not all; and strong opinions were expressed as 
               <br />
               to other possible ways out. Truly, they could have 
               <br />
               left some vestige of representation with us. We 
               <br />
               yielded, believing that we would have sent here 
               <br />
               men of the highest calibre, men to develop our 
               <br />
               industrial life as well as play watchdog on our 
               <br />
               treasury. No barriers were created by us in the 
               <br />
               selection of these men. If the good and useful did 
               <br />
               not come, the fault is surely that of the Dominions 
               <br />
               Ofﬁce. All this can be excused on the ground that 
               <br />
               they were uﬂdng things in their stride. Just when 
               <br />
               they planned to get us out of the woods seemed 
               <br />
               very obscure. However, perhaps everyone’s pur-

               pose is served today.

               One thing for which we can be thankful today, 
               <br />
               is that we did not suffer impairment of our form

               government, it may be said that they lost no time

               <br />
               they have done their job and should go. First 
               <br />
               because I see no justiﬁcation in the continuance 
               <br />
               of a dictatorial form of government, and secondly 
               <br />
               because I want to see it supplanted by a respon- 
               <br />
               sible government with full dominion status. It is 
               <br />
               to me a tragedy that we cannot negotiate our 
               <br />
               external affairs. Witness the many attempts made 
               <br />
               by the Hon. RB. Job in trying to get outside the 
               <br />
               curtain — not but that I am fully aware of the lift 
               <br />
               along which Great Britain gives in world 
               <br />
               markets. I do not suggest anything but the closest 
               <br />
               friendship with the mother country; but our posi- 
               <br />
               tion has been so unsatisfactory, having to sell in 
               <br />
               one currency and buy in another, that I look for 
               <br />
               some solution to it. That solution I can see only 
               <br />
               in economic ties with the USA. There, to a nation 
               <br />
               of 130 million people, we should be able to sell 
               <br />
               largely, and purchase all our requirements. This 
               <br />
               may be wishful thinking. I do not for a minute 
               <br />
               entertain the thought that the USA would want us 
               <br />
               to enter political union, and I would definitely be 
               <br />
               opposed to it. But there should be a pooling of 
               <br />
               advantages, with greater returns to our country. 
               <br />
               For that is just what Great Britain did in the base 
               <br />
               deal, with greater return to Great Britain.
