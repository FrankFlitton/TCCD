               under certain conditions, but I certainly am under 
               <br />
               these unnegotiated terms, terms which I honestly 
               <br />
               believe would redound to the economic sabotage 
               <br />
               of the country’s resources and the country’s fu~ 
               <br />
               ture. Vote against putting confederation on the 
               <br />
               ballot? Of course I shall, knowing full well I shall 
               <br />
               incur the displeasure of some people in this 
               <br />
               country, but also knowing this full well that I am 
               <br />
               doing my duty by the people whom I serve. ‘If our 
               <br />
               people want confederation, in Heaven’s name let 
               <br />
               them elect a government with a clear mandate to 
               <br />
               negotiate. The delegation had no power to secure 
               <br />
               proposals. Why then did Canada send proposals 
               <br />
               to His Excellency the Governor of New— 
               <br />
               foundland, who afterwards passed them on to us? 
               <br />
               When the people elected us, did they authorise us 
               <br />
               to discuss proposals for union with Canada? No, 
               <br />
               they did not, and we exceeded our duty in dis- 
               <br />
               cussing them at all. It seems to me that we have 
               <br />
               discussed nothing much else than union with 
               <br />
               Canada since this Convention met. Have we, I 
               <br />
               ask you, discussed any other form of govem-

               <br />
               responsible government we may want? Have we 
               <br />
               discussed Commission of Government, or any

               Mr. Smallwood complained on Friday that he 
               <br />

               confederation been brought before the people in

               <br />
               brought in his motion the other week. Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood made much ado about monopoly and 
               <br />
               monopolists on Friday, and my friend Major 
               <br />
               Cashin has referred to that already. I agree with 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood, I do not like monopolists either. 
               <br />
               I know that monopolies exist in this country in

               Now Mr. Smallwood, on Friday, very mag~ 
               <br />
               nanimously gave us an opportunity to say a few 
               <br />
               words on taxes on property, and I availed myself 
               <br />
               of that opportunity. He spent two hours last week 
               <br />
               replying to me, telling us that the federal govem- 
               <br />
               ment did not tax property. Whoever said they 
               <br />
               did? I did not, or that the provincial governments 
               <br />
               taxed real property. I now ﬁnd out, however, that 
               <br />
               the provincial governments did tax real property. 
               <br />
               For instance, in Saskatchewan in 1943 the 
               <br />
               province collected altogether in taxes just over 
               <br />
               $11 million, and of this amount something over 
               <br />
               $3 million was collected on real and personal 
               <br />
               property. (These ﬁgures which I am quoting are 
               <br />
               taken from the Comparative Statistics of Public 
               <br />
               Finance). The Province of Alberta collected 
               <br />
               $1.25 million on real and personal property, and 
               <br />
               British Columbia $1.3 million, and the thought 
               <br />
               of the whole matter is that every province of 
               <br />
               Canada, with the exception of Quebec, collected 
               <br />
               some taxes from real and personal property. But 
               <br />
               the point I endeavoured to explain was that 
               <br />
               generally the provinces, having the power to tax 
               <br />
               real and personal property, delegate this tax col- 
               <br />
               lecting power under the RNA Act to the 
               <br />
               municipalities or town councils, and herewith I 
               <br />
               submit some figures to show the great extent to 
               <br />
               which the municipalities have gone in collecting 
               <br />
               their necessary revenues by taxes on land, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">build</span>

               For instance, in the province of Nova Scotia 
               <br />
               1943 the total municipal taxes were $10 million, 
               <br />
               and $7.5 million of this came from taxes on real 
               <br />
               and personal property. In New Brunswick the 
               <br />
               municipal taxes amount to $5.8 million. Now of 
               <br />
               this, $4,417,000 came from taxes on real and 
               <br />
               personal property. In Quebec province the total 
               <br />
               taxes were $75 million, and of this $61 million 
               <br />
               came from taxes on real and personal property,
