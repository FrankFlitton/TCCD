               Mr. Cashin That‘s not my point. My point is 
               <br />
               this: This delegation went to Ottawa to get terms, 
               <br />
               or what would be a good base to go into con- 
               <br />
               federation. If you andl are going into partnership, 
               <br />
               the first thing I will say to you is, “Now what have 
               <br />
               you got?” And you will say, “Cashin, I owe 
               <br />
               $100”; I will say, “I owe $50”, consequently I am 
               <br />
               $50 better off than you. Now Canada owes 
               <br />
               roughly $1,300 or $1,400 per head, and New- 
               <br />
               foundland owes $150 per head. Now we are 
               <br />
               going into business with Canada, and according 
               <br />
               to this thing here, we are going to forget our 
               <br />
               indebtedness of $150 a head and take on an 
               <br />
               indebtedness of $1,300 or $1,400 a head. That 
               <br />
               does not sound like good business to me. In 1895, 
               <br />
               if my memory serves me right, a delegation went 
               <br />
               to Ottawa and was there 1 1 days, and that’s where 
               <br />
               that $50 a head came in, and the Canadian 
               <br />
               government had a less per capita debt than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> 
               <br />
               foundland, and our people here, because Canada 
               <br />
               would not take over $5 million of our debt, 
               <br />
               refused to go into confederation at that time. Now 
               <br />
               the boot is on the other foot. The position today 
               <br />
               is that Newfoundland has a net per capita debt say 
               <br />
               of $150 per head, and Canada has $1,300 per 
               <br />
               head. It is more than that I think, and consequent- 
               <br />
               ly the difference between the two is $1 , 150. Now 
               <br />
               if you multiply $1,150 by 320,000 people, you 
               <br />
               will ﬁnd that if we carried out their agreement, or 
               <br />
               the arrangements in 1895, that Canada would 
               <br />
               have to pay Newfoundland to go into confedera- 
               <br />
               tion somewhere around $350 million. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">posi»</span> 
               <br />
               tion now as I see it is that they are taking over our 
               <br />
               indebtedness of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$63M</span> million. What do they get 
               <br />
               for it? All Newfoundland, and all Labrador, the 
               <br />
               Railway and buildings and everything for $63.5 
               <br />
               million; a railway which cost $72 million; all our 
               <br />
               public buildings, everything for $63 million. I 
               <br />
               think that’s poor business. Now apart from my 
               <br />
               prejudices with regard to confederation, I feel 
               <br />
               that this situation on the public debt is not a 
               <br />
               square deal.... They are going to take on a debt of 
               <br />
               $50 per head, and we will take on a debt of 
               <br />
               $1,300. Is it going to be easier to pay off$l,300 
               <br />
               than it is to pay of $50? Other people may see it, 
               <br />
               but I can’t. I will probably have more to say on 
               <br />
               this debate before it is concluded, but I want to 
               <br />
               know whether the delegation directly asked the 
               <br />
