               our people, I have faith in Newfoundland and 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders. We fought in two wars and we 
               <br />
               came out on top, and not only on top, but we got 
               <br />
               from the highest rank and authorities in England 
               <br />
               these continents. Lord Haig said in the last war, 
               <br />
               “Newfoundlanders are better than the best.” 
               <br />
               Montgomery said, “Give me a million New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders and we will clean up all the Ger- 
               <br />
               mans in the world." Here is what I say: I have 
               <br />
               faith in my country, and I have faith in our people, 
               <br />
               and I do not like the idea of sending delegations 
               <br />
               anywhere. I do, however, agree with the delega- 
               <br />
               tion going to England, and that’s one of the 
               <br />
               reasons why I move this resolution, because 
               <br />
               when our delegation goes to England they are 
               <br />
               going to be asked, “Well, what do the people in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland think?” The answer is, “Some say 
               <br />
               responsible government, and some confedera- 
               <br />
               tion", and it stops there. Now if this resolution is 
               <br />
               passed today, they will be fully aware of this as 
               <br />
               well, when the Dominions Secretary asks, “What 
               <br />
               do you think of the USA?” Well, we also want to 
               <br />
               know what about that. I move this resolution first 
               <br />
               of all because I know there are a number of 
               <br />
               people in Newfoundland who would vote for 
               <br />
               amalgamation with the USA, and secondly be— 
               <br />
               cause I want our delegation when they go to 
               <br />
               England to let the British government know that 
               <br />
               we are beginning to get pretty itchy — in other 
               <br />
               words we are willing to go in with anyone. I 
               <br />
               personally do not agree with it. I am a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New»</span> 
               <br />
               foundlander, and I want Newfoundland for New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders, but as I see it you are having a 
               <br />
               delegation sent to England and one to Canada, 
               <br />
               and in order to give the people what they want, 
               <br />
               and in accordance with our terms of reference and 
               <br />
               what Professor Wheare told us, I move that this 
               <br />
               delegation be also included.

               <br />
               doing so I feel that it is my duty to point out 
               <br />
               clearly to the Convention that this proposal

               Mr. Butt I feel we have had too little time to

               consider a question which to me is of great im- 
               <br />
               portance. Irealise that I may be considered rather 
               <br />
               crazy and unpatriotic, but sometime or other 
               <br />
               somebody has got to say it. I am as interested in 
               <br />
               the welfare of Newfoundland as anyone else. All 
               <br />
               my people came from England, and for three 
               <br />
               generations we have been born and brought up in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, but we have had the terms of 
               <br />
               reference interpreted to include all forms of 
               <br />
               government. There are a number of people who 
               <br />
               feel that the time has come when we, as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New»</span> 
               <br />
               foundlanders, ought to make a decision for our— 
               <br />
               selves as to what we want to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do.</span> Now that’s the 
               <br />
               question. We ought to make a decision for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">our»</span> 
               <br />
               selves as to what we ought to do. There are, so 
               <br />
               far as I canjudge, quite a number of people who 
               <br />
               would consider <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> I have people of my own in the

               <br />
               themselves as blood brothers to Britishers. Now 
               <br />
               I don’t want to go into consideration of the
