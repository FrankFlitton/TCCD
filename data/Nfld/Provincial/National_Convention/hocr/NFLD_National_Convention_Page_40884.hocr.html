               Mr. Chairman Your point is where it is over 
               <br />
               $2,000, then they have no discretion in the matter 
               <br />
               at all. Where it is under $2,000, if we had a 
               <br />
               provincial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislature,</span> it would depend upon what 
               <br />
               comparable legislation had been in the past? 
               <br />
               Mr. Hickman I understood the pension auth- 
               <br />
               orities had the choice. From reading this, I would 
               <br />
               say they would be compelled to make a claim 
               <br />
               against the estate where the estate is in excess of 
               <br />
               $2,000 and also in the case of less than $2,000 
               <br />
               they could make a claim to recover the pension if 
               <br />
               they so desired. Their optional right is there. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I do not want to get into the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intricacies</span> of constitutional law, but I want to 
               <br />
               express a legal opinion. In my judgement the 
               <br />
               position taken by Mr. Hickman is perfectly jus- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tiﬁed....</span> Theoretically it is within the competence 
               <br />
               of the provincial legislature to deal with estates 
               <br />
               under $2,000, should that legislature be so 
               <br />
               minded. Over $2,000 it has no discretion at all. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I was not questioning that.... 
               <br />
               However, we can easily clean up the matter in this 
               <br />
               way. I will give notice before the sitting ends of 
               <br />
               a question to ask the Government of Canada to 
               <br />
               give us a memorandum showing clearly what the 
               <br />
               practice is in connection with old age pensions, 
               <br />
               and it will be beyond all doubt. I can assure you 
               <br />
               now, pending the receipt of an ofﬁcial reply, that 
               <br />
               where the value of an estate left by an old age 
               <br />
               pensioner is under $2,000 nothing is taken out; 
               <br />
               over $2,000 something is taken out only after the 
               <br />
               widow who is herself a pensioner has died and 
               <br />
               only if none of his children or anyone else has 
               <br />
               contributed regularly to the support of the pen- 
               <br />

               There is just one point I want to make before 
               <br />
               I pass on to unemployment insurance... A man 
               <br />
               or woman, whose father or mother being 70 years 
               <br />
               of age, gets the old age pension, who wishes to 
               <br />
               fall in for his father’s or his mother’s property, 
               <br />
               has only one thing to do, that is to help to support 
               <br />
               the old people and contribute regularly for 
               <br />
               three years. If no person does it and the govern~ 
               <br />
               ment has to do it, then the government can get the 
               <br />
               money back out of the pensioner’s estate when 
               <br />
               he or she dies, if the estate is worth more than 
               <br />
               $2,000 net. 
               <br />
               Mr. Miller Before we move on, when we were 
               <br />
               dealing with family allowances, we had a known 
               <br />
               number, 1 17,000 children in the country, we also 
               <br />

               <br />
               age pensions, we move into a ﬁeld of conjecture. 
               <br />
               Some suggested we have 12,000 people in New- 
               <br />
               foundland over the age of 70; they assume 10,000 
               <br />
               of that 12,000 would apply for and receive the old 
               <br />
               age pension. If that 10,000 did receive it we know 
               <br />
               it is a known ﬁgure; we would have to contribute 
               <br />
               $7.50 a month for each person and the grand total 
               <br />
               is given as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$750,000.</span> Now that is not even <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cor«</span>

               rect; it should be $900,000. That is a matter of 
               <br />
               only $150,000. I would refer you to Black Book 
               <br />
               Vol. 2, page 60 — there is an amount there of 
               <br />
               $5 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">10,000"</span> that is what the province would have 
               <br />
               to pay. That is why the $7.50 is given. There is a 
               <br />
               difference of $400,000 from our method of cal-
