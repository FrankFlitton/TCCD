               commission. Their representatives abroad are 
               <br />
               paid. What are the duties of the Fisheries Board 
               <br />
               in the sale of ﬁsh? Are they controlling the export 
               <br />
               of ﬁsh or do they merely employ inspectors who 
               <br />
               go around and inspect the quality of ﬁsh to go to 
               <br />
               the various markets, or do they also sell? Are the 
               <br />
               ﬁshery products sold through brokers abroad? 
               <br />
               Mr. Job As I understand it, the Fisheries Board 
               <br />
               have handed control over to the trade. The trade 
               <br />
               sets up the various groups and each group con- 
               <br />
               tacts the markets. They sell some through agents 
               <br />
               in various places — Trinidad, Pueno Rico and 
               <br />
               Spain -— they go through very much the same 
               <br />
               channels as before, but the Fisheries Board could 
               <br />
               not sell that ﬁsh without these people on the spot; 
               <br />
               it would be chaos if they did. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin Therefore the Fisheries Board has 
               <br />
               nothing to do with the price of ﬁsh; they merely 
               <br />
               employ brokers, or allocate a certain amount to 
               <br />
               the Portuguese group or the West Indies group, 
               <br />
               etc? 
               <br />
               Mr. Job No, they negotiate through these people 
               <br />
               abroad. Mr. Crosbie can tell us about Brazil; sales 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> were made through Mr. Crosbie’s agents and it 
               <br />
               was done in the best interests of the exporters. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett In one breath the Committee says 
               <br />
               they hand it over to the trade and in the other says 
               <br />
               the Fisheries Board negotiates the sales. 
               <br />
               Mr. Job The Fisheries Board hands over its 
               <br />
               authority to those who make the sales The groups 
               <br />
               are not part of the Fisheries Board, but they 
               <br />
               appoint them. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett All they do then is make alloca- 
               <br />
               tions? 
               <br />
               Mr. Job They set up organisations to sell the 
               <br />
               ﬁsh. They arrange the groups. A certain number 
               <br />
               of people depend upon the Cuban market and 
               <br />
               another depends on the Portuguese <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett To arrange groups is not a very big 
               <br />
               job, is it? 
               <br />
               Mr. Job They have to keep in touch with them 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> they are very helpful; they have to send special 
               <br />
               cables. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Why does the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trade</span> not send cables? 
               <br />
               Mr. Job They have the authority of the govem- 
               <br />
               merit behind them and it is advantageous to have 
               <br />
               such an organisation set up under government 
               <br />
               authority specially in these times. I am of the 
               <br />
               opinion that the Fisheries Board has done an 
               <br />
               excellent job; and we will need it more in times

               Mr. Smallwood lam not going tosay anything 
               <br />
               about the Fisheries Board. A little bird whispered 
               <br />
               to me that an amount of money —— $300,000 a 
               <br />
               year -— is paid out here in St. John’s to two men 
               <br />
               or two ﬁrms. The two ﬁrms are supposed to be 
               <br />
               the brokers representing the ﬁsh exported from 
               <br />
               this country — one handles all the ﬁsh going to 
               <br />
               the other side of the Atlantic. They get <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commie</span> 
               <br />
               sions which amount, in the case of one ﬁrm on 
               <br />
               Water Street, to $150,000 a year as brokerage. 
               <br />
               For doing what? In the last four or ﬁve years, 
               <br />
               since the Combined Food Board came into being, 
               <br />
               the United States, Canada and Great Britain have 
               <br />
               taken our whole output of codﬁsh; they have not 
               <br />
               had much to do but to pass on the trade papers 
               <br />
               and see that the money is deposited in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bank.</span> 
               <br />
               The Combined Food Board in Washington, 
               <br />
               where Mr. Gushue was a high ofﬁcial, says, “You 
               <br />
               can ship so much to Trinidad.” The importer in 
               <br />
               Trinidad who buys the ﬁsh has to put the money 
               <br />
               in the bank in advance and this agent is supposed 
               <br />
               to see that he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">does.</span> For that he collects $150,000 
               <br />
               a year and is doing it now. The other ﬁrm does 
               <br />
               the same thing for the ﬁsh over in Europe. It was 
               <br />
               not a little bird that told me that, it was a member 
               <br />
               of the Salt Codﬁsh Exporters Association who 
               <br />
               told me and he was feeling murderous about it. if 
               <br />
               I am driven too far, I will name the ﬁrm.... 
               <br />
               $150,000 a year, as the Americans say, is not hay. 
               <br />
               In the last four or ﬁve years no one had to work 
               <br />
               to sell ﬁsh; all you had to do was to get it.... I think 
               <br />
               perhaps that’s what Major Cashin was trying to 
               <br />
               get at.
