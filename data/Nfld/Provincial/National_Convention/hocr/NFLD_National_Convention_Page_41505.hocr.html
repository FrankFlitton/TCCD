               school system, is in the slightest danger from 
               <br />
               confederation. I challenge any man in this island 
               <br />
               to show that all existing rights of all denomina- 
               <br />
               tions are not absolutely safeguarded and 
               <br />
               protected under the terms of confederation. I say 
               <br />
               here and now that no denomination, not one 
               <br />
               denomination, has the slightest reason for uneasi— 
               <br />
               ness on this point. All existing rights have been 
               <br />
               fully guaranteed and protected, just exactly as 
               <br />
               they stand today. Any denomination that wishes 
               <br />
               to go right on with its own separate denomina— 
               <br />
               tional schools, paid for out of public funds, can 
               <br />
               do so under confederation, exactly as it can 
               <br />
               without confederation. Confederation will not 
               <br />
               make a particle of difference in our school sys— 
               <br />
               tem, and it is false and unworthy and mischievous 
               <br />
               to say it will, or even hint that it will. If there is 
               <br />
               in this island any denomination with separate 
               <br />
               school rights at the present time that fears that its 
               <br />
               rights would be put in danger, let that denomina- 
               <br />
               tion speak out, or take the proper steps, and it is 
               <br />
               the simplest and easiest thing in the world to 
               <br />
               copperfasten the matter. Iknow whatI am talking 
               <br />
               about. I know it in great detail, in intimate detail. 
               <br />
               I know what I am talking about, sir, and there are 
               <br />
               others that know too. I say here and now that if 
               <br />
               any person of authority shows me that our 
               <br />
               denominational school system is in any danger 
               <br />
               whatsoever from confederation, I will drop all 
               <br />
               further support of confederation. I will go further, 
               <br />
               I will oppose confederation just as ardently as up 
               <br />
               to now I have supported it. So now, if Major 
               <br />
               Cashin wants me to oppose confederation, let 
               <br />
               him get busy and produce his proof.

               Well, at last we know the truth about the 
               <br />
               matter of the government Savings Bank. It is 
               <br />
               exactly as I said all along. Full control over the 
               <br />
               Savings Bank will be held by our own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern~</span> 
               <br />
               ment, exactly as it is today. The Government of 
               <br />
               Canada has no law governing provincial savings 
               <br />
               banks, and it is left to the province itself, just as 
               <br />
               I said it would be. For a great many years the 
               <br />
               Province of Ontario has operated a savings bank, 
               <br />
               just as we have operated a savings bank, and the 
               <br />
               federal government has never interfered. Our 
               <br />
               Savings Bank will go right on as it is today. The 
               <br />
               provincial government will control it, and 
               <br />
               nobody else. The interest rates paid to depositors 
               <br />
               will be decided by our own government, just as 
               <br />
               they are now. Any proﬁts made will go to our 
               <br />
               own government, just as they do now. But will 
               <br />
