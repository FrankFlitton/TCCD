               And that is why, Mr. Chairman, Britain’s 
               <br />
               offer to Newfoundland is such a gallant one — 
               <br />
               one of the most pathetically gallant offers this 
               <br />
               world has ever seen. It is an offer to share her 
               <br />
               poverty with us, with Newfoundland. As long as 
               <br />
               the old mother country has a crust of bread she 
               <br />
               offers to share it with us. Let us reverence her for 
               <br />
               it. In 1934 she took over ﬁnancial responsibilty 
               <br />
               for Newfoundland. She said if we gave up 
               <br />
               responsible government, and came under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Com~</span> 
               <br />
               mission government, she’d come to our rescue. 
               <br />
               Britain was better off then than we were. It was 
               <br />
               a little better than a crust of bread that she offered 
               <br />
               to share with us then in 1934. That was six years 
               <br />
               before the war broke out. Today she is letting 
               <br />
               rich India, Burma, rich Palestine go, she is giving 
               <br />
               up her vital control of Greece to the United States. 
               <br />
               She is cutting some of her terrible losses, but out 
               <br />
               of her poverty offers to continue to be responsible 
               <br />
               for Newfoundland if we should decide to hold on 
               <br />
               to Commission government.

               Mr. Chairman, I wonder what Britain’s 
               <br />
               private thoughts are about this matter. Is she 
               <br />
               privately hoping that Newfoundland will not take 
               <br />
               her up on that offer? Does Britain make us this 
               <br />
               offer out of a sense of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">honour?.,..</span> Does she make 
               <br />
               it in the hope that we here in Newfoundland know 
               <br />
               enough about Britain’s own terrible plight not to 
               <br />
               take her up on it? 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now, Mr. Chairman, I’d like to take a look, a 
               <br />
               close look, at what, this magnaminous, this gal- 
               <br />
               lant offer of Britain really boils down to. Suppose 
               <br />
               we Newfoundlanders in the referendum vote to 
               <br />
               go on under Commission government. Just what 
               <br />
               will that mean? Just what help would it mean to 
               <br />
               us from the mother country? We’ve got two 
               <br />
               things to judge by. We have the period from 1934 
               <br />
               to 1940, when we desperately needed help from 
               <br />
               Britain, when she was much better off than she is 
               <br />
               today. What did Britain give us then?.... Out of 
               <br />
               her taxes Britain paid over to us certain modest 
               <br />
               amounts, just barely enough to keep our people 
               <br />
               alive, hardly that. The Commission of Govern- 
               <br />
               ment between 1934 and 1940 was always hard- 
               <br />
               up, always short of money. They couldn’t do this 
               <br />
               and they couldn’t do that. Our public services 
               <br />
               were starved. It was only after 1940 that they 
               <br />
               
            </p>

         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_9" title="bbox 918 188 1461 1880">
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               really began to spend money and then they were 
               <br />
               getting it from us Newfoundlanders. 1n <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">t‘aimess</span> 
               <br />
               to their own taxpayers, the British government 
               <br />
               could only hand money over to us in dribs and 
               <br />
               drabs, in very small amounts between 1934 and 
               <br />
               1940. That is the ﬁrst thing we have to judge by. 
               <br />
               The other thing is Britain’s own condition now 
               <br />
               and for years to come. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now, judging by these facts, what help would 
               <br />
               Britain give us in future, if we did vote for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">C0m~</span> 
               <br />
               mission government? Suppose hard times fell 
               <br />
               upon us, another depression, just what ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               help could we expect from the mother country? 
               <br />
               Here is how it works. In the fall of the year the 
               <br />
               Commissioner for Finance sends around to all 
               <br />
               the departments; he says we are going to make up 
               <br />
               a budget, you let me know what your department 
               <br />
               will need, and let me have it as soon as you <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can,</span> 
               <br />
               The departments send back estimates, and from 
               <br />
               those estimates the Commissioner makes up his 
               <br />
               budget. He says for the year beginning April 1, 1 
               <br />
               am going to spend say $15 million; the only 
               <br />
               revenue I can collect is $13 million. I am going 
               <br />
               to have a deﬁcit of $2 million. What does he do 
               <br />
               next? He sends his budget to the Dominions 
               <br />
               Ofﬁce, hands it over to the accountants of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Treasury...</span> If they approve that budget they are 
               <br />
               going to have to pony up $2 million. What do they 
               <br />
               do? They cut down the expenditure. They say to 
               <br />
               the Commission, “We will allow you a deﬁcit of 
               <br />
               $1 million or $500,000, that is what we are 
               <br />
               prepared to pay.” When the Commissioner for 
               <br />
               Finance was before the committee some time 
               <br />
               ago, we asked him how the British government 
               <br />
               exercised control over the Commission of 
               <br />
               Government and he said, “They control our 
               <br />
               budget.” If we go on under Commission of 
               <br />
               Government, what can we expect in 1948 or 
               <br />
               1958? 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I am driven to the conclusion that this offer 
               <br />
               that the United Kingdom government has made 
               <br />

               country if we really do decide to hold on to

               Commission government —— I am driven to 
               <br />
               believe that any help we would get would be on 
               <br />
               the smallest possible scale, just bare token pay- 
               <br />
               ments each year. Dole would be the lowest pos- 
               <br />
               sible scale, our public services would be starved. 
               <br />
               The Commission government would always be 
               <br />
               short of money. The only money they would have 
               <br />
               would be what taxes we might be able to pay
