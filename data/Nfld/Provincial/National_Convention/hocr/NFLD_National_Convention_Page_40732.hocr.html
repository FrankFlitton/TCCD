               The member from Bonavista Centre said a few

               days ago that if Grand Falls did not start when it

               <br />
               Buchans and Comer Brook did not start, we 
               <br />
               would be in a more or less chronic depression.

               This, by use of the word “if”, attempts to

               demolish all the prosperity that we may have

               hungry in other countries as in Newfoundland. A

               few people think that our economic security can

               <br />
               a place designed to satisfy man’s need. That was 
               <br />
               the Garden of Eden - and we all know what 
               <br />
               happened to the Garden of Eden.

               In reviewing our economic situation, there are 
               <br />
               a few fundamentals that I think we should never 
               <br />
               forget. First, I believe there is no Santa Claus; 
               <br />
               second, I believe that since the Garden of Eden, 
               <br />
               man has had to earn his bread by the sweat of his 
               <br />
               brow; third, I believe you get nothing for nothing, 
               <br />
               not even baby bonuses...

               Mr. Smallwood Sir, I rise to a point of order. 
               <br />
               This sounds to me perilously like an attack on 
               <br />
               confederation, which has not come up for debate 
               <br />
               yet. If we are going to debate it I am prepared, but 
               <br />
               let’s debate it, baby bonuses and all the rest. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman I can’t see the possible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">connecA</span>

               tion between baby bonuses and the debate here.

               Mr. Hollett I rise to a point of order. I object 
               <br />
               very strongly to interrupting a speaker when he 
               <br />
               is speaking. I do think baby bonuses have a lot to 
               <br />
               do with the economics of the householder, and 
               <br />
               therefore of the country. If anyone wants to refer 
               <br />
               to baby bonuses during his discussion I see no 
               <br />
               reason why any member should be refused. It 
               <br />
               certainly is an economic question.

               Some gentlemen say that the solution to our 
               <br />
               problems is in politics. I think our problems are 
               <br />
               economic, not political; and our economic future 
               <br />
               depends on our producing more, and ﬁnding 
               <br />
               markets for what we produce. Last year Canada 
               <br />
               sold us $37 million worth of goods, but bought 
               <br />
               very little from us. If a businessman were faced 
               <br />
               with a similar situation he would arrange to 
               <br />
               change this. He would seek another source for his 
               <br />
               purchases, and would patronise the man or firm 
               <br />
               who bought from him. And if some of the 
               <br />
               gentlemen in this House were as truly sincere to 
               <br />

               <br />
               foundland as they say they are, they might during 
               <br />
               the past six or seven months have directed some 
               <br />
               of their speeches to this angle of our problems 
               <br />
               rather than offering their own pet political 
               <br />
               theories as a solution. That is fundamentally a 
               <br />
               matter of buying and selling. 
               <br />

               The USA is the greatest outlet actually and

               is the market for our cod ﬁllets, lobster, salmon, 
               <br />
               herring, seal skins, cod oil, newsprint, berries, 
               <br />
               and anything we mind to produce. Is it foolish for 
               <br />
               me’ to think or say that our economic welfare lies 
               <br />
               in the direction of reducing our buying from 
               <br />
               Canada, who buys practically nothing from us, 
               <br />
               and spending these dollars in the USA, who will 
               <br />
               take more from us as we buy more from them? 
               <br />
               As I said before, it is our economic relations that 
               <br />
               have to be improved, and with the USA, and by 
               <br />
               that I don’t mean political relations. We are all 
               <br />
               right as we are, and to me at least, what we want 
               <br />
               is a closer economic union with the USA, and not 
               <br />
               a political union with any other country... What 
               <br />
               we want is a trade agreement with the USA, 
               <br />
               which a real patriot, Sir Robert Bond, almost 
               <br />
