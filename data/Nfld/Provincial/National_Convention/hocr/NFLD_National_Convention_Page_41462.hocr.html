               Canada. The reasons given for the difference in

               the wage scale is that business ﬁrms in Canada 
               <br />
               cannot afford to pay the same wages as paid in

               the United States. This argument, however, 
               <br />
               should not apply to the pulp and paper industry

               <br />

               <br />
               reason however, for this difference in wages is 
               <br />
               not in industry, but in the Canadian people them— 
               <br />
               selves, because of what they pay their citizens in

               Canadian agricultural research should lead the

               <br />
               $1,800 per year. He had a chance then from the

               And now, permit me to refer to the famous 
               <br />
               matter of taxes -— particularly property taxes on 
               <br />
               which Mr. Smallwood has been harping so much. 
               <br />
               He has told you that this is a provincial matter and 
               <br />
               therefore in the event of union you will never 
               <br />
               have property tax imposed in Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               This is absolute nonsense, as Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               well knows. How many provinces of Canada 
               <br />
               have property taxes and why are they imposed? 
               <br />
               Let Mr. Smallwood answer, if he likes. Would 
               <br />
               they be imposed in Newfoundland in the event of 
               <br />
               union? Of course they would, by the provincial 
               <br />
               parliament. They would have to be if the country 
               <br />
               is to continue to keep up the necessary services 
               <br />
               and to make the necessary improvements. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               As a province, Newfoundland would lose her 
               <br />
               main sources of revenue, yet some of our costliest 
               <br />
               services would be left to be kept up — our public 
               <br />
               health and welfare, our education and our roads. 
               <br />
               Who would provide the money for the roads in 
               <br />
               the outports? Canada will not. With the amount 
               <br />
               left to the provincial parliament they cannot, ex- 
               <br />
               cept with extra taxes. The provincial parliament, 
               <br />
               instead of collecting these taxes directly may 
               <br />
               avoid it by forming town councils. However, if it 
               <br />
               is done, it will necessitate increased taxation. 
               <br />
               And what is the logical way this taxation will be 
               <br />
               imposed? The logical way and one of the ways it 
               <br />
               is done in Canada is by property taxes. All those 
               <br />
               taxes which Mr. Smallwood has been crying out 
               <br />
               would not be imposed by the federal government 
               <br />
               in the event of union will of necessity have to be 
               <br />
               imposed in Newfoundland whether it be by the 
               <br />
               provincial government or by town councils 
               <br />
               which will have to be formed. They will have to 
               <br />
               be imposed or the provincial government will not 
               <br />
               be able to carry on. 
               <br />

               Now let me revert to our so—called iniquitous

               monies being collected by our customs duties are 
               <br />
