               Newfoundland for union with the Dominion of 
               <br />
               Canada.” Speaking on this resolution, Senator 
               <br />
               Rufus Pope said in part, “That territory which has 
               <br />
               been awarded to Newfoundland by the decision 
               <br />

               <br />
               come very valuable, and if Canada desires to 
               <br />
               possess it, we have no time to lose...” That was 
               <br />
               the theme of the whole debate, the value of 
               <br />
               Labrador, the need for Canada to repossess <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> 
               <br />
               That was only 20 years ago. The wheel has come 
               <br />
               full circle again. Let‘s not kid ourselves with that 
               <br />
               fatuous statement that Canada does not want 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, that we will be a drag on Canada. 
               <br />
               The only ones we will be a drag on are ourselves, 
               <br />
               when we try to make our little province pay and 
               <br />
               make both ends meet, out of the pitifully small 
               <br />
               and inadequate revenues left us after the 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood has made a valiant attempt to

               produce a provincial budget for eight years, and 
               <br />
               it is as ﬁne a piece of ﬁnancial juggling as anyone 
               <br />

               Smallwood was the champion of no limit on

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               everything, not for one year, but for eight! And 
               <br />
               the trump card for the provincial budget seems to 
               <br />
               be Clause 14 — Reassessment of New-

               ﬁrst eight years, then everything will be ﬁne. We

               <br />
               except Labrador. So the pressure is put on the 
               <br />
               provincial parliament, and they amend the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legisv</span> 
               <br />
               lation and alter the boundaries of the Province of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, that part of it called Labrador. 
               <br />
               That is the consent of the province, and someone 
               <br />
               takes over Labrador or part of it, and that some- 
               <br />
               one will be Quebec. I’ll stake my life on it. On 
               <br />
               the other hand, we may never get that royal 
               <br />
               commission. We have heard a lot about what the 
               <br />
               Duncan-White Commission did, but how many 
               <br />
               commissions did not function? As recently as 
               <br />
               1911 a commission of inquiry was set up for 
               <br />
               British Columbia to look into the matter of grant- 
               <br />
               ing that province better terms. The commission 
               <br />
               was set up, but it never functioned. The letter of 
               <br />
               the law may have been followed, but its spirit was 
               <br />
               hardly interpreted. Could not this happen in our 
               <br />
               case? Remember, Newfoundland would be the 
               <br />
               tenth and last province. Once in, anything would 
               <br />
               be good enough for her because there would not 
               <br />
               be any more prospective customers for the con~

               federation wares.

               I just mentioned the provincial budget, Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, and now I want to make a few refer- 
               <br />
               ences to a table on page 2, “Probable Revenue 
               <br />
               and Expenditure of the Province”. Expenditure is 
               <br />
               $15,138,775, an annual average for the first four 
               <br />
               years. Then the revenue. Note two things <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> the 
               <br />
               word taxation at the very beginning, and the 
               <br />
               amount of almost $3.5 million, and the sentence 
               <br />
               “New taxation is to be imposed”, another million 
               <br />
               and a quarter. Total provincial taxation, $4.5 
               <br />
               million. It goes up another million in the next four 
               <br />
               years. Now I ask the people to note this: the 
               <br />
               Dominion has taken the income tax, the customs 
               <br />
               revenues, has put excise on liquor and tobacco. 
               <br />
               What is left? What remains to permit the 
               <br />
               Province of Newfoundland to raise $4.5 million 
               <br />
               each year in taxation? Very little that I can see. 
               <br />
               There is $750,000 raised on gasoline. That is not 
               <br />
               regular revenue as of now, it would be new <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taxa~</span> 
               <br />
               tion to add to the $1.25 million earmarked in the 
               <br />
               budget as new taxation. Almost $5 per person,
