               Mr. Hollett I will be very brief, sir. I too was

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Saturday...</span> I immediately prepared a question to 
               <br />
               be laid on the table. There is just one other thing 
               <br />
               that I want to draw to the attention of this House, 
               <br />
               and that is the British North America Act, 1871, 
               <br />
               which reads as follows: “Alteration of Limits of 
               <br />
               Province”, section III: “The Parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada may from time to time with the consent 
               <br />
               of the Legislature of any Province of the said 
               <br />
               Dominion, increase, diminish, or otherwise alter 
               <br />
               the limits of such Province, upon such terms and 
               <br />
               conditions as may be agreed to by the said Legis- 
               <br />
               lature; and may, with the like consent, make 
               <br />
               provision respecting the effect and operation of 
               <br />
               any such increase or diminution or alteration of 
               <br />
               territory in relation to any province effected 
               <br />
               thereby.” Which simply means this: if we become 
               <br />
               a province of the Dominion of Canada, the 
               <br />
               Canadian government could alter the limits of the

               want to add one further remark before 1 put my 
               <br />
               question. and that is this: having studied very

               carefully the two Black Books which have been 
               <br />
               brought back by the delegation to Canada, l 
               <br />
               foresee that within the next eight years the ﬁnan- 
               <br />
               ces of this country will be in such a rotten state 
               <br />
               that the legislature of Newfoundland will be 
               <br />
               prepared to make any change in the limitation of 
               <br />
               the province. Now this is the question which I 
               <br />
               wish to lay on the table:
