               <br />
               people who are inﬁrm and unable to work, and 
               <br />
               one of the facts coming out is that we are ﬁnding 
               <br />
               a large number of ex- ﬁshermen and lumber men, 
               <br />
               who are not really fit to work, between the ages 
               <br />
               of 55 and 60. In the past we did not help them, 
               <br />
               but now we are prepared to do so. It is surprising 
               <br />

               Mr. Hollett One of the matters which we have 
               <br />
               to decide is self-support. We have this $23 mil- 
               <br />
               lion plus $34 million we have to borrow from the 
               <br />
               surplus, and on top of that we have reconstruction 
               <br />
               plans costing $60 million over a period of ten 
               <br />
               years. What I cannot reconcile with that picture 
               <br />
               is the statement in the Chadwick-J ones report that 
               <br />
               we are now self-supporting. I am wondering if 
               <br />
               Mr. Wild could give us some idea of the yardstick 
               <br />
               used in ﬁnding out whether or not we were self- 
               <br />
               supporting?

               wick and Jones used. At the moment I would say, 
               <br />
               “Yes, we are self-supporting.” But if we are to 
               <br />
               incur this expenditure and will still be able to 
               <br />
               balance our budget, I would not like to express 
               <br />
               an opinion. As far as that reconstruction matter is 
               <br />
               concerned, we should not proceed with the whole

               of that unless we could see daylight in regard to 
               <br />
               money. We feel that there are indications of 
               <br />
               greater economic prosperity where new roads 
               <br />
               have been opened — for example, the Deer Lake- 
               <br />
               Comer Brook road, this has opened up new
