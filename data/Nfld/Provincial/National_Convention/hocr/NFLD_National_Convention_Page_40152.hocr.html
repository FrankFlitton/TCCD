               Mr. Hollett What I cannot understand is this: 
               <br />
               when the Dorninions Ofﬁce through the Com— 
               <br />

               <br />
               Convention, they also set up a commission of 
               <br />
               two, two men from England to come out here and 
               <br />
               prepare a White Paper to guide us in our delibera— 
               <br />
               tions. I searched through that and all I ﬁnd are a 
               <br />
               set of facts. I cannot ﬁnd anything to suggest that 
               <br />
               we should'go to Canada and ﬁnd out anything 
               <br />
               Why did not the imperial authorities in that White 
               <br />
               Paper state deﬁnitely that we were to ﬁnd out the 
               <br />
               terms of confederation? Why did they not say that 
               <br />
               was a form of government we should talk about? 
               <br />
               They only speak of a form or forms of govem- 
               <br />
               merit and it seems to me that at the time they only 
               <br />
               had in their minds a form of government within 
               <br />
               the territorial boundary of this island. If they 
               <br />
               meant “outside” why did they not supply us with 
               <br />

               vicinity of $40,000. But my reason for seconding 
               <br />
               this motion was because I understood it to be the 
               <br />
               wish of the majority of delegates that we have a 
               <br />
               spring referendum. I do not know if that was 
               <br />
               stated in the house or not. At all events it was 
               <br />
               discussed on a number of occasions in private 
               <br />
               sessions, and it was not the sessions of the “little 
               <br />
               National Convention", but sessions of full 
               <br />
               responsible parties. As you, sir, and the learned 
               <br />
               Professor Wheare have outlined, in order to have 
               <br />
               a spring referendum we must ﬁnish our business 
               <br />
               by the end of January. That would mean that not 
               <br />
               only 'must we have all of our facts in, but we must 
               <br />
               have the debate on the forms of government 
               <br />
               concluded and we must be ready at that time to 
               <br />
               send our recommendations across to England. If 
               <br />
               it is not the intention to have a spring referendum, 
               <br />
               as so many members wished at ﬁrst, then we have 
               <br />
               to set our sights at a fall referendum. But even for 
               <br />
               a fall referendum, we must be ﬁnished here by 
               <br />
               the end of May. If it is the wish to have a fall 
               <br />
               referendum, then I say that the motion we should 
               <br />
               adopt here would be the amendment proposed by 
               <br />
               Mr. Bradley. If we leave it indeﬁnite, as in the 
               <br />
               other amendment, we do not know when we will 
               <br />
               be in a position to seek terms we all agree we must 
               <br />
               have... We have a big task ahead, but I am 
               <br />
               conﬁdent that we can ﬁnish our fact gathering by 
               <br />
               the end of January, if we really want to do it. It is 
               <br />
               going to mean much harder work than we have 
               <br />
               been putting in so far.... If you gentlemen are 
               <br />
               prepared, and you think the necessity warrants, 
               <br />
               then by all means let us wait until May. We 
               <br />
               deﬁnitely have to be ﬁnished by May or we 
               <br />
               cannot have the referendum until the following 
               <br />
               spring. It is simply up to us to decide what we are 
               <br />
               going to shoot for. It is a common agreement 
               <br />
               among all of us that we have got to get these terms 
               <br />
               otherwise we will be blackguarded out of the
