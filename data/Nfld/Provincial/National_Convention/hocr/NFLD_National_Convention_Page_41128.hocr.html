               General Manager of the Railway has indicated 
               <br />
               that once our present capital expenditures are

               $750,000 annually, we must draw the conclusion 
               <br />
               that under the management of the Canadian Na-

               would be balanced and that no deﬁcits would be 
               <br />
               incurred. Therefore in federal revenues the 
               <br />
               Canadian government would collect an amount 
               <br />

               foundland? We have no deﬁnite information on 
               <br />
               this matter beyond what appears in Annex IV in 
               <br />
               the Grey Book (and the reply which Mr. Hollett 
               <br />
               received yesterday, which was very indeﬁnite), 
               <br />
               which states that including subsidies the federal 
               <br />
               government would spend in Newfoundland some 
               <br />
               $27 million annually. This includes $8.35 million 
               <br />
               in family allowances which amount may, and 
               <br />
               probably will, be eliminated very shortly. I have 
               <br />
               already referred to this matter in the early part of 
               <br />
               this address. However, the amount of $27 million 
               <br />
               does not include $3.5 million transitional grant, 
               <br />
               which in my opinion is nothing more or less than 
               <br />
               a “coaxer”, or attempted bribe to influence our 
               <br />
               people to join Canada. It is not a permanent grant, 
               <br />
               as it expires within 12 years. Therefore, in addi- 
               <br />
               tion to taking over all our assets, which I estimate 
               <br />
               are worth not less than $120 million and which 
               <br />
               would be under Canadian control, the Canadian 
               <br />
               government would make an annual proﬁt on the 
               <br />
               administration of Newfoundland of around $3 
               <br />

               <br />

               the United Kingdom during the latter part of 
               <br />
               1941. During the course of this Convention, 
               <br />
               many questions have been asked and addressed 
               <br />
               to the Commission of Government, requesting

               <br />
               have failed to receive satisfactory answers. In 
               <br />
               some instances we were practically told to mind 
               <br />
               our own business. It was therefore with some 
               <br />
               surprise that I noticed that Mr. Hollett had suc-

               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               As you know, the text of this answer is that in 
               <br />
               such an event, the Government of Canada would 
               <br />
               replace the Government of Newfoundland as the 
               <br />
               lessor of these bases. I regard this position as most 
               <br />
               signiﬁcant, because what does it mean? It means 
               <br />
               this: in the event of confederation, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New«</span> 
               <br />
               foundland would lose all and every right, 
               <br />
               privilege, and beneﬁt which might have been 
               <br />
               otherwise hers. Our people, the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland, would be finally and absolutely 
               <br />
               deprived of all opportunity of capitalising on our 
               <br />
               leased territories. And in this connection, it must 
               <br />
               be remembered that it was one of our hopes to be 
               <br />
               able to use our rights in these bases as an impor— 
               <br />

               <br />
               the American market.

               Now this is but one phase of the matter. There 
               <br />
               is another one which to me at least seems of even 
               <br />
               greater importance. It is a well known fact that 
               <br />
               during 1946 a mutual defence pact was made
