               Dominion of Newfoundland, not the Dominion

               of Canada. Take young boys, six or eight years 
               <br />
               old; they start carrying rocks off the ground and 
               <br />

               <br />
               belongs to them just as much as it does to their 
               <br />
               father. When father married he took over virgin 
               <br />
               territory; as the sons grew up they helped clear 
               <br />
               the land, now my sons are on it. I know of some

               people today who are getting old age pensions 
               <br />

               <br />
               them. One is in hospital and there is no way for 
               <br />
               that son to help his father out. I have here some

               <br />
               says that in every question asked those legal 
               <br />
               authorities, the answer was, “No, you have no

               <br />

               time <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Bailey and I partially agreed in public 
               <br />
               since the Convention began. Here is the answer. 
               <br />
               “No province requires an applicant [for old age 
               <br />
               pensions] to turn over his property to the provin- 
               <br />
               cial government either before or after granting a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pension,</span> After a pension is granted a provincial 
               <br />
               pensions authority may, if authorised by provin— 
               <br />
               cial legislation, encumber any real property 
               <br />
               owned by the pensioner.” That means if a 
               <br />
               province has its own provincial law requiring its 
               <br />
               pension authority to encumber any real property 
               <br />
               of the old age pensioner, then that authority can 
               <br />
               do so. There may be provinces where there is 
               <br />
               such a provincial law. that is their business. If we 
               <br />
               became a province, and if the legislature passed 
               <br />
               a law giving authority to the pensions authority 
               <br />
               to encumber and take a lien, then it can do so, but 
               <br />
               there has to be a Newfoundland law to authorise 
               <br />
               them to do it.... There is no such Newfoundland 
               <br />
               law now. We are not compelled to pass any such 
               <br />
               law. If we have a legislature they will be our 
               <br />
               elected representatives. I doubt very much if an 
               <br />
               elected House of Assembly in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               would pass a law to give power to the old age 
               <br />
               pension authority to encumber the property... 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Your point is, the lien to which 
               <br />
               Captain Bailey refers arises under legislation 
               <br />
               passed by the provincial government, which 
               <br />
               makes it a purely statutory lien?
