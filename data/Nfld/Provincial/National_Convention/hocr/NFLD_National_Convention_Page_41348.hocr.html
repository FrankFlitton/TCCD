               Minister, but (I am coming to a very important 
               <br />
               matter) for political reasons the members of the

               Opposition, some of whom now hold responsible 
               <br />
               positions in the government, organised a 
               <br />
               deliberate attack, physically and otherwise on the 
               <br />
               government of the day, with the result that a 
               <br />
               general election took place in June, 1932. State- 
               <br />
               ments about that general election have been 
               <br />
               repeated over and over again. After the election 
               <br />
               in 1932, it was pointed out to the people of this 
               <br />
               country that immediately after Commission of 
               <br />
               Government assumed ofﬁce, they would restore 
               <br />
               our ﬁnancial stability; they would establish new 
               <br />
               industries and, if necessary, appoint a royal com— 
               <br />
               mission to go into our position. But (and this is 
               <br />
               the real thing!) they told us that under no 
               <br />
               circumstances would our status as a dominion be 
               <br />
               surrendered without ﬁrst consulting the people. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, I don’t want to go into the history 
               <br />
               of it any further. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Would that be a plebiscite? 
               <br />
               Mr. Bradley The words were, “Nothing will be 
               <br />
               done”. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin I am just speaking from memory: 
               <br />
               that nothing will be done unless by way of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pleb«</span> 
               <br />
               iscite or referendum. 
               <br />
               Mr. Bradley That’s right. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin But what happened? The next thing 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd ourselves saddled with is a royal commis- 
               <br />
               sion. There were no new industries started, in 
               <br />
               spite of the fact that many prominent men in the 
               <br />
               country went into the matter and were promised 
               <br />
               that as soon as this government was returned to 
               <br />
               ofﬁce this would be started. The next thing we 
               <br />
               ﬁnd is the Amulree royal commission, and the 
               <br />
               Amulree Report will go down in history as — 
               <br />
               well, I can’t think of anything bad enough to call 
               <br />
               it. Lord Amulree has passed away since that time 
               <br />
               and many of the men of the government of that 
               <br />
               day have passed away, but I say now that was 
               <br />
               done deliberately, not mind you by the people 
               <br />
               who voted for it in there, they were merely used 
               <br />
               by half a dozen, used to take away our integrity. 
               <br />
               Now the other day Mr. Smallwood stated that 
               <br />
               we were bankrupt. Mr. Chairman, I contend that 
               <br />
               we were not bankrupt We had not got money, but 
               <br />
               did the British government have it, or Canada, or 
               <br />
               any other countries in Europe have it? No, they 
               <br />
               all defaulted on their war debts, and the war up 
               <br />
               to that time had cost us nearly $40 million and we 
               <br />
               were sweating to pay the interest on that, and the 
               <br />

               other countries were defaulting on it. And I want 
               <br />
               to condemn the Amulree Report because in one 
               <br />
               paragraph it states that no British dominion or 
               <br />
               part of the British Empire had defaulted. Why the 
               <br />
               man who wrote that knew he was lying, because 
               <br />
               three months previous the British government 
               <br />
               itself had defaulted on a payment to the United 
               <br />
               States of between $75-90 million, and the in-

               <br />

               Commission government took over here in

               <br />
               were honest. I say they are the most dishonest

               that. The dole was given right from 1933 to 1940. 
               <br />
               If you look at the records of the Financial Report 
               <br />
               which I have compiled you will ﬁnd that $17-20 
               <br />
               million were advanced by Great Britain in that 
               <br />
               period, and the interest on our national debt 
               <br />
               during that period was more than the advance 
               <br />
               made by Great Britain. Now what is the answer? 
               <br />
               Out of our own revenue we got the money to pay 
               <br />
               the six cents a day dole, and those monies that 
               <br />
               they advanced (the British government) were 
               <br />
               really paying their own bondholders in England, 
               <br />
               and they were defaulting on their payments to the 
               <br />
               United States at the same time. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now we come to 1940—41. Here was a trus-

               teeship created in 1934. What is a trusteeship? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, you know all about it better than 
               <br />
               I do, and so does Mr. Bradley and Mr. Higgins.

               out any money he is liable. Now what happens? 
               <br />
               In 1940—41 the Commission government and the 
               <br />
               Dominions Ofﬁce there gave away to the United

               Cormick, to giving these bases for the period of

               object to any government, particularly this
