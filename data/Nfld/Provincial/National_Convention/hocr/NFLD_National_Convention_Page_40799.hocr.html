               seven years ago in the hour of great common

               peril, to give special trade concessions to New-

               important aspect of all that the Government of the

               United States would take into account, is the fact

               <br />
               deliberately turning her back on a trade policy 
               <br />

               <br />
               widely throughout the world as her policy. I refer, 
               <br />
               of course, to America’s well-known policy of 
               <br />
               multilateral trade and tariff agreements. A policy

               It was, we must not forget, the Government of 
               <br />
               the United States that called the trade conference 
               <br />
               at Geneva last spring. It was that government that 
               <br />
               invited the other nations to take part. it was that

               government that took the lead in the conference 
               <br />
               which met for many months, and at which New- 
               <br />
               foundland was represented. We all know the 
               <br />
               story of the ups and downs of that conference, of 
               <br />
               the difficulties, of the narrow escapes it had from 
               <br />
               disaster, of the herculean tasks it had to perform. 
               <br />
               We know that on the 18th of this present month, 
               <br />
               tomorrow, the world is to learn how successful or

               otherwise the United States government has been

               in establishing its policy of multilateral trade

               circumstances as these would mean that the

               <br />

               whether they liked it or not, the Government of

               the United States would have to give most careful

               consideration, and that is the powerful pressure

               which America’s own vast fishing industry

               All these are hard facts Mr. Chairman, and

               they are facts upon which we dare not turn our

               Now, there is another aspect of this debate 
               <br />
               upon which I wish to offer a word or two of 
               <br />
               comment. We have seen and heard a very thinly 
               <br />
               disguised attempt to impute a lack of patriotic 
               <br />

               <br />
               accept this so-called Economic Report and the 
               <br />
               rosy picture it paints ofour present and future. An 
               <br />
               effort is being made to blow this report up into an 
               <br />
               infallible test of our patriotism and love of 
               <br />
               country. If you are a patriot you will agree with 
               <br />
               this report, if you are not a patriot, you will 
               <br />
               question it. Your attitude towards it is a sure and 
               <br />
               certain test of your patriotism, that is the attempt 
               <br />
               that is being made, sir, and nobody seems to have 
               <br />
               observed the complete absurdity of it. Have we 
               <br />
               sunk so low, Mr. Chairman, are we so lost to all 
               <br />
               sense of reality? Have we wandered so far from 
               <br />
               a sense of duty? When the report seems to us
