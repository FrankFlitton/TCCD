               The National Convention, which is now com— 
               <br />
               ing near its end, came into being as a result of the 
               <br />
               existence of another organisation. It might never 
               <br />
               have been called into existence if there had never 
               <br />
               existed in Newfoundland a regime known as 
               <br />
               “Government by Commission”. The main reason 
               <br />
               for the existence of the National Convention lay 
               <br />
               in the desire of the United Kingdom government 
               <br />
               to ascertain whether Newfoundlanders wanted a 
               <br />
               continuation of Commission government or 
               <br />
               some other form in its place. In my opinion, the 
               <br />
               problem is probably stated in this motion of Mr. 
               <br />
               Higgins to which I now speak. I support that 
               <br />
               motion because I can admit of only two forms of 
               <br />
               government known to and experienced by con— 
               <br />
               temporary Newfoundlanders -—- <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self‘govemment</span> 
               <br />
               and Commission government. There are other 
               <br />
               forms of government existing in the world today, 
               <br />
               all the way from Russian communism to British 
               <br />
               socialism to American or Canadian federalism, 
               <br />
               and other forms operating within the British 
               <br />
               Commonwealth which may be possible or 
               <br />
               suitable forms of government for Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               But these forms are outside the practice of 
               <br />
               government in Newfoundland and at the moment 
               <br />
               we have no means, in my opinion, of testing them 
               <br />
               accurately and fully enough to warrant asking the 
               <br />
               people of this country to make a decision on 
               <br />
               them, apart from the two which Ihave mentioned. 
               <br />
               Furthermore, Mr. Chairman, I do not believe that 
               <br />
               any people should be asked to choose between 
               <br />
               more than that form of government which they 
               <br />
               have and one other, at any one time. Will any 
               <br />
               delegate please tell me any other people who 
               <br />
               have been asked to do more anywhere at any 
               <br />
               time? Normally to make a radical change in the 
               <br />
               form of government requires many years of ac— 
               <br />
               tively educating the people for that change. Mr. 
               <br />
               Higgins’ motion covers the choice that I think 
               <br />
               should now be put to the people of this country. 
               <br />
               Some 20 months ago when the Convention 
               <br />
               was being born, I had the privilege of telling 
               <br />
               groups of people now within the sound of my 
               <br />
               voice, that if they elected me as their delegate 
               <br />
               they would understand that I would be looking 
               <br />
               for that form of government which would give 
               <br />
               the greatest possible freedom, consistent with a 
               <br />
               tolerable standard of living. As this Convention 
               <br />
               comes to an end I feel that I have now a duty to 
               <br />
               perform. And after some 20 months of getting

               facts, I am now ready to discharge that duty. 1 am 
               <br />
               ready, fully aware of the import of this matter, to 
               <br />

               <br />
               to what form of government is in the best interest 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland.

               Some 20 months ago, I confess, I had my 
               <br />
               doubts as to whether full self-government, which 
               <br />
               offered the greatest political freedom, could give 
               <br />
               us a tolerable standard of living. In common with 
               <br />
               other Newfoundlanders I had been conditioned, 
               <br />
               consciously or unconsciously,'by the economic 
               <br />
               depression which struck me as it did many other 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders. I had been conditioned by the 
               <br />
               obvious weaknesses of the democratic way, 
               <br />
               which had earned the phrase “decadent", until a 
               <br />
               war against dictatorship awoke the democracies 
               <br />
               into galvanised action. Like many contemporary 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders, Ihad also been conditioned by 
               <br />
               the provincialism of living in an island, and I' 
               <br />
               think I may also add, by the insidious propaganda 
               <br />
               of those who were weak in courage but strong in 
               <br />
               playing safe. I had almost come to believe that 
               <br />
               there were none so poor as Newfoundlanders in 
               <br />
               that depression; none so depraved as 
               <br />
               Newfoundland’s politicians of that period; none 
               <br />
               so poorly endowed by nature with natural <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resoun</span> 
               <br />
               ces to work on as this island home of ours.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Later, I began to have my doubts as to whether 
               <br />
               Newfoundland poverty was even as bad as that 
               <br />
               of the depressed areas of England, or of the 
               <br />
               “Grapes of Wrath” areas in America, or many 
               <br />
               other places that could be mentioned in other 
               <br />
               countries Reading of the bosses of American 
               <br />
               politics or the Canadian equivalents, Ihad begun 
               <br />
               to doubt whether alongside them our politicians 
               <br />
               were not just pikers. Still, as I say, I was in doubt. 
               <br />
               I felt I knew what Newfoundlanders wanted — 
               <br />
               that is, political freedom consistent with fair 
               <br />
               security, but I was not sure which was the best 
               <br />
               way out; considering seriously, for instance, a 
               <br />
               modiﬁed form of Commission of Government as 
               <br />
               perhaps the possible solution. In other words, I 
               <br />
               entered the Convention with an open mind. In the 
               <br />
               20 months to which I refer I have read a lot of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland history, a lot of present day 
               <br />
               economic and political papers, and I have, in 
               <br />
               common with all you gentlemen here, had the 
               <br />
               opportunity to study, and in some measure report 
               <br />
               on the economic state of our country. I had also 
               <br />
               the opportunity, in common with six other mem-
