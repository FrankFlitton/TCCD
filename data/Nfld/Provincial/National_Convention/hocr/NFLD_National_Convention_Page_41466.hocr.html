               Mr. MacDonald To begin with, I did not say 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett said it. I said it was made here in this 
               <br />
               Convention. If Mr. Hollett thinks the hat ﬁts, he 
               <br />
               will have to wear it. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood He will wear it. 
               <br />
               Mr. MacDonald I was sitting in the chair 
               <br />
               alongside of Mr. Hollett. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Then you were referring to me? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood The whole country heard it. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Ihope at this stage members will 
               <br />
               please remember that time is of the essence. We 
               <br />
               are trying to get through a very important item of 
               <br />
               business and we have very little time left, and 
               <br />
               interjections and interruptions of this sort are 
               <br />
               causing a waste of time. I must ask members to 
               <br />
               strictly adhere to the rules. 
               <br />
               Mr. MacDonald Do you wish me to go on? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Mr. Hollett rose to a question of 
               <br />
               privilege. He wanted his right deﬁned in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">connec‘</span> 
               <br />
               tion with a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">statement,</span> He was perfectly in order 
               <br />
               in drawing my attention to it. He did not interrupt. 
               <br />
               He rose to a point of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">privilege.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. MacDonald There are many other points I 
               <br />
               could make to show why federal union is my 
               <br />
               preference; but they have already been discussed 
               <br />
               in the Convention and it would be only repetition 
               <br />
               to carry them further. In general, Mr. Chairman, 
               <br />
               I believe that federal union with Canada will be 
               <br />
               a solution of a great number of our difﬁculties. 
               <br />
               We will be joining a growing nation, and with it 
               <br />
               we will grow. On our own, we will possibly find 
               <br />
               ourselves within a very few years back to where 
               <br />
               we were in the 19203 and 19308.

               Mr. Chairman, as this is probably the last time 
               <br />
               I will have the privilege of addressing this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conv</span>

               vention, I take this opportunity to say that it has 
               <br />
               been a pleasure to me to attend this Convention. 
               <br />
               Ihave learned a good deal, and I agree with Major 
               <br />
               Cashin that friendships have been formed which 
               <br />
               will last as long as life itself, and which will 
               <br />
               undoubtedly have a good effect on the country at 
               <br />
               large in the days that are ahead. Before I resume 
               <br />
               my seat, may I personally express my humble, 
               <br />
               but none the less sincere appreciation of the man- 
               <br />
               ner in which you, sir, have conducted the 
               <br />
               proceedings of this Convention since you were 
               <br />
               appointed as our Chairman. It has not been an 
               <br />
               easy task, but you have, in my opinion, been 
               <br />
               strictly impartial in your many rulings. You have 
               <br />
               kept us strictly to the rules of procedure and the 
               <br />
               terms of reference as laid down, and you were

               Mr. Bailey Mr. Chairman, before us today we 
               <br />
               have a job which now and again crops up in our 
               <br />
               history. Perhaps I may be pardoned if I were to 
               <br />
               quote Mark Twain, the great American 
               <br />
               humourist, who when writing about King 
               <br />
               Arthur’s court, said of the knights in search of the 
               <br />
               Holy Grail, “Every now and again the boys went 
               <br />
               agrailing." Again our boys have gone agrailing. 
               <br />
               While I know it is not the holy vessel, yet to my 
               <br />
               mind it is something just as elusive — to better 
               <br />
               your condition by throwing your troubles upon 
               <br />
               the shoulders of a second power or person. In my 
               <br />
               opinion, if a person or nation cannot solve their 
               <br />
               own problems, how can a second person or power 
               <br />
               do that, when they have the same troubles them- 
               <br />
               selves? There are aspects of this search which, if 
               <br />
               I may quote a learned jurist, “To me there is an 
               <br />
               odour in the state of Denmark.” 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               During the debate there were statements made 
               <br />
               either through ignorance or a wish to deceive the 
               <br />
               people, for instance the statement of Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood and Mr. Ashbourne that New- 
               <br />
               foundland once in confederation could get out 
               <br />
               was a deliberate falsehood. If they knew no more 
               <br />
               about it than that, they should have left it 
               <br />
               deliberately alone. For we will turn back the 
               <br />
               pages of history. The BNA Act “gave all legisla- 
               <br />
               tive power to the federal government except over 
               <br />
               matters expressly reserved to the provinces. 
               <br />
               Power to levy any kind of taxes, to make any and 
               <br />
               every regulation of commerce, of money, and 
               <br />
               banking and to disallow any provincial statute it 
               <br />
               proposed to disallow." The result of this, nothing 
               <br />
               was clear in intent, nothing has proven more 
               <br />
               fallacious in its issue. The lean kind were to eat 
               <br />
               up the fat. The feeble provinces of 1867, ap- 
               <br />
               parently denuded of revenue, and devoid of all 
               <br />
               but the meager and necessary, were to be changed 
               <br />
               by altered circumstances and by judicial inter— 
               <br />
               pretation into the autonomous units of 70 years 
               <br />
               later, a sort of heptarchy (or a country ruled by 
               <br />
               different governments) whose members control 
               <br />
               the public domain, and vast revenues from sour- 
               <br />
               ces unknown at confederation. Now, all that was 
               <br />
               to come later. The provinces felt themselves 
               <br />
               overshadowed by the Dominion, and no longer in 
               <br />
