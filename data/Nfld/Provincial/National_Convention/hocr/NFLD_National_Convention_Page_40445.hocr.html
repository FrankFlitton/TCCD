               Mr. Job There are two more appendices, one is

               Mr. Ashbourne It had been the practice of the 
               <br />
               government to pay a bounty for repairing vessels. 
               <br />
               It was discontinued. I am afraid I cannot read the 
               <br />
               minds of the Commission of Government as to 
               <br />
               why this should be discontinued. I do remember 
               <br />
               one enquiry was made as to whether a bounty was 
               <br />
               payable or not, and it was remarked that the 
               <br />
               bounty was not payable at the time. Coupled with 
               <br />
               that was some remark about the matter of inspec- 
               <br />
               tion, as to whether or not it might not be abused. 
               <br />
               That depends entirely upon the inspector himself, 
               <br />
               and I see no reason why, if the system could be 
               <br />
               abused by some who wanted to affect sham 
               <br />
               repairs, the person who wanted to effect any 
               <br />
               repairs should suffer. I am in accord with the

               While I am on my feet I would like to reply to 
               <br />
               a question asked by Mr. Hollett as to the quantity 
               <br />
               of Merchantable ﬁsh shipped out of this country 
               <br />
               last year, and if any of it was classed as such. I 
               <br />
               went to the Fisheries Board this morning and I 
               <br />
               give you the ofﬁcial ﬁgures:* 
               <br />
               There is no report at the Fisheries Board of the 
               <br />
               amount of Merchantable ﬁsh exported from 
               <br />
               Lamaline. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett A few years ago Lamaline was the 
               <br />
               exporting center, now it goes direct from Grand 
               <br />
               Bank. 
               <br />
               Mr. Harrington The Committee gives the ap- 
               <br />
               proximate numbcr of men prosecuting the salt 
               <br />
               codﬁshery. I wonder if the Committee could give 
               <br />
               the number engaged in fresh ﬁshery? 
               <br />
               Mr. Job Those numbers there partly ﬁshed for 
               <br />
               fresh ﬁsh and partly engaged in salt ﬁshery. 
               <br />
               These numbers refer to the entire ﬁshery. 
               <br />
               Mr. McCarthy Page 2 of Appendix 1: ....Does 
               <br />
               that mean that if a local vessel left St. John’s to 
               <br />
               go to Halifax, she could not land freight along the 
               <br />
               coast? 
               <br />
               Mr. Job Yes, that is the meaning. What is hap- 
               <br />
               pening is this —— take a vessel loading at Port 
               <br />
               Union bound for Placentia Bay. She clears from 
               <br />
               Port Union and is permitted to carry cargo from 
               <br />
               Port Union to Placentia Bay. If it is any other 
               <br />
               vessel clearing for a foreign port, she is not 
               <br />
               permitted to carry cargo between ports. 
               <br />
               Mr. McCarthy Were any enquiries made as to 
               <br />
               the reason? 
               <br />
               Mr. Job There was no satisfactory reason given. 
               <br />
               The only reply was that it was the custom in 
               <br />
               Canada. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hickman I think it was originally instituted 
               <br />
               to prevent foreign vessels or time-chartered ships
