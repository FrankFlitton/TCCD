               $700,000 a year for the past 30 years, but the 
               <br />
               Railway being an importer of certain goods pays 
               <br />
               duty on these goods the same as a commercial 
               <br />

               <br />
               be deducted, but the point is not what the Railway 
               <br />
               is costing the country, but what the Railway is 
               <br />
               costing the government. We are dealing with 
               <br />
               public ﬁnance. What the Railway is costing New- 
               <br />
               foundland is this: what is paid out by the Railway 
               <br />
               is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">paid-by</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland.</span> Now the government 
               <br />
               pays out so much more; in addition Newfound- 
               <br />
               land is supporting the Railway by travelling on it 
               <br />
               and paying fares, sending freight, etc. The 
               <br />
               general economy of Newfoundland is doing that, 
               <br />
               but the government is making up the difference.

               to pay their expenses. They don’t get enough to

               pay their expenses from the public.

               Mr. Smallwood Yes. In 1922-23 the Railway 
               <br />
               lost $593,000. Next year the loss was only 
               <br />
               $6,500. The reason is exactly the same. In that 
               <br />
               year the Humber1 began, and a tremendous 
               <br />
               amount of tonnage was hauled on the railway, 
               <br />
               which gave them a sudden increase in their 
               <br />
               revenue, and that was not offset by an increase in 
               <br />
               their expenditures or costs of operating, because 
               <br />
               they did not have to take on additional 
               <br />

               to the next year, 1924-25 —~ they lost $328,000, 
               <br />
               because that big heavy trafﬁc in connection with
