               difference between the Canadian act and our

               <br />
               or demobilisation pay from Canada, but that has 
               <br />
               been already availed of, and they would not get 
               <br />
               any extra or back <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pay,</span> That is settled and done

               it is, 18 months or something, to avail of your
