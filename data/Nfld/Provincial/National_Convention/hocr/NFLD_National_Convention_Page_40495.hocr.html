               living index is somewhere here in the ﬁles, but 
               <br />
               owing to the report’s being limited there were 
               <br />
               several details we felt compelled to leave out. 
               <br />
               Mr. Ballam I must refer back to something Mr. 
               <br />
               Butt said with regard to TB patients and what 
               <br />
               happens to them. I had occasion to go into the 
               <br />
               Sanatorium early last fall, and I happened to meet 
               <br />
               a gentleman there, whom I understand has since 
               <br />
               deceased. I refer to Mr. Conrad Fitzgerald. He 
               <br />
               edited a magazine called Sunbeams. It was most 
               <br />
               interesting and informative. Mr. Fitzgerald told 
               <br />
               me that one of the big factors in the recurrence of 
               <br />
               TB was the fact that after a patient is discharged 
               <br />
               from hospital there is no form of rehabilitation. 
               <br />
               In other words, he is to all intents and purposes 
               <br />
               cured, and if he is a ﬁsherman he must go in a 
               <br />
               boat; if a logger, he must go in the woods. By so 
               <br />
               doing, he is losing what it took years to build up. 
               <br />
               Mr. Fitzgerald’s idea was that there should be 
               <br />
               some form of rehabilitation whereby those ﬁsher- 
               <br />
               men coming out of hospital could be looked after 
               <br />
               until they could rehabilitate themselves to the 
               <br />
               extent where they could follow their usual voca- 
               <br />

               Mr. Ashbourne I agree entirely with Mr. Bal- 
               <br />
               lam. This problem should be tied in with our 
               <br />
               health system. The problem of rehabilitation is 
               <br />
               one which must be tackled because when a man 
               <br />
               has suffered from such a disease as TB naturally 
               <br />
               the whole body is impaired, and it stands to 
               <br />
               reason that a man cannot undertake strenuous 
               <br />
               work. I believe such a scheme would be money 
               <br />
               well spent.

               In reply to Mr. Penney, I wish to thank him for 
               <br />
               his remarks on the report. I would like to say that 
               <br />
               this matter of arriving at the monthly cost of 
               <br />
               living index in St. John’s is a rather complicated 
               <br />
               matter as I see it. There has been a discussion on 
               <br />
               this matter going on; you see letters in the papers. 
               <br />
               It seems that when the index was started it was 
               <br />
               set at 100. Staple articles, food and clothing, were 
               <br />
               placed at certain values and when they advanced 
               <br />
               other articles were placed on the list. When prices 
               <br />
               advanced in grocery stores the prices were 
               <br />
               entered and different calculations were arrived at. 
               <br />
               They took October 1, 1938 as 100 for these 
               <br />
               commodities as listed and eventually these 
               <br />
               ﬁgures were arrived at. I have not changed the 
               <br />
               ﬁgures myself...

               <br />

               <br />

               we were shot down by enemy aircraft and I
