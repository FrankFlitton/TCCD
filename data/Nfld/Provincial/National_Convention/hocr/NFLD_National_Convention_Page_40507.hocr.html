               in moving this resolution I do so with no en- 
               <br />
               thusiasm. I am a Newfoundlander and a British 
               <br />
               subject, and I believe the only country in the 
               <br />
               world today that is doing anything towards the 
               <br />
               welfare of the common man is the British govem- 
               <br />
               ment, and I don’t want anyone to think for a 
               <br />
               moment that I am, by moving this resolution, 
               <br />
               disloyal to what I think is the best we have, but I 
               <br />
               do say that a lot of people want a delegation to 
               <br />
               the USA and why should we not send one there? 
               <br />
               Possibly the United States won’t have it, and I 
               <br />
               hope they won’t, but when the time comes for our 
               <br />
               delegation to go over to England, let them go with 
               <br />
               the thought that there is a sentiment in New- 
               <br />
               foundland on this line.

               Mr. Higgins I had no intention of indulging in 
               <br />
               this debate myself. In fact I felt very much like 
               <br />
               adopting Mr. Butt’s attitude, but as this debate

               Britain, the oldestcolony and the ﬁrst colony, and 
               <br />
               I want to say this to you: is the oldestcolony, even 
               <br />
               by words, going to stab a Britain that’s now 
               <br />
               practically on her back, going to stab her in that 
               <br />
               recumbent back today, even if it is only by 
               <br />
               words? I have got as much, not British but Irish

               blood as anyone, and I would be the last to 
               <br />
               support this motion. You ask how I am being 
               <br />
               consistent by uttering words like <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that.</span> Well, 
               <br />
               Canada is part of the Empire, and if this country 
               <br />
               decides, if we as a people decide, to join Canada, 
               <br />
               we will not be getting out of the British Empire; 
               <br />
               but once we adopt such a motion, or the country 
               <br />
               adopts what would follow such a motion, we 
               <br />
               would lose our nationality, we would be no 
               <br />
               longer British. I don’t think there is a possibility 
               <br />
               of this happening, but I don’t like to see such a 
               <br />
               motion brought into the House like this. I want to 
               <br />
               raise every objection to this motion. Mr Jackman
