               Mr. Cashin I accept your position, but the 
               <br />
               words “critically correct” brings up another mat— 
               <br />
               ter. In a budget speech of mine in 1931, I forecast 
               <br />
               a deﬁcit of$1.3 million and it turned out to be $4 
               <br />
               million; that was put forward as an argument, 
               <br />
               “Here is an individual who in 1931 made a budget 
               <br />
               that did not turn out. Can you believe him now?” 
               <br />
               We will tell them what happened in 1931. This is 
               <br />
               the place to clean our cloth. I was Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance. Our loan for $8 million was turned 
               <br />
               down. Myself and the Prime <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Minister1</span> went to 
               <br />
               Montreal to discuss the position with the Bank of 
               <br />
               Montreal. New I am going to tread on dangerous 
               <br />
               ground. The first thing I was told in the head 
               <br />
               ofﬁce of the General Manager at the time was, 
               <br />
               “Cashin, you should have boosted up that budget 
               <br />
               speech and made it balance.” My reply was, “Is 
               <br />
               that the way you run the Bank of Montreal?” I 
               <br />
               knew there was going to be a deﬁcit and I 
               <br />
               budgeted for it. We were turned down by the 
               <br />
               Bank of Montreal. Eventually we made a deal; 
               <br />
               we were advanced $2 million to meet the interest. 
               <br />
               We came back to Newfoundland. We tore the 
               <br />
               civil service, everything abroad trying to cut 
               <br />
               down expenses, railway, schoolteachers, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">every</span> 
               <br />
               thing. We did everything. Most of us took our 
               <br />
               political lives in our hands. Revenues were still 
               <br />
               falling. The world was upside doWn. New- 
               <br />
               foundland did not cause the world to turn upside 
               <br />
               down. Finally it was agreed that a delegation, 
               <br />
               another delegation should go to Canada. We went 
               <br />
               to see if we could get any money on the Labrador. 
               <br />
               Thanks be to God we did not get it. We were 
               <br />
               turned down. Canada was bankrupt herself; her 
               <br />
               banking institutions were on the verge of col- 
               <br />
               lapse. One of the banks was being run on while 
               <br />
               we were in Ottawa. We came back to New- 
               <br />
               foundland and hardly had we set foot inside the 
               <br />
               House of Assembly when four managers of the 
               <br />
               banks were in to see us. For what? They came to 
               <br />
               us to save themselves; to go off the gold standard. 
               <br />
               They had an arrangement under the Banking Act 
               <br />
               whereby Newfoundland or Newfoundlanders, 
               <br />
               who had $24-25 million on deposit, could 
               <br />
               withdraw the money in gold. The Canadians did 
               <br />

               <br />
               deposits in Canada. Then what happened? The 
               <br />
               Bank of Canada was brought into existence. They 
               <br />
               came to us on their hands and knees, we discussed 
               <br />
               it for nearly two months. What was happening? 
               <br />
               Merchants here in this country who had money 
               <br />
               were buying goods in the United States and the 
               <br />
               Canadian dollar was at a discount of 20%; the 
               <br />
               pound sterling was $3.50 to $3.80. Some of the 
               <br />
               merchants said, “We are not going to pay this 
               <br />
               premium of 20%; pay out the gold and we will 
               <br />
               ship it to the United States and pay for the goods." 
               <br />
               They came like a crowd of children bawling and 
               <br />
               crying to the Newfoundland government to save 
               <br />
               them from bankruptcy. That is what happened. 
               <br />
               So on December 31 at midnight, 1931, New— 
               <br />
               foundland went off the gold standard. The whole 
               <br />
               commercial structure of this country would have 
               <br />
               been down. The banks would have had to close 
               <br />
               their doors. The merchants owed the banks a lot 
               <br />
               of money. There was nothing else left but to go 
               <br />
               off the gold standard. That was the position in 
               <br />
               1931. Now, 16 years later, I am accused indirect- 
               <br />
               ly of cooking up this report on the grounds that 
               <br />
               in 1931 I forecast a false budget. That is the 
               <br />
               position and 1 am not taking <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> 1 think I have 
               <br />
               shown to the satisfaction of this house how that 
               <br />
               $35 million was made up. I make this com- 
               <br />
               parison; the difference in my ﬁgures, one way or 
               <br />
               another, on the short or on the long side, would 
               <br />
               not be sufﬁcient to stage a good cocktail party in 
               <br />
               St. John’s East or a beer—guzzling party in St. 
               <br />
               John’s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">West.</span> Here is the statement given by the 
               <br />
               Finance Department. I think this Convention as 
               <br />
               it is today is not of the opinion that this Economic 
               <br />
               Report, compiled in four days. was deliberately 
               <br />
               cooked up or is false or dishonest; or that any 
               <br />
               gentlemen on that Committee is dishonest. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Nobody within or without this 
               <br />
               House is justiﬁed in saying it. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin No one will be allowed to say it. I 
               <br />
               was the one who gathered the information and I 
               <br />
               owe it to the other seven members to make that 
               <br />
               statement this evening. I am glad Mr. MacDonald 
               <br />
               brought it up, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">although</span> I intended to, and probab— 
               <br />
               ly will deal with it at further length on Monday. 
               <br />
               We were told this debate was going to last four 
               <br />
               days, we were going to be closed by Christmas.
