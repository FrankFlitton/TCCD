               our approach to the economic side. What 
               <br />
               does education cost the treasury now, and 
               <br />
               what has it cost in the past? Is the country 
               <br />
               getting adequate results for the money spent? 
               <br />
               Could the same results have been got with 
               <br />
               less expenditure? Will the same level of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex»</span> 
               <br />
               penditure have to be maintained in future, or

               will expenditure be higher or lower than 
               <br />
               now? One thing the Committee decided from 
               <br />
               the commencement of its approach was its 
               <br />
               inability to judge of the the country’s 
               <br />
               capacity either now or in the future to meet 
               <br />
               the costs of education: the members felt that 
               <br />
               while as members of the National Conven- 
               <br />
               tion itself they would have ultimately to 
               <br />
               come to that judgement, as members of the 
               <br />
               Committee they had neither the general na- 
               <br />
               tional data, not even the mission, to consider 
               <br />
               the wider question of the country’s ability to 
               <br />
               carry educational services.

               As to the final conclusions, that is a horse of 
               <br />
               another colour. Dealing with section 2, Ihave felt 
               <br />
               and am sure all members of the Committee felt, 
               <br />
               that here, perhaps, was the basis of the criticism 
               <br />
               that the Convention might be prepared to offer in 
               <br />
               connection with this whole report. If this Conven—

               tion or the government or the Department of 
               <br />
               Education or other competent authority were to 
               <br />
               bring to Newfoundland a man or a number of men 
               <br />
               for the purpose of investigating not the cost of 
               <br />
               education, the purely economic side, but educa- 
               <br />

               who might be described as professionals ... not 
               <br />
               teachers or educators, but men who had made a 
               <br />
               study of education as such, men who had studied 
               <br />
               educational systems, the purpose and the reason; 
               <br />
               men who had made a comparison of the different

               types and forms and systems of education; and 
               <br />
               turn them loose in Newfoundland, giving them 
               <br />
               authority and power and a year or two in which

               in this country; then, having spent about six 
               <br />
               months in the different departments, attending 
               <br />

               opinion on the education system which would be

               worth having. Our Committee, consisting of two

               ourselves frankly and to the Convention that 
               <br />
               there was a great deal of the subject of which we 
               <br />
               knew nothing. We were not trained or equipped 
               <br />
               to make that kind of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">investigation.</span> Then we dug 
               <br />
               into the question of what it cost since 1920-21 
               <br />
               down to the present time; and forthat expenditure 
               <br />
               what have we got in the way of education? How 
               <br />
               many schools and how many classrooms, how 
               <br />
               many teachers? Has the school system from the 
               <br />
               plant, the physical standpoint, improved for that 
               <br />
               additional expenditure? Then we made a stab at 
               <br />
               guessing as to what the education plant would 
               <br />
               have to be in the years ahead. The result you will 
               <br />
               find in this report. I thought a frank statement of 
               <br />
               the spirit in which this report is presented would
