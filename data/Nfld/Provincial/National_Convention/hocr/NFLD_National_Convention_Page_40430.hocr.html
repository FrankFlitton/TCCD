               I would like Mr. Job, or someone else, to tell us 
               <br />
               are the words “merchantable ﬁsh”just words, or 
               <br />
               is there such a thing? Could someone throw some 
               <br />
               light on that perplexing question?.... 
               <br />
               Mr. Job I should think the best way for Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood to ﬁnd that out would be to interview 
               <br />
               the Fisheries Board. We must presume their ﬁsh 
               <br />
               is not good enough to classify that way. It is 
               <br />
               probably greatly exaggerated; I imagine there is 
               <br />
               a certain quantity of merchantable fish 
               <br />
               everywhere, but the quantity is small nowadays 
               <br />
               because the same care is not taken with the cure; 
               <br />
               the main bulk of the ﬁsh shipped is good Madeira 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁshw</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I know there is no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">merchane</span> 
               <br />
               able ﬁsh in Lamaline, but what they want to know 
               <br />
               is, is there such a thing as a merchantable fish? 
               <br />
               Mr. Job We are not cullers here. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett I object very strongly to the use of 
               <br />
               this Convention for answering anonymous let- 
               <br />
               ters. I can bring in half a dozen tomorrow. I object 
               <br />
               to anonymous letters, the contents of which I 
               <br />
               doubt very much. I can’t conceive of any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁsher‘</span> 
               <br />
               man making ﬁsh and not getting any merchant-

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               able ﬁsh at all. It is a good many years since I was 
               <br />
               associated with a ﬁshing settlement, but I know 
               <br />
               they did make considerable merchantable ﬁsh. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hillier As to whether or not merchantable 
               <br />
               ﬁsh has been made at Lamaline, I say, “Yes, it 
               <br />
               has been made there”; but according to the infor- 
               <br />
               mation furnished by ﬁshermen, they have not got 
               <br />
               that rating. One man took particular care in curing 
               <br />
               his ﬁsh, and he took his fish along and it was 
               <br />
               culled and as he said, it was “picture ﬁsh”, but he 
               <br />
               got no better price than the other man who 
               <br />
               brought in an inferior quality. Therefore I can 
               <br />
               understand the man saying, “Is there any mer- 
               <br />
               chantable ﬁsh?” Whether it is the grading or not 
               <br />
               I cannot say; but according to the information 
               <br />
               furnished me by the ﬁshermen of Lamaline, and 
               <br />
               they are all shore ﬁshermen, they don’t seem to 
               <br />
               be able to get no. I grade. Where the fault lies I 
               <br />
               cannot say, but these are the facts.

               Mr. Job It seems rather a waste of time to spend

               Mr. Job The remedy seems to be some sort of

               Mr. Starkes I think that matter should be dealt 
               <br />
               with in this Convention, because the people will 
               <br />
               know what we are doing on the ﬁsheries. I dis- 
               <br />
               agree with Mr. Job and agree with the letter from 
               <br />
               Lamaline to Mr. Smallwood. The rule is that the 
               <br />
               ﬁsh should be culled Merchantable, Madeira, and 
               <br />
               Thirds. The last two are all the one price to the 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen, and therefore they are not encouraged. 
               <br />
               They can make ﬁsh that’s classiﬁed as Thirds and 
               <br />
               get the same price as they would for Madeira. My 
               <br />
               experience is that it is almost impossible to get a 
               <br />
               no. 1 ﬁsh that will pass inspection.
