               conﬁne the greater part of my talk to a discussion

               of that industry which census statistics tell us 
               <br />
               employs 62% of our people, for isn’t it true that 
               <br />
               the success of the 62% contributes in a large way 
               <br />
               to the success of the 38%? In this I know that very

               <br />

               <br />
               the future of that industry may differ, we both 
               <br />
               believe in Newfoundland as principally a ﬁshing
