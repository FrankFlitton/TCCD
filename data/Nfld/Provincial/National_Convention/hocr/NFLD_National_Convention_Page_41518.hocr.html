               the circumstances, these various reports furnish 
               <br />

               In the course of its deliberations the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion deemed it advisable to send two fact~finding

               delegations abroad; one to London and the other 
               <br />

               <br />
               and reported the result of its three discussions 
               <br />
               with the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs 
               <br />

               <br />
               conversations which took place, and which were 
               <br />
               reported stenographically, were supplied to each

               <br />
               1947, and returned on October 4, 1947. During
