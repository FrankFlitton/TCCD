               I am a little bit disturbed by the Committee’s 
               <br />
               report that they were unable to get the facts from 
               <br />

               <br />
               it. I don’t want them to disclose their dead secrets, 
               <br />
               but they should be able to give us something that 
               <br />
               would be of assistance to us in coming to a full 
               <br />

               difficult it was for you to ﬁnd the facts, you say 
               <br />
               there is an Industrial Statistics Act. Why was it

               not possible for you to go to that department of

               <br />

               Mr. Hickman We approached the department 
               <br />
               that was handling that, and were told that that act 
               <br />
               was put on the books in 1938, and that the Depart~ 
               <br />
               ment of Public Health and Welfare used it for 
               <br />
               acquiring statistics covering the number of 
               <br />
               employees in the various manufacturing con- 
               <br />
               cerns and businesses and their wages. At that time 
               <br />
               there were people on relief, and it was used to 
               <br />
               check the earning and the number of people 
               <br />
               employed. After that period it was not found 
               <br />
               necessary for the department to have those 
               <br />
               figures, as unemployment became unknown due 
               <br />
               to the bases, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">etc.</span> We asked the department if we 
               <br />
               could have this information obtained through the 
               <br />
               act. We were advised that it had been transferred 
               <br />
               to the Department of Public Utilities, and it 
               <br />
               would be in the hands of the Labour Relations 
               <br />
               Ofﬁce. On making inquiries of that department 
               <br />
               we found that they did not know it had been 
               <br />
               cancelled. After a while we found it would be

               under Public Utilities and the Labour Relations 
               <br />
