               railway service so badly that, instead of giving 
               <br />
               money under Lend Lease, instead of giving us the 
               <br />
               money, they merely loaned us the money with 
               <br />
               which to purchase new rolling stock, and which 
               <br />
               we have to repay? This poverty stricken country 
               <br />
               has to borrow money for them.

               Mr. Wild There is a long story to that. We got 
               <br />
               big freights from them. The Americans wanted 
               <br />
               to spend $5 million immediately. We were 
               <br />
               hoping to get something for nothing, and we tried 
               <br />
               to do so. The one thing we would not touch was 
               <br />
               Lend Lease. The Americans wanted us to take 355 
               <br />
               million on that Lease. They said they never met 
               <br />
               anyone before who refused to take money. We 
               <br />
               got the interest down; we got the terms improved; 
               <br />
               we got 2.5%. We just took the amount required 
               <br />
               to ﬁnance the particular scheme which we agreed 
               <br />
               to. There were a lot of freight cars. We did less 
               <br />
               than they wanted us to do. At that time we had 
               <br />
               had a surplus.
