               ing a customs union between this country and the

               entertained, the Canadian government would 
               <br />
               also be interested, and perhaps the discussions 
               <br />
               which would take place might ﬁnally bring about

               a customs union between the United States,

               To do that, of course, it would be necessary 
               <br />
               for us to give consideration to some other method 
               <br />
               of taxation, but the one great benefit of such a

               things that today are entirely beyond their reach 
               <br />
               because of the high prices. It is almost impossible

               to envisage at this time all the results that may be

               achieved by sending a delegation to Washington,

               <br />

               <br />
               beneﬁt all our people by reducing the tariff on our

               Mr. Reddy Mr. Chairman, it has been a source 
               <br />
               of wonder to me why it is that a motion of this

               One of the terms of reference of this Convention

               days of this Convention, when our authority to

               send a delegation to the USA to inquire into trade

               and political relationships with that country was 
               <br />
               brought up, it was referred to the late Chairman

               and the constitutional authority, Professor 
               <br />

               Mr. Chairman That is not correct. You were

               What Professor Wheare and the late Justice Fox

               did say, was that you could send a delegation to 
               <br />
               the United States to discuss the question of 
               <br />

               Mr. Reddy Thank you, sir. I hope this will be

               with the consent of both governments. If there be

               <br />
               kind should have been one of the ﬁrst resolutions 
               <br />
               dealt with and not one of the last.

               It seems to me that there has been an utter lack

               subject. Delegates adopt a hush-hush and “don’t

               <br />
               appeared likely to come up. The Chairman is 
               <br />
               aware, and every other delegate is aware, that in

               establishing relations with the USA over all other 
               <br />
