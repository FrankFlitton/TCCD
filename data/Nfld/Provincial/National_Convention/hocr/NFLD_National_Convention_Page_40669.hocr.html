               thing. When we were compiling the ﬁgures we 
               <br />
               kept the Railway revenues clear of this. We 
               <br />
               brought the Railway out as a separate entity. We 
               <br />
               showed the Railway had a total deﬁcit of $4 
               <br />
               million and that it had to be paid from some 
               <br />
               source. All the deﬁcits from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">192333</span> are also 
               <br />
               shown. What are we talking about, then? We said 
               <br />
               that deﬁcits were paid for out of loans. We did 
               <br />
               not try to cover them up in any way. I object to 
               <br />
               this trying to convey that we left out something... 
               <br />
               There is another point that I want to clear up 
               <br />
               in connection with these revenues referred to by 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood, that the revenues collected are 
               <br />
               not revenues brought in by taxation. True. during 
               <br />
               these periods amounts of money were brought in 
               <br />
               and piled into the same accounts. Now what used 
               <br />
               to happen in die old days, was when we raised a 
               <br />
               loan, that loan was borrowed for speciﬁc pur- 
               <br />
               poses, and no Executive Council could change it 
               <br />
               without it being referred to the House. We estab- 
               <br />
               lished a new account in the bank for the 1928 
               <br />
               loan. The Auditor General had charge of that 
               <br />
               loan, and he knew what speciﬁc purposes that 
               <br />
               loan was to be used for... Today what happens is 
               <br />
               that it is all piled in together and it makes it most 
               <br />
               difﬁcult to follow. We consider that the budgets 
               <br />
               compiled by the present Commissioner for 
               <br />
               Finance are not clear. They do not show what the 
               <br />
               actual cost to the country is.... If I were making 
               <br />
               that budget speech I would point out that here is 
               <br />
               what it takes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">topperate</span> the country, and here is 
               <br />
               how we spent it.... And the capital expenditure 
               <br />
               has to be explained; when the budget is explained 
               <br />
               95% of the people don’t realise that the cost of 
               <br />
               operating the country is much less than is actually 
               <br />
               shown in the budget. Mr. Chairman, in continent 
               <br />
               about how much the people know about this, 
               <br />
               when I started to go into these ﬁgures I had to buy 
               <br />
               one of these Auditor General’s reports, and the 
               <br />
               bookstore told me they only sold seven Auditor 
               <br />
               General’s reports in 12 months, which shows 
               <br />
               how much people could know about it. I realise 
               <br />
               that the government accounts in every country 
               <br />
               are tangled up, but there is nothing in this report 
               <br />
               that is left out as far as I know; if there is anything 
               <br />
               left out, and if we did not pile in all the expendi- 
               <br />
               ture we should have, we have accounted for it by 
               <br />
               capital expenditure... 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman ....It would be a decidedly 
               <br />
               dangerous thing for any member to take any 
               <br />

               <br />
               are not justiﬁed in considering any part of this 
               <br />
               report without reference to the rest... 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I accept the point made by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> 
               <br />
               Cashin. I know that the point I am making is 
               <br />
               covered at one place and another throughout the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">report...</span> But the point 1 am making, and lam sure 
               <br />
               Major Cashin will agree with me, is this: that the 
               <br />
               ﬁgures from 1920 to 1934, on the expenditure 
               <br />
               side, the ﬁgures that are in the Auditor General’s 
               <br />
               reports, are not complete because they do not 
               <br />
               include all ordinary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expenditure.</span> They include 
               <br />
               some of it, but not all of it. But nevertheless the 
               <br />
               Committee took the ﬁgures as they were, and 
               <br />
               here they are. There is another point. Since <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Com~</span> 
               <br />
               mission came here in l934 what we ﬁnd is this: 
               <br />
               that the government, in the Auditor General’s 
               <br />
               report for every year, has given a ﬁgure showing 
               <br />
               every dollar and cent they spent.... That’s OK, but 
               <br />
               now turn over to 1934 up to now in revenue, and 
               <br />
               what do you ﬁnd? You ﬁnd left out money which 
               <br />
               the government had received and which they 
               <br />
               spent, and which is shown in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expenditure...</span> I 
               <br />
               am referring to the advances made from year to 
               <br />
               year by the Colonial Development Fund. True 
               <br />
               that most of these were paid as loans from year 
               <br />
               to year, but when it got around 1940. or 1941 I 
               <br />
               think it was, the British government said, “Since 
               <br />
               your Commission has been out there we have 
               <br />
               advanced you every year so much money from 
               <br />
               the Colonial Development Fund. It now runs up 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1198-10</span> million. We are going to give you that. 
               <br />
               It is an outright gift.” ThatColonial Development 
               <br />
               Fund money is included in the expenditure side 
               <br />
               here. My point is that these receipts of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern</span> 
               <br />
               ment from the Colonial Development Fund ought 
               <br />
               to be included on the revenue side. 
               <br />
               Mr. Cashin No. That’s where the quarrel started 
               <br />
               before. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Yes, and it’s a matter of inter- 
               <br />
               pretation, or opinion. The facts are clear, and we 
               <br />
               have given our opinions on it. We differ in our 
               <br />
               opinions on it.... My opinion is that the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment of Newfoundland should show on the 
               <br />
               revenue side every dollar, every cent, that they 
               <br />
               have received, and on the expenditure side every 
               <br />
               dollar and every cent they spent. How else are we 
               <br />
               going to know where we stand as a country? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, I am about to take my seat, but 
               <br />
               before doing so I would like to say this: that I 
               <br />
               happen to have been born in Newfoundland. My
