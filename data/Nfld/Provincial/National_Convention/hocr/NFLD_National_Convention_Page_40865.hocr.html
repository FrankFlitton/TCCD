               ments of money made each month to the children 
               <br />
               of Canada. There are in Canada, under the age of 
               <br />
               16, 3.5 million children. Every child in Canada 
               <br />
               under the age of 16 is entitled to receive, every 
               <br />
               month, a cheque for $5 up to the age of six years 
               <br />

               <br />
               month for every child. Where there are five 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. Miller I have an idea that Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               is reading from a book which is not ofﬁcial, it is 
               <br />
               probably nothing better than a magazine. We are 
               <br />
               not going to accept information from a magazine. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Turn to volume 1, page 92, 
               <br />
               section 47....2 This which I was reading is a table 
               <br />
               showing the family allowances in Canada and 
               <br />
               showing how they are reduced after the fourth 
               <br />
               child. This is an ofﬁcial document compiled by 
               <br />
               National Health and Welfare in Canada and 
               <br />
               shows family allowances. What are family al- 
               <br />
               lowances? Family allowances are regular cash
