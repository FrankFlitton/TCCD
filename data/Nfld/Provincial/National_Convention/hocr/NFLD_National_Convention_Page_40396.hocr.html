               18 March, 1947. 
               <br />
               [On the suggestion of the Chairman [t was moved 
               <br />
               by Mr. Jackman, seconded by Mr. Casht'n and 
               <br />
               carried that the Convention resolve itself into a 
               <br />
               committee of the whole to consider the com- 
               <br />
               munication, and elect by secret ballot a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegw</span> 
               <br />
               tion to proceed to England pursuant to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr,</span> 
               <br />
               Hollett’s resolution of February <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">281]</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman The most expeditious way to 
               <br />
               conduct this election will be in the manner in 
               <br />
               which we conducted it some time <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ago,</span> There will 
               <br />
               be no nominations, but each member will vote for 
               <br />
               six members of this Convention, whomever he 
               <br />
               chooses, and the six that stand at the top of the 
               <br />
               list will constitute the delegation. 
               <br />
               Mr. Job We elect six men, but there is always a 
               <br />
               possibility of one of those not being available 
               <br />
               when the time comes to go. Would it be possible 
               <br />
               to elect a couple to act as alternates? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman That is a matter for the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion to consider. Of course we could always meet 
               <br />
               again if anyone was ill or otherwise unable to 
               <br />
               attend. 
               <br />
               Mr. Bailey I wonder if the next two highest on 
               <br />
               the list could not be taken automatically? We 
               <br />
               could keep count of them, and one would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">auto»</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'matically</span> step into the place of the other man if 
               <br />
               anyone fell <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman The only objection I see to the 
               <br />
               suggestion would be that it is necessary to keep 
               <br />
               a record of votes cast, and it is usual to destroy 
               <br />
               the ballots immediately after the count has taken 
               <br />
               place. It is not usual to disclose the number of 
               <br />
               votes polled by each member of the Convention. 
               <br />
               Perhaps some members may not care to have the 
               <br />
               vote they polled disclosed. I can understand that. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hickman Well, you just have the first eight 
               <br />
               recorded in the order of the total number of votes 
               <br />
               each had. The ballots could be destroyed but the 
               <br />
               records could be kept of the eight. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman We can do that if someone will 
               <br />
               make a motion to that effect. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hickman I make a motion to that effect. 
               <br />
               Mr. Reddy I second that. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman The motion is that the first eight 
               <br />
               names on the ballot be recorded, the last two to
