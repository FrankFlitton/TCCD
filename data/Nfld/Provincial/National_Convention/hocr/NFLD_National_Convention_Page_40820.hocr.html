               position of our capital assets throughout the

               <br />
               homes and other equipment and I would have 
               <br />
               pointed out this —— and this may be a strange thing 
               <br />
               to bring in an Economic Report — the develop- 
               <br />
               ment of the radio. Radio is not just a means of 
               <br />
               communication. If you can use your means of 
               <br />
               communication to further the enlightenment of 
               <br />
               the people, you have created an asset which is 
               <br />
               something you did not have before; just as you 
               <br />
               say our health and education are assets which 
               <br />
               ought to be brought into questions of political 
               <br />
               economy. I would point out something else which 
               <br />
               has helped our economy, that is the development 
               <br />
               of trade unions and the development of the co- 
               <br />
               operative <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">movement.</span> Not only on its ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               and business side, but in the spirit which it is 
               <br />
               bringing about in our country and the education 
               <br />
               which it is doing. I would also add a word about 
               <br />
               the service industries to which nobody seemed to 
               <br />
               have paid much attention. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               In all, the conclusion reached from my point 
               <br />
               of view is that we are considerably better off than 
               <br />
               we were in normal times, and much better off 
               <br />
               than we were in 1934, the date given in our terms 
               <br />
               of reference. In saying that, I am well aware of 
               <br />
               the fact that if we look too far into the future, it 
               <br />
               may be that Newfoundland will strike hard times. 
               <br />
               The people of this country are not fools. They 
               <br />
               know that as well as I do. And when some people 
               <br />
               say they want the truth, they know it is the truth. 
               <br />
               They also want to know about our chances of the 
               <br />
               future. I think the Economic Report gives that 
               <br />
               very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reasonably,*although</span> as Mr. Burry said, it 
               <br />
               might have had some shadows put in it. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Having done that, I would ask myself, “Is this 
               <br />
               economy of ours the result of the war?” I would 
               <br />
               say, “Yes, to a large extent”. It is also the result 
               <br />
               of our having got back to our normal export 
               <br />
               position. I would add that when the war is over 
               <br />
               you go into a peace economy and it may be 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               entirely changed; because of what happened in 
               <br />
               the war, that peace economy may take a long time 
               <br />
               to settle back into the condition it was before the 
               <br />
               war started.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Having done that I would enquire into the 
               <br />
               relationship of our economy with government 
               <br />
               expenditure. As I see it, and reducing it to its 
               <br />
               simplest terms, it is this: ifa group of people have 
               <br />
               some way of producing wealth which is 
               <br />
               measured by money, they have two courses open 
               <br />
               to them. One (which is as old as the ﬁrst fog) is 
               <br />
               for each individual man and family to do things 
               <br />
               for himself, like looking after his own sick, 
               <br />
               educating his own children, building his own 
               <br />
               roads and other things which have to be done in 
               <br />
               order to make existence possible. Or he might 
               <br />
               say, we have a lot of things in common — we 
               <br />
               have education, health, roads, protection of 
               <br />
               property and of persons, we have communica- 
               <br />
               tions. All these things we have in common. Now, 
               <br />
               out of this we can produce, either as individuals 
               <br />
               or as corporations, or co—operatives, we can 
               <br />
               produce a certain amount of wealth, which can be 
               <br />
               measured in money, out of which we take so 
               <br />
               much to give -—- not to some big ogre, as some 
               <br />
               people look upon the government, any govern- 
               <br />
               ment, but to ourselves —— so that we can spend it 
               <br />
               on the things which we have in common, and 
               <br />
               relieve ourselves of the private and individual 
               <br />
               need of doing it. That is why I say it does not 
               <br />
               make much difference where you set the point of 
               <br />
               revenue and expenditure as long as you base it on 
               <br />
               your taxable capacity, or your own ability to 
               <br />
               produce that which allows people to live and pay 
               <br />
               for the things they have in common. In assessing 
               <br />
               our position in relation to 1934, I would state 
               <br />
               quite frankly one thing, I would say from 1920—33 
               <br />
               — what is commonly known as the “roaring 
               <br />
               twenties” — we in Newfoundland, in common 
               <br />
               with other countries in the world, went on a binge 
               <br />
               of extravagance; we built for ourselves overheads 
               <br />
               which we were not entitled to build up and for 
               <br />
               which we could not pay.... 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Looked at in one way, our public debt and its 
               <br />
               burden brought Newfoundland to her knees be- 
               <br />

               <br />
               5% and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">5W%,</span> and I would point out today we 
               <br />
               have $80 million with interest payment halved, 
               <br />
               because we are now paying 3%, therefore we do 
               <br />
               not have to carry the burden of $21/2 million 
               <br />
