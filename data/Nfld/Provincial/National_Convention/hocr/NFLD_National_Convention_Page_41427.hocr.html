               known to be ardent confederates by this time -- 
               <br />
               that is an inescapable conclusion. I do not want 
               <br />
               it to be misconstrued that you are Speaking under

               only deal with the points as they are delivered. 
               <br />
               Mr. Penney Since I cannot convey the meaning 
               <br />
               I intended to convey, I will have to do the best I 
               <br />
               can. Now that we have reached the crossroads, 
               <br />
               surely it is a time when self-respect alone should 
               <br />
               compel us to stand ﬁrm. It is your country and 
               <br />
               mine, where in the outports every man and 
               <br />
               woman is comparatively free from special taxes; 
               <br />
               where we can obtain our living from land and sea 
               <br />
               unhampered by periodic calls from tax collectors. 
               <br />
               Why then give up your life~long freedom because 
               <br />
               champions of confederation ask you to do so? 
               <br />
               When you must feel in your heart and soul there 
               <br />
               is something behind the move? I dare not do 
               <br />
               anything or say anything to knowingly harm our 
               <br />
               future prospects, for posterity will eventually 
               <br />

               confederation, it is a contract of sale and there is 
               <br />
               no stigma to be attached to the sense in which you

               use them. I want to tell this Convention to act 
               <br />
               warily. Elect your own government ﬁrst and 
               <br />
               foremost, controlled by the people of Newfound— 
               <br />
               land, and represented by a body of selected New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders, so that you may control the keys.

               Good men and true with adequate control of our

               treasury. The form of government we now have 
               <br />
               ——- am I allowed to refer to that?

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Penney I will end it up this way. There are 
               <br />
               four days to go before this Convention dies, and 
               <br />
               I have no regret about that whatsoever. But I will 
               <br />
               not likely have another chance to talk to this 
               <br />
               Convention as a body, so I want to make a few 
               <br />
               remarks concerning the history of the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion, in closing. Now that our term of service here 
               <br />
               is approaching its end, for which I have no regret 
               <br />
               because it has lasted many months longer than it 
               <br />
               should have, and has been swerved from its path 
               <br />
               of duty because of the projection of controversial 
               <br />
               political questions in the early stages of our 
               <br />
               studies of Newfoundland affairs. This, however, 
               <br />
               is past history. Now as we come to the end of our 
               <br />
               service here may I say in closing that it was a 
               <br />
               great privilege to meet and know the delegates of 
               <br />
               this Convention, most of whom I had not met or 
               <br />
               known before. 
               <br />

               The sad side of this get-together was almost at 
               <br />
               the very beginning of our Convention sessions 
               <br />
               when our revered and respected Chairman, in the 
               <br />
               person of the late Judge Fox, was claimed by 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">death.</span> The suddenness of his passing shocked us 
               <br />
               all, for we knew we had lost a Chairman of 
               <br />
               outstanding fitness for the tasks ahead, an 
               <br />
               eminent judge, whose guiding hand and sound 
               <br />
               judgement was recognised in the loyalty and 
               <br />
               respect of all delegates. May his soul rest in peace 
               <br />
               as his revered memory lives on. Then, too, this 
               <br />
               Convention lost another outstanding public 
               <br />
               leaderin the person of Mr. K. M. Brown who was
