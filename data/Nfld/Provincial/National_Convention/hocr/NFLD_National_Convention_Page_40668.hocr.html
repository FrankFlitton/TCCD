               had to cover their expenses and what did they do? 
               <br />
               They went out and they borrowed money; every 
               <br />
               year they borrowed... In all, $60 million. That is

               what the various governments borrowed from 
               <br />
               1920 to 1933. Now, it may be held that the reason 
               <br />
               they borrowed was because they were not taking 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               was well spent. It was spent on capital account to

               <br />
               facilities and conveniences for the people; it was 
               <br />
               well spent, it may be argued. Let us take a look

               <br />
               First of all, half a million was spent to pay off 
               <br />
               temporary loans for the railway; $1 million was 
               <br />
               spent on other railway purposes; half a million on 
               <br />
               public works ——~ spent on a per capita basis 
               <br />
               throughout the country; half a million on special 
               <br />
               public works, guaranteeing ﬁshery supply, half a 
               <br />
               million on railway operating deﬁcit. $5.5 million 
               <br />
               out of $6 million. You could not say it was spent 
               <br />
               on capital account; it was spent on account of the 
               <br />
               ordinary purposes of the government, to carry on 
               <br />
               the government. In 1922 they borrowed another 
               <br />
               $6 million. Did they spend that on capital <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aC&lt;</span> 
               <br />
               count? They spent $1.75 million on the railway; 
               <br />
               Hall’s Bay road (special district grant), $665,000; 
               <br />
               relief for unemployed, $128,500; roads and 
               <br />
               bridges, $1.5 million; relief work, $1 million; 
               <br />
               able-bodied pauper relief, $60,000. $5 .5 out of $6 
               <br />
               million for ordinary purposes of the country. No 
               <br />
               capital account. Next year they borrowed $3.5 
               <br />
               million. $800,000 was spent to pay the deﬁcit on 
               <br />
               1921 and 1922; $300,000 was spent on railway

               the days of responsible government, whenever

               the same thing. They said the Railway was a 
               <br />
               government department and they ran it at a loss 
               <br />
               every year. What do we know about operating 
               <br />
               losses on the Railway under the heading ‘Ordi~

               know it was wrong on the part of the various 
               <br />
               governments and Auditors General — it was 
               <br />
               wrong not to show all the expenditure on ordinary 
               <br />
