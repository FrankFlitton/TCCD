               valuable, but many of these people were already 
               <br />
               overworked and the amount of help they could

               I agree with Mr. Hollett’s remarks in connec- 
               <br />
               tion with the second paragraph on page 10. It 
               <br />
               seems strange to me also that there should be in 
               <br />
               existence since 1938 an Industrial Statistics Act, 
               <br />
               which however appears to be more honoured in 
               <br />
               the ignoring than in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">implementation”.</span> 1 
               <br />
               strongly support the Committee’s recommenda~ 
               <br />
               tion that it be implemented, after careful revision 
               <br />
               which would produce some worthwhile changes. 
               <br />
               In this regard, I must add a few words, on the 
               <br />
               same matter which was one of the ﬁrst obstacles 
               <br />
               met by the Local Industries Committee The 
               <br />
               Committee says, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“...we</span> might say that from the 
               <br />
               outset we have been very much handicapped by 
               <br />
               the lack of ﬁgures and statistics in relation to 
               <br />
               employment, production, invested value and 
               <br />
               other ﬁgures regarding the secondary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">industries.</span> 
               <br />
               There is a complete lack of the necessary 
               <br />
               figures”. That last brief sentence has now become 
               <br />
               the ofﬁcial refrain of all committees; for, as was 
               <br />
               pointed out, the Mining Committee has been so 
               <br />
               handicapped, and it is no secret that the Public 
               <br />
               Health and Welfare Committee, of which I am a 
               <br />
               member, has been up against the same problem 
               <br />
               In the debate on the supplementary report of the 
               <br />
               Forestry Committee and in previous reports of 
               <br />
               other committees, the same thing is found; the 
               <br />
               same abysmal ignorance of the various statistics 
               <br />
               that go to make up what Mr. Smallwood has been 
               <br />
               so much concerned with — namely, the gross 
               <br />
               national <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">product,</span> It is one of the great sins of 
               <br />
               omission of which the present government, with 
               <br />
               its 13 years of undisputed authority, has been 
               <br />
               guilty. I note too with some disappointment the 
               <br />
               lack of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cooperation</span> that the Committee had to 
               <br />
               contend with in connection with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span> 
               <br />
               naires which were issued to various local ﬁrms 
               <br />
               for completion. It is regrettable that they did not 
               <br />
               consider the matter of sufﬁcient national impor- 
               <br />
               tance to supply the information desired, and it is 
               <br />
               to be hoped that the country will make note of

               Only one other observation would I make. 
               <br />
               That is with reference to the rather sweeping 
               <br />
               remarks in connection with the figurative burn~ 
               <br />

               <br />
               people so employed out of the treasury. I am 
               <br />
               aware that no one means that literally, but saying 
               <br />
               it does create a false impression in the case for 
               <br />
               local industries. 1 do not agree, any more than 
               <br />
               other speakers, with excessively high protective 
               <br />
               tariffs, but I do agree that local industries should 
               <br />
               have some protection, though within reason. That 
               <br />
               is a matter which requires much investigation as 
               <br />
               the Committee has said, and until such time as it 
               <br />
               has been thoroughly gone into, we should not so 
               <br />
               sweepingly condemn an avenue of employment 
               <br />
               which takes care of a fairly large section of the 
               <br />
               community. The process of reduction of duties 
               <br />
               should be a gradual one, over a period, so that

               All these comments have dealt with the ﬁrst

               part of the report for to my mind it is the only 
               <br />
               controversial part; the second portion which con~

               accomplished a variety of excellent projects, that

               private enterprise, here is an example of how 
               <br />
               these two extremes can be more or less reconciled
