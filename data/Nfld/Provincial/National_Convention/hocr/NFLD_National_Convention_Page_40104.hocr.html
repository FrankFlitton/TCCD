               Our danger, so it seems to me, is that of 
               <br />
               nursing delusions of grandeur. We remember the 
               <br />
               stories of small states that valiantly preserved 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               fact that comparison of Newfoundland with them 
               <br />
               is ludicrous. We are not a nation. We are merely

               <br />
               of the 19th century when they advocated cutting

               Newfoundland, the same Newfoundland 
               <br />
               patriotism, that inspired their agitation then, 
               <br />
               would now, if they lived, drive them to carry the 
               <br />
               agitation to its logical conclusion, to take the next 
               <br />
               step of linking Newfoundland closely to the 
               <br />
