               The “Impact Upon Disease” has been tackled 
               <br />
               seriously and the department deserves commen- 
               <br />
               dations for their efforts in this direction. But the 
               <br />
               lack of statistics is inexcusable when the whole 
               <br />
               country knows this division was amply staffed to 
               <br />
               keep them. It is a hopeful sign to ﬁnd that tuber— 
               <br />
               culosis is on the decrease and it is common 
               <br />
               knowledge that the Dominions Ofﬁce has always 
               <br />
               taken a serious View of the effect of this dread 
               <br />
               disease upon our people. The noteworthy con- 
               <br />
               tribution of the TB Association is evi-dence of 
               <br />
               our deep consciousness of our responsibility as 
               <br />
               citizens. The work of the Division of Visual 
               <br />
               Education as a means of combating this silent 
               <br />
               menace will contribute in no small way toward 
               <br />
               checking at the source the unnecessary spreading 
               <br />
               of the disease. We have given due credit for what 
               <br />
               has been done but we cannot overlook the cost. 
               <br />
               The amount of $6 million plus the Public Works 
               <br />
               expenditure for the department is a terriﬁc burden 
               <br />
               for this little country to carry. In fact under nor- 
               <br />
               mal conditions we cannot hope to survive under 
               <br />
               such a load.

               <br />
