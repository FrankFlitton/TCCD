               foundland have had to contend with economic 
               <br />
               factors much less favourable than some 
               <br />
               countries. Of course we ate dole in New— 
               <br />
               foundland during the depression -— the world ate 
               <br />
               dole. In Europe and in the Americas, a hundred 
               <br />
               million human beings ate dole, and there are 
               <br />
               many eating it today. Some of the ﬁnest cities in 
               <br />
               the world have their cracked pavements, sagging 
               <br />
               roofs and tumbledown shacks. These things are 
               <br />
               there for anyone to see, this position is not 
               <br />
               peculiar to Newfoundland. A political change 
               <br />
               cannot bring forth economic reform and freedom 
               <br />
               from want. The resources of this country are as 
               <br />
               God made them, and any change in the form of 
               <br />
               government will not bring a change in climate. It 
               <br />
               will not bring more ﬁsh to our shores, nor make 
               <br />
               the day longer, nor will it bring us any nearer to 
               <br />
               the great centres of supply. No, Mr. Chairman, a 
               <br />
               particular form of government will not give us 
               <br />
               economic security. It has been stressed here that 
               <br />
               there can be no political freedom without 
               <br />
               economic security. Where can this be found, this 
               <br />
               political freedom coupled with economic 
               <br />
               security? It has never existed. Are we to receive 
               <br />
               this gift overnight? Trash and nonsense! If we 
               <br />
               want political freedom with some measure of 
               <br />
               economic security, we shall have to dig and sweat 
               <br />
               for it. It is the only way. Life was more simple at 
               <br />
               one time, Mr. Chairman, it was not the tremen- 
               <br />
               dously complex thing we know today, and we 
               <br />
               should remember that any individual solution to 
               <br />
               a local problem is a deﬁnite contribution to the 
               <br />
               solution of national problems, which are cum- 
               <br />
               ulative. If we want democracy in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               tomorrow, we must live it today. 
               <br />
               Fundamentally the Newfoundland scene has 
               <br />
               not changed, but we are slowly moving away 
               <br />
               from old methods of doing things, perhaps even 
               <br />
               without our knowing it; we are moving through 
               <br />
               a transitional period in this present century; the 
               <br />
               whole financial, government and economic 
               <br />
               structure of our island has been vastly changed; 
               <br />
               we have to adapt ourselves to new world condi- 
               <br />
               tions. And before we take one step forward into 
               <br />
               the future, we Newfoundland people must see to 
               <br />
               it that we have restored to us our hard-won rights 
               <br />
               as a separate unit in the Empire. In closing, sir, I 
               <br />
               say that we must ﬁnd for ourselves a framework 
               <br />
               of philosophy of life that will make it possible for 
               <br />
               us to approach and solve our problems in an 
               <br />
               intelligent and therefore democratic manner.

               Mr. Harrington Mr. Chairman, I have waited a 
               <br />
               long time and in patience for this day. I can still 
               <br />
               remember Friday, February 16, 1934. I had just 
               <br />
               passed my 17th birthday, and like most young 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders of the day who had ﬁnished 
               <br />
               school the preceding June, I was more taken up 
               <br />
               with the problem of what to do next than with 
               <br />
               affairs of state. Nonetheless, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Chairman, I had 
               <br />
               sufﬁcient sense of destiny to realise on that bleak 
               <br />
               February day 14 years ago, that something 
               <br />
               momentous was happening which, though I was 
               <br />
               not aware of it at the moment, was to have great 
               <br />
               meaning in time in my own personal life. I 
               <br />
               sensed, sir, then, that it was a great historical 
               <br />
               moment, and in a way, perhaps, I was a living 
               <br />
               symbol of the belief then held by a great section 
               <br />
               of our people, that the system of government that 
               <br />
               day being inaugurated in Newfoundland was des- 
               <br />
               tined to open up a new era for this country. This 
               <br />
               sense of destiny and that faith — more conscious 
               <br />
               than expressed — caused me to wander that 
               <br />
               afternoon to the vicinity of the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               Hotel to gaze at the notables as they arrived in 
               <br />
               their cars, and vanished into the impressive por- 
               <br />
               tals of that structure on their way to the Ballroom, 
               <br />
               where the deed was to be done.

               The papers said the weather was ideal, but I 
               <br />
               know better. It was cold and bleak, a grey 
               <br />
               February day as I recall it, and it has seemed to 
               <br />
               me, in every day that has passed thereafter that I 
               <br />
               think upon that scene, that a greyness comes into 
               <br />
               my soul as well. For you see, sir, I was young 
               <br />
               then, green; I knew little of governments and less 
               <br />
               of politics. The only recollection I can summon 
               <br />
               to my mind of the days of parliamentary govem- 
               <br />
               ment in this island is a recollection of the general 
               <br />
               election of 1932, when the Alderdice government 
               <br />
               was elected, whose manifesto said in effect that 
               <br />
               it would seek the appointment of a royal commis- 
               <br />
               sion to study the situation of the country and 
               <br />
               recommend as to the alteration of the existing 
               <br />
               constitution. but that no such recommendations 
               <br />
               should be carried into effect without an appeal to 
               <br />
               the people. Well, in June, 1932, I was more 
               <br />
               interested in the Council of Higher Education’s 
               <br />
               examination papers for grade ten, than I was in 
               <br />
               the personnel and manifestoes of the contending 
               <br />
               parties in that election. I can still vaguely recall 
               <br />
               the indifference with which I and my companions 
               <br />
               passed shops and ofﬁces in whose windows long 
               <br />
               lists gave the hour—to-hour results of the polling.
