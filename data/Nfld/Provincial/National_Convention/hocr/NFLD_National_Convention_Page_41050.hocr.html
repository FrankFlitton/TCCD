               I think it is common knowledge that a lot of

               roads were commenced this year and will be 
               <br />
               ﬁnished next year; and that in the course of the 
               <br />
               next few years the mileage of motorable roads in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland is going to increase steadily and 
               <br />
               considerably, which, in view of the fact that last 
               <br />
               year the government took in $900,000 in gasoline 
               <br />
               taxes, and in this current year will touch the $1 
               <br />
               million mark, it is pretty conservative, for the first 
               <br />
               four years of union, to put gasoline revenue at 
               <br />
               only $1 million, and for the second four years to 
               <br />
               stick another quarter of a million on it and say 
               <br />
               that revenue from gasoline will increase in New— 
               <br />
               foundland between 1947 and 1955 only by 
               <br />
               $250,000. So I hold that it is a most cautious and 
               <br />
               conservative estimate, and it would not surprise 
               <br />
               me at all, not at all if, by 1955, revenue to the

               province from gasoline, for use by motorists, 
               <br />
               would be up to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$l.5</span> million, rather than $1.25

               <br />
               the result of it was an exchange of questions
