               I have heard some strange pronouncements 
               <br />
               voiced both in and out of this chamber within the 
               <br />
               past couple of months, but none more curious 
               <br />
               than the assertions that Newfoundlandcrs were 
               <br />
               lazy and that family allowances were immoral, 
               <br />
               degrading and would result in people ceasing to 
               <br />
               earn a living. The ﬁrst of these statements I pass 
               <br />
               by as beneath contempt. But the latter cannot be 
               <br />
               allowed to go unchallenged. Family allowances 
               <br />
               are paid by the Canadian government to every 
               <br />
               child in Canada (and that would include New- 
               <br />
               foundland if our people chose confederation) 
               <br />
               from birth to the age of 16 years. The amount 
               <br />
               varies according to age from $5 to $8 per month 
               <br />
               for each child, or from $60 to $96 per year per 
               <br />
               child. The purpose is obvious. It is to ensure that 
               <br />
               every child in Canada shall have as far as possible 
               <br />
               appropriate food, sufficient clothing and educa- 
               <br />
               tion, notwithstanding that its parents are not 
               <br />
               prosperous. And, in order that the stigma of 
               <br />
               pauperism might not attach to the payments, 
               <br />
               these allowances are payable to all children, rich 
               <br />
               and poor alike.

               family allowances. On the contrary, they have 
               <br />
               hailed them as one of the most Christian pieces 
               <br />
               of legislation ever placed upon the statute book 
               <br />

               this eminently Christian and moral protection of

               more than half our provincial revenue, it will be

               provincial services, both public and social,

               <br />
