               taxes will be removed if government re-

               elected, and the last little bit of land taxation in 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island will be gone for the next 
               <br />
               two or three years.

               I also wrote the Premier of New Brunswick, 
               <br />
               and he said he was having the information 
               <br />
               prepared for me, but so far it has not been sent. 
               <br />
               Now let’s look at Nova Scotia, with a population 
               <br />
               of 620,000, just about double the population of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, and what do they collect? The 
               <br />
               Government of Nova Scotia collects less than 
               <br />
               $100,000 out of a total of $22,500,000, less than 
               <br />
               half a cent out of every dollar of taxes they collect 
               <br />
               in Nova Scotia. So if we become a province, and 
               <br />
               we have our provincial government, number one, 
               <br />
               no property tax from the Government of Canada. 
               <br />
               Number two, no property tax from the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment of Newfoundland, unless the Government 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland itself on its own free will 
               <br />
               should want to put on a property tax, and if they 
               <br />
               should decide to do it, which is very unlikely, as 
               <br />
               I can’t imagine any government getting elected 
               <br />

               in Newfoundland if they put on a property tax, 
               <br />
               unless it would be one on the absentee landlords. 
               <br />
               If I had to do it, it would go right on top of that 
               <br />
               land that’s owned by absentee landlords who live 
               <br />
               in England, or the States, or Canada. I certainly 
               <br />
               would put a tax on that, but except for that I can’t 
               <br />
               imagine a Newfoundland government for one 
               <br />
               moment even considering putting a tax on 
               <br />
               property in this island, but if they did, and if they 
               <br />
               followed the example of Nova Scotia, what 
               <br />
               would they collect? $50,000 a year, if they fol- 
               <br />
               lowed Nova Scotia. We, with half the population 
               <br />
               of Nova Scotia, would collect $50,000 a year. 
               <br />
               That is the great argument that the anti-con- 
               <br />
               federates have up their sleeve to bamboozle the 
               <br />
               people of this country.

               myself to a point about which there has been a 
               <br />
               considerable amount of misunderstanding, and 
               <br />
               even to this moment there is a considerable 
               <br />
               amount of misunderstanding, and this is the 
               <br />
               point: if we go into confederation and become a 
               <br />
               province, and have our own House of Assembly, 
               <br />
               will that provincial government he forced to put 
               <br />
               a property tax on the Newfoundland people? And 
               <br />
               the answer is, “No, it will not”, and furthermore, 
               <br />
               if anyone asks is it likely that they will do it even 
               <br />
               if they are not forced to do it, the answer is, “No, 
               <br />
               it is not likely. Not any legislature elected by the
