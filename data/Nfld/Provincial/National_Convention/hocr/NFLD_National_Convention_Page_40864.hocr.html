               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood It is not. Could someone tell me

               how many inspectors of the Department of Public 
               <br />
               Health and Welfare in the month of October, 
               <br />
               visited the factories of St. John’s, and saw how 
               <br />
               many toilets, rest-rooms and safety devices were 
               <br />
               provided?... I go further now. If Mr. Jackman 
               <br />
               were here, I would ask him to tell me what 
               <br />
               inspection has been made of the mines at Bell 
               <br />
               Island under the Mines Regulation Act. I would 
               <br />
               ask Mr. Hollett, who represents Grand Falls, in- 
               <br />
               cluding Buchans, to tell me what government 
               <br />
               inspector has gone down in the mines under the 
               <br />
               Mines Regulations Act to inspect the mines. We 
               <br />
               have no such inspectors in Newfoundland. We 
               <br />
               have a dead act. There is no enforcement of 
               <br />
               industrial health. Except insofar as a few individ- 
               <br />
               ual employers, such as the AND Company, the 
               <br />
               Buchans Mining Company, and Bowaters and a

               few here in town, except for these the health and 
               <br />
               the industrial conditions of employees, and the 
               <br />
               health conditions of employees, are completely 
               <br />
               ignored. Now let me go on. I must insist on

               Mr. Hollett May I say one word? When a ques-

               <br />

               <br />
               him to reply by asking you another question?

               things in any so-called civilised country. The

               in which the Government of Newfoundland is

               failing completely to protect public health in the

               inspection of locally killed meat (pork and beef),

               I am talking about. Now I won’t delay the House.

               <br />
               bit ahead. If he wants to content himself to 
               <br />
               believe that even proportionately the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment of Newfoundland provides public services 
               <br />
               to the people of Newfoundland as Canada does 
               <br />
               for her people, he is entirely welcome to believe 
               <br />
               it. If he thinks for a moment that the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland will believe it, then he is welcome 
               <br />
               to his belief. I say now that if he has been in the 
               <br />
               government civil service for 18 years, for almost 
               <br />
               twice 18 years I have made a very close study of 
               <br />
               public and governmental affairs in this country, 
               <br />
               and l have travelled throughout the length and 
               <br />
               breadth of this island, and I know what the public 
               <br />
               services are in Newfoundland. I know what the 
               <br />
               government does for the people, few know it 
               <br />
               better, and anyone who is going to set out to

               persuade me that the Government of Canada does 
               <br />
               not provide far better and far more public services
