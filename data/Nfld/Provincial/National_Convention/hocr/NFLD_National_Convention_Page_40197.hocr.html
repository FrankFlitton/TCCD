               Mr. Penney As I understand it, we are talking 
               <br />
               about the appointing of a member of this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion as Chairman, and it seems to me that two 
               <br />
               outstanding matters should concern us most. One 
               <br />
               is the qualiﬁcations of the Chairman, and the 
               <br />
               other is his impartiality. In regard to the member 
               <br />
               of this Convention named, all members here 
               <br />
               present know that we had differences in debate, 
               <br />
               but as far as I am concerned, it is over and 
               <br />
               forgotten. I listened very attentively to the ele- 
               <br />
               quent tribute which Mr. Bradley made to the late 
               <br />
               Judge Fox, and I do not think any man of good 
               <br />
               common sense could make the statements that 
               <br />
               Mr. Bradley made in a public session unless he 
               <br />
               meant it sincerely. Apart altogether from the 
               <br />
               voting matter, I do not feel myself competent to 
               <br />
               discuss that at this time. If the feeling of the 
               <br />
               Convention is unanimous, I rather think that 
               <br />
               Mr. Bradley would make a suitable and satisfac- 
               <br />
               tory Chairman.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Hillier When I spoke just now, I had no 
               <br />
               idea that any member would take that respon— 
               <br />
               sibility. I am glad that one of us is prepared to 
               <br />
               take that responsibility. A good many of you have 
               <br />
               known Mr. Bradley a long time; I have known 
               <br />
               him only since I came here to this Convention... 
               <br />
               Should he be appointed, he will not be able to 
               <br />
               enter as fully into debates on the various ques- 
               <br />
               tions as he would like to, but maybe Mr. Bradley 
               <br />
               would be in a position to forego some of these 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">things</span> I do not think it would be amiss if 
               <br />
               Mr. Bradley would express himself on this par- 
               <br />
               ticular point. Personally, I am prepared to vote 
               <br />
               for Mr. Bradley..., I would like to see everything 
               <br />
               working in harmony, and I do not see any reason 
               <br />
               why a member of this Convention, who is 
               <br />
               capable, could not be appointed as chairman to 
               <br />
               guide our destinies in a satisfactory manner. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Are you ready for the question? 
               <br />
               It is proposed by Major Cashin and seconded by 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne that Mr. Bradley he recom—

               <br />
               voting. The act, in addition to providing for the 
               <br />
               appointment of a Supreme Court judge, provides 
               <br />
               also that judge shall not have the right to vote,

               of the Convention also provide that that Chair— 
               <br />

               <br />
               Chairman to vote, it is necessary ﬁrst to amend
