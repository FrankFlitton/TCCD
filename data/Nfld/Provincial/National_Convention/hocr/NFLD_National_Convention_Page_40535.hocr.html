               <br />
               Mr. Vardy I would like to clear up the question 
               <br />
               of the tariff on machinery for the making of brick. 
               <br />
               I consulted the Customs and found they reduced 
               <br />
               the rate on power machinery from 45% to 20%. 
               <br />
               There is no provision in the tariff for free entry; 
               <br />
               it would have to be approved by the government. 
               <br />
               For special machinery coming in, if the duty is 
               <br />
               over $100 and the matter was approved by the 
               <br />
               Board of Customs, it comes in duty <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">free...</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood ....With respect to Bell Island, 
               <br />
               the Mining Regulations Act of 1908 governs that. 
               <br />
               The return of value is the value of the crude 
               <br />
               material. At Bell Island the figure would be the 
               <br />
               value of the ore when it is raised to the surface, 
               <br />
               irrespective of operation of equipment on the 
               <br />
               surface, or transporting it on the surface. The 
               <br />
               weighing is not done at Bell Island but at Sydney. 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne Thank you for the explanation. 
               <br />
               That ﬁgure $2.55 does not reflect the true present 
               <br />
               day value of ore. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins It is greater this year. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood The fact of the matter is that the 
               <br />
               ﬁgures showing the value of iron ore exported 
               <br />
               from Newfoundland, we might as well tear up. It 
               <br />
               is the value taken up and laid on the surface, not 
               <br />
               the export <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">value.</span> My complaint is with the Cus- 
               <br />
               toms. If you will recall, every budget speech 
               <br />
               would contain the values of iron ore exported 
               <br />
               from Newfoundland, and not one word was 
               <br />
               worth the paper it was written on. It was a sort of 
               <br />
               nebulous value of the ore as it comes out of the 
               <br />
               ground and not the export value. What country in 
               <br />
               the world does not know the value of its exports? 
               <br />
               The only thing we have in Newfoundland to 
               <br />
               enable us to determine the amount of wealth, the 
               <br />
               gross national production, is our figures of ex- 
               <br />
               ports. Here is one where our ﬁgures are inac~ 
               <br />
               curate. 
               <br />
               Mr.Ashbourne I understand this company or 
               <br />
               other companies associated with Bell Island have 
               <br />
               exported up to 40 million tons of ore. I would like 
               <br />
               to know the real value of that ore, not the nominal 
               <br />
               value. Everything that goes out of the country 
               <br />
               should have some value. I do not see why, if 
               <br />
               Buchans has to put down the present day value, 
               <br />
               this company should not do it...

               <br />
               Mr. Cashin I am glad of the opportunity to say 
               <br />
               a few words in connection with the Labrador 
               <br />
               Mining and Development Company. Conse- 
               <br />
               quently I will begin from 1935. Some of my 
               <br />
               remarks may not be quite accurate, but I trust the 
               <br />
               Convention will forgive me, as I have no notes 
               <br />
               here. 
               <br />
               In 1935 the Weaver Minerals applied to the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland government for the right to 
               <br />
               prospect 20,000 square miles of territory in 
               <br />
               Labrador. I should say that to Mr. A.H. MacKay, 
               <br />
               whose name is signed to the application, would 
               <br />
               have to go the credit for any big development. At 
               <br />
               that time, this Mr. MacKay and three other in- 
               <br />
               dividuals joined and formed this Weaver 
               <br />
               Minerals. They applied and received, through a 
               <br />
               letter (no act), the right. There was no act passed 
               <br />
               until 1938. They undertook to spend $50,000 on 
               <br />
               Labrador. This particular area had been held by 
               <br />
               local interests who were unable to ﬁnance it. 
               <br />
               Mr. MacKay and his associates spent $80,000. 
               <br />
               People in Newfoundland did not know that. A lot 
               <br />
               of money went up in the air. He employed 
               <br />
               Dr. Retty, geologist. The following year they felt 
               <br />
               they were throwing money away and were 
               <br />
               prepared to forget <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> But this gentleman, 
               <br />
               Mr. MacKay, was a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speculator,</span> He and his as— 
               <br />
               sociate carried on. The following year 
               <br />
               Mr. MacKay‘s associate died and he had to carry 
               <br />
               on alone. Then Mr. Timmins of the Hollinger 
               <br />
               Co. contacted Mr. MacKay in Montreal. Hol- 
               <br />
               linger Co. is a large gold producing company. 
               <br />
               Hollinger controls 30% of the stock in the Noran- 
               <br />
               da mine. MacKay’s money was nearly all gone. 
               <br />
               Eventually a deal was made. After Hollinger 
               <br />
               became interested, they probably spent about $1 
               <br />
               million; $200,000 of which is going up in the air; 
               <br />
               they have to fly in supplies and machinery. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I have noticed in the 1938 act1 that this 
               <br />
               Labrador Mining Company “shall be in British 
               <br />
               territory.“ Now the idea is to electrify that rail— 
               <br />
               way. When they electrify it they are going to run 
               <br />
               it into Canada. Are they going to run only to the 
               <br />
               border line? Is the government going to charge 
               <br />
               export rate? If so they are going to have difﬁculty, 
               <br />
               because they will have to tell them to haul it the 
               <br />
               rest of the way. It is anticipated this Labrador
