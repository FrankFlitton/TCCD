               <br />
               express an honest doubt? When we venture to 
               <br />
               disagree with the report’s pathetic attempt to 
               <br />
               convince us that we have been better than self- 
               <br />
               supporting all those tragic years of destitution, 
               <br />

               <br />
               traitors to our country? Has this Convention sunk 
               <br />
               so low that it is a major crime to remind ourselves 
               <br />
               of the fact, the indisputable fact, that this country 
               <br />
               went through a hell of suffering for nearly 20 
               <br />
               years between the two wars? Is it not permitted 
               <br />
               to us to wonder where our country and our people 
               <br />
               would be today if this war had not broken out? 
               <br />
               And when we look ahead, is it the one unforgiv- 
               <br />
               able sin to doubt that all is well with New- 
               <br />
               foundland - to wonder whether there may not 
               <br />
               be dangerous shoals ahead? I think I know how 
               <br />
               our Newfoundland people will answer all these 
               <br />
               questions, with their hard-headed practical minds 
               <br />
               and their vivid and bitter memories of their priva-

               agreement with the optimistic speculations of this

               Economic Report. They know exactly what value 
               <br />
               to place upon any report that tells them that their 
               <br />

               supporting all through those long years of hunger

               and despair. They know exactly what to call a

               report that tells them, with cheerful complacency, 
               <br />
               that our present prosperity, such as it is, is due to 
               <br />
               anything but the war. And any man who imagines 
               <br />
               for one moment that our people would be led by 
               <br />
               the report into its mood of easy optimism is 
               <br />
               making the mistake of his life

               <br />
               founded on reality. It is a picture of Mr. Average 
               <br />
               Fisherman’s home of 40 years ago. I lived among 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen then as I do now. I know their homes, 
               <br />
               their work, their ﬂakes and their stages, their 
               <br />
               boats and their nets, the hardships and the dangers

               they have endured, what they ate and what they 
               <br />
               wore, their education, or lack of it, their many 
               <br />
               labours and their few and limited pleasures, their 
               <br />
               hopes and their fears, the roughness and 
               <br />
               monotony of their simple diet, their utter lack of 
               <br />
               luxury and most of the amenities of life. It was a 
               <br />
               dull, drab existence; an inadequate reward for 
               <br />

               of that child’s maintenance, if at all possible. It

               <br />
               The product of his toil was a cheap commodity,

               consumed for the most part in the least wealthy

               <br />
               ﬁrst world war, in the latter days of which, and 
               <br />
               for a couple of years after its end, that ﬁsherman 
               <br />

               levelled substantially however, by an increased 
               <br />
               cost of production and of living. Then came the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst postwar slump when he went on the dole in 
               <br />
               his thousands. Then a short partial recovery

               during which the bite of poverty was not quite so 
               <br />
               sharp. Then the crash of the early thirties, when 
               <br />
               for eight long years he knew the grinding <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bitter»</span>

               ness of dire destitution, and the torture of seeing

               his children grow thin from malnutrition and 
               <br />

               <br />
               stalked through the land. The government, both

               economic plague as best it could with the limited 
               <br />

               <br />
               improvement in the general conditions. Even as 
               <br />
               late as 1939, the year of the outbreak of the war, 
               <br />
               more than 40,000 people were still on dole after 
               <br />
               some $20,000 of British money had been pumped
