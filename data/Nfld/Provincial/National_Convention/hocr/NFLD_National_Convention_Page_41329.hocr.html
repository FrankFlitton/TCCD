               know that, but this caretaker government out- 
               <br />
               strips them all; although I, with thousands of 
               <br />
               other Newfoundlanders, thought that by the ad-

               vent of Commission of Government these evils 
               <br />
               would be remedied. But instead of the evils being

               remedied they made things worse for the majority 
               <br />
               of people, and helped a few to make a fortune at 
               <br />
               the expense of the taxpayers. There is no need for

               me to say any more about the Commission of

               Government, as I know their doom is sealed by 
               <br />
               themselves. They have been weighed in the 
               <br />
               balance and found wanting, and should not be 
               <br />

               As for myself, I am like the man and woman 
               <br />
               who were ﬁghting in their own backyard, when 
               <br />
               a stranger passing by saw that the woman was 
               <br />
               getting the worst of it. The stranger went in to part 
               <br />
               them, when suddenly to his surprise both the 
               <br />
               woman and the man turned on him and he had to 
               <br />
               run for his life. They did not want any inter- 
               <br />
               ference in their affairs. They were capable of 
               <br />
               settling their own squabbles together. The same 
               <br />
               thing applies to me in considering our future form 
               <br />
               of government. I do not want to see any more 
               <br />
               interference in our political life. We have had it 
               <br />
               for 15 years, and everyone knows we have had 
               <br />

               would like to put it, and that is, we have men in

               appeal to any other country to rock us in the 
               <br />
               cradle. We have men who have not been asleep 
               <br />
               during the past 14 years, and have realised how 
               <br />
               essential it is that we look after our own affairs 
               <br />
               instead of allowing outsiders to do it for us. We 
               <br />
               have men in this country brilliant enough to have 
               <br />
               seen the error of our ways, and if given a chance 
               <br />
               would see to it that their country would be

               <br />
               country on the globe. Please remember that New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders have been classed “better than the 
               <br />
               best”. We have men that have decided that we

               safeguard ourselves in the beginning, by seeing 
               <br />

               constitution that will eliminate all evils, and 
               <br />
               prevent monopolies which the fishermen and 
               <br />
               workers of this country, in the past, have had to 
               <br />
               support; a constitution strong enough to direct its

               course in an honourable manner, beating in mind 
               <br />
               that we live on a rock and our principal source of
