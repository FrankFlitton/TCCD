               that she was getting control of not only the island 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland, but the vast area of Labrador, 
               <br />
               which only six years before her Privy Council 
               <br />
               had awarded to Newfoundland. What her ul-

               timate plans for this island and Labrador were in 
               <br />
               the minds of her long—headed statesmen, who can 
               <br />
               tell? But the war of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">19394945</span> turned the world 
               <br />
               upside down. The balance of power shifted to the 
               <br />
               New World. England, in desperate straits in 1940, 
               <br />
               got 50 over~age destroyers for bases in New- 
               <br />
               foundland and elsewhere, something which 
               <br />
               might have been foreseen in 1933, the year that 
               <br />
               Hitler came to power in Germany. Canada, too, 
               <br />
               must have struck a bargain with the mother 
               <br />
               country, not as well—publicised as the base deal. 
               <br />
               England’s need was Canada’s opportunity. The 
               <br />
               process of rounding out the Dominion was begun. 
               <br />
               It seems to be a fairly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">well«known</span> fact that 
               <br />
               while the government of Mr. Churchill was still 
               <br />
               in power, a plan was drawn up for a ten-year 
               <br />
               programme of reconstruction in Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               Some sources claim that the return of responsible 
               <br />
               government was also contemplated in conjunc- 
               <br />
               tion with this offer. It is reliably understood that 
               <br />
               Canada interfered, as she did in 1892 at the time 
               <br />
               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">BondBlaine</span> treaty. The late Sir John Pud- 
               <br />
               dester, in a meeting of the Public Health and 
               <br />
               Welfare Committee (of which I was a member, 
               <br />
               and Mr. Smallwood and others), stated: 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood: Bearing on that, what is the 
               <br />
               irreducible minimum? 
               <br />
               SirJ.C. Puddester: I made up a list, two years 
               <br />
               ago of what our outlay would probably be. 
               <br />
               When the Goodwill Mission was here they 
               <br />
               talked about a 10—year plan. When they went 
               <br />
               home, they talked a lot about it and Lord 
               <br />
               Cranbomc sent for representatives of the 
               <br />
               Commission of Government to go over. 
               <br />
               Emerson, Dunn and myself went over, and 
               <br />
               there were visions of everything. I was asked 
               <br />
               to put down then what I thought we would 
               <br />
               require in our department and the whole thing 
               <br />
               comes to $10 million capital expenditure 
               <br />
               over 10 years. There was also to be a gift of 
               <br />
               $100,000 for 10 years to do construction 
               <br />
               work. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins: Did they fall down on that? 
               <br />
               Sir J.C. Puddester: Nobody seems to know 
               <br />
               the real facts; but I think with the American 
               <br />
               plan of lend—lease and the Canadian raising 
               <br />
               money, they said, “If you have money to give 
               <br />

               Is it too fantastic, too far—fetched to even suggest 
               <br />
               that the Canadian government went a step further 
               <br />
               and made aid to Britain contingent on the entry 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland into confederation? And that as 
               <br />
               far back as 1941 or 1942, if I might paraphrase 
               <br />
               die title of this Grey Book, arrangements were

               It is very signiﬁcant to my mind, arising out 
               <br />
               of the remarks of Major Cashin last <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">week,</span> that 
               <br />
               around the period that he says the plan was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in.</span> 
               <br />
               stituted, this country became the target for a 
               <br />
               barrage of newspaper and other propaganda of 
               <br />
               the most <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">onevsided,</span> unfair, and in some cases, 
               <br />
               scurrilous type that our people have had to con- 
               <br />
               tend with in many years, the greater part of it 
               <br />
               originating in Canada. The general effect of this 
               <br />
               propaganda was to convey to the rest of the world 
               <br />
               that Newfoundland was —~ to quote <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> 
               <br />
               Smallwood more than a year ago in this chamber 
               <br />
               —- “50 years behind the times”; that our people 
               <br />
               were a benighted race, and that in the interests of 
               <br />
               international decency we should be saved from 
               <br />
               ourselves. The obvious inference was that 
               <br />
               Canada should be the saviour. Mr. Chairman, I 
               <br />
               cannot help but draw a comparison between such 
               <br />
               tactics and those used in Europe just prior to the 
               <br />
               second World War by Adolf Hitler. He sang 
               <br />
               much the same song. He looked over his borders 
               <br />
               at Czechoslovakia, Austria and other lands, and 
               <br />
               with variations on the theme, said that these 
               <br />
               people should be saved from themselves, and 
               <br />
               proceeded to march in and “save them”. But then 
               <br />
               he was not hampered by the necessity of even 
               <br />
               paying <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lip~service</span> to democracy, like the nations 
               <br />
               of the western world must do. So the “capture” 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland had to be achieved by more or 
               <br />
               less “peaceful penetration”; by power politics in 
               <br />
               the guise of democracy; in Ihe guise of a National 
               <br />
               Convention. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now, Mr. Chairman, before I proceed to a 
               <br />
               consideration of the “Proposed Arrangements for 
               <br />
               the Entry of Newfoundland into Confederation” 
               <br />
               of 1947, I wish to make one point very clear. I am 
               <br />
               not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anti«Canadian.</span> Far from it. The suggestion 
               <br />
               has been made in some quarters that opposition 
               <br />
               to Newfoundland’s entry into union at this stage 
               <br />
               is anti-Canadian. That is not so; certainly not in 
               <br />
               my case. Anticonfederate, yes. But anti- 
               <br />
               Canadian, no! I have as much regard for Canada
