               We live more poorly, more shabbily, more mean- 
               <br />
               Iy. Our life is more a struggle. Our struggle is 
               <br />
               tougher, more naked, more hopeless. In the North 
               <br />
               American family Newfoundland bears the 
               <br />
               reputation of having the lowest standards of life, 
               <br />
               of being the least progressive and advanced of the

               <br />
               warms our hearts, go where we will: a charm, a 
               <br />
               magic, a mystical tug on our emotion that never 
               <br />
               dies. With all her faults we love her. But a

               metamorphosis steals over us the moment we

               <br />
               undergo a transformation. We expect, and we 
               <br />
               take for granted, a higher, a more modern way of 
               <br />
               life such as it would have seemed ridiculous or 
               <br />
               even avaricious to expect at home. And as we 
               <br />
               return to Newfoundland we leave that higher 
               <br />
               standard behind, and our minds undergo a reverse 
               <br />
               transformation. We have grown so accustomed 
               <br />
               to our own lower standards and more antiquated 
               <br />
               methods and old—fashioned conveniences that we 
               <br />
               readjust ourselves unconsciously to the meaner 
               <br />
               standards under which we grew up. We are so 
               <br />
               used to our railway and our coastal boats that we 
               <br />
               scarcely see them; so used to our settlements, and 
               <br />
               roads, and homes, and schools, and hospitals and 
               <br />
               hotels and everything else that we do not even see 
               <br />
               their inadequacy, their backwardness, their 
               <br />
               seaminess.

               We have grown up in such an atmosphere of

               never surprised, certainly never shocked, when

               granted. We take for granted our lower standards,

               strange to say, angry and hurt when these shock-
