               There has been a lot of talk about ﬂour and the 
               <br />
               price. Everybody seems to forget that in 
               <br />
               peacetimes we get ﬂour cheaper than any other 
               <br />
               part of the world. Iknow in 1929, I put six barrels 
               <br />
               of flour in my house for $4.86 a barrel. I wish I 
               <br />
               could put it there today. About a month later at 
               <br />
               Halifax, I was in my sister’s home when she paid 
               <br />
               $5.60 for the same brand of flour, and a month 
               <br />
               afterwards, making up the vessel’s accounts at 
               <br />
               Gloucester, flour was charged at $6.50 per barrel. 
               <br />
               1939 ﬂour cost landed $3.40 per barrel, was sold 
               <br />
               to grocers in St. John' s for $3.80 per barrel, while 
               <br />
               ﬂour was retailing for $5.20 per barrel in Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia. But see how they treat us now?.., Now the 
               <br />
               price of ﬂour is $9.20 per 100 lb. sack. The trade 
               <br />
               here wanted to take only enough to fill the north- 
               <br />
               em orders, but Canada forced them to take the 
               <br />
               full allocation, thus depriving Newfoundland of 
               <br />
               the advantage of the lower wheat price and forc- 
               <br />

               <br />
               ﬂoru for Newfoundlanders, we being their best

               Mr. Chairman, I cannot support this fraud that 
               <br />
               is being put over on the people of this country, to 
               <br />
               me it is plain power politics. That’s the suspicion 
               <br />
               I had at the beginning. and the way things have 
               <br />
               gone in this house only makes me more certain 
               <br />
               that I have taken part in the greatest piece of 
               <br />
               codology that was ever foisted on an innocent and 
               <br />
               long-suffering people, and I cannot support it. I 
               <br />
               must apologise to the people whose money I have 
               <br />
               squandered, it’s been an education to me. I hope 
               <br />
               it has done some good to the country. I have one 
               <br />
               thing more to speak about, Mr. Chairman, it is a 
               <br />
               speech made a few days ago about politics being 
               <br />
               brought into the Convention. By whom? By me?

               I had never heard the word confederation men- 
               <br />

               <br />
               before I was buttonholed about that form of 
               <br />
               government by that same gentleman that made 
               <br />
               that speech. Now I hate to lie down under the 
               <br />
               accusation that I injected anything into this, that 
               <br />

               <br />
               ram something down my throat! But a week after 
               <br />
               I came in, I found out from Canada and Company 
               <br />
               that I was digging my political <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grave...</span> I said

               <br />
               form. For if We do not accept it, I know the British 
               <br />
               government will put it on. If it goes through I 
               <br />
               hope and pray it will be a good thing for the 
               <br />
               country. I won’t worry ifI'm called a fool —- only 
               <br />
               too glad to be called so. For I want the best for 
               <br />
               our people and I do not think this is the best. In 
               <br />
               fact, while the world is in the flux and chaos it is 
               <br />
               in today, I would put nothing on the country 
               <br />
               which the people could not change. I think there 
               <br />
               are better days ahead, and if wecan reaCh that 
               <br />
               point all will be well. As I see it now, if the British 
               <br />
               government puts it through against the advice of 
               <br />
               the majority of the Convention, then if it doesn’t 
               <br />
               work and I do not think it will, then our people 
               <br />
               will he in a ﬁghting frame of mind and through 
               <br />

               <br />
               subsidy or a bribe to keep their mouths shut. I’m

               sure Canada is going to get a bear by the tail if 
               <br />
               she gets Newfoundland, and I know it, and I am 
               <br />
               not going to support it. I am not going to tie any 
               <br />
               leader’s hands of the future. I’ll be alongside his

               One thing, I listened to Mr. Smallwood’s 
               <br />
               graphic description of proﬁts. I was glad to hear 
               <br />
               that, for! have taken an oath that if it ever comes 
               <br />
               again, if it‘s a crust for one, it’s a crust for all. 
               <br />
               Well, Mr. Smallwood’s idea of the commission 
               <br />
               merchant was graphic. I call him a muleskinner. 
               <br />
               Now that animal does not work alone in the

               woods on Water Street; he is on all the streets and 
               <br />
               he is going to turn the world upside down if he 
               <br />
               keeps on. Now in that Paradise Harbour that Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood is piloting this ship of state to, the 
               <br />
               woods are full of them. He forgot to mention that, 
               <br />
               and our Uncle Sam has so many of them, he has 
               <br />
               got them in his beard. I think he invented them or 
               <br />
               he brought them up to scratch. Those down here 
               <br />
               are only pikers, but they are learning fast. I
