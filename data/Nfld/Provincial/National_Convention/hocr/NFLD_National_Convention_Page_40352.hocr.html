               Mr. McCarthy I refer to the question asked by

               Mr. Northcott regarding payments having been 
               <br />
               made. I understand that when the grants were 
               <br />
               issued to these people, they would pay about $50 
               <br />
               for them; that would include holdings of land, 
               <br />
               buildings and barns — just a nominal charge. 
               <br />
               These grants are all made out now for members 
               <br />
               of the settlements; there are some negotiations 
               <br />
               going on as far as land is concerned with

               Mr. Smallwood You said something about the

               <br />
               through Sandringham —— it was quite a job to

               clear that place, build homes and get the men 
               <br />
               settled —— that gave them a certain amount of

               Mr. Newell I would like to refer to the point

               made by someone who was wondering about the 
               <br />
               returns we got by settling people on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">land.</span> The 
               <br />
               convenor made a classical understatement when 
               <br />
               he said the situation of some of those people was 
               <br />
               such that they found it difficult to earn a living. I 
               <br />
               happened to be on the south coast, where some 
               <br />
               of those people came from in 1938 ~—— you 
               <br />
               remember the tidal wave of 1929 destroyed the 
               <br />
               fishing grounds there — and the average catch of 
               <br />
               ﬁsh had been estimated by the government to be 
               <br />
               ten quintals per man. I went around with one of 
               <br />
               the clergymen who was trying to do something 
               <br />
               about the economic condition of the people, and 
               <br />
               loan assure you that Mr. Butt’s statement is very 
               <br />
               much an understatement. I would not wish to 
               <br />
               interfere with the digestion of your dinner this 
               <br />
               evening by giving a description of the graphic 
               <br />
               details of the conditions of those people who had 
               <br />
               been taken off the barren rocks; had not even soil 
               <br />
               in which to grow vegetables; and I wish to go on 
               <br />
               record that every $5,000 spent on these people 
               <br />
               out of any fund, they are welcome to it. I would
