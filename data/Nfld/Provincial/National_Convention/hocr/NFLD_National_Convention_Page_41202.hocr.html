               Mr. Starkes I was told one instance, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Chair‘</span>

               man, that I’m very much interested in. Take a

               man who returns from the war after 19 months, 
               <br />
               and during that time, through no fault of his own, 
               <br />
               he fails to make application for assistance in the

               <br />

               War Veterans’ Association and the Women’s

               <br />
               know for a fact that in some cases the returns they 
               <br />
               received were nothing except dole, which is 
               <br />
               facing the unemployed civilians. That is how the

               arriving at our conclusion, we must be guided by 
               <br />
               history. It is over 450 years since this country was 
               <br />
               discovered. It’s only 80 years since confederation 
               <br />
               took place in Canada. Why has Canada 
               <br />
               developed into a large industrial nation while we 
               <br />
               have not made the same progress? The position 
               <br />
               should be reversed, considering that Canada was

               assured that if prices soar in Canada they will be

               much higher here in a country that has to import 
               <br />
               about 80% of its requirements. There’s a book 
               <br />
               here, Mr. Chairman, that costs 25 cents. Some

               <br />
               down through my life I’ve often heard the story 
               <br />
               that if we went in confederation with Canada, the 
               <br />
               glass in our windows would be taxed, our motor 
               <br />
               boats, ﬁshing lines, and everything else would be 
               <br />
               taxed to the limit. If we turn to the British North 
               <br />
               America Act, clause 125, it states: “No land or 
               <br />
               property belonging to Canada or any province 
               <br />
               shall be liable to taxation.” Now that’s what we 
               <br />
               have got to go by —— with the exception of 
               <br />
               municipal taxes, municipal councils and outport 
               <br />
               town councils. There is not one act of the Govem- 
               <br />
               ment of Canada or the provinces that states that
