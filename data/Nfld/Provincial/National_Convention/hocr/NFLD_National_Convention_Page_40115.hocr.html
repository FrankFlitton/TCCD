               ing to the fairy godmother. I would go so far as 
               <br />
               to say that if that is the kind of people we are, I 
               <br />
               don’t think Canada would want us —— I’m sure 
               <br />
               she wouldn’t respect us. Certainly, we couldn’t 
               <br />
               respect ourselves. The whole question of federal 
               <br />
               union is bigger than that. It is my feeling the day 
               <br />
               may soon come when the peoples of the entire 
               <br />
               North American continent may ﬁnd it even 
               <br />
               necessary to let down their barriers and adopt a 
               <br />
               common citizenship. Many people feel that day 
               <br />
               is long overdue, and that it points the way to 
               <br />
               eventual peace and prosperity for all men. Should 
               <br />
               that day come, we will need to bring to bear on 
               <br />
               the problem sound reasoning in minds free of 
               <br />
               thought of personal aggrandisement or selﬁsh 
               <br />
               gain. Newfoundlanders are watching us, hoping, 
               <br />
               praying that we have among us men equal to the 
               <br />
               task. Can we produce men of the calibre of those 
               <br />
               who did their duty in these chambers long ago? 
               <br />
               If we can, we are saved. God help us if we can’t.

               Mr. Job I feel I should say a few words for or

               wood, and somewhat half-heartedly seconded by 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins. It is probable that somebody at

               <br />
               tainable for confederation, but personally I doubt 
               <br />
               if this Convention is the body that should ask for 
               <br />
               these terms. I think the request, if any, will have 
               <br />
               to come from a government of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               which at least has some elected representatives 
               <br />

               It is most unfortunate that Mr. Smallwood has 
               <br />

               destroy the independent views of members of this 
               <br />

               <br />
               seats on the proposed delegation, senatorships, 
               <br />

               I have previously stated that Canada has an

               important interest in the future welfare of New-

               during the recent war. It might conceivably be to 
               <br />
               the interest of both Canada and Newfoundland to

               interesting address by our very highly respected 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               February 13, 1945. In this address Mr. Gushue

               said in part:

               <br />
               well—being of the whole continent if that large
