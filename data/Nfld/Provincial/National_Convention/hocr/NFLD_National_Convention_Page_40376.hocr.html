               his remarks. One portion of that resolution which

               that the people of this country are looking for 
               <br />
               information in every particular and not in one 
               <br />
               particular. lam convinced that all the information 
               <br />
               we can get is not going to hurt anybody and unless 
               <br />
               we get the information from every source, how 
               <br />
               can we be expected to make a wise decision? Is 
               <br />
               it right we should deny the people ofthis country 
               <br />
               information which they are expecting to receive? 
               <br />
               It does not follow that because we receive that

               information we are going to accept it. I say in all

               Mr. Fowler It is most important that we be

               realistic concerning the whole matter. First I have 
               <br />
               to admit that there are a number of people who 
               <br />
               possibly favour the idea of federal union with 
               <br />
               Canada. There are also a number of people who 
               <br />

               With regard to responsible government we
