               Mr. Newell There is no need to attempt to refute 
               <br />
               anything said about the Tourist Board. We are all 
               <br />
               in perfect agreement about that. What I am con— 
               <br />
               cemed about is the subject matter of this report. 
               <br />
               I feel in some cases it is a bit vague. Apart from 
               <br />
               registering our indignation at certain things, I 
               <br />
               find myself listening to this motion that we rise 
               <br />
               and report progress and I ask myself, how much 
               <br />
               progress? I feel it is not even open to debate that 
               <br />
               tourist trade is an economic value to the country. 
               <br />
               We mustassume that everyone knows that. I 
               <br />
               think it is pertinent to enquire how much money 
               <br />
               should we spend on it. What do we find in the 
               <br />
               report? To use their own words, “We are con- 
               <br />
               vinced that the travel trade has within it the 
               <br />
               possibility of becoming one of this country‘s 
               <br />
               most proﬁtable and most considerable economic 
               <br />
               resources.” It is too vague. I hope when we con- 
               <br />
               sider this report again some consideration will be 
               <br />
               given to the ﬁnancial side of it. How much do we 
               <br />
               want any government to undertake, and how 
               <br />
               much should we leave for private enterprise? Is 
               <br />
               it going to be private enterprise or free enterprise 
               <br />
               or social enterprise? That is the question we have 
               <br />
               to decide. It is a serious question and we should 
               <br />
               give it some thought.

               Apart from that I have no cause to disagree 
               <br />
               with anything that has been said, except in this 
               <br />
               one other instance The report does not say on 
               <br />
               whose authority they based their information. I 
               <br />
               am not trying to compare the attitude of the 
               <br />
               government as against the attitude of the Tourist 
               <br />
               Board, but I wondered if the government was 
               <br />
               asked their viewpoint on the matter. I am not 
               <br />
               particularly concerned about their viewpoint, but 
               <br />
               reverting back to something you said, Mr. Chair-

               man, before you became Chairman, about our 
               <br />
               sitting here as a bench of judges, it seems to me 
               <br />
               necessary that before we pass judgement on any 
               <br />
               matter of policy we should get both sides of the 
               <br />
               story; maybe the Committee satisﬁed itself on 
               <br />
               that point, but I would like to know....

               I am inclined to disagree with Mr. Smallwood

               <br />

               what he says. The point about getting information

               <br />
               have done that, a much bigger choice has got to 
               <br />
