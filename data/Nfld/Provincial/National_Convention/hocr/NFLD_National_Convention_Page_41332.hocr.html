               been left in a fog of political oblivion for 14 years 
               <br />
               and were never taught, and never knew how a 
               <br />
               democracy works. I wonder what one columnist 
               <br />
               would have written or thought if she had attended 
               <br />
               the House of Commons and heard the Commons, 
               <br />
               with the enemy at the gates and the world falling 
               <br />
               to pieces, take time out to debate if the women 
               <br />
               sailors’ undies would be pink or blue — and other 
               <br />
               matters just as irrelevant. Perhaps it would have 
               <br />
               been OK for the Commons to have done that, 
               <br />
               being learned in the way of democracy, but for 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders ——- I guess they expect the

               home government on, I take each in turn. First, I 
               <br />
               believe this is the biggest “jumblement” that was

               am going to make it clear, the stand I am taking

               our ﬁnest laid down their lives for, and at least 
               <br />

               turned loose, to full and dominion independence,

               to form the word or sentence. Why has this hap- 
               <br />
               pened? I’ll whisper a secret, gentlemen. We did 
               <br />
               not take the nod, the imperial nod in the sixties, 
               <br />
               and this time by hook or by crook we are going 
               <br />
               to take the nod. Now the only thing between us 
               <br />
               and that imperial nod (in fact now it is a frown) 
               <br />
               is the people’s “X”. God grant they will use it
