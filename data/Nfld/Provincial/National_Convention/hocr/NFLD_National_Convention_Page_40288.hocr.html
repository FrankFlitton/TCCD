               have been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commenting</span> on the fact that, for the 
               <br />
               past few weeks, I have not been taking a very 
               <br />
               active part in the debates of this assembly. My 
               <br />
               explanation to them and to the public, is that, ﬁrst, 
               <br />
               I felt the carefully prepared reports which the 
               <br />
               several committees have presented were in them- 
               <br />
               selves sufﬁciently informative and factual for the 
               <br />
               basic purposes of this Convention. And second, 
               <br />
               wishing to expedite the work, I did not desire to 
               <br />
               enter into any analysis of endless details, which, 
               <br />
               if encouraged, could only develop into idle dis- 
               <br />
               cussions, with a consequent cost of the people’s 
               <br />
               money and the delegates’ time. For these reasons, 
               <br />
               I have been content to adopt the role of a more or 
               <br />
               less silent spectator. But on the present occasion 
               <br />
               1 rise to what I regard as a state of political 
               <br />
               emergency, with the object of placing before this 
               <br />
               Convention my impression of things as I see them 
               <br />
               today, and with the hope that what I shall have to 
               <br />
               say may be of some assistance to my fellow 
               <br />
               delegates and to the public at large.

               On September 18 last, just a week after this 
               <br />
               Convention had assembled, I made a speech in- 
               <br />
               troducing the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Chadwick—Jones</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">report,</span> I referred 
               <br />
               to this Convention in terms which, to some of 
               <br />
               you, may have seemed unduly harsh ~— perhaps 
               <br />
               shocking. I pointed out my lack of faith in this 
               <br />
               Convention, referred to it as being ethically 
               <br />
               improper, in View of the agreement which was 
               <br />
               made between the last Newfoundland parliament 
               <br />
               and the British government, wherein self—govem~ 
               <br />
               ment was promised this country upon its becom- 
               <br />
               ing self-supporting. I pointed out how that 
               <br />
               agreement had been deliberately avoided and 
               <br />
               ignored by the wholly unauthorised substitution 
               <br />
               of this Convention set-up. I said that as time went 
               <br />
               on, and the true nature of this Convention 
               <br />
               emerged, many delegates would endorse my sen- 
               <br />
               timents. I concluded with the statement that it 
               <br />
               would become clear that in its dealings with us, 
               <br />
               the Dominions Office had stolen the vocabulary 
               <br />
               of democracy, but had ignored both its spirit and 
               <br />
               substance. ~

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Over four months have elapsed since I made 
               <br />
               that speech, and today the things that I said then 
               <br />
               seem to have proved too dismally true. In one 
               <br />
               respect, perhaps, I might change my views. At 
               <br />
               that time I referred to the Convention as a 
               <br />
               gloriﬁed stall. Today I do not regard it in any such 
               <br />
               light <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">manner,</span> Rather I see in its characteristics 
               <br />
               something far more sinister and even tragic.

               Today I see it as a premeditated design to keep us 
               <br />
               out of control of our own country, so that time 
               <br />
               may be afforded those in power to complete their 
               <br />
               campaign of sabotage. And so, I see this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Convert»</span>

               <br />
               of ﬁddling while Rome burns. Now, let me say, 
               <br />
               that in speaking in this strain, I cast no reﬂection 
               <br />
               whatever on the personnel of this body, I simply 
               <br />
               speak of the Convention as a political entity — 
               <br />
               as being part of the costly and cumbersome 
               <br />
               machinery, consisting of plebiscites and referen- 
               <br />
               dums, which have been foisted on us to confuse 
               <br />
               our thoughts and efforts, until the plans of the 
               <br />
               Dominions Office have been completed.

               As for the personnel in the months that we 
               <br />
               have been together, I have come to know most of 
               <br />
               the delegates intimately and have made many 
               <br />
               warm friends. I have been greatly impressed with 
               <br />
               the sound reasoning and sincere utterances 
               <br />
               shown in their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speeches,</span> Many of them may not 
               <br />
               have been blessed with college education, and 
               <br />
               have had to get their learning in the university of 
               <br />
               hard knocks, but new as some of them may be to 
               <br />
               the political atmosphere, they have proven that 
               <br />
               they can measure up to their jobs in a manner 
               <br />
               reﬂecting credit on themselves and the people 
               <br />
               they represent. We have in this assembly repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives of all Newfoundland, including 
               <br />
               Labrador. From the great forests of the west to 
               <br />
               the stormy coastlines of the north — merchants 
               <br />
               and miners, lawyers and lumbermen, fishermen 
               <br />
               and farmers, teachers and teamsters; the rich and 
               <br />
               the poor, the classes and the masses ~— all are 
               <br />
               represented here. And because of this wide rep- 
               <br />
               resentation, I feel that I am speaking, not so much 
               <br />
               to the delegates themselves, as to the 300,000 odd 
               <br />
               people who are depending on us to safeguard 
               <br />
               their interests. I speak on behalf of no particular 
               <br />
               district, nor as the advocate of any political party 
               <br />
               or belief, but just as an ordinary Newfoundlander 
               <br />
               to his fellow men and women, on a matter of 
               <br />
               national interest.
