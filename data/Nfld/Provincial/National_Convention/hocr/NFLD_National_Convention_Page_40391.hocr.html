               <br />

               not found any place better to live than this island

               people in that country live. I have never believed

               a large country could be as well governed as a

               193 l~32 they put men working on the roads; they 
               <br />
               were paid $5 in the summer and $ 10 in the winter, 
               <br />
               they put the men in camps, 100 men to every five
