               we experienced during the war years; also to the 
               <br />

               <br />
               all aware of the fact that the economics of this 
               <br />
               country have always been very unbalanced. We 
               <br />
               have always had to depend too much on the 
               <br />
               returns of one industry —— the ﬁsheries. This 
               <br />
               condition has changed somewhat in recent years. 
               <br />
               We have such major industries as mining and 
               <br />
               logging, and also in very recent years our ﬁshing 
               <br />
               industry has been diversiﬁed with the coming of 
               <br />
               modern fresh fish processing plants, the 
               <br />
               manufacture and sale of ﬁshery products other 
               <br />
               than cod; and there are good reasons for believing 
               <br />
               that the returns from our mineral resources, espe- 
               <br />
               cially the iron ore deposits on the Labrador, will 
               <br />
               help in a large measure to balance our economy.

               But what I would like to ﬁnd out is how far we 
               <br />
               have come towards having a more balanced 
               <br />
               economy during the past 12 or 13 years. We still 
               <br />
               have around 50% of our people engaged in the 
               <br />
               ﬁshing industry, and with this thought in mind I 
               <br />
               would like to draw the attention of members to 
               <br />
               page 32 of the report, which reads as follows: “At 
               <br />
               the present time we ﬁgure that not less than 
               <br />
               25,000 of our people are engaged in the ﬁshing 
               <br />
               industry; 15,000 in the pulp and paper industry; 
               <br />
               and 3,500 in the mining industry", and then they 
               <br />
               give the value of these industries. I am of the 
               <br />
               opinion that it would have added to the value of 
               <br />
               this report, and helped us to more clearly evaluate 
               <br />
               the economic conditions of our country, if they 
               <br />
               had gone a little farther with this paragraph and 
               <br />
               shown in a comparative statement how the per- 
               <br />
               centage of our people engaged in the various 
               <br />
               industries has changed in the past 12 or 14 years. 
               <br />
               According to the census figures of 1935 those 
               <br />
               gainfully employed in the various industries were 
               <br />
               as follows: in the ﬁshing industry 36,900 persons; 
               <br />
               in the logging industry, including those engaged 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">paper~making,</span> 9,700; and in the mining in- 
               <br />
               dustry, 1,800; or if we take them by percentages, 
               <br />
               46.7% ﬁshing, 12.4% logging, and 2.3% mining. 
               <br />
               I do not know how these percentages would 
               <br />
               compare with those engaged in the different <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in‘</span> 
               <br />
               dustries at the present time, but glancing at the 
               <br />
               totals we ﬁnd that the number of those engaged 
               <br />
               in the ﬁshing industry has decreased by about 
               <br />
               50%, while those engaged in logging has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> 
               <br />
               creased by about 65%, and those engaged in 
               <br />
               mining has nearly doubled. Judging from those

               Mr. Bailey Mr. Chairman, first I would like to 
               <br />
               congratulate the Finance Committee on this 
               <br />
               report because I believe in the light of the other 
               <br />
               reports that have been tabled, this very clearly 
               <br />
               sums up the information gathered therein. One 
               <br />
               cannot help being struck with the brief and clear 
               <br />
               way the facts have been presented so that the 
               <br />
               common man can understand them. Perhaps 
               <br />
               more could be said if we go back to 1897 and ﬁnd 
               <br />
               out where we stood with regard to our way of life, 
               <br />
               and compare it with today.... First, I’ll paint a 
               <br />
               picture from memory and forget the records.

               <br />
               it wasn’t dog and slide. And the mails, one a

               <br />
               and 17 miles down with a large haversack on his

               know that these conditions still exist in some

               parts of the island, but there have been great 
               <br />
               strides made and I believe we are at the turn in 
               <br />
               the road, and should go ahead as much in 15 years 
               <br />
