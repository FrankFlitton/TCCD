               Mr. Chairman I will make my position clear. 
               <br />
               What I do tonight and what I do the week after 
               <br />
               next are two entirely different things, but cemin 
               <br />
               it is I am not going to run the risk of excluding 
               <br />
               discussion on any form of government which 
               <br />
               may be desired by any member of this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion. It has been suggested to me here in effect 
               <br />
               that these rules are relatively unimportant. I say 
               <br />
               they are of the utmost importance for this reason: 
               <br />
               they were made pursuant to section 4 of the Act. 
               <br />
               The Act says, “No rules shall be amended, altered 
               <br />
               or repealed except by two-thirds vote of the mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the Convention." Therefore I will have to 
               <br />
               enforce it. Every man shall be free to express his 
               <br />
               own opinion on forms of government. I am sure 
               <br />
               it never occurred to me that this motion was 
               <br />
               designed to cut off discussion of the other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">form</span> 
               <br />
               of government of which Ihave notice on the order 
               <br />
               paper. I am going to take the only position I can. 
               <br />
               That is, the motion will have to be amended. But 
               <br />
               I want to resolve any doubt, and there appears to 
               <br />
               be grave doubt, and if it is correct that this motion 
               <br />
               if carried would preclude discussion on Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood‘s motion, I think that ambiguity and 
               <br />
               doubt has to be resolved. I will accept the motion 
               <br />
               covering responsible government and Commis- 
               <br />

               <br />
               form of government next on the order paper, of 
               <br />

               another form of government. Now it is said you

               <br />
               never occurred to me until three o’clock this

               the whole matter can be simply resolved. Per~ 
               <br />
               sonally, I think the whole procedure, while not 
               <br />
               exactly wrong, was not as neat as it might have 
               <br />
               been. My own view is, the proper way to deal 
               <br />
               with each of these forms is to take them singly; 
               <br />
               after all, our duty is to decide as to what forms

               that motion was something over which the House 
               <br />
               has no jurisdiction. Your motion in its original

               Mr. Bradley I think each form could have been 
               <br />
               taken separately and dealt with in a manner that 
               <br />
               would not have been in any way exclusive. If we 
               <br />
               had a resolution for instance that Commission of 
               <br />
               Government be placed on the ballot paper, that 
               <br />
               would have been adopted and that would not 
               <br />
               exclude anything else. It would be dealing with 
               <br />
               one form — we would say, “Yes, that is one form 
               <br />
               which ought to be submitted to the people, we 
               <br />
               will put that on.” Then we take responsible 
               <br />
               government, we discuss that and we come to the 
               <br />
               conclusion, “Yes, that is also a form which shall 
               <br />
               be submitted to the people.” We are then ﬁnished 
               <br />
               with that. Then we take any other form we want 
               <br />
               to consider and discuss that, we may decide to put 
               <br />
               it on or not as the case may be -— each should 
               <br />
               have been taken separately. That was not done. 
               <br />
               What was done in the ﬁrst instance was this 
               <br />
               resolution was introduced to place one form on 
               <br />
               the ballot paper, and reading that resolution ac- 
               <br />
               cording to the concepts of the English language, 
               <br />
               it was to the exclusion of all others.
