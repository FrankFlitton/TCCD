               ment in St. John’s and gets his instructions from 
               <br />
               the department. They have certain standing or- 
               <br />
               ders from the department, and I have always 
               <br />
               maintained that a relieving ofﬁcer should have 
               <br />
               not only some initiative on his own part, but some 
               <br />
               power to grant relief in cases of destitution. It 
               <br />
               might be, perhaps, that in certain cases it might 
               <br />
               be abused, but certainly the department could 
               <br />
               check on the relieving ofﬁcer; but naturally this 
               <br />
               relief has to be given out, as in the past, in larger 
               <br />
               quantities in certain sections to a great number of 
               <br />
               people, and they have to have certain other rather 
               <br />
               stringent rules and regulations. That is the set-up 
               <br />
               in the outports, any man can approach a relieving 
               <br />
               ofﬁcer in his district; and I know some cases 
               <br />
               where the relieving ofﬁcers are Rangers, and they 
               <br />
               forward on to the department the applications and 
               <br />
               need for relief as it arises. As you can see from 
               <br />
               the ﬁgures given there has not been much relief 
               <br />
               up until quite recently in the outports, but as the 
               <br />
               winter months move along the people become 
               <br />
               destitute, they have no money, no credit, and no 
               <br />
               means of providing themselves with food, and 
               <br />
               they have to apply to the relieving ofﬁcer; and, 
               <br />
               as was pointed out last night, in certain sections, 
               <br />
               in White Bay for instance, where the trap ﬁshery 
               <br />
               has failed for two years following, these people 
               <br />
               have just carried themselves along as far as they 
               <br />
               can. I think that the department is sympathetic 
               <br />
               towards these applications and, while each ap- 
               <br />
               plication has to be studied on its merits, the 
               <br />
               amount of earning power that a man has during 
               <br />
               the summertime and what avenues he has tried to 
               <br />
               secure employment, all these factors have to be 
               <br />
               ascertained and studied. As far as I know they are 
               <br />
               submitted to the department in St. John’s and they 
               <br />
               get their orders from the ofﬁcial here who looks 
               <br />
               after outport relief and deals with the cases as 
               <br />
               they come up.

               died after the beginning of the quarter, and have 
               <br />

               <br />
               was received in the outports, on the 4th or 5th, the 
               <br />
               cheque is sent back to the department; and I have 
               <br />
               had one or two cases where they have paid that 
               <br />
               cheque in order to give the beneﬁt of the money 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               there are cases where the widow may be 62 or 63

               <br />

               <br />
               don’t know if that answers your question. I am in 
               <br />
               full sympathy with the idea that the pension age 
               <br />
               should be lowered. When I was introducing this 
               <br />
               report I mentioned that in my remarks. We have 
               <br />
               no authority to make any change in this age limit, 
               <br />
               it is a matter for the government. I know that to 
               <br />
               these elderly people, particularly the ﬁshermen 
               <br />
               and others who have helped build up the 
               <br />
               economy of Newfoundland throughout the years, 
               <br />
               this amount, even if very small, is a help to them, 
               <br />
               and I am in sympathy with the remarks of Mr. 
               <br />
               Ballam.

               periodic visits to the outport districts? If so how
