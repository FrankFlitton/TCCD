               Now take a married couple with no children

               <br />
               will pay $15 a month income tax out of his $150.

               If he makes $3,000 a year, or $250 a month all

               the year round, he pays $35 a month income tax 
               <br />
               out of $250. That is, remember, a married couple 
               <br />
               with no dependents, only the two of them. Now 
               <br />
               take a married couple with three children under 
               <br />
               16. On any income that that man makes, anything 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               $125 a month every month in the year, he pays 
               <br />
               no income tax; not only does he pay no income 
               <br />
               tax, but he is paid money, $216 a year by the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada in family allowances. 
               <br />
               Now if his income is $2,000 a year, this same man 
               <br />
               with three children, at $166 every month of the 
               <br />
               year, he still pays no income tax, but instead the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada pays him $194 a year in 
               <br />
               family allowances. Now if his income is $2,500 
               <br />
               a year, $208 a month every month, he still pays 
               <br />
               no income tax, but instead he receives $106 a year 
               <br />
               from the Government of Canada in family <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ale</span> 
               <br />
               lowances, and of course the more children he has 
               <br />
               under 16 the more family allowance money that 
               <br />
               family receives. The simple truth is that at least 
               <br />
               80 persons out of every 100 in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               under confederation will pay not a cent of income 
               <br />
               tax. God help us, their income does not bring 
               <br />
               them into the income tax group!

               Again, Maj or Cashin tried to curdle our blood 
               <br />
               by telling us of the almost incredible and un- 
               <br />
               believable number of taxes imposed on all kinds 
               <br />
               of products. For example, and this is one of the 
               <br />
               easiest ones, he says there are 52 taxes on a loaf 
               <br />
               of bread in Canada. There was one he mentioned 
               <br />
               that had 250 taxes on the one article. How do they 
               <br />
               live up there? Are they still alive, or are they all 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               dead? Now about those 52 taxes on a loaf of 
               <br />
               bread. Supposing he is right, what does it matter 
               <br />
               to people if there are 52 taxes on a loaf of bread, 
               <br />
               and the loaf still sells for 13 cents? 13 cents a loaf 
               <br />
               for a 20 ounce loaf. In St. John’s a loaf is what? 
               <br />
               18 cents. How many ounces? What is the size of 
               <br />
               our loaf in St. John’s? 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins It is a bigger loaf. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood [think it is 24 ounces. My wife 
               <br />
               buys the bread, which she won’t bake. We should 
               <br />
               go out in the real Newfoundland where they bake 
               <br />
               their bread. I am not going to deny that there are 
               <br />
               all these taxes actually imposed on all these 
               <br />
               things, for the simple truth of the matter is that 
               <br />
               that is how it is all around the world. It is the same 
               <br />
               here. These taxes, sir, are paid on all our imports 
               <br />
               before we import them, and then we pay them 
               <br />
               back in the price we pay for what we buy, and 
               <br />
               besides paying all those taxes that Major Cashin 
               <br />
               mentioned, besides paying those in the price of 
               <br />
               the article when we buy it, we also pay customs 
               <br />
               duty on top of them all, and on the customs duty 
               <br />
               we also pay a proﬁt, in fact a double proﬁt to the 
               <br />
               wholesalers. You can take almost any article you 
               <br />
               would like to mention, and if you can trace it back 
               <br />
               far enough, and trace back all the various articles 
               <br />
               that go into that one article, you will ﬁnd dozens 
               <br />
               and sometimes hundreds of taxes have been col- 
               <br />
               lected on it at one point or another, from one 
               <br />
               country or another, and the consumer pays it all. 
               <br />
               Now, sir, I want to address myself for a mo- 
               <br />
               ment to this question of sales taxes. In my opinion 
               <br />
               a sales tax is not an ideal tax. It is not direct 
               <br />
               taxation, which I prefer, but indirect taxation, 
               <br />
               which I do not like. The sales tax is put on by the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada. How long it will be left 
               <br />
               on I don’t know. It may be left on for two or three 
               <br />
               years yet. I don’t <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">know,</span> The rate of the sales tax 
               <br />
               is 8%. How long it will remain at 8%, again I 
               <br />
               don’t know. Before the Government of Canada 
               <br />
               abolishes the sales tax altogether they may reduce 
               <br />
               it to 4-5%. That is something I can’t <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prophecy,</span> 
               <br />
               Well, there it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~—</span> a sales tax of 8%. It is collected 
               <br />
               mainly from the manufacturer of the article. It is 
               <br />
               included in the retail selling price of the article. 
               <br />
               The consumer knows nothing about it, he simply 
               <br />
               buys the article in the shop and the price of that 
               <br />
               article includes the sales tax, if the article in— 
               <br />
               cludes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that.</span> It is like our customs duties, and 
               <br />
               that’s another reason why I don’t like the sales 
               <br />
               tax. But the sales tax is not put on everything, and 
               <br />
