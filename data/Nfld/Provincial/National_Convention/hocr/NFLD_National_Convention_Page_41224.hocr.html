               turn to the Canadian govemment’s own estimate

               that their estimate of what the sales tax would

               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, there is one 
               <br />
               statement by Major Cashin that needs to be 
               <br />
               cleared up, and that is his statement that the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland would be compelled to 
               <br />
               pay their proportionate share of running the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada. Just what did he mean 
               <br />
               by that? Take our own government here in New- 
               <br />
               foundland for example, our present government 
               <br />
               or any past government, Does Major Cashin 
               <br />
               mean that the Newfoundland people were not 
               <br />
               compelled to pay their proportionate share of the 
               <br />
               cost of running our government? And what does 
               <br />
               he mean by proportionate? Take this very year. 
               <br />
               The present government are collecting $40 mil— 
               <br />
               lion from all of us in taxes, that is $120 a head, or 
               <br />
               say from a family of ﬁve, $600. That would be 
               <br />
               the proportionate share, $120 a head, or $600 per 
               <br />
               family. Now does every person pay his propor— 
               <br />
               tionate share? Does every family? Of course not, 
               <br />
               because those ﬁgures are only average. Some 
               <br />
               persons and families pay much more, some pay 
               <br />
               much less. The government does not send a bill 
               <br />
               to each person in each family each year for $120. 
               <br />
               Or look at it another way. Does it mean that every 
               <br />
               settlement in the country must pay its propor- 
               <br />
               tionate share? Does our government collect a 
               <br />
               certain ﬁxed amount from every person or every 
               <br />
               family, or every settlement? Of course not, there 
               <br />
               just isn’t any such thing as a proportionate share. 
               <br />
               That’ 5 just a word, and in this connection it means 
               <br />
               nothing. That simply is not the way the Govem- 
               <br />
               mcnt of Canada collects its taxes. It does not start 
               <br />
               off by saying, “Now, we will need so much for 
               <br />
               the next year to run the country; we will collect 
               <br />
               an equal or proportionate amount from every 
               <br />
               person and family in Canada.” Do they do that? 
               <br />
               No, they don’t. Do they say, “We have nine 
               <br />
