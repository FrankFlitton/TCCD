               Mr. Chairman It is time I made my position

               clear on the matter. The debate will be presumed 
               <br />
               to be tentatively closed by virtue of the fact that 
               <br />
               if no member occupies the floor, I must assume 
               <br />
               no member is interested at this moment in ad-

               Report. In view of the fact that it has been found 
               <br />
               that the introduction of Mr. Howell might very 
               <br />
               well result in some new evidence coming before 
               <br />
               the committee, and in view of the fact that a 
               <br />
               motion to adopt would be deferred from day to 
               <br />

               Howell is appearing before the committee of the 
               <br />
               whole, I am afraid, Mr. Smallwood, that I intend 
               <br />
               to call upon Major Cashin to conclude, or tenta- 
               <br />
               tively conclude, the debate on the Economic 
               <br />
               Report. I must assume a member is not interested 
               <br />
               at this moment in addressing himself further if he 
               <br />
               does not rise. I am not going to call members up 
               <br />
               if they do not get up voluntarily. At this time it is 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               or not Mr. Howell is prepared to appear. If he

               does not appear, I think you are justified in as- 
               <br />
