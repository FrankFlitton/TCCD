               Mr. Cashin Mr. Chairman, in moving the ad-

               journment of the House this afternoon until the 
               <br />
               call of the Chair, I’d like to point out that the 
               <br />
               Finance Committee is now in session to prepare 
               <br />
               the Economic Report. It will probably be ready, 
               <br />
               in a week. As every member who has had any- 
               <br />
               thing to do with committees and compiling 
               <br />
               reports knows, a report like this, which is the 
               <br />
               summary of all the reports practically, is going to 
               <br />
               take some time. And whilst we may be able to 
               <br />
               compile it in two or three days, it’s got to be 
               <br />
               mimeographed and collected and so forth, and 
               <br />
               that that’s going to take a few days. And conse- 
               <br />
               quently, Mr. Chairman, I now move that this 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Chairman, I wondered if

               Mr. Asbbourne, who yesterday, on another mo- 
               <br />
               tion, desired to raise a point, could do so. I think 
               <br />
               it’s fairly customary in parliamentary circles for 
               <br />
               a member wishing to bring up a matter which 
               <br />
               doesn‘t quite properly fall under other motions or 
               <br />
               orders of business, to do so on the motion to 
               <br />
               adjourn... I caught enough of it yesterday to

               realise that the matter he was attempting to raise 
               <br />
               was rather important, and while possibly we can 
               <br />
               do nothing whatever about it, possibly he wants 
               <br />
               to ventilate the matter and use the Convention as 
               <br />
               a medium through which to raise a matter of 
               <br />
               grave public concern.

               opportunity which I trust is in order although I

               asked permission yesterday in the committee of

               <br />
               much having been out of order at that time. The 
               <br />
               matter, sir, refers to the convertibility of the

               <br />

               Mr. Ashbourne Thank you very much, Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman. As I was beginning to say yesterday, 
               <br />
               I wasn’t here at the time that this announcement 
               <br />
               was made by the government around September 
               <br />
               20, governing certain shipments of fish, and by 
               <br />
               the way, I understand that it is not for the whole 
               <br />
               catch that this provision has been made. I speak 
               <br />
               subject to correction upon this matter. But the 
               <br />
               important point in my mind is the rate at which 
               <br />
               the sterling proceeds of this ﬁsh is to be converted 
               <br />
               into Newfoundland and Canadian funds. I think 
               <br />
               myself that it’s only right and proper for the trade 
               <br />
               to expect some announcement to be made by the 
               <br />
               government as to the rate at which this exchange 
               <br />
               will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">converted.</span> I understand at the present time 
               <br />
               the rate is something over $4 to the pound; and at 
               <br />
               that rate exporters would be in a position to make 
               <br />
               a price for shore and Labrador ﬁsh. But should 
               <br />
               there be a pound sterling decline, to say $3 to the 
               <br />
               pound, we can readily understand that it would 
               <br />
               mean a cut of 25% in the value received for our 
               <br />
               ﬁsh. And it was this point, sir, that I had in mind 
               <br />
               yesterday. I don’t want to stress the fact now, but 
               <br />
