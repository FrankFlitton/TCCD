               tions which their agents in St. John’s could not 
               <br />
               give. This has now been done. We have received 
               <br />
               answers couched in the very best language of 
               <br />
               British diplomacy. They are very diplomatic 
               <br />
               answers in that they say a lot and say very little, 
               <br />
               and endeavour at the same time to put us very 
               <br />
               firmly in our place. But in this diplomatic lan- 
               <br />
               guage certain sentences have been written down 
               <br />

               <br />
               of twisting or interpretation can alter. I refer you 
               <br />
               to page 5 of my Lord Addison’s memorandum, 
               <br />
               second paragraph, on the base deals: “There is no 
               <br />
               reason to think that the United States Govem- 
               <br />
               ment would be prepared to agree to any substan- 
               <br />
               tial variation of the basis on which the Agreement 
               <br />
               was entered into, or to give any quid pro quo for 
               <br />
               rights which were given to them ‘freely and 
               <br />
               without consideration’. If, however, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ner</span> 
               <br />
               foundland should return to Responsible Govern- 
               <br />
               ment it would be open to her to raise the question 
               <br />
               of some modiﬁcation of the Agreement and in 
               <br />
               that event negotations would no doubt be carried 
               <br />
               out with the assistance of the United Kingdom 
               <br />
               Government ....” There is the answer to the many 
               <br />
               people in this country who wish for a closer 
               <br />
               association with the United States. It bears out 
               <br />
               too what I said during the last debate on the 
               <br />
               motion to send a delegation to Ottawa, that no 
               <br />
               agreements or arrangements of any kind can be 
               <br />
               expected to be made with the United States by 
               <br />
               Newfoundland until this country is once again a 
               <br />
               free agent, able to act through its own responsible 
               <br />
               government ~— that we will never be able to do 
               <br />
               so through either the Dorninions Ofﬁce or the 
               <br />
               Department of External Affairs in Ottawa. Again 
               <br />
               I refer you to page 7, to the answer to the question 
               <br />
               on the “Financing and Control of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               Airports”. After stating that Newfoundland is to 
               <br />
               be responsible for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one~third</span> of the operating 
               <br />
               deficit of Gander, the Secretary of State says: “In 
               <br />
               the event of a return to Responsible Government, 
               <br />
               the Newfoundland authorities will decide their 
               <br />
               policy with respect to the operation of the airport 
               <br />
               and they might if deemed desirable submit a 
               <br />
               request to the international organization for 
               <br />

               These are clear and plain statements. They
