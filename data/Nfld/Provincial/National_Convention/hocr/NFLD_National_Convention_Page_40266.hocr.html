               blame the present Secretary for that. He has not 
               <br />
               been long in this country, and as far as I can find 
               <br />
               out he is thoroughly familiar with the big job that 
               <br />
               lies ahead. I hope and trust he will see that the

               <br />

               <br />
               Transportation Committee has done a good job. 
               <br />
               It certainly covers a lot of ground and gives the

               Convention as well as the whole country much
