               Mr. Vardy Mr. Penney has given the thoughtsI 
               <br />
               had in mind when Major Cashin made the mo- 
               <br />
               tion. I feel if I could go on with the report it would 
               <br />
               be better. We have Mining to come in and then 
               <br />
               Finance and then the delegation to London has to 
               <br />
               move off. This will give us time to consolidate all 
               <br />
               this into the main report. Eventually we all have 
               <br />
               to take our stand here. We have to pick to pieces 
               <br />
               all these reports and it is my ﬁrm conviction that 
               <br />
               Major Cashin will not find himself alone at that 
               <br />
               time I have done all I possibly could to get the 
               <br />
               information he refers to released to the Conven— 
               <br />
               tion and to the people of this country. A whole 
               <br />
               lot of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the‘facts</span> contained in the various docu~ 
               <br />
               merits will be looked into when a fully qualiﬁed 
               <br />
               government takes ofﬁce in this country, and I do 
               <br />
               feel we should do nothing to jeopardise the work 
               <br />
               of the Convention. I would like to see Major 
               <br />
               Cashin reconsider his position. I think we will get 
               <br />
               further in the end. We will all support each other 
               <br />
               when that main report comes before this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion and every man is called upon to speak ac- 
               <br />
               cording to the dictates of his conscience. Let us 
               <br />
               get on with the report. I would again ask Major 
               <br />
               Cashin to please reconsider his motion.

               Mr. Cashin In reply to Mr. Vardy, it looks to me 
               <br />
               like a case of whitewashing. We all know they 
               <br />
               have been dOWn in that department digging up 
               <br />
               things and the report is incomplete. It does not 
               <br />
               contain the right facts and you know it. When we 
               <br />
               go to England I want to know the true statement 
               <br />
               of the Public Health and Welfare Department 
               <br />

               <br />
               Secretary, otherwise how am I to know? The 
               <br />
               department is under a shadow. Clean it up! They 
               <br />
               have been at it six months; it could have been

               Public Health is deliberately hiding facts from

               Mr. Penney I want to tell Major Cashin and the

               Three months ago we were asked to receive a 
               <br />
               conﬁdential report. We were not allowed to use 
               <br />
               it or release it. What have they been doing? Are 
               <br />
               they going on investigating until the Convention 
               <br />
               winds up? I think the people are entitled to know 
               <br />
               about it. I regret very much that I took the con- 
               <br />
               fidential report. Ifl had not taken it I might be 
               <br />

               Mr. Chairman I still suggest that the bringing 
               <br />
               up of this matter on the report of the committee 
               <br />
               is the proper place to hold up the report. In the

               meantime I suggest we let the details ofthe report 
               <br />
               go through. This is a committee of the Conven-

               amend as the committee thinks they ought to be 
               <br />
               amended. When the report comes formally

               has been a nurse on the ship continuously. There

               is a nurse on the ship now.
