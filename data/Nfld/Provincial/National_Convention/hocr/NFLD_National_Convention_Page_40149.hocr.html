               I made a week ago today, to the effect that even 
               <br />
               I was offered a senatorship, and the mover of the 
               <br />
               motion stated a moment ago that he inferred that 
               <br />
               I was alluding to him. To that I will say that I 
               <br />
               always have had a great regard for the reasoning 
               <br />
               powers of the mover of the motion, and I suspect 
               <br />
               strongly that he analysed the whole statement 
               <br />
               before he decided he arrived at a correct inter- 
               <br />
               pretation of the amendment. Now, if, on Monday 
               <br />
               past, I set a sprat to catch a herring, am I to be 
               <br />
               blamed if I caught a confederate cod? I noticed 
               <br />
               the greediness with which the proposer grasped 
               <br />
               at the bait, and Ifeel that he took the bait, the hook 
               <br />
               and all.

               Getting back to the matter of sending a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delega»</span> 
               <br />
               tion to Canada, allow me to refer you to section 
               <br />
               146 of the British North America Act, which 
               <br />
               makes provision for the entry of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               into the Dominion of Canada as a tenth province. 
               <br />
               I shall read it, section 146: “It shall be lawful for 
               <br />
               the Queen, by and with the advice of Her 
               <br />
               Majesty’s Privy Council, on the addresses from 
               <br />
               the Houses of Parliament of Canada and the 
               <br />
               Houses of the respective legislatures of the Com- 
               <br />
               mons of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island 
               <br />
               and British Columbia, to admit those Colonies or 
               <br />
               Provinces, or any of them into the Union.” Does 
               <br />
               that not presuppose that before we can enter into 
               <br />
               any union with the Dominion of Canada that we 
               <br />
               must have a legislature? Some people will say 
               <br />
               you have your Commission of Government, and 
               <br />
               they have the authority of the legislature. That 
               <br />
               may be correct or it may not. If it is, is it not 
               <br />
               therefore the bounden duty of the Commission of 
               <br />
               Government, if they have the power of the legis- 
               <br />
               lature, and if so many people in this country are 
               <br />
               so desirous of confederation, to go to Canada and 
               <br />
               find out the terms? The Dominion of Canada 
               <br />
               would then be negotiating with a legitimate 
               <br />
               government, not with 45 men who were sent in 
               <br />
               here to appraise the resources of this country. 
               <br />
               And, as Mr. Crosbie a moment ago pointed out, 
               <br />
               does it not look ridiculous to you that these 45 
               <br />
               men of this Convention should proceed to 
               <br />
               Canada without even knowing the extent of our 
               <br />
               natural resources, without even knowing just 
               <br />
               how our ﬁnances are? In what position are we to 
               <br />
               ask Canada to lay her cards on the table if we 
               <br />
               ourselves are unable to put ours down? I wish it 
               <br />
               to be clearly understood that I am not against 
               <br />
               confederation and I am not for confederation, and

               as Mr. Bradley from Bonavista said, I am not for

               or against responsible government, and neither 
               <br />

               what we are not for, should have been left to the 
               <br />
               time when we had gotten those facts which our 
               <br />
               people sent us here for. But when one member, 
               <br />
               whom I shall now call the senior member for 
               <br />
               Bonavista, elects to get on his feet on the floor of 
               <br />
               this house and make a political speech on the 
               <br />
               issue of COnfederation one hour long, and then 
               <br />
               reply for another half hour, then I submit that I or 
               <br />
               anyone else who did not get up and object to his 
               <br />
               motion would be failing in our duty to the people 
               <br />
               who sent us here. I do not wish to say anything 
               <br />
               more on confederation or responsible govem- 
               <br />
               ment or Commission of Government at this 
               <br />
               present time. I do think we are wasting an awful 
               <br />
               lot of time, and I submit that the quicker we get 
               <br />
               down to a vote on this issue and have done with 
               <br />
               it the better. 
               <br />
               Mr. Bradley As I said perhaps an hour ago, I 
               <br />
               can sympathise with those members of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Con~</span> 
               <br />
               vention who fear that we may be acting too 
               <br />
               precipitately. I tried on that occasion to explain 
               <br />
               to them that acting now did not mean an imme- 
               <br />
               diate delegation to Canada... Obviously if we 
               <br />
               defer the passage of this resolution until some 
               <br />
               later date, by an equal space of time will the 
               <br />
               departure of the delegates be deferred Why then 
               <br />
               should we defer the institution of these inquiries 
               <br />
               until we have ﬁnished the inquiries upon which 
               <br />
               our various committees are engaged today? If we 
               <br />
               do that it is perfectly obvious that when we have 
               <br />
               the ﬁnancial picture of the country before us we 
               <br />
               shall not have the terms of confederation, and the 
               <br />
               same thing exactly applies to any inquiries which 
               <br />
               may be directed to the United Kingdom... 
               <br />
               Already in the press a rather indiscreet and 
               <br />
               untimely reference has been made to adjourn- 
               <br />
               ments of this Convention, in utter ignorance of 
               <br />
               the facts. There are few, if any, members of this 
               <br />
               Convention who desire to prolong it any further 
               <br />
               than necessary. It has been stated that this is 
               <br />
               costing the country somewhere in the neighbour- 
               <br />
               hood of $1,000 a day. I have never taken the 
               <br />
               trouble to compute the amount so I can neither 
               <br />
               conﬁrm or deny the correctness of that statement. 
               <br />
               I have no desire to expend money belonging to 
               <br />
               the people of this country, and I feel that every 
               <br />
               member is of the same opinion, and if we are to
