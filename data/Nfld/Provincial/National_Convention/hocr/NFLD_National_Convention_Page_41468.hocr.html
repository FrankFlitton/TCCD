               trouble. The dollar bills just showered down in 
               <br />
               this rock-candy mountain. But I have a recollec— 
               <br />
               tion that Britain had a balanced budget and a large 
               <br />
               surplus. I don’t think Mr. Smallwood or anyone 
               <br />
               else would admit that she was in a strong, healthy 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial position. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'The</span> reason was, she did not 
               <br />
               have exports to buy her imports. You can always 
               <br />
               balance a budget with a printing press. You can 
               <br />
               also export with the same, but the time comes 
               <br />
               when even that won’t give you the market. 
               <br />
               Britain was in straits although she had a balanced 
               <br />
               budget, because she did not have exports to pay 
               <br />
               for the imports. Canada is in a jam because the 
               <br />
               countries she can export to have not the exports 
               <br />
               or gold to pay for Canada’s exports; a vicious 
               <br />
               circle, Mr. Smallwood, but then just the same I’ll 
               <br />
               forgive you. It’s a world’s saying that journalists 
               <br />
               and lawyers are the world’s worst economists. 
               <br />
               But you must tell people that you know how you 
               <br />
               must keep it up. “Would that God that gift would 
               <br />
               to give us To see ourselves as others see us.”

               I am trying to show this Convention the holes 
               <br />
               that are in this proposition, and I think you can 
               <br />
               row through them. I have a decision to make, and 
               <br />
               I must show the reason <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">why’</span> I am making that 
               <br />
               decision. In referring to my speech on the 
               <br />
               municipal taxes, Mr. Smallwood said I was 
               <br />
               shrewd, as I knew what hurt people. Taxes, yes. 
               <br />
               Nothing hurts like taxes, especially when you 
               <br />
               have nothing to pay them with. And there is a law 
               <br />
               saying they must be paid, or else. Now again, I 
               <br />
               must agree with Mr. Smallwood’s explanation 
               <br />
               that the federal government does not tax property. 
               <br />
               I think that’s clear to everybody, for the Black 
               <br />
               Books stated that is left for the municipal govem- 
               <br />
               ment, not town councils -— there are no town 
               <br />
               councils mentioned in the Black Books, they are 
               <br />
               called municipal governments. I also agree with 
               <br />
               him that the provincial government does not tax 
               <br />
               property unless there is no municipal govern- 
               <br />
               ment. Take the case of PEI, the provincial 
               <br />
               government there and the school districts do tax 
               <br />
               property as throughout the other eight provinces. 
               <br />
               The municipal governments do tax property and 
               <br />
               they collect as much in this tax as one~third to a 
               <br />
               half the revenues of the provincial government, 
               <br />
               and when it was put before the Ottawa delegation 
               <br />
               that we could not run the province on what we 
               <br />
               would get from the federal government, the 
               <br />
               answer was, “Use up your surplus or put on more 
               <br />
               taxes.” And we will ﬁnd out when that royal 
               <br />

               commission comes here that they will show the 
               <br />
               provincial government how to go about it, and 
               <br />
               then fur will fly. I am, shall I say, brutally frank. 
               <br />
               I tell them they will be taxed and I’m going to 
               <br />
               have a lot of fun out of it, because if we go into 
               <br />
               confederation, for a few years in this country it 
               <br />
               will be as good as seeing the “Pirates of Pen- 
               <br />
               zance”. I know I won’t be in any government, 
               <br />
               municipal or provincial, that will have to put 
               <br />
               them on. I am going to try to show the people the 
               <br />
               taxes the provinces are using to give them the 
               <br />
               conveniences they are having. I am going to let 
               <br />
               them read them themselves, and if it does not 
               <br />
               change them, and if they get them, it is their own 
               <br />
               hard luck. If I were an ardent confederate I would 
               <br />
               do that, forI know our people and I want to live 
               <br />
               with them, and I know that if you fool them, they 
               <br />
               have long memories. I believe this time that 
               <br />
               Shakespeare’s quotation will be very apt only it 
               <br />
               will include men as well as women. I don’t want 
               <br />
               to be one to fool the people.

               tions in Newfoundland as they have in Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia. That is the battle cry of those who favour 
               <br />
               this form of government. It is strange to me that 
               <br />
               in the years I have lived and worked amongst 
               <br />
               those people I did not ﬁnd it so. The sea was 
               <br />
               always a struggle, the Gaspé coast bleak with its 
               <br />
               small ﬁshing villages, no harbours, their homes 
               <br />
               like any ﬁshing Village, say Pouch Cove or Por- 
               <br />
               tugal Cove. The homes, some better than others, 
               <br />
               some worse. You won’t ﬁnd the chesterfrelds 
               <br />
               there, but you’ll find the settle of our father’s day, 
               <br />
               hand carved by some old habitant. The land is 
               <br />
               better than ours on the whole, with the exception 
               <br />
               of Howley and Codroy Valley, but to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁsherv</span>

               the same as here, from the boat to the garden and 
               <br />
               when the ﬁshery fails, the woods. There is no 
               <br />
               luxury. The province has a back log. They have 
               <br />
               their factories and the large port of Montreal to 
               <br />
               take up the slack, but we have no factories here 
               <br />
               to give our people case from these taxes, neither 
               <br />
               have we the great port of Montreal, or any other, 
               <br />
               to ease our ﬁshermen’s burdens. Montreal col—
