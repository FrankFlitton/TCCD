               <br />
               that the railway is in a fairly good condition, 
               <br />
               basically. When the railway was built, the con- 
               <br />
               tractors were paid by the mile, and they were not 
               <br />
               too particular about how they built <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> For in- 
               <br />
               stance a lot of culverts were built of wood, and 
               <br />
               the wood rotted and had to be replaced. Now it is 
               <br />
               true, in recent years they have replaced a number 
               <br />
               of those with concrete culverts. A certain amount 
               <br />
               of ballasting was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">done,</span> In other respects the 
               <br />
               railway is in better condition than it has been for 
               <br />
               years. But the main line has to be re-railed. That 
               <br />
               will call for a better roadbed. That will run into 
               <br />
               money. How much is any man’s guess. They 
               <br />
               have to buy seven new locomotives, and a lot of 
               <br />
               new rolling stock. If the railway were good, they 
               <br />
               would not have to re-rail the line, buy locomo- 
               <br />
               tives and buy rolling stock. But when the Com- 
               <br />
               mittee visited the Railway and spent an afternoon 
               <br />
               with Mr. Ryan, that matter was raised. It was 
               <br />
               admitted that at the end of World War I they had 
               <br />
               a completely worn—out railway. There were lives 
               <br />
               lost and people maimed on account of the condi- 
               <br />
               tion of the railway, because of the trafﬁc it had to 
               <br />
               carry, and which no one anticipated it would 
               <br />
               carry. The question was put to Mr. Ryan, “The 
               <br />
               railway has been called upon to carry tremendous 
               <br />
               amount of trafﬁc during the war years, is it now 
               <br />
               as worn-out as it was at the end of the last war?” 
               <br />
               He said, “No, it is distinctly better now than at the 
               <br />
               end of the last war.” Because, he told us, during 
               <br />
               the war years they did spend some money on the 
               <br />
               roadbed, and some money on rolling stock and 
               <br />
               some on general <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">upkeep...</span> It is better than it was 
               <br />
               but is far from being perfect and a lot of money 
               <br />
               has to be spent to make it ordinarily efficient and 
               <br />
               workable.

               Mr. Hollett Mr. Smallwood said something 
               <br />
               about not congratulating ourselves on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">condi»</span> 
               <br />
               tion of the railway. It seemed to me he was 
               <br />
               pleased with the condition of the railway. Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood said that at the end of World War I 
               <br />
               we had an absolutely wom-out railway, would he 
               <br />
               tell me what the government has done in regard 
               <br />
               to that?

               Mr. Smallwood When the railway was wom- 
               <br />
               out, it was owned by the Reids. The Reids kept 
               <br />
               coming to the government with this, that and the 
               <br />
               other proposition and ﬁnally the government had 
               <br />
               to step in. They appointed a Railway Commis- 
               <br />
               sion and they brought in railway experts. The

               upshot was that in 1923 the government bought 
               <br />
               out the railway from the Reids. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett What did they do with the railway?

               Mr. Smallwood When the government bought 
               <br />

               There are always improvements going <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on,</span> For 
               <br />
               a small country, it is a mighty system. Naturally, 
               <br />
               capital expenditure has had to be made —— sta- 
               <br />

               <br />
               clockwork. 
               <br />
               Mr. Miller I think the point is now very clear 
               <br />
               that the management of the Railway in the lean 
               <br />
               years did a good job. When war came along we 
               <br />
               had a railway system which might have carried 
               <br />
               on for a long period to serve our needs, but an 
               <br />
               excessive burden was thrown on it I cannot be 
               <br />
               reconciled to the fact the Newfoundland should 
               <br />
               be saddled with an expenditure on a railway 
               <br />
               which helped fight a war, beyond our means. 
               <br />
               Someone else should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pay.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett What I cannot understand is, one 
               <br />
               statement says the railway is worn out, and 
               <br />
               another says it is in better condition than ever. 
               <br />
               Mr. Butt Basically, it is in a better condition. 
               <br />
               They have put in new culverts; done a lot of 
               <br />
               ballasting; taken off curves; have built new sheds 
               <br />
               which will last for long periods; have put gravity 
               <br />
               feed in the water system. Basically the railway 
               <br />
               has an outﬁt better than before... 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett I wish to draw attention to this 
               <br />
               particular <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">report.</span> You will note that everything 
               <br />
               we have in this country is absolutely worn out and 
               <br />
               should be scrapped. It is tragic. We have to throw 
               <br />
               the postal telegraphs in the Narrows and get in a 
               <br />
               new system. The railway has to be re—railed. 
               <br />
               Everything this report touches has to be scrapped. 
               <br />
               That is an important thing to remember when we 
               <br />
               are discussing forms of government. What <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">par.</span> 
               <br />
               ticular form of government is able to afford that? 
               <br />
               When we come to sum up, we will have to bear 
               <br />
               that in mind. 
               <br />
               Mr. Job Are we now discussing the report, not 
               <br />
               only on posts and telegraphs, but the general 
               <br />
               report? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Yes. 
               <br />
               Mr. Job We have not had any general picture of 
               <br />
               what all these six items are going to cost the 
               <br />
               country. As a member of the Finance Committee, 
               <br />
               I may say we are rather interested in ﬁnding out 
               <br />
               what that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is....</span> I take it from this report that the 
               <br />
               Finance Committee will have to estimate a rise
