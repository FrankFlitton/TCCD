               There were several notes I took during the 
               <br />
               debate in connection with the Economic Report 
               <br />

               <br />
               will try to the best of my ability to answer the 
               <br />
               questions asked. The ﬁrst one was asked by Mr. 
               <br />
               Northcott. I was not here that afternoon, but I 
               <br />
               understand it was how much gasoline comes into 
               <br />
               Lewisporte, lands at Gander and on which no 
               <br />
               duty is paid. I think it is 10-12 million gallons. If 
               <br />
               we got one cent a gallon on it, it would mean 
               <br />
               $120,000.

               Mr. Burry asked what authority we had for the 
               <br />
               forecasts regarding this development on the 
               <br />
               Labrador. In reply, I would say we understand 
               <br />
               there is a piece of legislation, which has received 
               <br />
               its ﬁrst or second reading, whereby a railway is 
               <br />
               to be built by the Labrador Mining Company 
               <br />
               from the St. Lawrence River right into this mine; 
               <br />
               150 miles of this territory is Newfoundland’s, 
               <br />
               and the balance is Canadian. This piece of legis— 
               <br />
               lation is in the course of being adopted or 
               <br />
               negotiated with the Commission of Government. 
               <br />
               In connection with this 350 miles of railway, if 
               <br />
               my estimates are worth anything, it will cost that 
               <br />
               company in docks, loading piers and rolling 
               <br />
               stock, something around <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3</span> 100 million. I saw Mr. 
               <br />
               Timmins, President of the Labrador Mining 
               <br />
               Company, and he told me that this railway and 
               <br />
               docks would cost in the vicinity of $65 million. 
               <br />
               Half this railway is to be built in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               territory and considerable labour will be given 
               <br />
               our people... Mr. Timmins would not be inter- 
               <br />
               ested in speculating such vast amounts of money

               <br />
               ment, these interests checked the reserves of iron 
               <br />
               ore in the Mesabi Range and I was told that from 
               <br />
               their investigation they felt that high grade ore on 
               <br />
               the Mesabi Range would be depleted within ten 
               <br />
               years, consequently they were taking no chances. 
               <br />
               Mr. Timmins told me that he felt that within ten 
               <br />
               years ten million tons of iron ore would be 
               <br />
               produced annually. The big steel mills in the 
               <br />
               United States consume 100 million tons of ore 
               <br />
               annually. When the Mesabi Range is closed out 
               <br />
               there is only one place. The Labrador Company‘s 
               <br />
               property is good. Everyone is optimistic about it, 
               <br />
               and we ﬁnd stock which went on the market at 
               <br />
               $l is now selling up to $8 and $9. There must be 
               <br />
               something to it. I have great faith in Labrador, 
               <br />
               and I think it is our greatest potential asset. In 
               <br />
               preparing this report in connection with Labrador 
               <br />
               we were conservative. Within ten years Labrador 
               <br />
               mineral deposits should be able to pay off the 
               <br />
               national debt of Newfoundland.

               In connection with the timber areas on the 
               <br />
               Labrador, when we went into the Forestry 
               <br />
               Reportl there was some question about the 
               <br />
               amount of timber available for pulp and paper. 
               <br />
               Mr. Burry was rather dubious as to the estimates 
               <br />
               of 50 million cords on the Labrador. Finally we 
               <br />
               brought in a supplementary report after we had 
               <br />
               had an interview with the General Manager of 
               <br />
               Bowaters, and in the Hamilton-Melville area 
               <br />
               alone there was shown to be 25 million cords. I 
               <br />
               realise timber in Labrador is difﬁcult to transport 
               <br />
               as navigation is open only four months a year; but 
               <br />
               I am conﬁdent that within the next ﬁve or ten 
               <br />
               years the forest areas of North America will 
               <br />
               become depleted, even in Quebec. Then there 
               <br />
               will be only one place to go, and that is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Labrador.</span> 
               <br />
               That is why we discussed the possibility of a mill 
               <br />
               on the southwest coast. I discussed that matter 
               <br />
               with the General Manager of Bowaters — they 
               <br />
               were not interested at the present time, but the 
               <br />
               newsprint industry is now flourishing, they can— 
               <br />
               not meet the demand, they have contracts signed 
               <br />
               for the next ten years... There is 150,000 horse- 
               <br />
               power in Bay D’Espoir which can be developed 
               <br />
               fairly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reasonably.</span> Consequently, we felt that in
