               Mr. Cashin It is higher. I am certain it is higher, 
               <br />
               particularly in the western part of Canada. If we 
               <br />
               are in the Dominion, it affects us from here to 
               <br />
               Vancouver. I think today they are looking for 
               <br />
               30% increase in passenger and freight rates. 
               <br />
               During the war period these railways made con- 
               <br />
               siderable money because of war trafﬁc. Now they 
               <br />
               are getting back to peacetime; the position is they 
               <br />
               cannot make the grade. The Canadian National 
               <br />
               Railways took over the Grand Trunk Railway 
               <br />
               after it became bankrupt. The Canadian National 
               <br />
               is the largest publicly-owned railway; the 
               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc is the largest privately—owned, 
               <br />
               running on its own. Just prior to the war the 
               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc were in such difﬁculties that 
               <br />
               they had to go to the government which had to 
               <br />
               guarantee them a loan. They started paying back 
               <br />
               interest on common stock. Today it is practically 
               <br />
               as bad as ours. With regard to our rolling stock, 
               <br />
               we have information that the Railway spent $1 
               <br />
               million in converting our locomotives from coal 
               <br />
               to oil. If Canada takes over, they will be taking 
               <br />
               over locomotives in ﬁrst class condition.

               Mr. Chairman This proportional increase of

               Mr. Crosbie and some other progressive ﬁrms
