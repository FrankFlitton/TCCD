               one; there are others but I am not prepared to 
               <br />
               make any other suggestions. I do say that there 
               <br />
               are other forms coming up for discussion when 
               <br />
               the time comes. I am not prepared and may not 
               <br />
               then be prepared... I do not know enough about 
               <br />
               constitutional government and about confedera- 
               <br />
               tion with Canada, and just how we would come 
               <br />
               out if we decided to get into confederation. I 
               <br />
               would like to know more and have an opportunity 
               <br />
               of thinking it over.... Personally I do not feel I 
               <br />
               could progress as willingly with the work of the 
               <br />
               Convention if I did not feel that I would have the 
               <br />
               information which would enable me to discuss 
               <br />
               confederation with Canada. I know there is a 
               <br />
               majority of people in this country and in Labrador 
               <br />
               who are thinking that this matter of confederation 
               <br />
               with Canada is a possible way out of our apparent 
               <br />
               difﬁculties and in getting a decent living for our 
               <br />
               people. They may be wrong in that; but there is a 
               <br />
               considerable number of such people in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New«</span> 
               <br />
               foundland and Labrador and we should satisfy 
               <br />
               them by bringing in intelligent observations on 
               <br />
               that form of government. I feel that I must vote 
               <br />
               for the resolution in order to get information 
               <br />
               about other forms of government. I do not feel 
               <br />
               any member of this Convention would want to 
               <br />
               deny the people this information. If the 
               <br />
               machinery is not set up it will delay the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion, and I do not want to be here longer than I 
               <br />
               have to be. It is unfair to us if the Convention 
               <br />
               votes down this motion; other men are getting 
               <br />
               information about other forms of government; I 
               <br />
               feel that I should get this information and the 
               <br />
               machinery should be set up to get it.

               Mr. Vincent After listening to yesterday‘s stor—
