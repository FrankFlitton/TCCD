               foundland situation Mr. Plumptre says, “It ap—

               pears on the evidence of the Report (meaning the 
               <br />
               Amulree Report) that Newfoundland had an 
               <br />
               incontrovertible case for honourable default <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">_.</span> a 
               <br />
               case which was even stronger in its economic 
               <br />
               aspect than that of Great Britain a few months 
               <br />
               earlier.” But Newfoundland was not allowed to 
               <br />
               take advantage of such a course because of the 
               <br />
               efforts of a combine consisting of the British 
               <br />
               government, the Canadian bankers and our own 
               <br />
               prime minister at that time. The report says that 
               <br />
               Newfoundland was led to ask for assistance from 
               <br />
               the United Kingdom. I contend the word “led” is 
               <br />
               not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accurate.</span> It should rather read we were mer- 
               <br />
               cilessly dragged and driven into the pit prepared 
               <br />
               for us. And above all in its signiﬁcance, this 
               <br />
               report completely ignores the fact that the Alder- 
               <br />
               dice government with whom they were dealing 
               <br />
               was acting in callous violation of its election 
               <br />
               pledges; that the whole thing was dripping with 
               <br />
               treachery and broken faith, and that the British 
               <br />
               government was fully aware that it was dealing 
               <br />
               with leaders who had been traitors to their 
               <br />
               country and who were agents acting without any 
               <br />
               legal authority. And it is from reports of this kind 
               <br />
               that they apparently expect us to base the discus— 
               <br />
               sions of this Convention. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Let me give you just one more example. The 
               <br />
               second paragraph of the report begins in this 
               <br />
               fashion: “The Commission has now been in of- 
               <br />
               ﬁce for twelve years. During the first half of that 
               <br />
               period the Island was in ﬁnancial difficulties.” In 
               <br />
               these few words the report condemns itself. We 
               <br />
               were supposed to surrender our political freedom 
               <br />
               on the clear understanding that our ﬁnancial dif- 
               <br />
               ficulties would be removed. That was both the 
               <br />
               word and the spirit of the negotiations between 
               <br />
               our government and the British government, and 
               <br />
               what happens. This report coolly admits that after 
               <br />
               faithfully performing our part of the agreement 
               <br />
               and sacriﬁcing our national honour we were 
               <br />
               simply left to bow deeper under worse financial 
               <br />
               difﬁculties for six whole years. That instead of 
               <br />
               keeping their agreement, they led us into a valley 
               <br />
               of poverty and misery, which condemned 70,000 
               <br />
               of our people to the whiplash of dole, and caused 
               <br />
               us to experience a period of national suffering

               ourselves to be inﬂuenced by writings which are

               that the first duty of this assembly is the removal 
               <br />

               date, and indicates what should be the starting
