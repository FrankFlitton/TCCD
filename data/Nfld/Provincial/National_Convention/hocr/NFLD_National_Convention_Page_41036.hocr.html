               count. The law provides that every single cent 
               <br />
               that comes to a government in a year must go into 
               <br />
               the Consolidated Revenue Fund, every single 
               <br />
               cent no matter what it is. It may be conscience 
               <br />
               money, it may be $1.30 that someone cheated the 
               <br />
               government out of and he sends it in anonymous- 
               <br />
               ly, and that $130 by law has to go into the 
               <br />
               Consolidated Revenue Fund. If the government 
               <br />
               borrows money, what it borrows has to go into 
               <br />
               the CRF. If it gets interest on money that it loaned 
               <br />
               to somebody, and that somebody now pays back 
               <br />
               interest each year, that has to go into the CRF. 
               <br />
               Every cent that the government receives in any 
               <br />
               shape or form must by law go into the CRF. Now 
               <br />
               when you put it there, you can call it this, that or 
               <br />
               the other. Within the CRF you can set up various 
               <br />
               subsidiary funds, but the CRF is the 
               <br />
               govemment’s money. That is what it takes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in.</span> Not 
               <br />
               one cent can be paid out of the CRF except on the 
               <br />
               authority of Parliament. Not one cent can be paid 
               <br />
               out of it except what Parliment orders. In a 
               <br />
               country like Britain you have two men who are 
               <br />
               appointed by Parliament itself, the Comptroller 
               <br />
               of the Treasury and the Auditor General. The 
               <br />
               Comptroller is there to see that every cent goes 
               <br />
               into the CRF, and that not one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cent'is</span> paid out 
               <br />
               without the consent of Parliment. The Auditor 
               <br />
               General audits the accounts and sees that they are 
               <br />
               audited in the various funds. Here in New- 
               <br />
               foundland the two jobs are done by the one man. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               So what kind of thinking is it, what kind of 
               <br />
               argument is it, to quarrel about whether or not the 
               <br />
               interest payments that the government receives 
               <br />
               from the Housing Corporation, or anyone else 
               <br />
               that the government has loaned money to 
               <br />
               should not be counted as revenue? Every cent the 
               <br />
               government receives is revenue. It may not be 
               <br />
               revenue received by taxation, but every cent the 
               <br />
               government receives is revenue. So please, no 
               <br />
               matter what private organisation of business or 
               <br />
               ﬁnance may do, no matter what is their system of 
               <br />
               accounting, no matter what their system may be 
               <br />
               of balance sheets, it has nothing to do with public 
               <br />
               accounting. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">»</span>

               Now if Mr. Hickman, or any other gentleman 
               <br />
               in this Convention, is disposed to doubt what I 
               <br />
               am saying there is a simple way to solve it. Go 
               <br />
               down to the public library and take up any of the 
               <br />
               50 books that are there on public finance; not 
               <br />
               private, or corporation, or banking ﬁnance, but 
               <br />
               public finance. If you don’t want to spend that

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               much time, as l have done, reading dozens of 
               <br />
               books on public ﬁnance go down to the Auditor 
               <br />
               General, or the Fiance Commissioner, or anyone 
               <br />
               who has any knowledge, practical or theoretical. 
               <br />
               and you will find out if what I say is true or 
               <br />
               fooling. So I say this: the Housing Corporation, 
               <br />
               or other housing outﬁts who have had money 
               <br />
               loaned to them in the past and who now pay back 
               <br />
               interest and principal for many years to come. 
               <br />
               that money is income and revenue for the 
               <br />
               Government of Nefoundland, no doubt about it. 
               <br />
               Do you suppose that with the best Auditor 
               <br />
               General that we have ever had in our lives, do you 
               <br />
               suppose that with a Commissioner for Finance 
               <br />
               who is a practical financial man, that when they 
               <br />
               show revenue from the Housing Corporation as 
               <br />
               revenue, that they don’t know what they are 
               <br />
               doing? Ofcourse they know what they are doing. 
               <br />
               They are following orthodox and established 
               <br />
               public ﬁnance practices. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now similarly, the other point that Mr. Hick- 
               <br />
               man made was this: the Newfoundland govern- 
               <br />
               ment agreed a year or so ago to buy back <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> 
               <br />
               the Government of Canada whatever they own 
               <br />
               out there in Gander —— equipment of all kinds. 
               <br />
               They got for $1 million what it cost the Canadian 
               <br />
               government $25 million to put there. They agreed 
               <br />
               to pay that in three annual installments of 
               <br />
               $333,000. The Government of Canada says they 
               <br />
               will pay that back if we become a province, so in 
               <br />
               two years that means $666,000 which will come 
               <br />
               in to the Government of Newfoundland in cash. 
               <br />
               On top of that the Newfoundland government 
               <br />
               placed an order in Scotland to build three boats, 
               <br />
               one ofthem is the Cabot Srruil on duty now, and 
               <br />
               the other two are still being built and will he done 
               <br />
               very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">soon.</span> The Canadian government says that if 
               <br />
               we become a province they will pay back the cash 
               <br />
               we paid out for these two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">boats,</span> It is a couple of 
               <br />
               million dollars, or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">more...</span> That is revenue of the 
               <br />
               government. Now let us say that we are the 
               <br />
               cabinet. We say, “All right gentlemen, we just 
               <br />
               received a cheque from the Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 
               <br />
               Canada for $2 million, what will we do with it?" 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett and Mr. Hickman give their ideas. To 
               <br />
               begin with we have no choice, it has to go into 
               <br />
               the CRF, but now what will we do with it? Will 
               <br />
               we spend it all the first year, or in two years, or 
               <br />
               eight years? According to my plan we divide it 
               <br />
               by eight, and spend $255,000 a year. Now what 
               <br />
               is wrong with that? We are the cabinet, and we 
               <br />
