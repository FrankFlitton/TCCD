               word about ﬁsh offal. It may not be known to Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood, but about 70 years ago, my ﬁrm lost 
               <br />
               £20,000 trying to deal with fish offal. It has a very

               enticing appearance, you sell all this stuff being 
               <br />
               thrown away. You think, “This is ridiculous”, but 
               <br />
               I am sorry to say my firm and others put up 
               <br />
               factories in Catalina, Bay Bulls and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">L’Anse—au»</span>

               <br />
               very nearly mined us. The day will come when 
               <br />
               fish offal will be used, but it depends on the 
               <br />
               question of centralisation of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁsheries,</span> Mr. 
               <br />
               Crosbie is doing a lot towards that. I hope it will 
               <br />
               be a successful adjunct. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood There was a time when we got 
               <br />
               500,000 sealskins a year; if we get it back to 
               <br />
               200,000 it will be good. Even these could be 
               <br />
               made into boots and shoes and consumed locally 
               <br />
               — manufactured locally for the home market. I 
               <br />
               have seen in the States pocket books, women’s 
               <br />
               purses, all kinds of leather goods made in 
               <br />
               England and exhibited in the States and Canada, 
               <br />
               paying the high duty and selling. In New York 
               <br />
               you will see a fine class of leather goods made in 
               <br />
               England, and on which they pay high <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">duty.</span> I was

               Mr. Higgins Well, you corroborated Major 
               <br />
               Cashin’s ideas in the matter, and the suggestion 
               <br />

               tion with salaries after all did not warrant the 
               <br />
               protection they were receiving. The suggestion 
               <br />
               was that the protection is not given in other 
               <br />
               countries I believe those familiar with Canadian
