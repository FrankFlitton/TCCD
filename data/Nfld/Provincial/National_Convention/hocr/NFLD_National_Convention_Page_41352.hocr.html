               <br />
               how I feel about the Dominions Ofﬁce. I say now 
               <br />
               about this ballot that I said is tucked away in the 
               <br />
               rolltop desk, what a pity that individual did not 
               <br />
               send it on to us 12 or 14 months ago, and save us 
               <br />
               the trouble and expense of this long drawn out 
               <br />
               Convention. However, let us hope that we have 
               <br />
               gotten some beneﬁt out of these sessions. Now in 
               <br />
               making that statement, much as I have con- 
               <br />
               demned this Convention, and I have called it 
               <br />
               everything, I think there has been some good 
               <br />
               come out of it. One thing came out of it, we as 
               <br />
               members of this National Convention, from 
               <br />
               various sections of the country, have met here 
               <br />
               together and we have made warm friendships 
               <br />
               whichI feel will last for life. Some of us who have 
               <br />
               not had any parliamentary experience have 
               <br />
               learned considerably about it, and a lot about 
               <br />
               government affairs, which without this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion they would never have learned, and conse- 
               <br />
               quently I feel that is one bit of good the 
               <br />
               Convention has probably done.

               Mr. Cashin All right, sir. I have often heard 
               <br />
               “two minutes to go", and my friend Mr. Bailey 
               <br />
               often heard that too. If we have succeeded in 
               <br />
               showing our people that Newfoundland is today 
               <br />

               <br />
               have brought to their notice the great potential 
               <br />
               wealth of Labrador, if it has enabled us to remove 
               <br />
               some of the smear campaign which has been 
               <br />
               directed on our public men of the past, then I 
               <br />
               believe to that extent the work will not have been 
               <br />
               in vain. I have every conﬁdence that a majority 
               <br />
               of this Convention will vote for the motion now 
               <br />
               before the Chair. Perhaps some of those who vote 
               <br />
               for it may do so for reasons of political strategy

               <br />
               I am sure that the great majority will vote for the

               Now sir, for a few minutes I will just refer 
               <br />
               briefly to our Economic Report, which was based 
               <br />
               on every report that was brought in here during 
               <br />
               the past 14 or 15 months, our Economic Report 
               <br />
               which says that this country at the present time is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self‘supporting.</span> That report was unanimously 
               <br />
               adopted by this Convention — the only report 
               <br />
               that was adopted unanimously. When we 
               <br />
               presented our Economic Report, we were most 
               <br />
               conservative in our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">views,</span> We felt that the future 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland is better really than we could 
               <br />
               take the chance of telling the people; they would 
               <br />
               think we were faking the report. We did not take 
               <br />
               into consideration the potential wealth of 
               <br />
               Labrador, that in Labrador, within ﬁve or ten 
               <br />
               years, there will be developed the most out- 
               <br />
               standing iron ore mines in the world, on the North 
               <br />
               American continent at any rate. Nearly 10 million 
               <br />
               tons of iron ore, or possibly 100 million tons a 
               <br />
               year. I also wish to point out to Mr. Smallwood, 
               <br />
               who tells us the Commission government was so 
               <br />
               honest, they gave away this water-power on the 
               <br />
               Labrador practically for nothing.

               power. Honest? I do not think they are fools. I

               challenge anyone from the Dominions Ofﬁce to

               <br />
               piece of plundering I ever heard of! If an ordinary
