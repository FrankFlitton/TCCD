               having gone through that experience, having had 
               <br />
               contact with it, I make the statement that I fear

               is no idle expression of mine when I say that. 
               <br />
               People will say to me, “It does not have to happen 
               <br />

               have to say is that it may happen again and I do 
               <br />
               not want to take a chance on it. We have no

               people are on the dole in this country and in

               Labrador.... I have no doubt but the long and 
               <br />
               hungry month of March will add other thousands 
               <br />
               to the long list on the dole. There are indications 
               <br />
               of hard times coming to this country. As I sit in 
               <br />
               this Convention within these sheltered walls, sur— 
               <br />
               rounded by the conveniences and comforts of city 
               <br />
               life which I have enjoyed for the past 16 months, 
               <br />
               I ﬁnd I am not as keenly sensitive of what is going 
               <br />
               on in this country and in Labrador, I am not as 
               <br />
               sensitive as perhaps I might be. But the doors of 
               <br />
               this Convention will not close very long before I 
               <br />
               will be smack up against that kind of thing again. 
               <br />
               And, sir, if it has to come; if I have to face it again 
               <br />
               and go through it, in my work, I do not want to 
               <br />
               have to say to myself that I should not have given 
               <br />
               support to the kind of government under which 
               <br />
               this kind of thing exists. Let us try something else. 
               <br />
               There is another way out, to my mind. I feel I 
               <br />
               cannot conscientiously support return of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respon«</span>

               As far as Commission of Government is con-

               <br />
               past 16 months, beginning from the very early 
               <br />
               days. It has been a left to the jaw and a right to 
               <br />
               the jaw and some of the punches have been under 
               <br />
               the belt. I want to go on record again as saying I 
               <br />
               am not going to be a part of all the punches given 
               <br />

               Commission of Government has been 
               <br />
               described as a caretaker government. It has been 
               <br />
               that, and the time has come when we can take care 
               <br />
               of ourselves. The time has come for the Commis—

               ful of what it has done for the Eskimos in the 
               <br />
               Labrador trading project. They had a big problem 
               <br />
               on their hands. About 1,000 Eskimos were scat- 
               <br />
               tered among the islands, no means of making a 
               <br />
               living; lots of ﬁsh, but they had no means of 
               <br />
               catching it. Now after a few years of Commission 
               <br />
               of Government, many of these Eskimos have the 
               <br />
               means whereby they can make an honest living, 
               <br />
               and when the time comes to adopt a form of 
               <br />
               government to take over control, will have a great 
               <br />
               foundation to work upon, especially in northern 
               <br />
               Labrador. A great future is in store for them under 
               <br />
               a proper form of government. I shudder to think 
               <br />
               what would have happened if it had not been for 
               <br />
               the interference of Commission government on 
               <br />
