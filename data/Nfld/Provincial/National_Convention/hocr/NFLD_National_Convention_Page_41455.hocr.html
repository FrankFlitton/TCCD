               How vastly different is the whole prospect 
               <br />
               today. Canada is a rich and powerful nation — 
               <br />
               no longer a strange and foreign land, but a friend- 
               <br />
               ly neighbour in which many thousands of our 
               <br />
               own Newfoundland people are prospeting at this 
               <br />
               very moment. And our Newfoundland people are 
               <br />
               educated today, they are better informed, they 
               <br />
               read the newspaper and magazines, they have 
               <br />
               radios, they have relatives and friends in Canada. 
               <br />
               No longer are they under the thumb of anyone, 
               <br />
               merchant or otherwise. They have full manhood 
               <br />
               suffrage, both men and women. And they have 
               <br />
               the secret ballot. And, sir, they have something 
               <br />
               more: they have experience of two forms of 
               <br />
               government, Commission and responsible.

               There is, however, one thing which has not

               changed. The same policy of twisting and distott~

               ing and misrepresenting the facts is again to be 
               <br />
               seen. The tax scare, which worked so well in 
               <br />
               1869, is again put to work.

               But these despicable political dodges are a bit 
               <br />
               stale and ineffectual, and so the anticonfederates 
               <br />
               have coined a new one, the Labrador scare. “If 
               <br />
               we become part of Canada, Quebec will chisel us 
               <br />
               out of Labrador.” Sir, these men in their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">despera-</span> 
               <br />
               tion forget that our people know full well that 
               <br />
               Labrador was awarded to Newfoundland by the 
               <br />
               Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and that 
               <br />
               there is no way whatever to upset that award. 
               <br />
               They know further that the terms of union now 
               <br />
               before us contain a deﬁnite undertaking by the 
               <br />
               Canadian government that Labrador shall form 
               <br />
               part of the Province of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland.</span> They 
               <br />
               know that the British North America Act, which 
               <br />
               even the Government of Canada must obey, dis- 
               <br />
               tinctly and clearly lays down the condition that 
               <br />
               no territory of a province can be taken from it. 
               <br />
               That is one of the terms of union. This silly 
               <br />
               catch—cry will fail, sir, as will the old and mouldy 
               <br />
               wail about taxing people’s property. I do not 
               <br />
               know whether these anticonfederates are aware 
               <br />
               of it, but it is strictly true to say that since the 
               <br />
               beginning of Canadian confederation some 80 
               <br />

               <br />
               now, any tax of any kind whatever imposed by 
               <br />
               Canada upon people’s property.

               word in our cheeks, but a partner with a full voice 
               <br />
               in Canada’s councils, and complete control of

               Eighty years ago it might have been sound to 
               <br />
               say that to join in the union then would have been 
               <br />
               risky. The union had no assurance of success or 
               <br />
               even of continued existence. Today the prospect 
               <br />
               is far different. Those four weak provinces have 
               <br />
               grown and expanded into a mighty nation whose 
               <br />
               institutions have a world reputation for sound- 
               <br />
               ness and stability, and whose social, commercial 
               <br />
               and ﬁnancial services are in the front rank of 
               <br />
               sane, modern development, and whose standard 
               <br />
               of living is far ahead of ours. If you doubt this 
               <br />
               latter statement, ask the people of the southwest 
               <br />
               coast, and of Labrador and northern New- 
               <br />
               foundland, who are in constant touch with 
               <br />
               Canada. Truly, Canada has proved that in union 
               <br />
               there is strength, and it would now appear in— 
               <br />
               evitable that had we joined the union in 1869, the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland people would be better off today. 
               <br />
               Of course the standard of living is higher in some 
               <br />
               parts of Canada than in other parts, just as in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland the people of the paper towns are 
               <br />
               better situated than those of the ﬁshing settle- 
               <br />
               ments. These variations are inevitable in any 
               <br />
               country, as they depend on the resources of the 
               <br />
               panicular locality. But there is no province of 
               <br />
               Canada which cannot show a better standard of 
               <br />
               living than we have experienced. That is a 
               <br />
               deﬁnite result of union, the system of taxation 
               <br />
               and distribution of revenue, and the power which
