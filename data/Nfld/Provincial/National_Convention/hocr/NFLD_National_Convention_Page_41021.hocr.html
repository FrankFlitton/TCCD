               page 16 you will see why this is not in my

               memorandum, these things are not federal. The

               page 17, Department of Finance. You see whatI 
               <br />
               have done there... I ought to say, in connection 
               <br />
               with those items, that the Department of Finance 
               <br />
               would naturally be a smaller department than it 
               <br />
               is today, because so many things that department 
               <br />
               has to do now would then be done by the Govem- 
               <br />
               ment of Canada... The same thing applies to the

               Then we pass on to the next page. “Travelling

               contingencies. Rental, statistical machines - 
               <br />
               $4,500.” The explanation of that, of course, is 
               <br />
               that the machines are costing more than that to 
               <br />
               rent, but the same machines would be used for 
               <br />
               both federal and provincial purposes. There 
               <br />
               would be no need of putting in additional 
               <br />
               machines, and that would cut down the cost to the
