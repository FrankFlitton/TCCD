               Chairman, it will take some twisting to change 
               <br />
               the meaning of that. There’s no crowd of men 
               <br />
               who will gain more from confederation than our 
               <br />
               railroaders.... Their unions are all connected with 
               <br />
               the railroad unions of Canada, and under con- 
               <br />
               federation the Canadian National will stretch all 
               <br />
               the way from St. John’s to Vancouver. And 
               <br />
               they’ll have the satisfaction of seeing passenger 
               <br />
               rates, freight rates and express rates in New- 
               <br />
               foundland brought down to the same rates as in 
               <br />
               Canada. They’ll have the satisfaction of seeing 
               <br />
               the wages of some of them brought up to the 
               <br />
               Canadian level. Above all, their professional 
               <br />
               pride in the railway will be pleased by a great 
               <br />
               program of improvement and rehabilitation of 
               <br />
               their railway system by the CNR, for we’re told 
               <br />
               by the CNR experts that $17 million will have to 
               <br />
               be spent by Canada in the ﬁrst ten years to put 
               <br />
               our transportation system in satisfactory shape. 
               <br />
               Sir, as we have only one stenographer, I think 
               <br />
               the thought was that we might rise till tomorrow. 
               <br />
               In that case sir, I move the adjournment of the 
               <br />
               debate and that the committee rise, report 
               <br />
               progress and beg leave to sit again on tomorrow. 
               <br />
               [The committee rose and reported progress] 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, speaking to 
               <br />
               your motion to adjourn, I wonder in view of the 
               <br />
               fact that the sands of time are running out not only 
               <br />
               for the Convention in general but in particular for 
               <br />
               this debate, would it not be possible to have a 
               <br />
               night session tomorrow?... 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman ....I think that if the Convention 
               <br />
               desires to continue tomorrow evening, I’ll be 
               <br />
               perfectly willing to sit if I get a quorum... 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Sir, having told us that, I would 
               <br />
               like to say it’s not my idea thatl should occupy 
               <br />
               all the remaining time of this debate in my reply.

               so after I have completed. There’s no thought in

               my part of using up all the remaining time in this 
               <br />
               debate. I believe there are a number of members 
               <br />
               who do wish to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speak...</span> I have no intention

               whatever of replying to any member who speaks 
               <br />
               after I have ﬁnished. I don’t guarantee that I 
               <br />
               won’t. I‘m quite sincere about it. To the best of 
               <br />
               my knowledge and belief, I will not speak any 
               <br />
               more afterI have ﬁnished this speech that I began 
               <br />
               tonight. But if something outrageous comes up, 
               <br />
               something that I think I absolutely must answer, 
               <br />
               well then, I can’t guarantee that I won’t answer 
               <br />
               it. But honestly sir, I have no intention of making 
               <br />
               another speech beyond the one I’m making now. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Before I put the motion to ad- 
               <br />
               journ the actual position is that the order paper 
               <br />
               tomorrow will of necessity contain a closure mo- 
               <br />
               tion. I’ve intimated already to the House and I 
               <br />
               reaffirm that ruling now, that I have a discretion 
               <br />
               as to when that motion should be put. Unfor— 
               <br />
               tunately, a number of members have seen ﬁt to 
               <br />
               quite improperly telephone me or communicate 
               <br />
               with me in my private ofﬁces and at my home, to 
               <br />
               make sure that I could guarantee them that they’d 
               <br />
               be able to speak. Of course I can give no such 
               <br />
               guarantee to any members, and I think Major 
               <br />
               Cashin with his very wide parliamentary ex- 
               <br />
               perience can quite sympathise and agree with me 
               <br />
               in this. I have to give the floor according to the 
               <br />
               rules to any man that occupies the floor at any 
               <br />
               given time. But in view of the fact that there is a 
               <br />
               closure motion coming up, and in View of the fact 
               <br />
               that some members have not been able to address 
               <br />
               themselves on this matter and desire to address 
               <br />
               themselves on the matter, I will have to consider 
               <br />
               when that closure motion is to be put. In doing 
               <br />
               so, I naturally want to facilitate members who 
               <br />
               have not been able to address themselves on this 
               <br />
               question, because I’d be very reluctant by prema- 
               <br />
               turely putting a closure motion to abridge or take 
               <br />
               away the rights to speak that they would other- 
               <br />
               wise have had. Therefore the actual position is 
               <br />
               simply this. While this closure motion is coming 
               <br />
               up tomorrow, I may conceivably not put it tomor- 
               <br />
               row. Not saying when, I’ll have to be guided by 
               <br />
               the temperament and the assistance of the House 
               <br />
               in trying to determine the time at which that 
               <br />
               closure motion should be put. But meanwhile, to 
               <br />
               facilitate the House and in particular members 
               <br />
