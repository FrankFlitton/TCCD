               two comments on it that appear not to have been 
               <br />
               considered by the Committee. Perhaps they did 
               <br />
               not feel it came within their province — perhaps 
               <br />
               they did not think of it —— I shouldn’t wonder at 
               <br />
               that, considering the vast amount of data they 
               <br />
               gathered and had to try and assimilate. The point 
               <br />
               I mention arises from a statement of the General 
               <br />

               <br />
               “The General Manager states that the main line 
               <br />
               needs retailing, that seven new locomotives, and 
               <br />

               the United States and Canada. This criticism is 
               <br />
               not, however, without reason. For the fact 
               <br />
               remains that it still takes an express train over a 
               <br />
               day to cover 546 miles from eastern to western 
               <br />
               terminus. A person who ﬂies from New York or 
               <br />
               Montreal to Gander in a few hours, takes perhaps 
               <br />
               12 to 16 hours to reach St. John’s by rail, and so 
               <br />
               on. I know that trains will never be able to travel 
               <br />
               as fast as aeroplanes, but they can travel as fast 
               <br />
               as automobiles, at least they do in other countries. 
               <br />
               I am quite aware too, that in other countries, there 
               <br />
               are trains a lot slower and a lot worse-appointed 
               <br />
               than our trains —— but again I am not making 
               <br />
               comparisons. Iam merely saying these few things 
               <br />
               as a lead-up to a question that has always 
               <br />
               bothered me whenever the Newfoundland Rail- 
               <br />
               way is on the carpet, namely this business of the 
               <br />
               narrow gauge. For that, it appears to me, is the 
               <br />
               chief drawback of our railway system. 
               <br />

               In previous debates on other matters, some 
               <br />
               delegates have asked in jocose mood or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">other“</span> 
               <br />
               wise, why we persist in believing that we are right 
               <br />
               and the rest of the world is wrong on certain 
               <br />
               questions. I make the same observation on the 
               <br />
               matter of our railway and its narrow gauge. In 
               <br />
               debating this report yesterday, almost every 
               <br />
               delegate made the observation that he was not a 
               <br />
               railroad man, as though to apologise for his 
               <br />
               remarks if they should prove to be stupid, ir- 
               <br />
               relevant or anything else. I make no apology in 
               <br />
               referring to the narrow gauge road that traverses 
               <br />
               this country, since it is the greatest drawback not 
               <br />
               only to the efﬁcient, but also to the proﬁtable 
               <br />
               operation of this vital public utility. The standard 
               <br />
               gauge railroad, 4 feet, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">81/2</span> inches, is in use in the 
               <br />
               United States, Canada, Mexico, England, the 
               <br />
               continent of Europe, and Australia, amongst 
               <br />
               other countries. In Europe, it is true, as well as in 
               <br />
               other countries, there are considerable mileages 
               <br />
               of smaller gauge, especially in mountainous dis- 
               <br />
               tricts, such as Switzerland and parts of Germany. 
               <br />
               But the main trunk lines, if not exactly 4 feet 
               <br />
               81/2 inches, are so close to that gauge as to permit 
               <br />
               the through running of locomotives and rolling 
               <br />
               stock. Thus by means of train ferry steamers, 
               <br />
               which carry locomotives and rolling stock on 
               <br />
               their decks, it is possible for British rolling stock 
               <br />
               to cross the continent on the Harwich to 
               <br />
               Zeebrugge train feny, traverse all central Europe, 
               <br />
               and by means of similar steamers, reach Scan—
