               pleasure to second this resolution. I had some

               comments to make on that section of the Mining

               learned that a resolution of this nature was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com»</span> 
               <br />
               ing up for discussion I resolved to keep what I 
               <br />
               had to say for the debate on that.

               It seems to be generally agreed that it is the 
               <br />
               same old story, we have come off on the wrong 
               <br />
               end. I don’t understand myself why the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern»</span> 
               <br />
               merit should have taken the attitude that it was a 
               <br />
               question of “or else” — either we gave the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con</span> 
               <br />
               cessions to the Labrador Mining Co. the way they 
               <br />
               wanted them, or they would go elsewhere. Surely 
               <br />
               they must have known, as we know. and as has 
               <br />
               been pointed out here, that the world’s iron ore 
               <br />
               supplies are almost exhausted in certain areas, 
               <br />
               and that the companies concerned would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">certain&lt;</span> 
               <br />
               1y be looking for other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deposits.</span> Another point 
               <br />
               which has not been brought out a great deal in 
               <br />
               this debate is the amount of land in the concession 
               <br />
               area which has been given this company. In 
               <br />
               Quebec it is something like 4,000 square miles, 
               <br />
               but in Newfoundland it is something like 20,000 
               <br />
               square miles. which is almost <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one~ﬁfth</span> of the 
               <br />
               entire area, and we have no idea what other 
               <br />
               mineral resources may be tucked away in that 
               <br />
               great parcel of land. I don’t see why it should be 
               <br />
               so sweeping. Surely an area proportionate with 
               <br />
               the Quebec area would have been in order. Then
