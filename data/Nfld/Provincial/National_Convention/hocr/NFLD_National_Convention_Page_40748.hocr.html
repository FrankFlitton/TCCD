               While the producer is the backbone of the 
               <br />
               country, the volume of employment is much 
               <br />
               larger than may be thought by looking at the 
               <br />
               number of people in only the productive in- 
               <br />
               dustries. Back in 1935, in the middle of our worst 
               <br />
               depression, the total number of people employed 
               <br />
               in ﬁshing, farming. logging and mining was less 
               <br />
               than the people employed in other things. We 
               <br />
               have to keep up the volume of production so that 
               <br />
               these others can be employed, but the fact is that 
               <br />
               in the service and distributing industries there are 
               <br />
               many more thousands employed than there are in 
               <br />
               the producing industries. The number of wage 
               <br />
               earners has greatly increased, and unemployment 
               <br />

               picture must be seen as a whole so that we can 
               <br />
               get an accurate picture of it, and it is a pity we 
               <br />
               have not got more statistics to help us piece the 
               <br />
               puzzle together.

               In my opinion we have many prospects yet to 
               <br />
               be tapped. I have heard criticisms of the cost of 
               <br />
               the Clarenville ﬂeet, yet these vessels are giving 
               <br />
               employment at sea to more than a hundred <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New~</span> 
               <br />
               foundlanders and are earning large sums in 
               <br />
               freights that we used to pay out to foreign bot- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">toms,</span> I don’t say we can carry all we produce in 
               <br />
               our ﬂeet, but I believe that we can greatly in- 
               <br />
               crease the size of our mercantile marine. We have 
               <br />
               the men and if Norway, a country with a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">popula‘</span> 
               <br />
               tion of a little more than three million, can have 
               <br />
               one of the world’s largest mercantile marines, 
               <br />
               then I can’t see any reason why this island should 
               <br />
               not have a much larger mercantile marine than 
               <br />
               we have. We believe that the employment and 
               <br />
               earnings of Newfoundlanders in the trade of 
               <br />
               seamanship can be greatly increased. The same 
               <br />
               is true of the tourist industry and I am certain that 
               <br />
               the right use of capital in the development of that 
               <br />
               industry can bring results that will astonish us 
               <br />
               all....

               Some people have said that there was no point 
               <br />
               in trying to make up a budget. I can’t agree with 
               <br />
               that. We are trying to answer the question as to 
               <br />
               whether the country is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selfvsupporting.</span> We had to 
               <br />
               examine the ﬁnancial picture, and we had to be 
               <br />
               guided by the advice of the Finance Commis- 
               <br />
               sioner who was interviewed by the Convention. 
               <br />
               He said the country could balance its ordinary 
               <br />
               requirements with a revenue of $23.5 million. We

               tion in the cost of servicing the debt and in some 
               <br />
               other things. We have examined the sources of 
               <br />
               revenue and we believe that it is highly im— 
               <br />
               probable that the revenue in the next three years 
               <br />
               will fall below an average of $30 million. That is 
               <br />
               allowing fora drop of 25% from the present level, 
               <br />
               and that leaves a pretty good margin for error. Of 
               <br />
               course, if there were to be a big fall in world 
               <br />
               prices, there would be a fall in our revenues like 
               <br />
               the revenues of every other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> On the other 
               <br />
               hand, if the fall in prices is big, it will mean that 
               <br />
               everything will cost less so that we would also 
               <br />
               have a fall in our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expenses.</span> You cannot foresee 
               <br />
               everything but we feel that the ﬁgures we have 
               <br />
               produced are conservative... My own opinion, 
               <br />
               for what it is worth, is that conditions must 
               <br />
               remain fairly good, because the consequences of 
               <br />
               any grave decline would be terrible beyond 
               <br />
               anyone’s imagination to the richest nations. 
               <br />
               America cannot have prosperity in a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">poverty</span> 
               <br />
               stricken world. Neither can Canada. Neither can 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. But as far as any ordinary person 
               <br />
               can examine our situation and foresee what is 
               <br />
               likely to happen, I say that our estimates are 
               <br />
               conservative and reasonable, and give as fair a 
               <br />
               picture of our prospects as it is possible to give.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               There are factors which are helpful to us. The 
               <br />
               people who live in cities abroad mostly pay rent. 
               <br />
               They have to buy coal or oil to heat their homes 
               <br />
               and do their cooking. They must earn money to 
               <br />
               buy everything they eat and need to live. We do 
               <br />
               have a few advantages which are not to be over- 
               <br />
               looked. In the census of 1935 it was shown that 
               <br />
               nearly 90% of the houses in Newfoundland are 
               <br />
               owned by the people who live in them. There is 
               <br />
               no other country in the world ofwhich this is true. 
               <br />
               Many of our people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-——~</span> not all but a very great 
               <br />
               many — not only own their own homes, but can 
               <br />
               have fuel at the expense of their labour, can grow 
               <br />
               a part of their own food and get some more of it 
               <br />
               from the bounty of nature. Their life is not easy, 
               <br />
               but if we can build up the value of our productive 
               <br />
               enterprises and maintain a good level of seasonal 
               <br />
               employment, we should be able to achieve a 
               <br />
               standard of living in this country that will make 
               <br />
               for security and happiness. We must bend our 
               <br />
               efforts to achieve this end and it is my opinion 
               <br />
               that it can be attained...
