               Now let’s take a look ﬁrst at the services 
               <br />
               which will be taken over by Canada. You will 
               <br />
               ﬁnd those in section 5. You have all read it, and 
               <br />
               1 don’t need to go over it.... Now let’s look at the 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial arrangements, and ﬁrst as to the public 
               <br />
               debt, let’s take a squint at that. Canada, as you 
               <br />
               know, will assume and provide for the servicing 
               <br />
               of the debt now guaranteed by the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom, that is $63,569,074. Now what hap- 
               <br />
               pens really is this, gentlemen, that the guarantee 
               <br />
               of our debt would simply change hands from the 
               <br />
               Government of Britain to the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada, for mark you, our Newfoundland people 
               <br />
               would still raise the money to pay the interest. 
               <br />
               Don’t forget that. Don’t let us have our people 
               <br />
               think that Canada is wiping out the debt. She is 
               <br />
               just putting herself in the same position that Great 
               <br />
               Britain is today, as a guarantor of our debt, but 
               <br />
               don’t forget that she will see to it that we people 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland will service that debt by the 
               <br />
               taxes which she will impose upon us. And 
               <br />
               another point, if I were a bondholder under that 
               <br />
               deth would as soon have the guarantee of Great 
               <br />
               Britain as I would that of Canada. Be that as it 
               <br />
               may, I want you to note that Canada, in taking 
               <br />
               over our debt does nothing to help us along these 
               <br />
               lines whatsoever. We would pay for the servicing 
               <br />
               of the debt under confederation as we pay it now, 
               <br />
               through taxes, only it will be administered by the 
               <br />
               Dominion government. Well, let’s say that dis— 
               <br />
               poses of the sterling debt, but remember that we 
               <br />
               would still be left, as a new province of Canada, 
               <br />
               with a total debt of $10,465,593, besides interest 
               <br />
               at from 3.75% to 3%. Canada does not guarantee 
               <br />
               this interest for us. This interest, with our local 
               <br />
               dollar debt of $10 million, is at the present time 
               <br />
               practically $500,000, when you add on the 
               <br />
               $123,000 which our friend from Bonavista 
               <br />
               Centre forgot. You will ﬁnd that the interest on 
               <br />
               our national debt is $499,000 and some odd 
               <br />
               hundred dollars, practically $500,000, and that is 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst charge on the new province.

               Now let us take a look at where our revenue 
               <br />
               came from this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">year»—</span> I think that 1947-48 would 
               <br />
               be as good a guide as any other. The Customs 
               <br />
               Department gave us $19.5 million. As a province 
               <br />
               we give that up completely. Posts and Telegraphs 
               <br />
               gave us $1.7 million. That too, we surrender to 
               <br />
               Canada. The Assessor’s Ofﬁce yielded $10.5 
               <br />
               million. That too Canada takes over, only more 
               <br />
               so on account of higher taxes in Canada. Home

               Affairs gave us $194,000. and that’s out, practi-

               ment nothing. Last year the Justice Department 
               <br />
               was supposed to yield $47,000. Natural Resour—

               <br />

               tically all revenue producing sources are handed 
               <br />
               over to Canada. Now let us assume, and l am not 
               <br />
               talking about the latest budget brought in, but the 
               <br />
               budget prepared by the Ottawa delegation in 
               <br />
               these books, let us assume that these figures of 
               <br />
               revenue as a province are correct. or practically 
               <br />
               so. They say the yield will be $1.25 million. On 
               <br />
               that they added, for a large profit, $1 million, and 
               <br />
               that makes a total provincial revenue of $2.25 
               <br />
               million. Now what monies do we get from 
               <br />
               Canada? You have it outlined there in your Grey 
               <br />
               Book. They give you $6.8 million. 1 think it is. 
               <br />
               But remember that‘s their estimate, based upon 
               <br />
               the irreducible minimum and the adjusted sub- 
               <br />
               sidy, which, as 1 already pointed out, depends on 
               <br />
               two variables: the increase in your population, 
               <br />
               and the increase or otherwise in the gross national 
               <br />
               product of Canada. The gross national product 1 
               <br />
               think you all understand. Now 1 want you to look 
               <br />
               at page 148, book I, and turn over to the next 
               <br />
               page, and see what 1 have taken. instead oftaking, 
               <br />
               as the Ottawa delegation did, the adjusted figure 
               <br />
               of$6.8 million, 1 have taken the irreducible min- 
               <br />
               imum, and that is $15 per head of the population, 
               <br />
               and the statutory subsidies, the irreducible mini- 
               <br />
               mum. I want you to look at this particular list of 
               <br />
               ﬁgures here, and you will find that the minimum, 
               <br />
               for instance in Nova Scotia in 1944, was 
               <br />
               $12,524,000, and the next year it was 
               <br />
               $12,244,000, and the next year, 1946, it was 
               <br />
               $1 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1,521,000.</span> Then they take a three year average, 
               <br />
               and they say, “For 1947 the Nova Scotia subsidy 
               <br />
               will be $12,096,000." Well, if you look back to 
               <br />
               1944 you will see that it was $12,544,000, prac- 
               <br />
               tically $500,000 less than the estimated figure for 
               <br />
               1947. Then you can look all along these figures 
               <br />
               and you will ﬁnd that in every one of these 
               <br />
               provinces, the estimate for 1947 under this tax 
               <br />
               agreement is far, in some cases $1 million, below 
               <br />
               that which it was in 1944. Why? Why was it?
