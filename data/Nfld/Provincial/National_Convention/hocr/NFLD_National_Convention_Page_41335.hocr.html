               <br />
               you can hardly tell us apart. I have asked myself 
               <br />
               the question, why did our people stand for it? For 
               <br />
               you can’t give away freedom and have it. There 
               <br />
               is only one answer to my mind. There were too 
               <br />
               many of our bonds held in Newfoundland. I 
               <br />
               haven’t the least doubt that the constitution 
               <br />
               would not have gone only it was a choice between 
               <br />
               the 5% and 6% interest on the bonds and the 
               <br />
               constitution. So the constitution lost. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               In this 1 am reminded of a bond poster in 
               <br />
               England during the ﬁrst world war. It said, “You 
               <br />
               gave your sons, but you won’t lend your money ." 
               <br />
               In this case it was “You’ll make sure of your 
               <br />
               percentage” ~— the mess of pottage. And then 
               <br />
               through promises, half truths, a heaven on earth 
               <br />
               was promised by a nation who, for a scrap of 
               <br />
               paper in 1914, went to war. That was our battle 
               <br />
               cry, ‘33, how nice the promises, how soft the 
               <br />
               siren’s song. I have the Amulree Report; how 
               <br />
               much it says, how little it means —— something 
               <br />
               like my Lord Addison, one question answered 
               <br />
               seven different ways, then coming back, the other 
               <br />
               scrap of paper treated by our sainted mother just 
               <br />
               as callously as Germany treated that scrap of 
               <br />
               paper guaranteeing the independence of Belgium 
               <br />
               — so has Britain treated us, less the loss of life 
               <br />
               and property. Let us examine the report. It starts 
               <br />
               with a history time forbids us to go into, so we’ll 
               <br />
               take things that count for our period. 
               <br />

               I’ll first quote paragraph 218: “The credit 
               <br />
               system might have disappeared without direct 
               <br />
               intervention by the government, had an attempt 
               <br />
               been made to train the people to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">independence."1</span> 
               <br />
               Let’s see what the Commission of Government 
               <br />
               did to train them. Never in the history of this 
               <br />
               island was the chance better to train our people 
               <br />
               in independence. The dole could have been a 
               <br />
               blessing in disguise, for it was the ﬁrst time in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland history that poor people had a 
               <br />
               regular income, and this is what could and should 
               <br />
               be done. It could have been tried out on a small 
               <br />
               scale. First, two of us were sent into St. John’s by 
               <br />
               the people of Trinity South in 1939 because 
               <br />
               things had come to such a pass that life was 
               <br />
               unbearable, owing to mismanagement by those

               in authority. The ﬂour was full of weevils and 
               <br />
               rope— unpalatable, nauseating. I knew what was 
               <br />
               the matter, as from 18 to 24 years of age I had 
               <br />
               been at sea, three years of that in the grain trade, 
               <br />
               sometimes at sea for 1 17 days. If your ﬂour tanks 
               <br />
               weren’t steamed at least once a year, the weevils 
               <br />
               would over-top you and in the ﬂour tanks you had 
               <br />
               more weevils than flour. The ﬂour was good but 
               <br />
               a high wheat content, which lends easily to rope 
               <br />
               and weevils. I visited the Fumess sheds. The 
               <br />
               sheds in August were packed to the metal roofs 
               <br />
               with flour which had been there nearly a month, 
               <br />
               although we had nearly a weekly service to the 
               <br />
               old country, and in the surruner months only a 
               <br />
               monthly supply of flour should be kept on hand. 
               <br />
               The winter it did not matter, as the cold weather 
               <br />
               would keep the flour in good condition. I con— 
               <br />
               tacted those in authority but could not get to see 
               <br />
               them, although 11,000 people had sent me in 
               <br />
               from the Broads to Lead Cove. That was the 
               <br />
               fatherly, beneﬁcial dictatorship we were under! I 
               <br />
               saw a few heads of departments, but no soap. We 
               <br />
               saw the Commissioner for Natural Resources, 
               <br />
               and here I come to where our people could have 
               <br />
               been lifted out of this credit system. We had an 
               <br />
               income even if it was only six cents per day, but 
               <br />
               how did we get it? First go to the little dictator, 
               <br />
               the relieving ofﬁcer, with a note; and then to the 
               <br />
               local peddler who had friends at court. Mind you, 
               <br />
               they were sure you would not learn anything, no, 
               <br />
               you weren’t grown up. Consequently, you could 
               <br />
               only turn in your note at the peddler and take out 
               <br />
               the bit of pork, the bit of tea, sugar, beef and last 
               <br />
               but not least, the weevilly flour— good ﬂour that 
               <br />
               was spoiled by the indifference and ignorance of 
               <br />
               the Department of Public Health and Welfare. 
               <br />
               While travelling from Winterton to Hant’s 
               <br />
               Harbour I came across a small party, two cars. 
               <br />
               They were boiling up. I made enquiries and found 
               <br />
               out it was the Whitﬁeld Laite Baritone Troupe, 
               <br />
               “baritoning”, singing the glories of co-operation 
               <br />
               to a starving people. I had just done about 150 
               <br />
               miles, a lot of it on foot; I had an intimate close-up 
               <br />
               of every village from Lead Cove to the Broads, 
               <br />
               had figures on how TB had increased in each 
               <br />
               village. I was not in a good frame of mind, 
               <br />
               because the thought struck me forcibly that I was 
               <br />
               always intrigued with the idea of Nero ﬁddling 
               <br />
               while Rome burnt, but I never thought I would 
               <br />
               see Newfoundland starve while Laite “baritoned”.
