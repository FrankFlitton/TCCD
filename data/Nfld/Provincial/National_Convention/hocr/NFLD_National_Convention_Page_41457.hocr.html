               <br />
               Chairman, here are the terms of union. The 
               <br />
               people have them now. Let them decide the issue. 
               <br />
               It is their absolute right, and if the members of 
               <br />
               this Convention in inconceivable arrogance at- 
               <br />
               tempt to cheat them of that right, I warn them that 
               <br />
               the people will know how to deal with them. 
               <br />
               Sir, my duties as a Convention member are 
               <br />
               now all but ended. What I have done throughout 
               <br />
               is to try as best I could to reach no decision as to 
               <br />
               the comparative merits of the different forms of 
               <br />
               government until all the facts possible had been 
               <br />
               ascertained and discussed. And for that reason I 
               <br />
               have made no confession of political faith in this 
               <br />
               chamber. Some of you will remember that years 
               <br />
               ago I strongly opposed the introduction of Com— 
               <br />
               mission government. While I did not then and do 
               <br />
               not now favour that form, my hostility to its 
               <br />
               introduction was based mainly upon the fact that 
               <br />
               it was imposed upon the people without even 
               <br />
               asking their consent. It robbed the people of the 
               <br />
               right to say how they should be ruled. What was 
               <br />
               done then was undemocratic and politically in- 
               <br />
               decent. Again I am faced with a similar question 
               <br />
               today. There is to be a referendum at which the 
               <br />
               people are to decide what form of government 
               <br />
               they want. The defeat of this motion may rob 
               <br />
               them of their right to vote for one of the forms of 
               <br />
               government. I would not be a party to such rob- 
               <br />
               beryin1933, and I will notbe a party to it in 1948. 
               <br />
               I will not join the enemies of the people. Who are 
               <br />
               the 45 individuals who sit here to say to the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland peOple, “You shall not have an 
               <br />
               opportunity to vote for confederation?" What 
               <br />
               right have we to tell them that we will save them 
               <br />
               from themselves by denying them that right 
               <br />
               which was always theirs morally, and which 
               <br />
               Britain has returned to them now in full measure? 
               <br />
               I shall vote for this motion. In my view it is 
               <br />
               the only course open to an honest man and a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">democrat</span> But I have, like every member, a 
               <br />
               preference of my own. I have given the matter a 
               <br />
               great deal of thought within the past 18 months, 
               <br />
               and I have at least had as good an opportunity to 
               <br />
               judge of the merits of the several forms of 
               <br />
               government as any man in Newfoundland, and I 
               <br />
               have come to a deﬁnite conclusion. I am not 
               <br />
               bound to disclose that conclusion here, but as 
               <br />
               many have made this Convention the means of 
               <br />
               proclaiming their political faiths, there is no

               congratulations to my learned friend Mr. Bradley 
               <br />
               on a very fine Speech indeed. I have admired Mr. 
               <br />
               Bradley‘s forensic ability for some time and 
               <br />
               today his speech was of the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">order.</span> It was 
               <br />
               also fully apparent to me that Mr. Bradley was 
               <br />
               pleading a case which he himself was not fully 
               <br />
               satisﬁed with. With respect to the remarks made 
               <br />
               by Mr. Bradley in his address in referring to the 
               <br />
               conduct of members here prior to the Christmas 
               <br />
               recess, whatever that conduct was, we have been 
               <br />
               very fair. Nobody can say that this confederation 
               <br />
               proposal has not been given anything but the 
               <br />
               fullest attention of the house for a longer period 
               <br />
               than any other form of government or any other 
               <br />
               report, and as Mr. Smallwood admitted at the end 
               <br />
               of the debate, he was fully satisﬁed with all the 
               <br />
               publicity given it.
