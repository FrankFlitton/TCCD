               mental or physical ﬁtness that we lost our 
               <br />
               democratic freedom, then why was it? I ask the 
               <br />
               question, but I think that all of you have the 
               <br />
               answer. The people of the country know it, and 
               <br />
               the outside world too is aware of it. The answer 
               <br />
               is that we lost that last final reward of democratic 
               <br />
               living because we were found by Lord Amulree 
               <br />
               and the British and Canadian financiers guilty of 
               <br />
               the unpardonable sin of being poor. For this alone 
               <br />
               we lost all that our forefathers had treasured and 
               <br />
               fought for. For this the proud title of “dominion" 
               <br />
               was stripped from us. For this these very legisla- 
               <br />
               tive halls were sabotaged of the symbols of a 
               <br />
               proud free people... But did those who sat in 
               <br />
               judgement on us give any thought to the things 
               <br />
               which had made us poor? In those days we saw 
               <br />
               the rest of the world justify their ﬁnancial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis.</span> 
               <br />
               asters by placing the blame where it rightly 
               <br />
               belonged, at the doorstep of the world depression. 
               <br />
               Not so with Newfoundland, no such excuse was 
               <br />
               accepted from us! On us was pronounced the 
               <br />
               verdict of guilty —— guilty of being corrupt in our 
               <br />
               leaders, both in church and state. These things 
               <br />
               they said, and the bad old politicians were 
               <br />
               reSponsible for our downfall. Other and bigger 
               <br />
               nations could ignore and even default on their 
               <br />
               gigantic national debts, on the pretext that they 
               <br />
               were war debts. This they did and believed that 
               <br />
               they were keeping their self-respect. Yet could 
               <br />
               we not claim the same defense? For was not 
               <br />

               1933, which if we had possessed at that time 
               <br />
               would have saved us from national misfortune —

               Before I continue with my prepared script, I 
               <br />
               would like to bring our minds back to this place 
               <br />
               in 1931. On many occasions I have repeated what 
               <br />
               I am going to repeat now. I feel that my remarks 
               <br />
               will not be tedious repetition, for this reason. In 
               <br />
               1931, I happened to be Minister of Finance of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland — Sir Richard Squires was Prime 
               <br />
               Minister. We passed an act in this very hall 
               <br />
               authorising the government to borrow, on the 
               <br />
               credit of the colony, some $8 million. When the 
               <br />
               time came round to ask for tenders on the loan, 
               <br />
               we were turned down. The executive of the 
               <br />
               government met — Mr. Bradley was a member 
               <br />
               of the executive - and it was suggested that 
               <br />
               myself and the Prime Minister should go to 
               <br />
               Montreal to consult with our bankers, the Bank 
               <br />
               of Montreal. We did this, and after considerable 
               <br />
               difﬁculty we were able to negotiate a temporary 
               <br />
               loan, so to speak, of $2 million to meet our 
               <br />
               semi—annual interest coming due on June 30, 
               <br />
               1931. Before we did this the General Manager 
               <br />
               of the Bank of Montreal took occasion to write 
               <br />
               myself and Sir Richard Squires, pointing out that 
               <br />
               we should then and there bring about commission 
               <br />
               government in Newfoundland, and if we did, they 
               <br />
               would guarantee us any kind of money we 
               <br />
               wanted, or words to that effect. Mr. Chairman, 
               <br />
               you are now sitting in the Chair occupied by your 
               <br />
               predecessor, Hon. Mr. Justice Fox, who was in 
               <br />
               Canada at that time and who drafted a reply to 
               <br />
               that letter. Our reply was “No". After we got the 
               <br />
               $2 million, we came back. We took our political 
               <br />
               lives in our hands. We had to strip the public 
               <br />
               services. Mr. Bradley served on committees with 
               <br />
               us. We stripped the Railway, education, soldiers’ 
               <br />
               pensions, everything. What was the result? In 
               <br />
               December, 1931, we were short again; $2 million 
               <br />
               had to be found. That was found by the British 
               <br />
               government and, I think, the Canadian govem- 
               <br />
               ment. What happened then? The House opened 
               <br />
               in February, 1932. I had resigned as Finance 
               <br />
