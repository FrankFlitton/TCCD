               <br />
               would sell the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">properties.</span> I was informed by one 
               <br />
               of the directors of the International Company that 
               <br />
               they had made a tentative offer to the Reids for 
               <br />
               the Gander areas amounting to some $6 million. 
               <br />
               The Reids, however, had faith that the Gander 
               <br />
               could be promoted and a mill established and 
               <br />
               refused this offer. Negotiations continued for 
               <br />
               some time between the Reids and other interests 
               <br />
               but nothing materialised. This placed the Reids 
               <br />
               in a very awkward position from a ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               standpoint, and they had practically arrived at a 
               <br />
               position where they would be forced to sell their 
               <br />

               diately placed writs against the properties and

               thus held the properties from being sacriﬁced to

               During the early thirties the newsprint busi- 
               <br />
               ness was in a state of stagnation. Prices of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">news</span> 
               <br />
               print were falling at an alarming rate because of 
               <br />
               the absence of any demand, and long established 
               <br />
               mills both in Canada and the United States were 
               <br />
               forced to suspend business. At Corner Brook, 
               <br />
               feeling the results of the widespread depression 
               <br />
               in the newsprint world, operations were severely 
               <br />
               curtailed and hundreds of employees were laid 
               <br />
               off. Operations continued on a very restricted 
               <br />
               scale. It was not until 1937 that there was any 
               <br />
               evidence of an increased demand in the 
               <br />
               newsprint world.

               It was this same year that the Bowater people 
               <br />
               of London, England, sent their agents to Canada 
               <br />
               for the purpose of acquiring from the Quebec 
               <br />
               government timber areas from which to export 
               <br />
               raw wood for use in their English mills. Their 
               <br />
               advances, however, were turned down by the 
               <br />
               Quebec government, and as a result they came to 
               <br />
               Newfoundland and secured from the Commis- 
               <br />
               sion government options on certain Labrador 
               <br />
               areas. They also acquired options on the Gander 
               <br />
               areas, with the distinct idea of constructing a pulp 
               <br />
               and sulphite mill in that territory. However, their 
               <br />
               principal purpose at that time was the export of 
               <br />
               raw wood to Britain. Their survey on the 
               <br />
               Labrador was completed in the autumn of 1937 
               <br />

               Having acquired the Corner Brook mill, the

               Bowater people came back to the Commission 
               <br />
               government and intimated that it was not 
               <br />
               economic to build a mill on the Gander. But they 
               <br />
               countered with the proposition, that if they could 
               <br />
               acquire the Gander areas and incorporate them 
               <br />
               with the Corner Brook company, they would 
               <br />
               build a sulphite mill in Corner Brook and, further, 
               <br />
               they proposed to export some 130,000 cords of 
               <br />
               raw pulpwood annually to their mills in England. 
               <br />
               This, in effect, was the “Gander deal." Through

               <br />
               in 1930-31, Bowaters acquired the Gander areas, 
               <br />
               incorporating them with Corner Brook, and be- 
               <br />
               cause of the fact that the Corner Brook company 
               <br />
               had a concession given them originally in 1923, 
               <br />
               and again in 1927, whereby the annual proﬁts 
               <br />
               taxes amounted only to $150,000, we find that 
               <br />
               the operations on Gander result in no proﬁts taxes 
               <br />
               and that thus the Newfoundland treasury has been 
               <br />
               deprived of not less than $750,000 a year in 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Gander deal in 1938 was rampant. Meetings 
               <br />
               were held in various sections of the country 
               <br />

               Trade passed resolutions condemning the enact—
