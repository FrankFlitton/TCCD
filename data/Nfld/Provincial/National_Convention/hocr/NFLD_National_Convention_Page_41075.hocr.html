               change in the gross national product of Canada. 
               <br />
               Therefore I say this which the Ottawa delegation 
               <br />
               has brought in -— $6.8 million -— is something 
               <br />
               which we cannot take for granted. We don‘t 
               <br />
               know what the gross national product is going to 
               <br />
               be this year, or next year, or the year after. The 
               <br />
               gross national product in Canada in 1944 and 
               <br />
               earlier was tremendous. Why? Because they 
               <br />
               were working and turning out guns, ammunition 
               <br />
               and ships, and all sorts of war material to send 
               <br />
               across to win this war. That in itself gave employ~ 
               <br />
               ment to people and put up the gross national 
               <br />
               product as never before in the history of Canada. 
               <br />
               The war ends, and as soon as the war ends all that 
               <br />
               industry has to cease, and has to be changed over 
               <br />
               to peace time industry, and it is inconceivable to 
               <br />
               think that Canada could, in such a few years, get 
               <br />
               back to the high peak of gross national product 
               <br />
               as it was in the war <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years.</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               That ﬁgure of $6 million, I put the irreducible 
               <br />
               minimum in the books, and that’s ofﬁcial — 
               <br />
               $6.21 1,000, and that is the only ﬁgure that we can 
               <br />
               take. You cannot take the $6.8 million, because 
               <br />
               by the time we, if we do, go into confederation, 
               <br />
               the gross national product of Canada may have 
               <br />
               changed to such an extent that we would not get 
               <br />
               any more than our gross irreducible minimum. 
               <br />
               To prove that, on the same page on which you are 
               <br />
               looking, you go to Saskatchewan. in 1944 Sas- 
               <br />
               katchewan received by way of subsidy, or would 
               <br />
               have received, $16,525,000. Now you notice in 
               <br />
               1946 they got $15,291,000, and you will notice 
               <br />
               Note D: “The adjusted ﬁgure being less than the 
               <br />
               guaranteed minimum, the guaranteed minimum 
               <br />
               is substituted." In other words, the population of 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan had changed, and if you go back 
               <br />
               to the population at the top of the page, you will 
               <br />
               find that the population in Saskatchewan in 1941 
               <br />
               was 895,000, in 1942 it was 883,000, in 1944 — 
               <br />
               858,000, in 1945 —— 845,000 and still coming 
               <br />
               down. In 1946 it was 832,000, as against 895,992, 
               <br />
               so you see that change in the population in Sas— 
               <br />
               katchewan over that brief four of ti ve years made 
               <br />
               such a difference in the amount that you would 
               <br />
               have been glad the irreducible minimum was put 
               <br />
               in there, so the federal government gave Sas- 
               <br />
               katchewan the irreducible minimum. So I take 
               <br />
               that ﬁgure. Yes, you will get that much, which is 
               <br />
               guaranteed, but anything more you cannot bank 
               <br />
               on. Now! Adding that and the revenues which I 
               <br />
               have already mentioned, this gives us a total 
               <br />

               <br />
               Canada however, realises how hopeless that 
               <br />
               would be, save that in the first three years (this is 
               <br />
               a sop, now) they will give us an amount of $3.5

               <br />
               enter into confederation it is the plan of Canada 
               <br />
               that we shall buy all the goods that she can make 
               <br />
               us buy. We are going to buy from Canada, don’t 
               <br />
               worry about that, and isn’t it reasonable to expect

               that the manufacturers will take advantage of 
               <br />
               that, and put the prices up to such an extent that
