               are told that in 1947 Canada easily maintained 
               <br />

               Again, if I were permitted to quote directly from 
               <br />
               a newspaper, which I am not, I would quote from 
               <br />
               a very recent issue of News of Washington.

               Mr. Chairman Let me anticipate you, Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood No sir, I will not quote it. This 
               <br />
               tells that to the world’s end, in peace or war, 
               <br />
               Canada makes a great centribution, but she does 
               <br />
               it quietly and without fanfare, and it is a sturdy 
               <br />
               and noble people that they have to the north of 
               <br />
               them. Canadians are a bulwark of democracy and 
               <br />
               decency. They are fortunate in their neighbours. 
               <br />
               The whole world recognises Canada’s greatness 
               <br />
               amongst the nations, but to listen to what you hear 
               <br />
               ' in this Convention, you would think not that our 
               <br />
               British cousin is a vast nation, but a poor, pover— 
               <br />
               ty—stricken nation, hungry to get Newfoundland 
               <br />
               in her claws to abuse us and save themselves from 
               <br />
               disaster. It is as grotesque a picture as was ever 
               <br />
               painted. 
               <br />
               lNow sir, one thing that hurt me, the only 
               <br />
               thing that Major Cashin said that hurt me, was 
               <br />
               that in this budget these estimates I brought in 
               <br />
               of what I estimated the provincial government 
               <br />
               would spend and collect in Newfoundland, Major 
               <br />
               Cashin says that I’ve cutout this and I’ve cut out 
               <br />
               that. And when he did that, I turned to him and 
               <br />
               said, “Now be fair, be fair". He said, “All right, 
               <br />
               I’ll be fair”. And I thought that he meant to go 
               <br />
               ahead and say, “Yes, I know that these things 
               <br />
               which Smallwood has cut out of the provincial 
               <br />
               budget have been cut out because they’ve be- 
               <br />
               come federal expenditures” — that’s what I 
               <br />
               thought he was going on to say. But he didn’t. He 
               <br />
               went straight on to say that he supposed that what 
               <br />
               I had in mind was to put on special taxes, an 
               <br />
               education tax for example. A queer thing happens 
               <br />
               to a man very often when he stands up to speak.

               He says things that he’s astonished afterwards 
               <br />
               when he reads them in the paper, or hears them 
               <br />
               on the recording. “Did I actually say that?” Now 
               <br />
               I dare say it’ 3 like that with Major Cashin, but I’m 
               <br />
               sure he couldn’t have thought he was going to get 
               <br />
               away with that. He must have known that I was 
               <br />
               going to answer it.... The simple truth is that in 
               <br />
               my provincial budget I did cut out a whole lot of 
               <br />
               things, over half of it. I cut out the Railway 
               <br />
               system, because that system would come under 
               <br />
               the federal government of Canada. I cut out ligh- 
               <br />
               thouses and beacons and buoys and dredging, and 
               <br />
               public wharves and breakwaters and marine 
               <br />
               works generally — cut them all out, because 
               <br />
               they’d be federal. I cut down on the Department 
               <br />
               of Public Health and Welfare, because veterans’ 
               <br />
               pensions and rehabilitation, which come under 
               <br />
               that department now, would not come under it in 
               <br />
               confederation. Those things would be federal. I 
               <br />
               cut out a lot of things from the provincial govern— 
               <br />
               ment for the simple reason that such things would 
               <br />
               not be handled or paid for by the provincial 
               <br />
               government at all. Would Major Cashin want 
               <br />
               such things to be done twice, once by the provin- 
               <br />
               cial government and once by the federal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern“</span> 
               <br />
               ment'! After cutting out the things that would be 
               <br />
               called federal expenditures, I also cut down on a 
               <br />
               few items that would be saved through ordinary 
               <br />
               economy. One example of that is the cost of 
               <br />
               supplies going into the public institutions. These 
               <br />
               things would come into Newfoundland duty—free 
               <br />
               and the provincial government would save quite 
               <br />
               a bit on duty which it pays today. My suggested 
               <br />
               provincial budget shows only ordinary expenses. 
               <br />
               That’s all it shows, expenditure on ordinary ac- 
               <br />
               counts. 
               <br />

               The Commission government this present 
               <br />
               year are spending nearly $40 million. But over 
               <br />
               $10 million of that is shown in their estimates as 
               <br />
               special or capital expenditures. Reconstruction is 
               <br />
               what they call it — over $10 million. Now, these 
               <br />
               items are capital expenditures and they are so 
               <br />
               shown. Under ordinary conditions the money to 
               <br />
               pay for those reconstruction expenditures would 
               <br />
               come out of capital account. The government 
               <br />
               itself expects that they’d have to pay for them this 
               <br />
               year —- they expected to draw upon the accum- 
               <br />
               mulated cash surplus to pay for some of those 
               <br />
               capital expenditures. Because they didn’t ﬁgure 
               <br />
               that they were going to take in enough revenue,
