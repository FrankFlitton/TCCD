               Mr. Fogwill I want the people to know the truth 
               <br />
               as far as taxes are concerned. As far as excise tax 
               <br />
               is concerned, Ido not think there is much difﬁcul~

               <br />

               <br />
               contained in this book and I got $3 million over

               <br />
               country, where the money will be raised. When 
               <br />
               we get to revenue and expenditure we will need 
               <br />
               experts. That means two or three months. Mr.
