               Touching brieﬂy on the question of teachers’ 
               <br />
               salaries, I do feel the lower grade teachers are still 
               <br />
               underpaid and there is little inducement for 
               <br />
               anyone to take up the profession unless they see 
               <br />
               their way clear to qualify for the higher scale. In 
               <br />
               the matter of assisting in the building and equip- 
               <br />
               ping of new schools, I would say the department 
               <br />
               has done a good job and the value of this policy 
               <br />
               will best be proved over a period of years... 
               <br />
               Mr. MacDonald <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,...Education,</span> to my mind, is 
               <br />
               one of the more, if not the most important sub- 
               <br />
               jects in our study of the future well-being of our 
               <br />
               country. An educated people tends towards a 
               <br />
               prosperous and happy future, an uneducated 
               <br />
               people the very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opposite,</span> We have in the past 
               <br />
               been woefully lacking in this very important mat- 
               <br />
               ter. Progress has been made in the past few years 
               <br />
               undoubtedly; but much more needs to be done. 
               <br />
               The question has been asked in this report: “ls the 
               <br />
               country getting adequate results for the money 
               <br />
               spent? Could the same results have been got with 
               <br />
               less expenditure?” The Committee has answered 
               <br />
               these questions in a general way by stating they 
               <br />
               consider the department had done a good job 
               <br />
               under the circumstances. They probably have, 
               <br />
               but my answer to the question, considering it 
               <br />
               from a ﬁnancial and social point of view, is that 
               <br />
               the same result can be obtained from a smaller 
               <br />
               expenditure and that better results could be ob- 
               <br />
               tained from the same expenditure. 1 don’t mean 
               <br />
               by this that teachers are overpaid; they are very 
               <br />
               much underpaid. Teaching, as a profession, is 
               <br />
               probably the lowest paid, for what we expect 
               <br />
               from them, of any class in the country.

               Our set—up in the matter of education is wrong, 
               <br />
               and here I probably enter upon a very controver- 
               <br />
               sial subject. The system of denominational 
               <br />
               education which we have is antiquated and 
               <br />

               <br />
               in all progressive countries in the world todayln 
               <br />
               discussing this question I shall endeavour to ap~ 
               <br />
               proach it from a purely financial and social

               aspect. The theological arguments I shall leave to

               where the effect of the present system is probably

               more pronounced than in the city of St. John’s,

               <br />
               the provisions of this system. Financially, the 
               <br />
               present system is uneconomical, in that there is 
               <br />
               too much overlapping both of money and effort, 
               <br />

               spirit of intolerance which has been a drag on our

               To illustrate what I am saying, my own town 
               <br />
               of Botwood might be very well used in this 
               <br />
               connection. Some two or three years ago, when 
               <br />
               compulsory education was put into effect, it was 
               <br />
               found that our schools would not accommodate 
               <br />
               all the children. The population was at that time 
               <br />
               about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2,700.</span> We had five schools divided among 
               <br />
               three denominations; one, the largest having 
               <br />
               three schools, and the other two having one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">each,</span> 
               <br />
               All these school buildings, except one, were in a 
               <br />
               bad state of repair and, with the exception of two, 
               <br />
               had no sanitary facilities. An effort was made to 
               <br />
               get an amalgamated school. A committee was 
               <br />
               formed to carry out the idea, which would have 
               <br />
               meant that one central school with a primary 
               <br />
               school on each end, or three schools in all, would 
               <br />
               have been sufficient to take care of the pupils, and 
               <br />
               give them a higher standard of education. The 
               <br />
               whole district of Botwood was canvassed, and it 
               <br />
               was found that the great majority of the people 
               <br />
               were in favour of such a school. We contacted the 
               <br />
               education department, and where did we get? Just 
               <br />
               nowhere We even had a visit from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Commis.</span> 
               <br />
               sioner of Education of the day, who advised us 
               <br />
               that an act had been passed enabling an amal- 
               <br />
               gamated school to be started, providing that the 
               <br />
               various school boards would agree. What chance 
               <br />
               do you think we had, when the members of the 
               <br />
               school boards are recommended by the different 
               <br />
               ecclesiastical authorities, some of which were 
               <br />
               opposed to the idea? The ﬁnal result to all this 
               <br />
               was that four new schools were built which, with 
               <br />
               the original two remaining, total <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">six.</span> Since then 
               <br />
               one more has been added, making seven in all. ls 
               <br />
               that economy? Does it tend to raise the standard 
               <br />
               of education as much as could be obtained by an 
               <br />
               amalgamated or public school? It has been said 
               <br />
               that the public or amalgamated school system is 
               <br />
               not workable. All we have to do to answer that 
               <br />
               question is to point to Grand Falls, Corner Brook,
