               Within the next few days this Convention will 
               <br />
               come to an end, and in spite of its shortcomings, 
               <br />
               I feel that it has done a lot of good and has 
               <br />
               justiﬁed its existence, if for no other reason than 
               <br />
               that it has aroused the people out of a sleep that 
               <br />
               has lasted for 14 years. Throughout the life of this 
               <br />
               Convention I have tried to be as fair as I possible 
               <br />
               could. I have not tried to hide or deprive the 
               <br />
               people of this country from obtaining any infor- 
               <br />
               mation that this Convention has been able to give, 
               <br />
               in spite of the fact that it has been stated here that 
               <br />
               those who do not favour submitting confedera- 
               <br />
               tion to the people are trying to deprive the people 
               <br />
               of something that is rightfully theirs. l plead not 
               <br />
               guilty to that charge. I am not going to vote in 
               <br />
               favour of this motion under the present cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances. I shall try as best I can to give 
               <br />
               reasons why I make that statement.

               <br />

               <br />
               pointed out that this Convention had no power to 
               <br />
               discuss or negotiate (I think that is the word used) 
               <br />
               with the USA or Canada on economic, ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               or political questions. We were politely told that 
               <br />
               such negotiations were none of our business, and 
               <br />
               that it was a job to be dealt with strictly between 
               <br />
               governments. In spite of that, it was still main— 
               <br />
               tained that we should send a delegation to Ottawa 
               <br />
               to ascertain terms of federal union, with absolute- 
               <br />
               ly no power to dispute or question any proposals 
               <br />
               that might be put forward by the Canadian 
               <br />
               government. Mr. Chairman, what a position for 
               <br />
               an independent and free people to be placed in! 
               <br />
               And we are expected by the advocates of con— 
               <br />
               federation to place before the people of this 
               <br />
               country a situation such as that! No matter what 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd in those terms which we do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under«</span> 
               <br />
               stand, or any points on which we are clear, we are 
               <br />
               still urged to recommend it as being a form of 
               <br />
               government, without being able to question or 
               <br />
               dispute any of these things. To my mind, Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, the situation, to say the least, is 
               <br />
               ridiculous.

               As a body of ordinary Newfoundlanders, I 
               <br />
               maintain that a pretty good job has been done as 
               <br />
               far as investigating our position as a country. I 
               <br />
               think that the reports tabled in this Convention 
               <br />
               point to that fact. We know probably as much 
               <br />
               about the country as a newly-elected government 
               <br />
               would know, with only 16 months of experience. 
               <br />
               We send a delegation to Ottawa to get the terms. 
               <br />
               What position are they in? The Canadian govern— 
               <br />
               ment gives them what? Precious little. They did 
               <br />
               not even give them the terms to bring back, in 
               <br />
               spite of all their knowledge of Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               Even if they had been given the terms, what could 
               <br />
               they have done? Absolutely nothing. They could 
               <br />
               read them, that was all. Any clause in those terms 
               <br />
               which they thought could be improved upon, or 
               <br />
               which they thought could be made more fair or 
               <br />
               equitable, they could do nothing about it; and 
               <br />
               worst of all, this whole Convention could do 
               <br />
               nothing about it. But Mr. Chairman, if they had 
               <br />
               the power to do something about it, how different 
               <br />
               the situation would be. I would have had no 
               <br />
               hesitation in recommending it. Even if we had 
               <br />
               that power to negotiate or bargain, and had used 
               <br />
               it without being able to alter any of these terms, 
               <br />
