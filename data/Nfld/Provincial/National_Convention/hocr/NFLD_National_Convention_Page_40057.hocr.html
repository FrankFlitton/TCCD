               of our country.” I have observed that there are 
               <br />
               those among us who are very hopeful of seeing a 
               <br />
               sentiment develop in favour of this or that form 
               <br />
               of government. In the early stages of what can 
               <br />
               only be described as an investigating committee, 
               <br />
               that is very bad. One delegate is a proponent of 
               <br />
               this, another an adherent of that, and it would be 
               <br />
               very unfortunate should any attempt be made by 
               <br />
               a proponent of any form to superimpose his 
               <br />
               preconceived notions, ﬁxed beliefs and fore—or- 
               <br />
               dained opinions on this assembly. There should 
               <br />
               be no splitting into groups. Supposing your dis-

               sible government, what of it? Districts are but the 
               <br />
               components of what make up Newfoundland, so 
               <br />
               let us conﬁne ourselves to factual data only. 
               <br />
               Furthermore, any attempt to narrow the issues or 
               <br />
               restrict the choice of the people would not only 
               <br />
               be foolhardy, it would be positively dangerous. 
               <br />
               The majority of our people are not concerned 
               <br />
               with the name of tomorrow’s government, but 
               <br />
               that the administration of tomorrow should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro</span> 
               <br />
               vide, inasmuch as governments can, more com- 
               <br />
               prehensive and higher educational standards, 
               <br />
               more and better communications, in short a 
               <br />
               general raising of the standard of living which, to 
               <br />
               say the least, is much lower than in any English- 
               <br />
               speaking country of the western hemisphere. 
               <br />
               The solution is not to be found in the political 
               <br />
               field, it will be found in the future prosperity and 
               <br />
               consequent happiness of that family over the 
               <br />
               way, for “a nation is as poor as its people.” I 
               <br />
               personally do not care what name is given to their 
               <br />
               set form of government; I’ll vote for it as soon as 
               <br />
               it can be shown it was in the best interest of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. Today we are at the cross-roads. 
               <br />
               “Whence from here and whither tending?" I ask. 
               <br />
               These are important questions and it devolves 
               <br />
               upon the members to be exacting in their research 
               <br />
               and honest in their opinions, not guided by senti- 
               <br />
               ment. The economy of Newfoundland is not basi- 
               <br />
               cally different in 1946 from what it was in 1934 
               <br />

               <br />
               appreciable effect upon our ability to be self-suf— 
               <br />
               ﬁcient - the internal market for our products 
               <br />
               cannot in the foreseeable future be greatly en- 
               <br />
               larged. Newfoundland still has 42,000 square 
               <br />
               miles of territory with only a third of a million 
               <br />
               people. That confronts us with a large problem 
               <br />
               for it obviously means a too—wide diffusion of our

               national effort, which in turn greatly weakens the 
               <br />
               ability of any centralised government to maintain

               <br />
               business game of trying to make enough money 
               <br />
               on the goods sold to enable the businessman to 
               <br />
               keep his personnel happy, and his stores and 
               <br />
               warehouses in fairly decent order. The three

               meals and tight roof argument may he basically 
               <br />
               sound, but it is only a half-tmth, for the question 
               <br />
               is not how we’ll eat and what we’ll wear. It goes 
               <br />
               deeper than that, for it must not be forgotten that 
               <br />
               no government in itself can go on providing for 
               <br />
               the welfare of its people unless its resources can 
               <br />
               support its economy. Government of course can 
               <br />
               provide legislation, social and otherwise, that 
               <br />
               will in some measure contribute to that end, but 
               <br />
               the burning questions are, can we provide new 
               <br />
               industries, seek out and develop new resources? 
               <br />
               There is a dire need for newer methods in our 
               <br />
               saltfrsh industry; and our external trade, the very 
               <br />
               essence and life-blood of our economy, is, as it 
               <br />
               was 50 years ago, still contingent upon the ability 
               <br />
               of foreign markets to purchase our exportable 
               <br />
               products. These and other factors tend to make 
               <br />
               the task facing the Convention a case of arith— 
               <br />
               metic plus sound common sense, so let us dis- 
               <br />
               pense with our pet opinions and continue the 
               <br />
               investigation on our financial and economic af~

               I cannot agree that the Convention is a farce 
               <br />
               and a ﬁasco. I am willing to explore every pos-
