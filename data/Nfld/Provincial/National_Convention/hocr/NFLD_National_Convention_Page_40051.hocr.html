               creased direct taxation during the war, and it now 
               <br />
               amounts to more than half the yield from customs 
               <br />
               duties, on which we used mainly to depend. Some 
               <br />
               revision of our tariff will undoubtedly be neces— 
               <br />
               sary as the result of international trade discus- 
               <br />
               sions which have been under consideration for 
               <br />
               some time and which are now scheduled to start 
               <br />
               next month. We shall, of course, endeavour to 
               <br />
               secure more favoured treatment for the entry of 
               <br />
               our produce into other countries but, at the same 
               <br />
               time, we shall be expected to make concessions 
               <br />
               in return. Until these negotiations have reached a 
               <br />
               more advanced stage, it will be impossible to 
               <br />
               assess the effect on our yield from customs duties 
               <br />
               but, in any event, we must be prepared for some 
               <br />
               reduction in this source of revenue, as our tariff 
               <br />
               is undoubtedly still heavy on certain classes of 
               <br />
               commodity, although, as you will see from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">para»</span>

               years the average rate of duty over all imports has 
               <br />
               been reduced from 36.5 to 25.5 per cent. We can, 
               <br />
               I think, expect some increase in revenue from the

               <br />
               extended. On the other hand, we must be

               prepared for some decline in the revenue from the

               mentioned in the memorandum on reconstruction

               <br />
               mature in 1950 and 1952, respectively. This sum

               was obtained from the government of the United

               Kingdom as the ﬁrst repayment of the loans 
               <br />
               totalling $12.3 million which we made as a 
               <br />
               voluntary contribution to the war effort in the 
               <br />
               years 1941- 1944. The balance of these loans still

               due to us by the government of the United

               Kingdom is now approximately $9. 1 million, and 
               <br />
               applying the repayment of $3.2 million to the 
               <br />
               reduction of debt, the total amount of our public 
               <br />
               debt is reduced still further to $70.5 millions. 
               <br />
               This ﬁgure excludes a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">552.5%</span> loan to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">railv</span>

               Corporation of the United States for the purchase

               <br />
               unredeemed savings certiﬁcates, amounting to 
               <br />
               some $2,257,000, out of total issues of 
               <br />
               $3,103,000, since we have balances set aside to

               meet in full the government’s liability in respect 
               <br />
               of these certificates. Out of the proceeds of 
               <br />
               savings certiﬁcates, we lent $1,800,000 to the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom (part of the $12,300,000 I have

               already mentioned), which will be available 
               <br />
               when we want it. The balance required to meet 
               <br />
               outstanding certiﬁcates is on deposit, at interest, 
               <br />

               <br />
               At the end of March, 1946, we had an accumu-

               $10.5 million was loaned to the government of
