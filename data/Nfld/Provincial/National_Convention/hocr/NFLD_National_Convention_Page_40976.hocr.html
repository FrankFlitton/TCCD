               Mr. Chairman With all due respect to 
               <br />
               Mr. Bradley, this is a matter of conscience... But 
               <br />
               the opinion has been expressed by Mr. Higgins, 
               <br />
               Rev. Burry and Mr. Smallwood that they can see 
               <br />
               no reason why this information would be with- 
               <br />
               held from the Convention. Therefore I am now 
               <br />
               requesting these three gentlemen, if according to 
               <br />
               their own consciences they are free to do so, 
               <br />
               would they please be good enough to pass over 
               <br />
               any document or documents they may have to the 
               <br />
               Secretary to be mimeographed and distributed to 
               <br />
               the members. That does not obligate you, 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashboume, or Mr. Bradley, or anyone else 
               <br />
               who thinks he is in conscience bound to withhold 
               <br />
               it from the Convention. At the same time it allows 
               <br />
               other members to exercise, or at least to govern 
               <br />
               their actions by the dictates of their conscience. 
               <br />
