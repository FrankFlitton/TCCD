               again over a three page memorandum on the 
               <br />
               situation I thought we might ﬁnish it now, if that 
               <br />
               is satisfactory to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr,</span> Smallwood. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Yes, certainly. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins This particular memo was 
               <br />
               prepared while we were in Ottawa, and submitted 
               <br />
               to Mr. Mansur at the time, and he agreed to it 
               <br />
               basically — the position of the housing acts. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I think maybe Mr. Higgins 
               <br />
               would not mind if I pointed out that it was Mr. 
               <br />
               Higgins himself who raised this question. Mr. 
               <br />
               Mansur, the head of the Central Mortgage and 
               <br />
               Housing Corporation, I think it is called, could 
               <br />
               only tell us what happens and what can be done 
               <br />
               under the existing arrangements in Canada, and 
               <br />
               if these existing arrangements do not cover our 
               <br />
               Newfoundland situation in the matter of housing, 
               <br />
               then it would become a matter for the minister 
               <br />
               himself; that is the Right Honourable C.D. Howe, 
               <br />
               the minister in charge of that department. Mr. 
               <br />
               Higgins raised the matter with Mr. Howe himself, 
               <br />
               and my recollection is that Mr. Howe said he had 
               <br />
               no doubt that something could be worked out to 
               <br />
               cover the Newfoundland situation from the 
               <br />
               standpoint of housing, but that that would be a 
               <br />
               matter for the future. It was not something that he 
               <br />
               could very well do until and unless New- 
               <br />
               foundland became a province. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Yes, well, if you don’t mind Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood, if there are any remarks that you 
               <br />
               wish to address based upon what Mr. Higgins has 
               <br />
               to say, I think it would be time to make them later. 
               <br />
               At the moment I am interested in what Mr. Hig- 
               <br />
               gins has to say. 
               <br />
               [ Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Higgins</span> read a summary of Canadian hous- 
               <br />
               ing acts, and information about the committee] 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins Now with reference to the few 
               <br />
               remarks that Mr. Smallwood made, I was prin— 
               <br />
               cipally interested in the St. John’s Housing Cor~ 
               <br />
               poration, and the possibility of obtaining further 
               <br />
               loans under the set—up of their Housing Associa- 
               <br />
               tion up there, and Mr. Mansur and Mr. Howe 
               <br />
               explained that under the present set-up it would 
               <br />
               be impossible to obtain ﬁnancing for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">St.</span> 
               <br />
               John’s Housing Corporation. But at the last plen- 
               <br />
               ary session Mr. Howe informally told us that it 
               <br />
               was possible that some legislation would be 
               <br />
               provided whereby loans could be made for the St. 
               <br />
               John’s Housing Corporation to continue its 
               <br />
               operations.

               them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">again.</span> When we were discussing the para- 
               <br />
               graph 5, the Newfoundland Railway, I believe a 
               <br />
               question was asked as to whether the present 
               <br />
               employees of the Railway would be retained. 
               <br />
               And I believe the answer was that they would be 
               <br />
               retained... As you know the committee dealing 
               <br />
               with transportation consisted of Mr. Ballam, Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood and myself, and we met with the 
               <br />
               committee set up by the Canadian govemment, 
               <br />
               consisting of Mr. Fairweather of the CNR and 
               <br />
               some other ofﬁcials. As a result of that meeting, 
               <br />
               and the facts we gave them, the report made by 
               <br />
               the Vice—President and those associated with him 
               <br />
               was given to each member of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">committee...</span> 
               <br />
               Look for Appendix 7 (Black Book, Volume 2), 
               <br />
               and you will see a preliminary statement of what 
               <br />
               would be involved in the integration of the New- 
               <br />
               foundland railway and steamship system with the 
               <br />
               Canadian railway system... This particular pan 
               <br />
               of the report was not included in the Black Book: 
               <br />
               “It is not anticipated that the re-arrangement of 
               <br />
               the organisation and other duties of the ad- 
               <br />
               ministrative personnel would result in demotions 
               <br />
               or dismissals, although no assurance should be 
               <br />
               given on that point, since it would be necessary 
               <br />
               to have discretionary power to deal with situa- 
               <br />
               tions as they might arise”.... Now you have there: 
               <br />
               “It is noted that the staff of the railway at the 
               <br />
               present time numbers 2,990, and of the steamers 
               <br />
               761, a total of 3,751" but this is not included: 
               <br />
               “This looks to be an undue number in relation to 
               <br />
               the size of the operation, but only a careful, 
               <br />
               detailed study would reveal whether or not the 
               <br />
               staff would likely be decreased under Canadian
