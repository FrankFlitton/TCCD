               govemment’s own current estimates for this year 
               <br />
               are only in part a fair basis of comparison 
               <br />
               because in my estimates the revenue is divided 
               <br />
               into two kinds — on the one hand revenue got by 
               <br />
               taxing the people of the province, and on the other 
               <br />
               revenue from non-taxation sources. From the 
               <br />
               standpoint of the taxation sources it is fair to 
               <br />
               compare my estimates with the estimates of the 
               <br />
               government. From the standpoint of non-tax

               I would point out that the estimates that I

               union the government of the province would 
               <br />
               spend $123 million; and I would point out further 
               <br />
               that $83 million of that I estimate would come 
               <br />
               to the government not from taxation sources at 
               <br />
               all, which leaves $39,960,000, call it $40 million 
               <br />

               <br />
               people of Newfoundland; and in respect of that 
               <br />
               item it is fair to compare it with the government’s 
               <br />
               present current estimates in the Blue Book; but 
               <br />
               with respect to the $83 million from non-taxation 
               <br />
               sources there is no basis of comparison, because 
               <br />
               those are based upon the terms in the Grey Book.

               Mr. Higgins Before you reply to Mr. Hollett, I

               wonder if you would mind answering those two 
               <br />
               speciﬁc questions I asked? Whatever we learned 
               <br />
               in Ottawa or did not learn in Ottawa, I would like 
               <br />
               to know how licenses for motor vehicles and 
               <br />
               drivers has been increased from $250,000 (some 
               <br />
               of us do not like that estimate) to $325,000? Can 
               <br />
               you tell me that?

               Mr. Smallwood I do not mind answering that

               speciﬁc <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question,</span> When we were drafting our

               estimates of possible revenue for the Province of

               Newfoundland before we went to Ottawa, there 
               <br />
               was, as Mr. Higgins has said, some difference of 
               <br />
               opinion as to how much we should estimate to be 
               <br />
               revenue from vehicular licenses on motor cars, 
               <br />
               trucks, buses, and from drivers’ licenses My 
               <br />
               contention, and the dispute, if there was a dispute, 
               <br />
               between some members of the delegation and 
               <br />
               myself, was that we should raise that amount. 
               <br />

               we get confederation. because they will come in

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">duty‘free</span> from Canada. There will be more motor

               and conservative estimate to do what I have done.
