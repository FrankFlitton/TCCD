               foundland is under the Parliament of Great

               Britain and the government of Great Britain, and 
               <br />
               the Dorninions Office of Great Britain, and will 
               <br />
               so remain so long as we have Commission 
               <br />
               government. We are virtually a branch of the 
               <br />
               British government. Now the British government 
               <br />
               has a tremendous stake in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">postwar</span> civil <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aviation,</span> 
               <br />
               Civil aviation is becoming as important in world 
               <br />
               trade as the merchant marine used to be before 
               <br />
               the war. If Britain is to have her place in the sun 
               <br />
               commercially speaking in the world, she must 
               <br />
               have a great part to play in civil aviation. One of 
               <br />
               the biggest trumps that Britain had was virtually 
               <br />
               control over Gander. We here in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               look at Gander as our airport —- we New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders who say that Gander should be 
               <br />
               made to ﬁt into the scheme of things in such a 
               <br />
               way as to be the greatest possible benefit to 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. But you could not expect the 
               <br />
               British government to look at Gander in that light 
               <br />
               at all. If I were in the government of Great Britain, 
               <br />
               as Minister of Civil Aviation, I would have on the 
               <br />
               wall in my office a great map of the world, and I 
               <br />
               would have drawn on the map in red lines the 
               <br />
               British airways and air routes, and show on that 
               <br />
               map the airports that Britain controlled,‘ and 
               <br />
               could look at it and say, “Here is what we have; 
               <br />
               these are our bargaining weapons in dealing with 
               <br />
               the Americans”, and amongst them I would place 
               <br />
               Gander. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               As a Newfoundlander I would look at it in an 
               <br />
               entirely different light. Great Britain, God 
               <br />
               knows, needed some weapons to fight the 
               <br />
               Americans in civil aviation Before the war ended 
               <br />
               the Americans had thousands of planes ready to 
               <br />
               fly, and tens of thousands of personnel ready to 
               <br />
               ﬂy them, millions of money. The American 
               <br />
               policy was for each nation to be on its own, act 
               <br />
               unilaterally, grab all the airways and air trafﬁc of 
               <br />
               the world, and if America had been able to do that 
               <br />
               now, in 1947 she would dominate the airways of 
               <br />
               the world. Britain, on the other hand, had no 
               <br />
               planes, not even yet has she got her new models 
               <br />
               ready to fly. If America had been able to go ahead 
               <br />
               on her own today Britain would be out of the 
               <br />
               picture, but Britain is not out of the picture, and 
               <br />
               one of the reasons is that Britain virtually control—

               <br />
               policy and all doing the same thing. That’s what 
               <br />

               the airports that we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">control,”</span> That was a perfectly 
               <br />
               reasonable attitude for Britain to take, thinking of 
               <br />
               her own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interests.</span> If I had been prime minister of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland and if the British government had 
               <br />
               come to me and said, “Look here, Smallwood, 
               <br />
               you have an airport at Gander, and it is very 
               <br />
               important to us that we should control that air- 
               <br />
               port. We are on the broad of our back, we have 
               <br />
               been blitzed and beaten to pieces, and the 
               <br />
               Americans have been untouched, and if we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">don’t</span> 
               <br />
               do something about it inside a year the Americans 
               <br />
               will own all the airports of the world, will you 
               <br />
               help us? Will you let us control Gander so that 
               <br />
               we can use it for a bargaining weapon in talking 
               <br />
               with the Americans?" I would say, “How?”, and 
               <br />
               they would say, “If we don’t allow them to use it 
               <br />
               that ﬁnishes them for the North Atlantic air 
               <br />
               routes.” I would say, “Well, I hate to say ‘no' to 
               <br />
               you, but what is it going to cost us?” They would 
               <br />
               say, “Well, we can’t ask $300 per landing, be- 
               <br />
               cause if we do that the Americans are going to 
               <br />
               demand $300 for our planes crossing the 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc.” I would say, “But if you are only going 
               <br />
               to charge $85 a plane we will lose $l million a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">year.</span> We are willing to help you, sure, but what 
               <br />
               does Newfoundland get out of it?" Now if they 
               <br />
               said, “Look, we will employ all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New»</span> 
               <br />
               foundlanders out there, and let you have the 
               <br />
               general running of the airport, and we will foot 
               <br />
               the bills", I would say, “OK, take it with my 
               <br />
               blessing.” Now that’s the rock bottom position. 
               <br />
               Gander has been used up to now not for the 
               <br />
               interest of Newfoundland, but for the interest of 
               <br />
               Great Britain. I am not saying a word against that, 
               <br />
               but I don’t want it to cost Newfoundland any- 
               <br />
               thing. We need every dollar we can lay our hands 
               <br />
               on in the next 20 years. We can’t afford to pay 
               <br />
               the loss of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gander.</span> If Britain will pay it, and all 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders are employed out there (in-

               cluding those American airlines, and they are 
               <br />
