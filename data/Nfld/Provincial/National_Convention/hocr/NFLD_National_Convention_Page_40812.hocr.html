               <br />
               taken place in Newfoundland since 1934 and we 
               <br />
               have entered into considerable discussion. I 
               <br />
               think, in view of what has been said by members, 
               <br />

               <br />
               perhaps my time might be well spent in referring 
               <br />
               to the reports which have been presented and in 
               <br />
               giving my ideas on them. I shall try to do this in

               the shortest possible time, but I would like the 
               <br />
               indulgence of the members of this House because 
               <br />

               <br />
               is the backbone and lifeblood of our national life, 
               <br />
               I would like to refer to two reports ~—- the report 
               <br />
               of Chadwick and Jones,1 which was distributed 
               <br />
               to us before the Convention met, and the Report 
               <br />
               of the Finance Committee.2 The former report is 
               <br />
               a comprehensive survey and I think it would have 
               <br />
               been greatly to our advantage if instead of going 
               <br />
               out and making another Economic Report, we 
               <br />
               had accepted this Chadwick—Jones Report and 
               <br />
               had debated it. It contains 15 tables, and while it 
               <br />
               was prepared before the Convention met, we 
               <br />
               could have these tables brought up to date by the 
               <br />
               government. That is the least we could expect of 
               <br />
               them. Perhaps, seeing that we are in the closing 
               <br />
               hours of the Convention now, that might be over~ 
               <br />
               looked. But anyone who has considered and 
               <br />
               studied this white paper has been struck with 
               <br />
               its comprehensiveness. It is a factual report and 
               <br />
               contains a considerable amount of information.

               <br />
               Iconsider these reports have good points in them, 
               <br />
               but as far as I am concerned the Economic Report

               and examine — that is the present tense —— the 
               <br />
               country as we ﬁnd it today. Who knows the

               There are several matters I would like to speak 
               <br />
               about in this report. The need of a good standard 
               <br />
               of living for our people is an essential, a great 
               <br />
               essential. We want taxation iifted from the neces- 
               <br />
               sities of life, and I would not want to be a part in 
               <br />
               the future, or even in the present, of a government 
               <br />
               which would seek to extract $17 million in duties 
               <br />
               from 300,000 people. There should be a great 
               <br />
               revision of the tariffs. I think it was about a year 
               <br />
               ago that the government made some reductions 
               <br />
               in the tariff, and I hope it will not be very long 
               <br />
               before we have further reductions, so that it will 
               <br />
               in some way try and offset the rise in the cost of 
               <br />
               living which must be a source of deep concern to 
               <br />
               our people. We know it is. I speak as one from 
               <br />
               the outports, rubbing shoulder to shoulder with 
               <br />
               the ﬁshermen, for in our section people depend 
               <br />
               practically wholly upon the ﬁsheries. There are 
               <br />
               some people who augment their earnings with the 
               <br />
               amount they earn from the Iumberwoods. I am 
               <br />
               sure these people are anxiously awaiting the day 
               <br />
               when this great amount, I think it was $20 million 
               <br />
               last year, will be considerably lifted from their 
               <br />
               shoulders. We have heard recently about the re- 
               <br />
               quest of the dairymen for an increase in milk. The 
               <br />
               fact that there is $4.75 a ton placed on imported 
               <br />
               hay is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">excessive.</span> I see no reason whatsoever why 
               <br />
               the government could not reduce or remove al— 
               <br />
               together the duty on hay. 
               <br />

               We know that people are wondering when the 
               <br />
               economic recession is going to get an impetus 
               <br />
               such as the World War brought along. Those of

               us who went through the experience after World 
               <br />

               of the drop in price of ﬁsh, wonder today when 
               <br />
               this recession is going to strike us again. Per— 
               <br />
               sonally, I do not think there will be such a drop 
               <br />
               in price as was experienced at that time. I think 
               <br />
               the demand for proteins, just the same as the
