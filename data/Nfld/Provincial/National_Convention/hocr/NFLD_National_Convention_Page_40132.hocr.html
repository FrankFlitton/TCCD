               already said that we owe it to the people of this

               This Convention is only in its infancy; it has 
               <br />
               not yet emerged from its committee stage. Until 
               <br />
               we have passed that milestone let the different 
               <br />
               forms of government sleep peacefully, and when 
               <br />
               we are strong enough, wake them up, and then we 
               <br />
               shall see what we shall see. Mr. Chairman, we are 
               <br />
               growing up too fast; let us get back to our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com</span> 
               <br />
               mittee stage and ﬁnish that job first. When that 
               <br />
               work has been completed and discussed we shall 
               <br />
               be in a much better position to talk about the 
               <br />
               different forms of government most suitable for 
               <br />
               this country. We may find that our own house, 
               <br />
               with a little window cleaning, may not be so bad 
               <br />

               a big majority of the members is in favour of

               ﬁnding out what terms Canada would offer this

               <br />
               approach. I too think that the motion is a bit

               premature, and therefore favour the amendment 
               <br />
               brought in by Mr. Penny on Monday afternoon. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Mr. Fudge was interrupted in 
               <br />
               his address the other afternoon and unwittingly 
               <br />
               sat down. I feel quite sure that none of us wants 
               <br />
               to deprive Mr. Fudge of his liberty of completing 
               <br />
               his remarks.

               tions before the House, I rose and objected to the 
               <br />
               statement made by Mr. Smallwood, wherein he 
               <br />
               stated that Newfoundland was 50 to 100 years 
               <br />
               behind the times. I want to say that I did not 
               <br />
               believe it then and do not believe it now.

               It appears to me that the sole aim of the resolu-

               I have listened to the debate on this question 
               <br />
               and I recall the introduction of the Chadwick— 
               <br />
               Jones report by Major Cashin. You will remem— 
               <br />
               ber also that in later addresses made by other 
               <br />
               delegates Major Cashin was attacked viciously. 
               <br />
               No point was raised then regarding personalities, 
               <br />
               or that attack was not the proper procedure. But 
               <br />
               during discussion on this resolution, which in my 
               <br />
               opinion came before it was sent for, Major 
               <br />
               Cashin, in my opinion at any rate, was not treated 
               <br />
               fairly. And it appears to me that the whole thing 
               <br />
               was unfair. Mr. Cashin merely asked for‘an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex‘</span> 
               <br />
               planation from the introducer of these resolutions 
               <br />
               on whose authority he was suggesting the ap- 
               <br />
               pointment of senators and delegates to Ottawa. 
               <br />
               This I certainly would have asked myself, and I 
               <br />
               want to ask it now and to go on record that I have 
               <br />
               asked, not only for my own information but for 
               <br />
               the information of the people who comprise the 
               <br />
               second-largest district in the country. I feel that 
               <br />
               we are entitled to such information. I consider 
               <br />
               that if the statements made by Mr. Hollett and 
               <br />
               Mr. Harrington are not denied, then there is noth- 
               <br />
               ing else left for us to do but accept them as the 
               <br />
               truth.

               Right at this particular moment, one of the 
               <br />
               most important reports was to be discussed, 
               <br />
               namely the Forestry Report, which was full of 
               <br />
               hope and encouragement and would have had an 
               <br />
               important bearing on the final findings of this 
               <br />
               Convention. This report in my opinion was too 
               <br />
               optimistic for the advocates of confederation. 
               <br />
               They only want the dark and gloomy picture to 
               <br />
               come before the people of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> I am sick 
               <br />
               and tired of hearing some of our delegates stating 
               <br />
               that we have not got the men in our country 
               <br />
               capable of looking after our own affairs. Let the 
               <br />
               recall one of the most important boards set up in 
               <br />
               this country during the war. I refer to the Woods 
               <br />
               Labour Board, and I am not alone in this when I 
               <br />
               say that the members on that board from its very 
               <br />
               beginning were highly capable of looking after 
               <br />
               their own affairs. The results show this and they 
               <br />
               were Newfoundlanders. And I further state, Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, that at the head of that board was 
               <br />
               another Newfoundlander, namely yourself, who 
               <br />
               succeeded the late Judge Higgins.
