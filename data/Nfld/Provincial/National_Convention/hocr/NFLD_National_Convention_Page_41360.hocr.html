               Those who would deprive the people of self- 
               <br />
               govemment advance a great variety of reasons, 
               <br />
               and perhaps their greatest and most effective one 
               <br />
               is the recalling of the misdeeds of the last years 
               <br />
               of responsible government; whilst in the same 
               <br />
               breath they say, “Responsible government! Why, 
               <br />
               what has that to offer?” It is when I hear such 
               <br />
               remarks that I doubt the wisdom of restoring 
               <br />
               self-government, for it portrays, as I see it, a great 
               <br />
               misconception of the duties and functions of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government.</span> The reason for this is given in the 
               <br />
               fact that we secured national government before 
               <br />
               we had come to appreciate its capabilities by a 
               <br />
               closer view of municipal government. I believe 
               <br />
               that to be largely correct, but I try to outweigh it 
               <br />
               with the advancement, in om age, of education, 
               <br />
               and in the great advantages of radio and press 
               <br />
               distribution. I further try to outweigh it by the 
               <br />
               ability of our people to grasp the intricacies of 
               <br />
               any situation. Iknow they can do it. I have visited 
               <br />
               people’s homes where, in the war days, the ad- 
               <br />
               vancement of the allied armies was charted and 
               <br />
               recorded with marvelous enlightenment. I have 
               <br />
               been astounded at their ability to constructively 
               <br />
               estimate world reactions. We are indeed a great 
               <br />
               people, but we have to outlive a period of our 
               <br />
               history when we were a spoiled people. We have 
               <br />
               to outlive a period in our history when we 
               <br />
               believed our government to be capable of un— 
               <br />
               limited handouts, when we seemed to shut our 
               <br />
               eyes to the fact that a government can give back 
               <br />
               to the people only part of that which they take 
               <br />
               from them. We did not seem to realise that the 
               <br />
               more gratuities a government bestows, the more 
               <br />
               taxes it must collect. This was not a deliberate 
               <br />
               wrong, but it certainly was an error and it gave 
               <br />
               rise to serious reactions. And now, as we consider 
               <br />
               a return to self~govemment, we must check the 
               <br />
               credentials of our people as well as the resources 
               <br />
               of our country. My faith in both I have already

               Generally, I would say that Newfoundland’s

               position today is a coveted one and that our 
               <br />
               progress offers further promise. We have a better 
               <br />
               marketing system for our ﬁsh, which should 
               <br />
               serve us well in the years ahead, whilst con—

               solidating our position on these markets, and we 
               <br />
               continued to enjoy high price for this commodity. 
               <br />
               How unlike this is to other countries, some of 
               <br />
               which were marketing their products, for ex—

               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">posbwar</span> business. Let us stop a moment to ap-

               It was a satisfying feature, in the days of 
               <br />
               committee meetings, to see the way many of our 
               <br />
               industrialists considered themselves a part of this 
               <br />

               promise and to weigh their earnestness and deter— 
               <br />
               urination in developing industries. In one in- 
               <br />
               stance only did we meet an antagonistic attitude 
               <br />
               and what could be described as a refusal to co-

               of praise to the civil servants who assisted the
