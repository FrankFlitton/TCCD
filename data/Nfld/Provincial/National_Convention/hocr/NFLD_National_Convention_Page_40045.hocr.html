               <br />
               labour for many years I would never be one who 
               <br />
               would cast my vote to let 70,000 starve. I agree 
               <br />
               with my honourable friends Mr. Newell and 
               <br />
               Mr. Keough, but I am interested today, as a rep- 
               <br />
               resentative of the people, in the question of how 
               <br />
               we are going to get three meals a day for oursel- 
               <br />
               ves and our families. We must not forget that 
               <br />
               while the Commission of Government have 
               <br />
               made mistakes they have done some good things 
               <br />
               as well. I wish it to be distinctly understood that 
               <br />
               I don’t like Commission of Government, al- 
               <br />
               though I helped bring it in. I would rather see 
               <br />
               responsible government or some other form of 
               <br />
               government if this country could afford it. I came 
               <br />
               to this Convention with an open mind and no 
               <br />
               preconceived ideas. I told my supporters that it 
               <br />
               was useless to ask me what form of government 
               <br />
               I wanted. I said, “I don’t know, I must ﬁrst go 
               <br />
               there, and after every form of government is 
               <br />
               examined then, and only then, will I be in a 
               <br />
               position to cast my vote for what form of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern~</span> 
               <br />
               ment I thinkis best for the people of this country.” 
               <br />
               And the form of government that is best for the 
               <br />
               people of this country is best for me and what I 
               <br />
               represent.

               Now, some may be running away with the idea 
               <br />
               that all this country is down on Commission of 
               <br />
               Government. That is not correct. I think that if 
               <br />
               there was a vote taken among the ﬁshermen, you 
               <br />
               would ﬁnd 85% of them for it. This is the only 
               <br />
               form of government that ever did anything for the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fishermen...</span> I just bring back to your memories 
               <br />
               two or three years ago, when the government first 
               <br />
               announced the prices of codﬁsh in the foreign 
               <br />
               markets. That was done, I think, as much through 
               <br />
               my inﬂuence and advice as through anybody’s. I 
               <br />
               was after Mr. Dunn for two years to do that and, 
               <br />
               by the way, I feel that Mr. Dunn was the ﬁnest 
               <br />
               commissioner that has come here in the Natural 
               <br />
               Resources department — and the fishermen 
               <br />
               knew for the ﬁrst time in the history of the New- 
               <br />
               foundland ﬁshery that year and since, before they 
               <br />
               put a cod trap, or a trawl, or net or line in the 
               <br />
               water, what they were going to get for a quintal 
               <br />

               of ﬁsh when it was taken out and dried. Take 
               <br />
               labour. The government created conciliation 
               <br />
               boards ﬁrst. They created an arbitration board 
               <br />
               and gave laboura show, and I may say that I think 
               <br />
               that in eight out of ten cases that came before that 
               <br />
               board, labour got the beneﬁt. Ask any of the 
               <br />
               clerks on Water Street. Labour today can thank 
               <br />
               the Commission of Government for that. Take 
               <br />
               public health, cottage hospitals, and other things 
               <br />
               carried through by the Commission of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern»</span> 
               <br />
               ment. We must, if we are going to condemn any 
               <br />
               form of government, give credit where credit is 
               <br />
               due. The Commission of Government has, in my 
               <br />
               opinion, done as much and more for the industry 
               <br />
               of the country than any government which has 
               <br />
               existed. As far as the government of today is 
               <br />
               concerned and the future government, sir, I have 
               <br />
               an open mind. After this Convention has got 
               <br />
               through its work and settled down to make some 
               <br />
               recommendations to the Dominions Office as to 
               <br />
               what forms of government are best for this 
               <br />
               country, then I will cast my vote according to the 
               <br />
               dictates of my conscience. 
               <br />

               When the discussion was on in connection 
               <br />
               with Mr. Wild coming to address the Conven- 
               <br />
               tion, and the discussion lasted some time as to 
               <br />
               whether he would address the Convention as a 
               <br />
               committee of the whole with no outsiders, or in 
               <br />
               public with strangers in the gallery, I said I 
               <br />
               thought it was better not to cross our bridges until 
               <br />
               we came to them. I said that if Mr. Wild refused 
               <br />
               to give us information in public, then that was all 
               <br />
               we could do about it. Never kick a man until you 
               <br />
               have reason. One of the daily papers reported I 
               <br />
               said that if he refused to give us the information, 
               <br />
               it was time to jump on him. That gave a wrong 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">impression.</span> I do not think any members, myself 
               <br />
               included, are ready to jump on anybody’s back. 
               <br />
               Every man should get a decent hearing, and never 
               <br />
               condemn a man until you have reason to con- 
               <br />
               demn. If Mr. Wild or any of the commissioners 
               <br />
               cross meI would not be afraid to tell them what 
               <br />
               I thought of them. The paper’s statement was 
               <br />
               misleading and I ask that it be corrected.
