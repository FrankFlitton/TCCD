               think it is a pity to adjourn now and not carry on. 
               <br />
               I don’t care if Mr. Smallwood objects to having 
               <br />
               the tariff set out. Let's have something else. But 
               <br />
               I do object to one man insisting that his will shall 
               <br />
               be carried over 44 men. That’s one thing, and I 
               <br />
               don’t care if you take another hour to decide that. 
               <br />
               I think it is an outright disgrace to adjourn until 
               <br />
               Monday. Here we have the rest of this afternoon, 
               <br />
               and the night session, and tomorrow afternoon, 
               <br />
               and we should not adjourn, but go ahead and get 
               <br />
               what we are allowed to give to the people out of 
               <br />
               these Black Books... These are the only things 
               <br />
               we can give to the people. We cannot go back to 
               <br />
               Canada and start to negotiate for better terms. We 
               <br />
               are not allowed to as a Convention, the delegation 
               <br />
               was not allowed to. I think it is ridiculous... I am 
               <br />
               very much against any adjournment on this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mat»</span> 
               <br />
               ter, and I think Mr. Crosbie might agree to that.

               Mr. Cashin Mr. Chairman, I am sorry that I 
               <br />
               created anything of a furore. I have never done 
               <br />
               that in my life! But here is the position. I have a 
               <br />
               lot of sympathy in many ways with Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood. He fostered this delegation to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">0t»</span> 
               <br />
               tawa in the beginning. They went to Ottawa, and 
               <br />
               I hold that the delegation came back with an 
               <br />
               incomplete report. They have made no report 
               <br />
               whatever as a delegation to this Convention, and 
               <br />
               this Grey Book may or may not be the result of 
               <br />
               their efforts in Ottawa; we don’t know, because 
               <br />
               before they left Ottawa this was not in their 
               <br />
               possession. It was sent here afterwards by the 
               <br />
               Canadian government through His Excellency 
               <br />
               the Governor in Commission, and from then it 
               <br />
               was sent to this ofﬁce, consequently the delega- 
               <br />
               tion which we sent to Ottawa merely came back 
               <br />
               with the Black Books. Now when we received 
               <br />
               this document here, and when we go into the 
               <br />
               ﬁgures in it, we ﬁnd that they have no foundation 
               <br />
               in fact, and that there is no member of the delega— 
               <br />
               tion who is able to properly explain them. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, surely the members of the Ottawa 
               <br />
               delegation should be able to get up and explain 
               <br />
               every item that is in here in connection with the 
               <br />
               financial situation of both Canada and New- 
               <br />
               foundland; but no, what happened was, as I see 
               <br />
               it, when they adjourned in Ottawa to return to 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, the Canadian government made 
               <br />
               up a budget, so to speak, of its own, particularly 
               <br />
               with regard to federal expenditures, and the Qt- 
               <br />
               tawa delegation came back; and when they see 
               <br />
               this, whilst they might have talked about it up 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, that the Ottawa delegation fell 
               <br />
               down on its job, because they should have had all 
               <br />
               this information, and we should not have to ask 
               <br />
               any questions at all. Mr. Smallwood pointed out 
               <br />
               to me that the way I asked these questions this 
               <br />
               afternoon did not suit him. lam going to ask them 
               <br />

               and ask them on what basis they made them up. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Hear! Hear! 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               <br />
               then I will say they are fraudulent. It is all 
               <br />
               guesswork. I said when this House opened 15 
               <br />
               months ago, and I am going to repeat it: there is 
               <br />
               only one regret I have, that I consented to be a

               <br />
               greatest political mistake of my career, to stay 
               <br />
               here and talk at a mock parliament that means
