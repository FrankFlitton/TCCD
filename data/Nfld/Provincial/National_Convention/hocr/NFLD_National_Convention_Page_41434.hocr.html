               length than the time allotted to me in showing 
               <br />
               why this country of ours should not and must not 
               <br />
               allow itself and its nationhood to be absorbed by 
               <br />
               the dominion to the west of it, but I think that I 
               <br />
               should avail of the short time left to me in at- 
               <br />
               tempting to boil this whole thing down to its 
               <br />
               broad outlines, and see the thing at its proper 
               <br />
               worth. Does not all this confederation business 
               <br />
               come down to a matter of a cold, commercial 
               <br />
               business deal, whereby we were asked to sell out 
               <br />
               our country and our future to Canada for a certain 
               <br />
               sum of money? And speaking of this attitude, I 
               <br />
               confess it seems to me to be a terribly serious 
               <br />
               thing for any country or any people to place 
               <br />
               themselves in the balance against the pull of 
               <br />
               Canadian dollars. What is the price, or shall I say 
               <br />
               the bribe, they offer us? The prize bait seems to 
               <br />
               be that a certain number of our people will get 
               <br />
               this thing called the baby bonus. But do they tell 
               <br />
               us that this bonus is an unsubstantial thing, that it 
               <br />
               is something that we cannot depend upon? That 
               <br />
               it may vanish overnight, and that in the event of 
               <br />
               a depression in Canada it will die a quick death? 
               <br />
               Indeed, my own personal opinion is that it will 
               <br />
               not exist longer than two years. Do they tell us 
               <br />
               that when our babies reach the age of 16 they will 
               <br />
               spend the rest of their lives paying back to the 
               <br />
               Canadian government the amount of their bonus? 
               <br />
               Do they tell us that when our babies reach 
               <br />
               military age they will almost certainly be con- 
               <br />
               scripted into the Canadian military forces? Do 
               <br />
               they tell us that in the event of confederation a 
               <br />
               big percentage of these young people will have 
               <br />
               to emigrate from this country to seek employ- 
               <br />
               ment which cannot be found at home? Of course 
               <br />
               they do not tell us those things, because they 
               <br />
               know, and know well, that if we saw the truth of 
               <br />
               these things this baby bonus would be no longer 
               <br />
               able to bluff and deceive us. 
               <br />

               Then they next offer us an enticement. Here 
               <br />
               again they cover the bitter pill with a thick coat- 
               <br />
               ing of sugar. You don’t hear them tell you that 
               <br />
               many of those who receive this old age pension 
               <br />
               will have to surrender their property to the state, 
               <br />
               and that in the ﬁnal result all it seems is that the 
               <br />
               pensioner has to sell his property to the Canadian 
               <br />
               government with the hope of getting paid back in 
               <br />
               some small monthly installments. Then there is 
               <br />
               the matter of our industries. Do they tell us that 
               <br />
               if confederation comes to this country it will 
               <br />
               mean death tomany of our small industries? That

               <br />

               Now we come to another matter, which means 
               <br />
               much to the religious and law-abiding people of 
               <br />
               our country. With us, the matter of our education- 
               <br />
               al system is one of great importance, and we have 
               <br />
               evolved our own system of denominational 
               <br />
               schools, which time has found to be most suitable 
               <br />
               to the wishes and requirements of New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders. In the event of confederation there 
               <br />
               is a threat that, as Mr. Crummey has pointed out 
               <br />
               to this Convention, is a most serious threat to the 
               <br />
               destruction and overthrow of that system. He has 
               <br />
               pointed out to us that if Canadians take charge of 
               <br />
               our country in every probability we will have 
               <br />
               imposed on us, even forced on us, the adoption 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nonvdenominational</span> schools. What right have 
               <br />
               we to jeopardise the moral and religious lives of 
               <br />
               the coming generations in this matter? Why, to 
               <br />
               my mind this particular thing in itself is sufﬁcient 
               <br />
               to warn us that the road to confederation is the 
               <br />
               wrong road for Newfoundland. But it seems that 
               <br />
               our people are asked to regard this matter from 
               <br />
               the standpoint of dollars and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cents.</span> Well, if we 
               <br />
               talk of dollars and cents we must also talk of 
               <br />
               taxes. Are the people of this country ready to take 
               <br />
               on a burden of taxation, the like of which they or 
               <br />
               their fathers have never known? Are they 
               <br />
               prepared to chip in an additional $35-40 million 
               <br />
               because you, Mr. and Mrs. Newfoundland, you 
               <br />
               are the ones, out of your pennies and dimes, who 
               <br />
               will have to pay for Mr. Smallwood’s baby bonus.

               Now in this matter I am not speaking from 
               <br />
               hearsay. I have lived in Canada and I can speak 
               <br />
               from hard, actual experience, and I tell you that 
               <br />
               under confederation the people of this country 
               <br />
               will ﬁnd themselves smothered and suffocated 
               <br />
               under an avalanche of federal, provincial and 
               <br />
               municipal taxation. I have heard Mr. Smallwood, 
               <br />
               when asked some embarrassing questions about 
               <br />
               taxation, evade the issue by saying, “Oh, the 
               <br />
               federal government will not impose such and 
               <br />
               such a tax. That would be a matter for our own 
               <br />
