               of anger, I made a remark which now I wish to

               Mr. Hollett Mr. Chairman, I don’t propose to 
               <br />
               make any extended remarks in reply to my friend 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood. I think probably he has the right 
               <br />
               to lose his temper once in a while, the same as the 
               <br />

               heartily accept his apology for the words which 
               <br />
               he used towards me the other day, but, as I said, 
               <br />
               these words were spoken in the heat of debate and 
               <br />
               I am quite sure that he probably did not mean 
               <br />
               what he said, and if he did, he has recanted now. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood and myself have got along very 
               <br />
               peaceably in the past 12 months. We have fallen 
               <br />
               out once in a while, but it was always in the 
               <br />
               course of debate when we were trying to decide 
               <br />
               something which we each believed to be for the 
               <br />
               beneﬁt, or otherwise, of our country.

               I am rather appalled at the attitude taken by 
               <br />
               some of the daily papers in connection with the 
               <br />
               little episode which happened here on Friday. 
               <br />
               Speaking for myself, I remember being in the 
               <br />
               British House of Commons last May at question 
               <br />
               time, and there were more cat~calls across the 
               <br />
               ﬂoors of that assembly than we have cast at each 
               <br />
               other in the whole 12 months. There were cat- 
               <br />
               calls and cries of “sit down" and “get out”; and 
               <br />
               nobody seemed to worry about that, it was in the 
               <br />
               ordinary course of debate... I accept this apology 
               <br />
               from Mr. Smallwood, and l would like, sir, in 
               <br />
               accepting it, to offer to you my heartiest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con»</span> 
               <br />
               gratulations on this office which you have as— 
               <br />
               sumed, and which I know will tax even you; at 
               <br />
               times you will be taxed probably as to the correct 
               <br />
               decision to give, but I feel quite sure that I can 
               <br />
               add my words to Mr. Smallwood in offering you 
               <br />
               my whole-hearted support in this strenuous job 
               <br />
               which you have undertaken for your country.
