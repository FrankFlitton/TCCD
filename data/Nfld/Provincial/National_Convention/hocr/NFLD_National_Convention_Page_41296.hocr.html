               It might be just as well if you are discussing 
               <br />
               the matter with the Attorney General, you might 
               <br />
               take up with him the necessity of an act ofParlia- 
               <br />
               merit to put this Convention out of existence. In 
               <br />
               any event, even assuming that its work is done, it 
               <br />
               is still a Convention by statute. What is there on 
               <br />
               the statute book to say that it does not exist any 
               <br />
               more? There is nothing to say that having made 
               <br />
               its recommendations the Convention shall cease 
               <br />
               to exist. It is quite possible that the Governor in 
               <br />
               Commission may want it to do some more work. 
               <br />
               If so, it is still there, and the Governor can em- 
               <br />
               power it to do that work. I think that should be 
               <br />
               taken up with the Attorney General when you see
