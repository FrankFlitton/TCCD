               government was raised, I would like to make this

               one brief statement. When we have reviewed the 
               <br />
               report that has come back from London; when we 
               <br />
               see where we stand as far as the British govern- 
               <br />
               ment and Newfoundland are concerned; and 
               <br />
               when we receive the report of the delegation that 
               <br />
               is to proceed to Ottawa <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«—</span> when we get all these 
               <br />
               reports, together with the facts we have gleaned 
               <br />
               about our own country and its ﬁnances and 
               <br />
               prospects, and the people of this country should 
               <br />
               make the decision to stand alone, though that 
               <br />
               decision should involve a certain amount of 
               <br />
               poverty — in other words they are prepared to be 
               <br />
               poor but proud — I want to say that they will earn 
               <br />
               my undying respect, and that I will do whatever 
               <br />
               I can. But there are two observations I want to 
               <br />
               make. One is, I have never been prepared to 
               <br />
               compromise that such a decision must be made 
               <br />
               by the whole people of Newfoundland, including 
               <br />
               the people to whom the future may be hardest, 
               <br />
               because it has always been our fate that when the 
               <br />
               boot has been too small it has always pinched 
               <br />
               hardest on the smallest toes. I think the people 
               <br />
               most directly concerned in any sacriﬁce should 
               <br />
               be heard from before that sacriﬁce is imposed 
               <br />
               upon them. If they take it willingly, more power 
               <br />
               and more credit to them. Secondly, regardless 
               <br />
               how much you or I may come here and talk of 
               <br />
               what we will do in the future, there has never been 
               <br />
               in this country any equality of sacrifice on the part 
               <br />
               of all people. If there had been, perhaps we should 
               <br />
               never be in the position we are today. When we 
               <br />
               are prepared to stand together and take that 
               <br />
               equality of sacriﬁce, perhaps we shall have the 
               <br />
               right to tell other people they are not what they 
               <br />
               should be. Let us not scorn any man for looking 
               <br />
               to the security of his future, when our own future 
               <br />
               is as secure as we want it to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be,</span>

               <br />
               importance, worried by fears of its own imagin-

               ing, so much so as to darkly contemplate outside 
               <br />
               influences, and internal traitors banding together 
               <br />
               to work our economic, financial and political 
               <br />
               collapse? Gentlemen, the main conclusion I draw 
               <br />
               from this debate is that the mother country gives 
               <br />
               us a guarantee that is at best provisional upon her 
               <br />
               ability to stand behind the guarantee. Should we 
               <br />
               then, on this very uncertain assumption, retain in 
               <br />
               power a government whose policies we all claim 
               <br />
               are not in the best interest of this island? Perhaps 
               <br />
               the main objective of the London delegation was 
               <br />
               to find out under what terms, if any, the British 
               <br />
               government would be prepared to continue the
