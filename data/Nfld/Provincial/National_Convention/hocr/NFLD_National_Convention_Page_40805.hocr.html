               won’t ﬁnd anything there showing dishonesty. I

               am convinced from what I have seen and what 
               <br />
               we did, that this country is self—supporting, no

               trary. 
               <br />
               Mr. Vardy Mr. Chairman, it does not matter 
               <br />
               how we obtained the prosperity we have, but 
               <br />
               rather what are our chances of holding it. It 
               <br />
               matters not to a country whether an earthquake, 
               <br />
               war or even a revolution brings prosperity. What 
               <br />
               does matter in deciding on a plan for the future is 
               <br />
               whether the prosperity is real. Is it lasting? Have 
               <br />
               we a reasonable chance of continuing to be self- 
               <br />
               supporting? Surely we do not expect a drop of 
               <br />
               25% in our revenue in the immediate future. 
               <br />
               Frankly, I fail to see what purpose it serves to 
               <br />
               be debating these reports in committee of the 
               <br />
               whole. Most of us could have used up much more 
               <br />
               valuable time talking, bickering and arguing over 
               <br />
               something we ourselves, and the whole country, 
               <br />
               know has been prepared in such a manner as to 
               <br />
               do full justiCe to all the circumstances surround— 
               <br />
               ing it. Each member should have spoken once 
               <br />
               only and then the vote taken. It has been very 
               <br />
               difﬁcult for some of us to hold our seats when we 
               <br />
               see so much valuable time wasted. I am in full 
               <br />
               support of Mr. Job’s suggestion to get on with the 
               <br />
               job, and I must reiterate that this whole business 
               <br />
               should not have lasted six months. In my opinion 
               <br />
               we are all justiﬁed in suggesting corrections or 
               <br />
               minor alterations, but when we appoint commit- 
               <br />
               tees to do a job, we should not question the 
               <br />
               honesty of the reports, butrather the purpose they 
               <br />
               serve, and vote according to the dictates of our 
               <br />
               own consciences. In my opinion, anyone who 
               <br />
               votes against this report is betraying the land that 
               <br />
               gave them birth; regardless of whether we recom— 
               <br />
               mend that we carry on on our own or join hands 
               <br />
               with some other country, it is and will still remain 
               <br />
               our bounden duty to keep the torch of New- 
               <br />
               foundland burning high, and never let us accept 
               <br />
               an inferiority complex at any time, but insist that 
               <br />
               we are, and will always be equal with our neigh- 
               <br />
               bours of the same race. We are all only too 
               <br />
               conscious of the fact that all is not well with the 
               <br />
               world, and we cannot expect to escape our full 
               <br />
               share of the aftermath of the war; but we are

               waste the time of this Convention with my 
               <br />
               opinion of members who consider their own 
               <br />
               blocking has any bearing whatsoever on the 
               <br />
               economic, or indeed any other standing, of our 
               <br />
               country. The general public, and indeed you 
               <br />
               yourself, must by this time be heartily sick of 
               <br />
               would-be statesmen and their egotism, so enough 
               <br />
               of this nonsense. I make no pretense of being an 
               <br />
               economist, but at the same time I claim common 
               <br />
               sense, and I trust that my claim will be substan— 
               <br />
               tiated.

               The direct aim of any business involving the 
               <br />
               public is to bring to that public the things that it 
               <br />
               needs most. If stocks held are the stocks in 
               <br />
               demand, then that business, regardless of whether 
               <br />
               its neighbours sink or swim, is bound to thrive — 
               <br />

               ﬁnance minister’s estimates. Apply this principle
