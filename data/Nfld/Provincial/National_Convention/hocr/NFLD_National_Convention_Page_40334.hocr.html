               From the days of Adam Smith, the famous 
               <br />
               English economist, whose treatise The Wealth of 
               <br />
               Nations was published in 1776, the doctrine of 
               <br />
               free trade has been known. Its first application 
               <br />
               came with Pitt’s commercial treaty with France 
               <br />
               in 1786, which removed many of the prohibitions 
               <br />
               and duties that had previously obstructed 
               <br />
               legitimate trade between the two countries, but 
               <br />
               the outbreak of the Napoleonic wars checked its 
               <br />
               workings. Down through the centuries the 
               <br />
               protagonists of free trade and protective tariffs 
               <br />
               have been battling the subject, and there is still a 
               <br />
               wide difference of opinion as to the respective 
               <br />
               merits of either policy, and the existence of 
               <br />
               protective tariffs in most countries of the world 
               <br />
               today would seem to prove that the free trade 
               <br />
               doctrine has not as yet won the allegiance of an 
               <br />
               overwhelming number of disciples. The breaking 
               <br />
               down of all international barriers and tariffs 
               <br />
               would seem to be essential to the satisfactory 
               <br />
               working of the doctrine, and perhaps it may be 
               <br />
               said that the ultimate fulﬁllment of the dream of 
               <br />
               men like Adam Smith, Mercier and Le Trosne 
               <br />

               and support of a large number of people, and that 
               <br />
               encouragement should be given to the estab-

               <br />
               way contribute the same beneﬁts to the economic 
               <br />
               structure of Newfoundland”. I also find myself in 
               <br />
               agreement with their statement in the last para- 
               <br />
               graph of page 9 —— “The question of local in- 
               <br />
               dustries in relation to tariffs and customs duties, 
               <br />
               as affecting the cost to the consumer, was taken 
               <br />
               up by your Committee, and it should be noted 
               <br />
               here that your Committee is not satisfied that the 
               <br />
               high customs tariff under which certain local 
               <br />
               industries operate may be in the best interest of 
               <br />
               the country as a whole, and we believe that such 
               <br />
               matters should be investigated." Again I say, that 
               <br />
               it is a govemment’s duty to conduct such an 
               <br />
               investigation, and it is not a task that comes 
               <br />
               within the scope of this Convention.

               Quoting again from the report: “...the Com- 
               <br />
               mittee felt that it would require the investigation 
               <br />
               by accountants and/or economists in order to 
               <br />
               determine the degree of protection in connection 
               <br />
               with revenue tariff.” I have to disagree with Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood’s inference in Friday’s debate that 
               <br />
               the Committee was lacking in appreciation of its 
               <br />
               task as well as its powers, by not getting such 
               <br />
               accountants or economists to assist them. By the 
               <br />
               same token all committees of the Convention 
               <br />
               would be so lacking, including the Committee on 
               <br />
               Transportation and Communications, which on 
               <br />
               certain matters, notably the railway, professed its 
               <br />
               inability to make a proper assessment of all the 
               <br />
               figures and factors that went to make up their
