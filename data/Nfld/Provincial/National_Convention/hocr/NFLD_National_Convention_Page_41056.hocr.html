               Mr. Bailey I just wish to deal with the ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               side of it, Mr. Chairman. Coming back to this 
               <br />
               assessment of Newfoundland’s ﬁnancial posi~ 
               <br />
               tion. When we accept this in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Convention,</span> and 
               <br />
               the eight years have passed, and we give that 
               <br />
               royal commisssion the right to come here and to 
               <br />
               help us set up, it says here, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“...having</span> regard to 
               <br />
               capacity to pay, than that of the Maritime Provin- 
               <br />
               ces.” Yet Mr. Smallwood turns around and says 
               <br />
               it’s none of Canada’s business how we get our 
               <br />
               taxes. We must get them directly. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Under section 92 neither is it 
               <br />
               any of their business. 
               <br />
               Mr. Bailey And yet Mr. Smallwood can tell me. 
               <br />
               Supposing for instance that we have got to find 
               <br />
               say $30 million, how are we going to get it 
               <br />
               without putting in the same form of taxation that 
               <br />
               the other nine provinces of Canada put in? I will 
               <br />
               be happy to listen to him. This is the place I am 
               <br />
               in, and that is what I want the people to know. if 
               <br />
               we go on having extra social services, and extra 
               <br />
               responsibilities I want the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland to know, no beating around the bush 
               <br />
               or anything at all; I want you to come out clear, 
               <br />
               that when that royal commission comes down 
               <br />
               here and lays the case before us, does that mean 
               <br />
               we are going to have the same form of taxes as 
               <br />
               they have in the Maritime Provinces? I don‘t see 
               <br />
               any way out. If a delegate to this Convention can 
               <br />
               get up here and tell me how we, in this island, are 
               <br />
               going to be taxed after we lose the way we are 
               <br />
               collecting taxes today, i will be perfectly satisﬁed 
               <br />
               to listen, and I don’t know but that I will go along 
               <br />
               and work for confederation. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Chairman, that’s a very 
               <br />
               good point raised by Mr. Bailey, and it’s a point 
               <br />
               that deserves a straightforward and honest 
               <br />
               answer. He directed your attention to clause 14.... 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               What does that mean? That is an extremely 
               <br />
               important clause in these terms. It is sometimes 
               <br />
               said that confederation for Newfoundland would 
               <br />
               be a leap in the dark. In certain respects it would 
               <br />
               be and in certain respects it would not. Certain 
               <br />
               things are laid down, and are as plain as the day. 
               <br />
               But in other respects it would be a leap in the dark, 
               <br />
               and one respect in which confederation would be 
               <br />
               a leap in the dark is this very matter, sir, that we 
               <br />
               are discussing here today, and ever since Mon- 
               <br />
               day. That is, could the government of the 
               <br />
               province pay its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">way?....</span> Any government can 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               pay its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">way.</span> There need never have been a year 
               <br />
               since 1920, when the bad times hit us, when the 
               <br />
               government needed to fail to balance its budget. 
               <br />
               A government can always pay its way. it has three 
               <br />
               ways to do it: 1. To stick on more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taxes.</span> 2. To cut 
               <br />
               down on the public services. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3.</span> To do both, to put 
               <br />
               on more taxes and give the people less service. 
               <br />
               Now these are three ways, and either one of them 
               <br />
               will enable any government to pay its way, but 
               <br />
               that’s not what we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mean.</span> As a province we have 
               <br />
               got to have our own government, and can that 
               <br />
               government pay its way without putting too 
               <br />
               heavy a burden of taxation on the people, and 
               <br />
               without cutting down on the public services? It is 
               <br />
               impossible to answer that with finality, and when 
               <br />
               I came in here on Monday 1 brought in what l 
               <br />
               called “estimates“. I admit frankly that I am not 
               <br />
               a prophet, and that i cannot see through a stone 
               <br />
               wall further than any other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">man...</span> i have brought 
               <br />
               in what I honestly and sincerely consider to be 
               <br />
               conservative estimates or guesses, if you like, 
               <br />
               showing that we can do that, but we may not. I 
               <br />
               will be man enough to admit that if in any one of 
               <br />
               these eight years the government should spend 
               <br />
               more in that year or take in less revenue in that 
               <br />
               year than I show, then in that year we have to dip 
               <br />
               into our surplus to pay the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">debts.</span> Why should i 
               <br />
               try to hide that or refuse to admit <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it?....</span>

               <br />
               what will happen ﬁnancially to this government 
               <br />
               if we become a province the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada says, “We know what you are up against. 
               <br />
               You can’t forecast it exactly. Tell you what we 
               <br />
               will do; we will set up a royal commisssion" - 
               <br />
               as they have done before in other provinces. They 
               <br />
               set up the royal commisssion headed by Sir 
               <br />
               Andrew Ray Duncan in the three Maritime 
               <br />
               Provinces in 1926. They set up another one 
               <br />
               headed by Mr. lustice White, and so you get the 
               <br />
               Duncan-White Award. These royal commissions 
               <br />
               admitted that the Maritime Provinces could not 
               <br />
               pay their way and give the people proper service, 
               <br />
               so the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Duncan~White</span> Award recommended that 
               <br />
               they pay more to the Maritime Provinces, and 
               <br />
               they did, and they are still doing it. So they said, 
               <br />
               “We will appoint a royal commission to look into 
               <br />
               your ﬁnances, and we will do that inside of eight 
               <br />
               years after you become a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">province".</span> Now what 
               <br />
               do they do? When that royal commission lands in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">St.</span> John’s, what is their job? To look into our 
               <br />
               ﬁnances. What for? To see what? To see whether
