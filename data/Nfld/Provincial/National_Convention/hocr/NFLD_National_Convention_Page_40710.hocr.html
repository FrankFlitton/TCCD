               friend from Lewisporte, Mr. Northcott, and he 
               <br />
               could tell us more about lobster than we know. 
               <br />
               Lobsters today are not canned so much as they

               were in the old days, they are shipped away alive. 
               <br />

               <br />
               they have cornered this lobster ﬁshery in their

               area and arranged to ship them properly and 
               <br />
               co-operatively, and thereby assure to the people

               Salmon. Again, we have the same thing there 
               <br />
               as in the lobster ﬁshery. Mr. Job would be able to 
               <br />
               tell us more about salmon, because I think he was 
               <br />
               shipping them to England in a frozen state for a 
               <br />
               good many years at any rate; but even today 
               <br />
               salmon are at a premium, and are being shipped 
               <br />
               away in the frozen condition. And then, as you 
               <br />
               know, our seal ﬁshery for many years has been 
               <br />
               more or less a dud. Most of us remember when 
               <br />
               we had eight or ten huge ships prosecuting the 
               <br />
               seal ﬁshery, and for some reason or other the 
               <br />
               seals got scarce, or the market collapsed or the 
               <br />
               strips were sold. For a good many years the seal 
               <br />
               ﬁshery just more or less faded out of existence 
               <br />
               and gave no returns whatsoever to our people. 
               <br />
               Now in the last couple of years you have seen 
               <br />
               what has happened. That is not a wartime boom 
               <br />
               — it is peace. We have starving people all over 
               <br />
               the world, and we have unlimited ﬁsh, and there- 
               <br />
               fore it is our job to have brains and money 
               <br />
               enough, government or otherwise, to catch and 
               <br />
               ship it so that we can get something in return, and 
               <br />
               our people can pay the necessary revenues into 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Finance Committee, at $34.5 million. That in

               you know, are more extensive than they were... 
               <br />
               These altogether employ about 2,378 men and
