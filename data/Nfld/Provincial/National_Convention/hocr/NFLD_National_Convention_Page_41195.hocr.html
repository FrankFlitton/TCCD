               service, one man rang me up indignantly and

               upon what they’re doing in Canada?” I do. I’m 
               <br />
               going to skip over the public debt and the tax 
               <br />
               agreement, which I can’t <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">understand,</span> I doubt that 
               <br />
               there’s more then one or two people that could 
               <br />
               approach it. Then I come to federal revenue and 
               <br />
               expenditure. I don’t propose to go into them. I 
               <br />
               don’t propose to go into the proposed provincial 
               <br />
               budget, because I hope I’m not hurting anyone’s 
               <br />
               feelings -— it seems to me to be too silly to merit 
               <br />
               much time to be spent on it. I have seen a budget 
               <br />
               prepared. I have seen dozens and dozens of 
               <br />
               people work for months, people actually dealing 
               <br />
               with these matters. I have seen that budget 
               <br />
               brought forward to the minister, and he has had 
               <br />
               a go at it and I have seen it in the end torn up by 
               <br />
               the responsible government of the day.... And 
               <br />
               then I am asked to accept a budget which is based 
               <br />
               upon a short study and also has in it the normal 
               <br />
               capital expenditures taken from our surplus. 
               <br />
               And we are asked to believe that that goes with a 
               <br />
               province that is self—supporting. I would say this, 
               <br />
               that looking at Newfoundland over a long period, 
               <br />
               when the transitional grants and our surplus have 
               <br />
               come to an end, and on the basis of the ﬁgures 
               <br />
               produced here now, not allowing for the normal 
               <br />
               increase, that you’ll ﬁnd in the accounts, as 
               <br />
               governments progress, that the government 
               <br />
               would have to ﬁnd $9 million more. It is now 
               <br />
               ﬁnding according to this $3.3 million. It is now 
               <br />
               finding from the interest from its own surplus, 
               <br />
               $600,000 under this budget. It is now ﬁnding 
               <br />
               $250,000 just to pay the normal increments in the 
               <br />
               civil service, $250,000 from refunds, mind you, 
               <br />
               from refunds.

               Mr. Smallwood You mean the normal growth

               Mr. Butt I don’t know how far it can go. I

               speciﬁcally told you, it was because of the age 
               <br />
               grouping... The civil service has been reor— 
               <br />
               ganised over the past few years and they’ve 
               <br />
               brought in men who are younger than the average 
               <br />
               civil service in an older established country 
               <br />
               which hadn’t been reorganised, would be... The 
               <br />
               point is, that we’re ﬁnding here under this budget 
               <br />
               $250,000 out of refunds from money which I 
               <br />
               doubt is paid yet. And if it isn’t paid yet, and the 
               <br />
               government just balances its budget this year, 
               <br />
               then the money to pay for these steamers will 
               <br />
               have to come out of surplus, and your $28 million 
               <br />
               will get another grant of a few million dollars. If 
               <br />
               they keep balancing as they are at the present 
               <br />
               time, and there’s no surplus this year, that money 
               <br />
               will have to come out of surplus. Then the tax 
               <br />
               rental, well I already spoke about that. How any 
               <br />
               person could recommend to the people of New— 
               <br />
               foundland that they should accept that just <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> 
               <br />
               cause seven provinces have accepted it, is beyond 
               <br />
               me. Several provinces which carry, I believe, 
               <br />
               about two—thirds of the population of Canada, do 
               <br />
               not accept it. Gas and electricity — $50,000. I 
               <br />
               would point out that that represents half that 
               <br />
               would be collected from these companies. In- 
               <br />
               cidentally I thought they were public utilities <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">..</span> 
               <br />
               publicly owned. I may be wrong. That involves 
               <br />
               taxation of $100,000 — on some of it. That’s 
               <br />
               what they pay now, I think.

               Mr. Butt Now we come to the transition grant, 
               <br />
               and to the new taxation to be imposed of 
               <br />
               $1,236,000, that has to be found in direct taxa- 
               <br />
               tion. In addition we are to take out $3 million a 
               <br />
               year from our surplus to spend on ordinary capital 
               <br />
               expenditure. It’s the sort of thing that must be 
               <br />
               taken into consideration when you’re consider~ 
               <br />
               ing the working of a govemment.... I contend that 
               <br />
               the surplus should not be touched under any 
               <br />
               circumstances, except in the case of national 
               <br />
               emergency. If I were a member of a government, 
               <br />
               I would suggest that if we didn’t have a surplus, 
               <br />
               that we would build one up. And my reason is 
               <br />
               this: because we have not developed to the point 
               <br />
               of self-sufﬁciency. When we must depend upon 
               <br />
               the outside world, we must take care of emergen— 
               <br />
               cies... I contend it is criminal to get rid of our 
               <br />
               surplus, I don’t care what kind of a government 
               <br />
