               <br />

               no power to negotiate.

               I frankly confess that the offer we have 
               <br />
               received appears to be fair, but I am fully conﬁ- 
               <br />
               dent that a delegation properly informed, assisted 
               <br />
               by competent advisers, and with the power to 
               <br />
               negotiate, would receive a better offer from 
               <br />
               Canada than we received. I say that with full 
               <br />
               knowledge of what I am saying. From informa- 
               <br />
               tion I gathered from various sources during our 
               <br />
               visit to Ottawa, I am certain that the Canadian 
               <br />
               government would have given us a better offer 
               <br />
               had the case been properly presented. Again I 
               <br />
               repeat, with full knowledge of what I am saying, 
               <br />
               that we can still get a better offer or, if you will, 
               <br />
               more favourable terms of confederation, if the 
               <br />
               approach is made by a government elected by and 
               <br />
               representative of Newfoundland.

               I do not want you to understand that our 
               <br />
               delegation did not do a good job or that we were 
               <br />
               not given every assistance by the Canadian 
               <br />
               government. On the contrary, I can assure you 
               <br />
               that the delegation did a good job and further, that 
               <br />
               we had every co-operation from the Canadian 
               <br />
               government. Every possible courtesy was ex-

               <br />
               Canada until our departure. I have nothing but the 
               <br />

               cussions, were extremely generous of their time 
               <br />
               and more than considerate in the manner in which

               busy, but at all times they endeavoured to meet

               our ideas with respect to meetings, no matter how 
               <br />
               inconvenient it was to them. Their advisers, 
               <br />
               among whom were included the top men of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               times showed that they were anxious to assist us 
               <br />
               in every way possible. I gathered from what was 
               <br />
               said here on their return, that those who visited 
               <br />
               England did not get such a reception. However, 
               <br />
               I repeat to those of you who are inclined towards 
               <br />
               confederation, that the only proper way in fair- 
               <br />
               ness to Newfoundland, is that negotiations 
               <br />
               should be conducted by a Newfoundland govem- 
               <br />
               merit if we are to make the best possible deal for 
               <br />
               the country. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The facts we have brought back are a very 
               <br />
               good basis for future negotiations, and there need 
               <br />
               be no worry in your minds that if the present offer 
               <br />
               from Canada is not accepted, it will lapse. This 
               <br />
               was made clear at our last meeting when we were 
               <br />
               informed that, unless world economic conditions 
               <br />
               changed, the offer would remain the same if it 
               <br />
               was not accepted at this time, and negotiations 
               <br />
               later renewed. Therefore I say, in view of this 
               <br />
               fact, should we not ﬁrst elect a government to 
               <br />
               ﬁnalise any such deal? If nothing else but from 
               <br />
               sentiment, if we are going to confederate, let us 
               <br />
               do it in the proper way. Let us go in the front door 
               <br />
               and not the back door! Let us, as beﬁtting the

               <br />
               to understand the reason for Canada wishing to 
               <br />
               acquire Newfoundland. To begin with, Canada 
               <br />
               is, I believe, the third largest country in area in 
               <br />
               the world, but she only has a population of some 
               <br />
               12 millions. She needs immigrants to develop her 
               <br />
               own country and is at present engaged in bringing 
               <br />
               them in by the thousands. She has tremendous 
               <br />
               areas of territory, good rich land at present lying
