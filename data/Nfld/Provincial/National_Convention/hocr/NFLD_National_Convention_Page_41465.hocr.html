               the persons concerned, but indirectly in the way 
               <br />
               of general business. It is estimated that 120,000 
               <br />
               children under the age of 16 would be eligible for 
               <br />

               It is also estimated that the number of persons 
               <br />
               over 70 is 10,000. When we allow that 7,000 of

               <br />
