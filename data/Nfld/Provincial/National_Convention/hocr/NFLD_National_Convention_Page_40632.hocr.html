               Mr. Butt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">....For</span> many months me Convention 
               <br />
               has been occupied with attempting to assess the 
               <br />
               natural resources of this country —— fish, ore, 
               <br />
               lumber and other industries. It has not been our 
               <br />
               business to assess that most natural and basic of 
               <br />
               all resources, that is, our people, our human 
               <br />
               resources. There is not one man here who is not 
               <br />
               conscious of the great potentialities of these 
               <br />
               human resources — the stuff and fabric of all we 
               <br />
               have attempted, suffered and achieved. There are 
               <br />
               many who may not yet have realised that our men 
               <br />
               and women, like our industries, are capable of 
               <br />
               infinitely greater development, and that just as we 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               operative abilities of Newfoundlanders. We need 
               <br />
               these things far more... Newfoundland needs 
               <br />
               wealth, production, industries, but she also needs 
               <br />
               men and women with imagination, the creative 
               <br />
               abilities, the scientific knowledge and training to 
               <br />
               bring these things about...

               time and opportunity to introduce this resolution,
