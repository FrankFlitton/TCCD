               <br />
               impression that when we were handed the first 
               <br />
               memorandum that they considered that the whole 
               <br />

               <br />
               us when we sat down at the ﬁrst meeting and we 
               <br />
               were supposed to discuss them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intelligently...</span> 
               <br />
               But it seemed as if they said, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“There’s</span> your

               answer. We will take you here and there, and we 
               <br />
               will meet again before you go back, and say 
               <br />
               goodbye”, but we were not having that and im- 
               <br />
               mediately studied the memorandum and shot 
               <br />
               back another memorandum in answer to theirs. 
               <br />
               Their answer was a ﬂat, “No, we have said what 
               <br />
               we have said, and can do nothing more in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               London and raising all these points will redound

               Mr. Keough Mr. Chairman, now that all the

               other members of the London delegation have 
               <br />

               <br />
               delegation of tribunes of the people which recent- 
               <br />
               ly went up to London to beard the Dominions

               I wish to dissociate myself completely from 
               <br />
               all the petty furore about the delegation’s not 
               <br />
               being treated with due deference in London. As 
               <br />
               far as I am concerned we were. We were received 
               <br />
               in right good spirit and were extended many 
               <br />
               courtesies. Anyone with an opinion to the con- 
               <br />
               trary must have been expecting a salute of guns 
               <br />
               and red plush <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">carpets,</span> It is utterly ridiculous that 
               <br />
               I should have to go into this matter. The treatment 
               <br />
               we received was quite considerate, and I am 
               <br />
               appreciative of the courtesies extended. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">How.</span> 
               <br />
               ever, there seems to have been such a furore here 
               <br />
               at home that I feel I should have somewhat more 
               <br />
               to say. I remember what happened in London this 
               <br />
               way. On arrival at Heathrow we were met by 
               <br />
               Rear Admiral Sir Arthur Bromley, who wel— 
               <br />
               corned us on behalf of the Secretary of State, and 
               <br />
               then conducted through Immigration and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cus~</span> 
               <br />
               toms with diplomatic immunity. In that there was 
               <br />
               no discounesy. Next we were driven in special 
               <br />
               cars to our hotel. There, some delay was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oc“</span> 
               <br />
               casioned on the doorstep because, through some 
               <br />
               misunderstanding, the hotel management had us 
               <br />
               booked for two days subsequently. However, the 
               <br />
               difﬁculty was ironed out and those of us who 
               <br />
               wished to moved into the hotel forthwith. In any 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               case, the delay at the hotel did not involve, as far 
               <br />
               as I was concerned, any discourtesy, merely a 
               <br />
               misunderstanding...

               I am quite satisfied, too, that every effort was 
               <br />
               made to secure for the delegation the best pos- 
               <br />
               sible accomodations. We arrived in London at a 
               <br />
               time of a great inﬂux of visitors. Besides oursel- 
               <br />
               ves, there were some 15 other delegations in 
               <br />
               London for consultations with the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government,</span> There were buyers there 
               <br />
               to attend the British Industrial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Fair.</span> And there 
               <br />
               were fans from all over the United Kingdom to 
               <br />
               attend the soccer and rugby cup tie finals. Lodg~ 
               <br />
               ings were not at a premium, they were just simply 
               <br />
               unobtainable. We were advised by reSponsible 
               <br />
               ofﬁcials that every effort had been made to secure 
               <br />
               the best accomodations available. I believe them. 
               <br />
               I was quite comfortable, and the food was ade- 
               <br />
               quate. Incidentally, a New Zealand delegation 
               <br />
               was housed in the same hotel shortly before our 
               <br />
               arrival, and as far as I know found no reason to 
               <br />
               work themselves up into an international incident 
               <br />
               about their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accomodations.</span> 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The officials of the Dominions Office went 
               <br />
               out of their way to make our visit a pleasant one. 
               <br />
               Cars were put at our disposal. A tour of London 
               <br />
               was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arranged.</span> Tickets were procured for those of 
               <br />
               us who wished to attend the mgby ﬁnals and a

               showing of A.P. Herbert’s new play. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Arrange</span> 
               <br />
               ments were made for us to sit in the Dominions’

               Gallery during a session of the House of Com- 
               <br />
               mons. We were entertained at luncheon at the 
               <br />
               Savoy Hotel. The prime minister took time out to 
               <br />
               meet the delegation informally in the cabinet 
               <br />
               chamber at 10 Downing Street. In all of these 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">goings«on</span> I saw no evidence of discounesy no 
               <br />
               reason to be insulted. And that I hope will dispose 
               <br />
               of the discounesy myth forever. There is this 
               <br />
               much more that needs to be said of the furore that 
               <br />
               was raised here at home about our reception. I 
               <br />
               have often heard of a mountain being made of a 
               <br />
               molehill. This was the first time I have seen an 
               <br />
               international incident made of a molehill.
