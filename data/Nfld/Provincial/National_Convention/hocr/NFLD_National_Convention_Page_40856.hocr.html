               Mr. Penney I am not convinced over that. The

               Government of Canada is controlled by the 
               <br />

               <br />
               upset in the next general election. It holds the key. 
               <br />
               That is why I say there is something in what Mr. 
               <br />
               Duplessis says about Labrador and the boundary

               Mr. Smallwood The Province of Quebec elects 
               <br />
               65 members to the House of Commons. Ontario 
               <br />
               elects 96. A good many more than the Province 
               <br />
               of Quebec. Let me tell you something: there was 
               <br />
               a time when Quebec was not as big as it is now. 
               <br />
               At that same time, Ontario was not as big as it is 
               <br />
               now. What <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">happened?....</span> Quebec was pushed 
               <br />
               north to the sea as far as she could go; Ontario 
               <br />
               was pushed north to the ocean as far as it could 
               <br />
               go. The last thing that can happen is that Quebec 
               <br />
               can be made bigger, because Ontario controls the 
               <br />
               government more than does Quebec. Quebec has 
               <br />
               65 members whom she elects; Ontario has, I 
               <br />
               think, 80-odd. Look in the Black Book and you 
               <br />
               will find the number. If you say Quebec controls 
               <br />
               the Parliament, why not say Ontario controls it 
               <br />
               still more? Do you think Ontario is going to sit 
               <br />
               by and allow Quebec to be made bigger? No. It 
               <br />
               cannot be done.
