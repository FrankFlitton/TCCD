               Mr. Bailey After listening to Mr. Smallwood I 
               <br />
               was wondering just how countries like Portugal, 
               <br />
               Spain and France can compete with us over here. 
               <br />
               I can see how it can be done. We have no doubt, 
               <br />
               as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Crosbie says, a competitor in Norway as 
               <br />
               far as codﬁsh is concerned. Iceland has never 
               <br />
               been a competitor. I cannot see how even Spain 
               <br />
               and Portugal are going to feed the people, let 
               <br />
               alone feed their own... In 1909, 1907, 1908 and 
               <br />
               1911 we could buy more for a dollar than we do 
               <br />
               today. We should be concerned with what we will 
               <br />
               be able to buy with what we produce. Take the 
               <br />
               ﬁsherman today, he is in one of the worst places 
               <br />
               he has ever been in in the history of the shore 
               <br />
               fishery. The men of my district, on the shore 
               <br />
               ﬁshery, their average earnings are $325; out of

               that they had to come home and feed their 
               <br />
               families — flour $18 a barrel. How much better 
               <br />
               off they were if they caught 50 quintals in 1929, 
               <br />
               than the men who catch 50 quintals today. He was

               Mr. Hollett I feel the Committee has made a 
               <br />
               fairly conservative estimate of what things to 
               <br />

               <br />

               feel quite sure that it will not go back more than 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Committee overestimated on any false basis 
               <br />
               whatsoever.... Looking at the figures, 1 am sure 
               <br />
               the Committee which brought in this excellent 
               <br />
               report has not falsely estimated. Nobody can 
               <br />
               make an exact estimate. 1! must be tantamount to 
               <br />
               a guess, although 1 am sure it is not a guess. I

               entirely agree with the conclusions the Commit-
