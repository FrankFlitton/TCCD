               They are home now working their souls out to get 
               <br />
               a bit of wood for the winter. Altogether, their

               income for the year will be anywhere between 
               <br />
               $550 and $750 a year. I can assure the people in

               this House that if there is no fish caught next year 
               <br />
               there will not be any money spent on the roads, 
               <br />
               either on Avalon Peninsula or transinsular roads,

               fishermen of this country on a paying standard. I

               am going to take this up later when the Fishery

               can earn the money so that the politicians will be 
               <br />
               able to go ahead and do those things. That’s 
               <br />

               that nobody in this world was treated worse than

               We had a large amount of money, about 
               <br />
               $6,000, spent in 1938 on the roads from Victoria 
               <br />
               Village1 down. Last year a Plymouth truck tried 
               <br />
               to get over those roads and could not. On the 
               <br />
               $223,000 road from Heart’s Content to Whit- 
               <br />
               bourne, cars could not get through. When you get 
               <br />
               to Winterton hill you get some men to take a rope, 
               <br />
               put your car off the road and attach the rope, and 
               <br />
               pull the car through the trees, and finally get it on 
               <br />
               the road again. You might have it stuck fora week 
               <br />
               or two on that road. When you had responsible 
               <br />
               government that was a good road. That’s what we 
               <br />
               have been up against.

               We have in St. John’s 63,000 people, which 
               <br />
               in comparison with the mral population is out of 
               <br />
               all proportion. The population of Trinity South 
               <br />
               has dropped two-thirds in the past few years, and 
               <br />
               a lot of them are in here. In the spring when the 
               <br />
               boats came in to load, most everybody got a few 
               <br />
               days work, and when there was a good harbour 
               <br />
               and a good wharfit was all right. This is the thing 
               <br />
               we have been up against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—¢</span> but I don’t understand

               it. That’s still the position we are faced <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with.</span>

               Today you have got to go 49 or 50 miles before 
               <br />
               you can connect with anything at all. I think that 
               <br />
               the quicker we can change this the better for the 
               <br />
               country. I believe it would cost $150,000 to put 
               <br />
               the branch railroad back in its place. We pleaded 
               <br />
               with Sir Wilfred Woods, put up every argument 
               <br />
               possible, but in spite of that the railroad was taken 
               <br />
               away from us. I believe the quicker we can get 
               <br />
               clear of this form of government the better. One

               <br />
               Ashboume’s remarks. There is one bright spot, 
               <br />
               you know - <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lewisporte,</span> The branch line this 
               <br />
               year brought in a credit balance of $58,000. Then 
               <br />
               they took the line away and we had to walk! I 
               <br />
               think that main line should be swung on to 
               <br />
               Lewisporte and Norris Arm to save all that un- 
               <br />
               necessary expense. Lewisporte, though small, is 
               <br />
               a very progressive little town, second to none as 
               <br />
               far as taxes and revenue are concerned. It has 
               <br />
               1,000 people and we have gone over the 
               <br />
               $200,000 mark in revenue <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alone.</span> When we come 
               <br />
               to roads we have a trail. Thanks to the local 
               <br />
               government we have started now; and I hope in 
               <br />
               the near future it will be more than 25 cents per 
               <br />
               mile. I therefore go on record that there should be 
               <br />
               a main line to Lewisporte.

               Mr. Smallwood I would like to remind Mr.

               Lewisporte branch was the only one that showed 
               <br />

               I was much interested in what Mr. Bailey said. 
               <br />
               It is only fair to say this: the government is 
               <br />
               spending $2.5 million a year on roads, but if you 
               <br />
               go back to just before the war and look at what 
               <br />
               the government spent then on roads and bridges, 
               <br />
               you will ﬁnd that in 1938, on the construction of 
               <br />
               new roads, they spent only $12,000.... The total 
               <br />
               amount they spent was only $480,000, as against 
               <br />
               $2.5 million today. The point is that up to 1938 
               <br />
               or 1939 we were not paying our way as a country. 
               <br />
               There was a deﬁcit every year. After that we 
               <br />
               began to have a surplus, and we have had one 
               <br />
               every year, and it is only since they have had a 
               <br />
               surplus, money from the taxpayers, that they 
               <br />
               spent any real money on roads; but when they 
               <br />
               were not getting it from us they were only spend- 
               <br />
               ing $500,000 dollars on roads each year.

               We must get this right. You have people in this
