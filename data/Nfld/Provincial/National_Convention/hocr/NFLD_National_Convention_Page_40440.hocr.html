               Mr. Newell I would say that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cooperative</span> 
               <br />
               movement is open to constructive criticism, and 
               <br />
               the term ideology as applied to the movement is 
               <br />
               not one to create embarrassment. History is on 
               <br />
               the side of this movement, but I am at a loss to 
               <br />
               understand what particular ideology is being 
               <br />
               taught by these govemment- sponsored ﬁeld 
               <br />
               workers. The word “ideology” is common cur- 
               <br />
               rency in die last few years, but I wish people 
               <br />
               would be careful in the use of it. You get the idea 
               <br />
               that there is something subversive going on, that 
               <br />
               you might wake up some morning and ﬁnd a lot 
               <br />
               of anarchists on our hands. As far as I know, and 
               <br />
               I am open to correction, there is no ideology 
               <br />
               being taught. The money that the government is 
               <br />
               putting into the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cooperative</span> movement it is not 
               <br />
               putting into individual co-operative societies. A 
               <br />
               certain amount of money had been previously 
               <br />
               invested in land settlements’ stores, but it is not 
               <br />
               the practice of the government today to put 
               <br />
               money into co—operative societies. Any money 
               <br />
               from now on will be on the same basis as they put 
               <br />
               it in cold storage companies — loaned as a deal 
               <br />
               with private business. This $50,000 that the 
               <br />
               government is spending on the enhancement of 
               <br />
               the co—operative movement is to organise adult 
               <br />

               <br />
               solve their problems and benefit themselves

               Mr. Ashbourne 1 am quite in favour of this 
               <br />
               co-operative movement. I believe that it is a 
               <br />
               world-wide movement and viewing its effect in 
               <br />
               other countries I believe it is in Newfoundland to 
               <br />
               stay. Whether or not the working out of these 
               <br />
               co—operative ideas will bring the utmost value to 
               <br />
               the greatest number remains to be seen, but I 
               <br />
               think it contains the seed of something which is 
               <br />
               very essential and valuable to the people. Now 
               <br />
               with regard to the amount spent, the way I ﬁgure 
               <br />
               it out it is less than 1%. Of course it looks large 
               <br />
               enough, $50,000, but I am of the opinion that we 
               <br />
               want more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cooperation</span> in this country all 
               <br />
               around. A year or two ago there was a firm here 
               <br />
               that wanted to invest about $1 million in the 
               <br />
               building of a powerful steamer to prosecute the 
               <br />
               seal ﬁshery, and the government was asked to 
               <br />
               help in that matter by perhaps chartering this boat 
               <br />
               in the summer to go to the Labrador, quite a place 
               <br />
               for tourists and probably there would be a good 
               <br />
               many dollars come into the country if we had 
               <br />
               suitable boats to take people down around there. 
               <br />
               That proposition was turned down. Today we are 
               <br />
               told that around the Labrador there are probably 
               <br />
               200,000 seals, a very valuable asset and one of 
               <br />
               our natural <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resources.</span> It is not easy to get to these 
               <br />
               seals by small auxiliary boats, they have not the

               power for one thing, except when the ice is break- 
               <br />
               ing up and they can get through it. There is a case 
               <br />
               where if the government had co-operated with 
               <br />
               that ﬁrm, and there are not many ﬁrms willing to 
               <br />
               put $1 million down, it would be a great benefit 
               <br />
               to the country. It might be possible, with co- 
               <br />
               operation in some other way, that plans like that 
               <br />
               could be worked out...
