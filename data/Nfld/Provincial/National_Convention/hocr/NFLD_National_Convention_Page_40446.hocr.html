               <br />
               large percentage of it. It incurs a great deal of

               Mr. Job In reply to that, there is a very consid- 
               <br />
               erable portion of the outﬁts of ships that have to 
               <br />
               be purchased here and it is more costly here. 
               <br />
               Again, repairs cost very much more here than in 
               <br />
               Canada. One of the competitions we have had in 
               <br />
               the past has been Norweigan competition. These 
               <br />
               Norweigan ships have been getting cheaper 
               <br />
               provisions than us. I expect they also have been 
               <br />
               getting lower wages; also they are subsidised. We 
               <br />
               are up against all these. The only thing to do 
               <br />
               would be to make sure we got all our expenses 
               <br />
               down to the ﬁnest point. You will remember in 
               <br />
               the sealﬁshery report, in the case of coal, they 
               <br />
               charged duty on it although it never left the ship. 
               <br />
               They all count up in the expenses of running a 
               <br />
               ship.

               Mr. MacDonald I am talking about ships to 
               <br />
               handle imports and exports, ships of from 5,000 
               <br />
               to 10,000 tons, ships to carry paper and iron ore. 
               <br />
               If these ships were owned in Newfoundland and 
               <br />
               employed on foreign trade, it is not necessary for

               here some years ago, and we bought very little. I 
               <br />
               was an engineer, and except when we were ab- 
               <br />
               solutely stuck we never got goods in St. John‘s. I

               don’t suppose we get $20 worth of supplies here, 
               <br />

               <br />
               no duty to pay. That is the point I am raising with

               that we have to buy quite a large portion of our

               Mr. Bailey Mr. Chairman, I don’t know why we 
               <br />
               have no merchant marine... I know if a country 
               <br />
               like Greece, which has practically no import or 
               <br />
               export trade, could become the fourth largest 
               <br />
               tramp tonnage in the world at the outbreak of this 
               <br />
               war, and whose only assets were the seamen they 
               <br />
               could put to work, we should be able to do the 
               <br />
               same, because I know what our seamen can do. I 
               <br />
               should not say this perhaps, but I am forced to. I 
               <br />
               was not satisﬁed with our Transportation Report, 
               <br />
               and I went back quietly to find what the trouble 
               <br />
               was. I found out that the little Kyle2 takes 25 tons 
               <br />
               of coal daily to operate it. The ship I was on, the 
               <br />
               Halcyon which was 26,000 tons, used to take IO 
               <br />
               tons daily, but I don’t know the tonnage of the 
               <br />
               Kyle. Nowl believe the Ungava is around 25,000 
               <br />
               tons. 
               <br />

               Mr. Job No, from 18 to 22,000 tons.

               Mr. Bailey Now as regards the loss to this

               <br />

               <br />
               walking around on the dole, it is considerable. If

               you remember there was a time when there was

               anything around because we had foreign owners 
               <br />
               down here getting men to man their ships. I can’t 
               <br />
               see for the life of me why it costs ships more to 
               <br />
