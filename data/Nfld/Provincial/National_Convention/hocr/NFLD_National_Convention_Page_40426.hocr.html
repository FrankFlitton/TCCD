               Mr. Newell On that point I note that on the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               page of the Appendix the total poundage of live 
               <br />
               lobsters to Canada and USA is approximately 2.5 
               <br />
               million pounds, and the total returns ap- 
               <br />
               proximately $650,000, and I think that works out 
               <br />
               to around 25 1/3 cents per pound as the declared 
               <br />
               value to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Customs,</span> When I take what value is

               declared to the Customs, and the figure we have 
               <br />
               is 25 cents per pound on that basis given there, 
               <br />
               and then on page 57 of the report, which has not 
               <br />
               been read yet, in the section on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">co‘operatives,</span> you 
               <br />
               have the fact that they shipped 900,000 pounds 
               <br />
               and got a net proceeds of $300,000, and the price 
               <br />
               to the ﬁshermen is given as an average of 32 cents 
               <br />
               per pound. Well, that would seem to further sub- 
               <br />
               stantiate the argument that this other figure is 
               <br />
               considerably too low, that actually it should be a 
               <br />
               good deal higher than that. I don’t know if losses 
               <br />
               involved by the private companies were so much 
               <br />
               heavier than the losses of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cooperative,</span> be-

               by the ﬁshermen in your co-operative take the 
               <br />
               losses into account.

               Mr. Newell I am not questioning the validity of

               if one group of people average that price over the

               <br />
               a menace to ﬁshermen all overthe country. A few 
               <br />
               years ago, due to persistent agitation by ﬁsher— 
               <br />
               men, an experiment was carried out in connection 
               <br />
               with IR. Dickson of Fortune, and large numbers 
               <br />
               were caught and freighted to Canada. The thing 
               <br />
               became uneconomical because it involved too 
               <br />
               much expense, but it did destroy much dogﬁsh. 
               <br />
               It had to be abandoned although it did do much 
               <br />
               good. The Commission of Government agreed 
               <br />
