               <br />
               those were his words — hat in hand, begging 
               <br />
               from Ottawa. Now nothing could be further from 
               <br />
               ' the truth. The truth is the exact opposite of what 
               <br />
               Major Cashin said. We went to Ottawa holding 
               <br />
               our heads high. We gave Newfoundland the 
               <br />
               highest kind of a name. We told Canada that 
               <br />
               Newfoundland was sitting on top of the world. In 
               <br />
               all our newspaper interviews, and there were 
               <br />
               dozens of them, we kept up Newfoundland’s 
               <br />
               name. In his speech at the very opening session 
               <br />
               of our conferences in Ottawa, our Chairman Mr. 
               <br />
               Bradley said this, and I quote his exact words. He 
               <br />
               said: “Should these talks produce an under— 
               <br />
               standing between us, and that understanding be 
               <br />
               endorsed by the country in the forthcoming 
               <br />
               referendum and Newfoundland becomes the 
               <br />
               tenth province of your Canadian union, you will 
               <br />
               be receiving a proud people eager and deter— 
               <br />
               mined to pull their weight in generous measure. 
               <br />
               For make no mistake, union of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               and Canada will never take place, while our 
               <br />
               people have the decision, unless New— 
               <br />
               foundlanders are convinced that they have a con— 
               <br />
               tribution to make towards the general good of the 
               <br />
               partnership in which they share.”.... It was broad- 
               <br />
               cast over the entire network of the Canadian 
               <br />
               Broadcasting Commission, and thousands of our 
               <br />
               own people heard it that night here in New- 
               <br />
               foundland. As for myself, as I go back over the 
               <br />
               clippings of the interviews I gave to the Canadian 
               <br />
               newspapers, I ﬁnd that I made this public state- 
               <br />
               ment and I quote my exact words: “Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood termed Labrador the richest area in 
               <br />
               the world <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today”.</span> Is that letting the country 
               <br />
               down? Is that putting on the poor mouth? Is that 
               <br />
               giving Newfoundland a bad name? “Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood termed Labrador the richest area in 
               <br />
               the world today", God forgive me, and though I 
               <br />
               may not be so far off, I don’t know. But I didn't 
               <br />
               put on the poor mouth. Again I made this state— 
               <br />
               ment: “While we have survived for 450 years in 
               <br />
               isolation and made tremendous progress, we will 
               <br />
               never reach our maximum strength in isolation, 
               <br />
               we must be part of North America." You might 
               <br />
               take note, sir, of the words “while we have sur— 
               <br />
               vived for 450 years in isolation and made tremen- 
               <br />
               dous progress”. Then again I said, 
               <br />
               “Newfoundland is not bankrupt but blooming”. 
               <br />
               Sir, I could go on quoting dozens of statements 
               <br />
               
            </p>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               like that made by me to the newspapers of Canada 
               <br />
               during our visit to that country. It may suit Major 
               <br />
               Cashin to say that we went up there running the 
               <br />
               country down or putting on the poor mouth or as 
               <br />
               beggars, but it simply isn’t <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">true.</span> The exact op-

            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now sir, one thing I hardly expected was that 
               <br />
               Major Cashin would trot out Premier Duplessis 
               <br />
               again, but he did. He still professes to be afraid 
               <br />
               that the Quebec fascist, I beg your pardon, the 
               <br />
               Quebec premier will somehow or other manage 
               <br />
               to rob us of our Labrador. And while Major 
               <br />
               Cashin was discussing this matter of Labrador, 
               <br />
               he gave utterance to what surely must be the 
               <br />
               strangest remark ever heard in this building since 
               <br />
               it was erected over 100 years ago, he said this, 
               <br />
               what dependence can we place on a mere 
               <br />
               decision of the Privy Council? What dependence 
               <br />
               can we place on a mere decision of the Privy 
               <br />
               Council? Was Major Cashin serious? Did he 
               <br />
               mean that question to be taken seriously? Would 
               <br />
               he, a former cabinet minister, a former minister 
               <br />
               of the Crown, would he seriously suggest to the 
               <br />
               people of this country that no dependence can be 
               <br />
               placed on a decision of the Privy Council of Great 
               <br />
               Britain? Can Major Cashin name any other court 
               <br />
               in the whole world whose verdicts and judgments 
               <br />
               merit and receive such universal respect and 
               <br />
               which are so binding as those of the Privy Coun- 
               <br />
               cil? He cannot and no man can. But he ﬁnds 
               <br />
               himself straight up against what is for his argu- 
               <br />
               ment a very awkward fact, the fact that the Privy 
               <br />
               Council has laid down the boundaries of our 
               <br />
               Labrador. So what did he do? He makes the futile 
               <br />
               and foolish attempt to throw doubt upon the 
               <br />
               validity of that Privy Council award and makes 
               <br />
               the extremely foolish statement that no depend- 
               <br />
               ence can be placed upon their famous decision on 
               <br />
               the Labrador boundary. And then he makes this 
               <br />
               further <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">statement.</span> The only inducement, he says, 
               <br />
               for Canada wanting Newfoundland is to get 
               <br />
               Labrador’s mineral wealth. In fact, he says that 
               <br />
               when he was in Montreal the other day, some 
               <br />
               businessmen he met told him so. I won’t dignify 
               <br />
               that statement with a reply, for any ﬁfth form 
               <br />
               schoolboy could tell Major Cashin that it’ 3 highly 
               <br />
               unlikely that the petty businessmen that he met 
               <br />
               in Montreal would be in the conﬁdence of the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada. Let’s look at this matter 
               <br />
               clearly and squarely. Is that why Canada wants 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, to get the minerals of Labrador? 
               <br />
