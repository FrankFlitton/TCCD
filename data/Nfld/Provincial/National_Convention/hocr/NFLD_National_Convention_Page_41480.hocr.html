               are now being supported by propaganda to divide 
               <br />
               the classes in the country, as I have stated before 
               <br />
               ~— a “soak the rich” attitude. But however, the 
               <br />
               Canadian Finance Minister, Mr. Douglas Abbott, 
               <br />
               has stated himself that this is an impossibility 
               <br />
               even in Canada, and has said that there are not 
               <br />
               enough rich in Canada to soak. If that applies in 
               <br />
               Canada, then so does it most certainly apply in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. It is all political propaganda to 
               <br />
               hide the real cold facts, and to stir the people up 
               <br />
               so that they cannot see what the future may hold 
               <br />
               for them. You cannot legislate a standard of 
               <br />
               living. People have to work to live, and there is 
               <br />
               nothing in the British North America Act that 
               <br />
               provides that all peoples in union shall have a 
               <br />
               high standard of living. 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               If I were the most ardent confederate, and yet 
               <br />
               sincere with the people of Newfoundland, I could 
               <br />
               not possibly recommend these terms to them. It 
               <br />
               is not a question of recommending confederation 
               <br />
               or not. It is a question of doing so on those terms 
               <br />
               submitted by the Government of Canada, and to 
               <br />
               recommend them to the people of this country is 
               <br />
               more than I would care to have on my conscience. 
               <br />
               If I thought sincerely they were good enough to 
               <br />
               beneﬁt the people as a whole, raise the standard 
               <br />
               of living and give us economic security, then I 
               <br />
               would heartily support them and do all I could to 
               <br />
               have the people accept them But I have looked 
               <br />
               at these terms, sir, and have studied them to the 
               <br />
               best of my ability. Ihave used the experience I 
               <br />
               have gained in 20-odd years in this country in 
               <br />
               work, and I can only say it is a one—sided argu- 
               <br />
               ment —— one sided for Canada. I am willing to 
               <br />
               prophesy — which I hope will not come true ~— 
               <br />
               that if we have union with Canada, that anywhere 
               <br />
               from three to ﬁve years after we have entered into 
               <br />
               union, the people of this country will curse the 
               <br />
               day they ever voted for confederation on these 
               <br />
               terms. I hope that I am wrong, but that is my 
               <br />
               sincere belief, as well as that if the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland enter confederation on the terms 
               <br />
               submitted to us, it is nothing less than criminal. 
               <br />
               Mr. Harrington Mr. Chairman, I think you will 
               <br />
               agree, and every right—thinking Newfoundlander 
               <br />
               will agree, that it is most regrettable that the chief 
               <br />
               advocate of the cause of confederation should 
               <br />
               have introduced his resolution in the final stages 
               <br />
               of this Convention on such a note as he did, which 
               <br />
               several speakers have already suggested strongly 
               <br />
               resemble the tactics of class war and sectional

               <br />
               Surely, confederation has more merit than that it 
               <br />
               has to be boosted in such a desperate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">manner,</span>

               Instead, he said very little about the many

               see, was his reference to the business of property 
               <br />
               tax, and of course his usual assertion that such a 
               <br />
               tax would scarcely apply to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland,</span> He 
               <br />
               said that the federal government never collected

               a dollar in property tax, that the provincial

               <br />
               or town councils, and we have only ten or 15 of 
               <br />
               these councils, and so our people would not be

               we would have in our provincial budgets, how

               long it would be before that provincial govern-

               population of 500 and over into a local council, 
               <br />
               in order to raise the absolutely necessary

               revenues to keep the country going. And then see

               where we would stand on the matter of property
