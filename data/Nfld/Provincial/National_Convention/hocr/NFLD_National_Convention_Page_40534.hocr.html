               Mr. Hollett I must agree with Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Smallwood,</span> 
               <br />
               l was amazed to see the terms under which 
               <br />
               various individuals and corporations were given 
               <br />
               these water-power leases. One is for one pepper- 
               <br />
               com a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">year,</span> Harveys has a lease for payment of 
               <br />
               one peppercom a year on demand.2 I suggest we 
               <br />
               go to Harveys and ask them for 50-odd pepper~ 
               <br />
               coms. Then these other leases granted a consid- 
               <br />
               erable amount of water-power on terms of $1 up 
               <br />
               to $5 a year. In those leases there was a proviso 
               <br />
               that in up to five years they were to develop the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">water-power,</span> I am sure that those I know have 
               <br />
               done no development. Why the government 
               <br />
               should accept a $1 fee in order to assist these 
               <br />
               individuals, [cannot understand, and I would like 
               <br />
               to go on record as suggesting when the time 
               <br />
               comes round for these people to pay their fee, the 
               <br />
               government refuse to accept it, and then act on 
               <br />
               the proviso which says they must develop within 
               <br />
               two to ﬁve years. A good many people are hold- 
               <br />
               ing on, waiting for someone to come in and 
               <br />
               develop, and then make a scoop. I would suggest 
               <br />
               that the government cancel the leases if those 
               <br />
               people do not develop the water-power. This is 
               <br />

               the paltry amount paid into the revenue, it does 
               <br />
