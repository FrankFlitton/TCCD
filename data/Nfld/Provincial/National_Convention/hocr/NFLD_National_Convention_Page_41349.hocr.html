               government now with deliberately attempting to

               dissipate the treasury of Newfoundland. When 
               <br />
               this Convention opened, September 11, 1946, I 
               <br />
               made a statement that Mr. Attlee stated in the 
               <br />
               House of Commons, when he was bringing in this 
               <br />
               White Paper which created this Convention Act, 
               <br />
               that his understanding would be that under no 
               <br />
               circumstances would any change of government 
               <br />
               take place in Newfoundland under ten years, 
               <br />
               because the Commission government had a 
               <br />
               programme that they wanted to go ahead with 
               <br />
               without interruption. Well how far out was I? It 
               <br />
               is three years now. There will be no change in any 
               <br />
               wise until this fall, and it may not even take place 
               <br />
               then, because we are a powerless group with no

               courage. Would you mind telling me, Mr. Chair-

               If you take the annex to the resolution, sub-sec— 
               <br />
               tion 8, it says deﬁnitely: “The existing form of 
               <br />
               government would be suspended until such time 
               <br />
               as the island would become self-supporting 
               <br />
               again.” That is sub-section 8. Turn to sub—section 
               <br />
               G, which is the last one. What does it say? “It 
               <br />
               would be understood that, as soon and the 
               <br />
               country is again self~supporting, responsible 
               <br />
               government, on request from the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland would be restored.”1 Now sir, why 
               <br />
               was it necessary to stick in sub-section G when 
               <br />
               they had the thing covered in sub-section 8? I 
               <br />
               have very suspicious ideas about that sub-sec- 
               <br />
               tion, and I have talked with many gentlemen who 
               <br />
               were in this House at that time, and they under- 
               <br />
               stood that when Newfoundland was self-support- 
               <br />
               ing responsible government would be handed 
               <br />
               back; but now they stuck that in, in the last 
               <br />
               section. I have seen funny things happen in this 
               <br />
               House once in a while. I feel that “there’s some- 
               <br />
               thing rotten in the state of Denmar ” in connec- 
               <br />
               tion with that sub-section.

               I think therefore, Mr. Chairman, that in a 
               <br />
               general way I have outlined what brought about 
               <br />
               Commission government —— we were poor. But 
               <br />
               that was not so in 1931 and 1932. It took another 
               <br />
               government to come in here and barter it away — 
               <br />
               I call it the great betrayal of 1933-34. I have heard 
               <br />
               people say, “What could we have done?” What 
               <br />
               did the British government do? What did the 
               <br />
               Government of Saskatchewan do? What did 
               <br />
               other countries do? They defaulted. And weren’t 
               <br />
               we as much entitled to default as they were? 
               <br />
               Couldn‘t we have carried on and paid six cents a 
               <br />
               day dole on our own? Why Professor Plumptre 
               <br />
               said that Newfoundland would have been jus- 
               <br />
               tiﬁed in defaulting then! And whilst this report I 
               <br />
               am referring to was being written, which said that 
               <br />
               no British dominion had defaulted, it is a fact that 
               <br />
               Great Britain herself had defaulted to America 
               <br />
               three months previous to the writing of that 
               <br />
               report.
