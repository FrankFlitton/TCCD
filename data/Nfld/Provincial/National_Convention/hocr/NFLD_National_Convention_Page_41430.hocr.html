               <br />
               29 October last from the Right Hon. the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister of Canada, to the effect that before ﬁna-

               lising any arrangement for union, “the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland should indicate clearly and 
               <br />
               beyond all possibility of misunderstanding their 
               <br />
               will that Newfoundland should become a 
               <br />
               province of Canada.” How can they come to a 
               <br />
               well—considered conclusion with incomplete in~ 
               <br />

               <br />
               Canada’s expression of views mentioned in the 
               <br />

               <br />

               I believe that the issues to be placed before the 
               <br />
               people in the forthcoming referendum will be 
               <br />
               seriously befogged and confused if this Canadian 
               <br />
               issue is included in the referendum. By excluding 
               <br />
               it, the people of Newfoundland will be much 
               <br />
               better able to come to a deﬁnite choice between 
               <br />
               responsible government and Commission 
               <br />
               government, and later on will have an oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity of considering the confederation issue. If 
               <br />
               the confederation issue is on the referendum 
               <br />
               paper it can deﬁnitely be dealt with at some not 
               <br />
               far distant date, perhaps within six months from 
               <br />
               the date of the referendum, as it should then be 
               <br />
               put before the people as a single issue, instead of 
               <br />
               being mixed up with two real forms of govem- 
               <br />
               merit. These two forms of government, if unsatis- 
               <br />
               factory, can at some future date be discarded, 
               <br />
               while acceptance of confederation would be an 
               <br />
               irrevocable and irretrievable step. If this motion 
               <br />
               is turned down by the majority of this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion, as Ibelieve it will be, it must be remembered 
               <br />
               that the British government still has the option, if 
               <br />
               they deem it wise, of keeping the confederation 
               <br />
               issue in some form on the referendum paper. I 
               <br />
               hope that if they do so they will see that it is

               I must refer to Mr. Smallwood’s statement that 
               <br />
               the whole truth should be put to the people, a 
               <br />

               <br />
               statement, which I think was afterwards con- 
               <br />
               ﬁrmed by Mr. Ashboume, that confederation 
               <br />
               with Canada would not be an irretrievable step, 
               <br />
               and in fact <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr,</span> Smallwood indicated that it would 
               <br />
               be comparatively easy to get out of it should 
               <br />
               Newfoundland ﬁnd that she has made a mistake. 
               <br />
               I don’t fear to state deﬁnitely that this is simply 
               <br />
               not true, as it has been deﬁnitely decided that the 
               <br />
               only way in which provinces can secede, or be 
               <br />
               expelled, is through an act of the United Kingdom 
               <br />
               Parliament. In actual fact a select committee of 
               <br />
               Lords and Commons decided in 1935 that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Parlia"</span> 
               <br />
               ment was, by constitutional convention, not com- 
               <br />
               petent to deal with such a matter upon petition of 
               <br />
               a single province or state. Their decision em- 
               <br />
               phasised the fact that in practice, as well as in law, 
               <br />
               no right of secession rests with any state or 
               <br />
               province acting alone. If there is any doubt on that 
               <br />
               point, and if Mr. Smallwood would like conﬁr- 
               <br />
               mation, I have quoted almost from the views of 
               <br />
               our own constitutional adviser, Professor 
               <br />
               Wheare, who issued a textbook on federal 
               <br />
               government and very strongly pointed that out, 
               <br />
               quoting the actual case on which I have based my 
               <br />
               views. I hope that Mr. Smallwood will correct his 
               <br />
               statement, before we “marry in haste and repent 
               <br />
               at leisure.” I thank you.

               Mr. Cashin Mr. Chairman, the question now 
               <br />
               before the Convention, as I see it, is simply this: 
               <br />
               is this Convention, having reviewed the terms 
               <br />
               and conditions of confederation as contained in 
               <br />
               the Black Books and the Grey Book, of the 
               <br />
               opinion that union with Canada should be recom— 
               <br />
               mended to our people as a possible form of 
               <br />
               government in the forthcoming referendum? On 
               <br />

               <br />
               myself, my conclusion in the light of all the 
               <br />
               information at my disposal is, that it would be 
               <br />
               neither wise nor proﬁtable for us to recommend 
               <br />
               such a form of govemment to our people; and I
