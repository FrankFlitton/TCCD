               ing your remarks to prognostications made by the 
               <br />
               member from Bonavista Centre in 1931, and if so 
               <br />
               what relevancy is there between your remarks 
               <br />
               and the matter in hand? 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett I am trying to prove that this report 
               <br />
               is a good report, and the remarks made relative 
               <br />
               to 1931 yesterday have no bearing whatsoever; 
               <br />
               and I am trying also to prove that my friend from 
               <br />
               Bonavista Centre forgot these things which he 
               <br />
               wrote in an economic history, which I thought I 
               <br />
               ought to read. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman My only point is this: that if the 
               <br />
               soundness or unsoundness of the report is to be 
               <br />
               determined in the light of the soundness or un- 
               <br />
               soundness of the opinion expressed by the mem- 
               <br />
               ber from Bonavista Centre yesterday, then of 
               <br />
               course I can see a visible connection between the 
               <br />
               two, but if the report is to appear on its own merits 
               <br />
               then the opinion expressed yesterday can only be 
               <br />
               regarded as his own opinion... 1 can’t see that 
               <br />
               there is any connection between statements made 
               <br />
               by him in 1931 and the opinions held by him now, 
               <br />
               which could alter our opinion when we are called 
               <br />
               upon to decide upon the merits of the Economic 
               <br />
               Report. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Mr. Chairman, may I refer to you 
               <br />
               the fact that the member from Bonavista Centre 
               <br />
               yesterday read to us two letters from Bonavista 
               <br />
               Bay or other places? On that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">basis‘may</span> I ask you 
               <br />
               to allow me to ﬁnish this short paragraph? 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman With consistency with the 
               <br />
               latitude I allowed Mr. Smallwood yesterday this 
               <br />
               allows rue no alternative. Under these circum- 
               <br />
               stances will you go ahead. 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett Thank you, sir. 
               <br />
               And after all when all is said, where is there 
               <br />
               another country in which life is so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">compara»</span> 
               <br />
               tively free and easy? Where men can live so

               easily in health and happiness as in New- 
               <br />
               foundland? One has only to witness the bread 
               <br />
               lines in front of hospitals and various 
               <br />
               charitable institutions, and see the vast 
               <br />
               crowds of hungry and unemployed men in 
               <br />
               New York and other American and Canadian 
               <br />
               cities, and read of the same terrible condi-

               tions in every country in Europe to appreciate 
               <br />
               just how well off we really are in New-

               foundland. Those of us who are interested in 
               <br />
               the great changes that are coming over New— 
               <br />

               I just draw that to your attention to show how 
               <br />
               difficult it was for the ﬁnance minister to make 
               <br />
               up a correct budget in 1931. I also draw your 
               <br />
               attention to the fact that there were bread lines in 
               <br />
               New York and in many cities in the United States 
               <br />
               and Canada in 1931. My mind goes back to 1934, 
               <br />
               and I remember this: there were 90,000 people on 
               <br />
               the dole here, and the government spent $1.5 
               <br />
               million, and I do know our people were in dire 
               <br />
               distress even in 1931. This book was not publish- 
               <br />
               ed for use in Newfoundland, but for New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders in Canada and the United States. I 
               <br />
               will refer later to another document which was 
               <br />

               Now the Committee, on page 2, continues to 
               <br />
               try and assess the value of the fixed assets of this 
               <br />
               country, those things which are practically im- 
               <br />
               possible to remove, not like money in the bank. 
               <br />
               And they found out that we have a Railway which 
               <br />
               was valued at $72 million; some highroads here 
               <br />
               which they further valued at $20 million; some 
               <br />
               public buildings, lighthouses, public wharves, 
               <br />
               breakwaters, etc, valued at $10 million. And 
               <br />
               there was another $10 million for breakwaters 
               <br />
               and telegraphs, making a total in all of $112 
               <br />
               million fixed assets. Now ﬁxed assets is some- 
               <br />
               thing which you have which remains. Sometimes 
               <br />
               you have to get repairs, but anything you have 
               <br />
               spent to get them, such as money which made up 
               <br />
               our national debt, you have these fixed assets to 
               <br />
               go against it. We have $112 million worth of 
               <br />
               ﬁxed assets, but there is a point I want to make in 
               <br />
               connection with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway.</span> In yesterday’s dis- 
               <br />
               cussion the chairman of the Finance Committee 
               <br />
               was more or less ridiculed because he had valued 
               <br />
               the Railway at $72 million; we found that he had 
               <br />
               got that figure from the report of the Ottawa 
               <br />
               delegation, a figure which the delegation had 
               <br />
               presented to the Canadian government to show 
               <br />
               them how valuable we were. You will remember 
               <br />
               the remark which was made by the member from 
               <br />
               Bonavista Centre: “Of course we valued it at $72 
               <br />
               million. We were fooling them, but we don’t 
               <br />
