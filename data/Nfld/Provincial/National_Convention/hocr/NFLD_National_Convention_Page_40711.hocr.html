               I think, having looked at all these things, I 
               <br />
               cannot conceive how any man in this aSSembly

               could possibly come to the conclusion which they 
               <br />
               did when they said that they could put our 
               <br />

               <br />
               lion. They took account of a possible depression. 
               <br />
               On top of that they tell you we have new 
               <br />
               peacetime industries which are not going to leave 
               <br />
               and that is what we want. They have told us this 
               <br />
               and I would almost be optimistic enough to put 
               <br />
               the ﬁgure at a much higher price than $30 million. 
               <br />
               Therefore I have to come to the conclusion that 
               <br />
               they were very conservative in their estimate... 
               <br />
               Of course if the whole world goes, we will not 
               <br />
               need it then at all. They also pointed out the 
               <br />
               possibilities of the Marshall Plan if it goes into 
               <br />
               effect. We know the trouble we have had in 
               <br />
               ﬁnding the price of our salt cod for the year. The 
               <br />
               Marshall Plan would, I hope, cure all that. So as 
               <br />
               we were on the top of the pig’s back after the last 
               <br />
               war I think we will be on the top of the elephant’s 
               <br />
               back in this peace, which I hope will last for a 
               <br />
               long time. I commend very strongly the action of 
               <br />

               will see what they are going to do with that
