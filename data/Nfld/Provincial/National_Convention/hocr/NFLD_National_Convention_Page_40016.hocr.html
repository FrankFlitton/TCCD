               tions I am very vague in the absence of rules

               governing them; but I imagine that a great 
               <br />
               amount of information will be sought from the 
               <br />
               government. No doubt, the procedure for doing 
               <br />
               so will be laid down in the rules, which may take 
               <br />
               two or three weeks and in the meantime many 
               <br />
               members may have questions on which they 
               <br />
               desire authentic information. I do not know

               whether members will submit questions verbally
