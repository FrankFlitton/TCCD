               Mr. Crosbie With regard to the question asked 
               <br />
               by Mr. Reddy, I can say “yes.” Mr. Raddy is a 
               <br />
               businessman — at least so I am told — and if he 
               <br />
               is, he knows that if he buys wholesale he gets a 
               <br />
               better price than if he buys retail. As far as the 
               <br />
               Railway is concerned, they sell service. If any 
               <br />
               company guarantees them a certain amount of 
               <br />
               business, they naturally look for the best rate they 
               <br />
               can get, and it is up to the management of the 
               <br />

               Mr. Fudge In our last session I retired from the

               <br />
               stated that there was 14 cents in the difference

               between the highroads rate and the paper mill 
               <br />
