               Has Mr. Smallwood told us what he is going 
               <br />
               to tax to make up for this deficit in the ﬁrst or 
               <br />
               second year of confederation? He himself, sir, in 
               <br />
               the Black Book, admits there will be a deﬁcit. 
               <br />
               This deﬁcit he admits is $1 million. It is called 
               <br />
               “Additional Provincial Taxation —— $1 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million”.</span> 
               <br />
               Actually it is $1.2 million. Very well, what is he 
               <br />
               going to put his taxes on to get this? In the second 
               <br />

               <br />
               ther $350,000. As you will remember the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">transi»</span>

               <br />
               by $350,000 a year until it gets down to nothing, 
               <br />
               and so on year after year, until at the end of the 
               <br />
               12th year the Newfoundland people will be 
               <br />
               paying, mark you, $4.7 million in taxes more than 
               <br />
               they are paying today. They have to make that up. 
               <br />
               Very well. All I want to know, sir, from Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood is just what he is going to levy these 
               <br />
               taxes upon? It seems to me some indication ought 
               <br />
               to be given us. We enter confederation now with 
               <br />
               the prospect of having to raise more revenues 
               <br />
               year by year than we are raising now. Does this 
               <br />
               make sense? God knows we are taxed enough 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now.</span> Most countries today are endeavouring to 
               <br />
               lower the taxation burden. We are told, however, 
               <br />
               “Oh no, you must be taxed more year by year if 
               <br />
               you desire this inestimable privilege of being a 
               <br />
               Canadian citizen." Any fool can see that accord- 
               <br />
               ing to these terms, ten years hence the New- 
               <br />
               foundland people will have to raise nearly $5 
               <br />
               million more by way of taxation than we are 
               <br />
               doing now. And all this makes no allowance 
               <br />
               whatsoever for new construction or repair to 
               <br />
               roads, schools, buildings and other construction, 
               <br />
               and makes no allowance whatever for increase in 
               <br />
               public health services, educational facilities or 
               <br />
               ﬁshery improvement. Let us forget all this and 
               <br />
               merely ask Mr. Smallwood just how is he going 
               <br />
               to raise that money, that $5 million, say ten years 
               <br />
               hence? Is he banking on the possibility of having 
               <br />
               been gone by that time to his reward, eternal or 
               <br />
               otherwise? No, he won’t tell us, but I have indi- 
               <br />
               cated a method to you, and I hope, sir, that you 
               <br />
               will be here to be witness to the truth of that which 
               <br />
               I have spoken. It may be, however, that by that 
               <br />
               time communism will have overrun the world, 
               <br />
               and that a suitable commissar will be found to 
               <br />

               thing I do know is that the present administration

               <br />
               whatever form of government the people decide 
               <br />
               on in the future, that government will be hard put

               only be achieved by the fullest development of

               all our natural resources.

               In this development government must lend a

               How necessary therefore is it that govemment 
               <br />
               should be truly representative of the people. The 
               <br />
               brightest hope I have seen so far for the future is 
               <br />
               the present organisation of labour throughout the 
               <br />
               country. I have watched its development for a 
               <br />
               number of years, and after close association with 
               <br />
               some of its leaders I believe it to be the only 
               <br />
               development in self-govemment that has come to

               <br />
               wise leadership I believe that labour can save this 
               <br />
               country and her resources for the beneﬁt of all. If 
               <br />
               labour cannot make this country a better place in

               thing is absolutely essential, and that is a very

               close co-operation between all the unions in 
               <br />
               every branch of industry. They must get together 
               <br />
               and put up a solid co—operative front with capital 
               <br />

               <br />
               only be one of two forms, and it should be put to 
               <br />
               the people in this manner: “Do you desire the

               “yes", then we get back our former status, and 
               <br />
               begin to put our house in order. Mr. Chairman, I 
               <br />
               put it to you that is of the very essence of the 
               <br />
               meaning of the word “referendum”. The diction- 
               <br />
               ary tells us that the meaning of the word is the 
               <br />
               “referring of some social or political question to 
               <br />
               the electorate, who will decide it by either a ‘yes’ 
               <br />
