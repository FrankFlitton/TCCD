               Mr. Chairman Before you resume your seat, 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne, I presume it is a fair inference 
               <br />
               that the situation to which you refer is of a recur- 
               <br />
               ring nature since our ability to carry it into effect 
               <br />
               would naturally depend upon whatever surpluses 
               <br />
               we have. I take it that it is your opinion that this 
               <br />
               might have a bearing upon the deliberations of 
               <br />
               the Committee in determining our future 
               <br />
               economic potentialities, or in other words our 
               <br />
               ability to remain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self~supporting</span> in the future. 
               <br />
               Mr. Ashbourne Quite so, sir, because as I un- 
               <br />
               derstand it, the monies that we receive from the 
               <br />
               exports of our products will reﬂect our ability to 
               <br />
               pay taxes and to provide the revenue that’s neces-

               Mr. MacDonald May I ask a question of you, 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman? Some time ago, around Easter I 
               <br />
               believe it was, there were some committees ap- 
               <br />
               pointed to work during the recess, to consolidate 
               <br />
               the different committee reports. These commit- 
               <br />
               tees were appointed in very unofﬁcial gatherings. 
               <br />
               private sessions; it never came before the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Con“</span> 
               <br />
               vention ofﬁcially; they were appointed ofﬁcially 
               <br />
               butnot in the Convention. MightI ask, Mr. Chair- 
               <br />
               man, in View of this Committee that’s now taking 
               <br />
               up the economic question, if they are aware of 
               <br />
               that fact? Are they in possession of these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">docuu</span> 
               <br />
               ments, which were supposedly condensed from 
               <br />
               the full reports that came in? Were they con~ 
               <br />
               solidated or not, and just what became of these 
               <br />
               reports?....

               Mr. Chairman I think I ought to answer this 
               <br />
               way, to the best of my ability, belief and 
               <br />
               knowledge. That is, the work of the Committee 
               <br />
               will be to co~ordinate and collate any reports that 
               <br />
               have thus far been tabled, and have a bearing 
               <br />
               upon the economic question. It was felt by the 
               <br />
               Steering Committee that the Finance Committee, 
               <br />
               by virtue of their experience and excursions into 
               <br />
               ﬁnance, would perhaps be best qualified to deal
