               <br />
               operated a chain of hotels, and in the event of

               union it would be possible, perhaps advisable, 
               <br />
               that the Newfoundland Hotel would be acquired 
               <br />
               by that company. Mr. Bailey expressed the 
               <br />
               opinion that this was the best reason for con- 
               <br />

               The sub-section dealing with Posts and

               Telegraphs was brought up for discussion. These

               services, though considered as two separate ser- 
               <br />
               vices in Canada, would be taken over as a single

               A question was raised whether the federal 
               <br />
               government would continue to employ the New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders in the service at the time of union. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood stated that the federal govern- 
               <br />
               ment was duty bound to employ in the public 
               <br />
               services of a province, citizens of that province. 
               <br />
               Mr. Fogwill wondered if the persons now 
               <br />
               employed by Posts and Telegraphs would be 
               <br />
               required to qualify for jobs according to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stand</span> 
               <br />
               ards set by the federal government: if the 
               <br />
               qualiﬁcations required were higher than those in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, would it mean that persons now 
               <br />
               employed, who failed to meet these qualifica- 
               <br />
               tions, would be discharged? Mr. Smallwood felt 
               <br />
               certain that if persons were unqualified for their 
               <br />
               jobs, every opportunity would be given to those 
               <br />
               employees to qualify.

               Mr. Fogwill wanted to know why revenue from 
               <br />
               Posts and Telegraphs estimated by Canada was 
               <br />
               $1 million below the amount estimated for the 
               <br />
               1947-48 period by the present government. Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood stated that in the event of union this 
               <br />
               service would be taken over by the federal 
               <br />
               government. Postage rates would be lower and 
               <br />
               wages would be increased, hence the difference 
               <br />
               in the two estimates. He went on to say that 
               <br />
               during the period 1920 to 1940, Posts and 
               <br />
               Telegraphs in Newfoundland averaged a yearly 
               <br />
               deﬁcit of $500,000.

               Mr. Smallwood It may be a fair inference from 
               <br />
               a purely legal standpoint. But to me it is not a fair 
               <br />
               or realistic inference at all; the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada in taking over these services will give us 
               <br />
               much better service, but as for a guarantee, no, 
               <br />
               there is no guarantee. That is a matter of what has 
               <br />
               been said and of what we believe. I believe, 
               <br />
               personally, that they will give us a little better 
               <br />
               service. I wish Mr. Higgins were here. He was 
               <br />
               one of the three delegates who were at the meet- 
               <br />
               ing. When the meeting ended we were chatting 
               <br />
               around in groups with the railway experts, espe- 
               <br />
               cially Commander Edwards. The Deputy Mini- 
               <br />
               ster of Transport said, “If and when 
               <br />
               Newfoundland comes into confederation, what 
               <br />
               do you think would become of the railway? What 
               <br />
               do you think, Captain, do you think they will do 
               <br />
               something for the railway, put it in good shape?" 
               <br />
               He said, “What else? Either that, or we will have 
               <br />
               a railway hanging on us, dragging on us, a burden 
               <br />
               on us.” ....He said, “If you ever come in with us, 
               <br />
               you will have the best railway you ever had.” But 
               <br />
               there is no guarantee of it in the Grey Book. No 
               <br />
               guarantee about the railway and the steamship 
               <br />
               services. No guarantee they would not even shut 
               <br />
               them down. If anyone prefers to think that, I 
               <br />
               cannot stop them. I do not believe that. On the 
               <br />
               contrary, I believe the services the Government 
               <br />
               of Canadian would take over would be operated 
               <br />
               more efﬁciently and with better service to the 
               <br />
