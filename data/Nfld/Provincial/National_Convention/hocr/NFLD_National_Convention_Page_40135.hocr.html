               <br />
               over 20 years. Both of us entered the House

               respect and admiration for Mr. Brown increased.

               in the act of doing that yesterday when he was

               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, I had not had 
               <br />
               many conversations with Mr. Brown, although 
               <br />
               my acquaintance with him runs back to the fall 
               <br />
               of 1923, but on the night before last, in the lobby 
               <br />
               of the Hotel, we had quite a pleasant chat, which 
               <br />
               I was personally very happy to have. Yesterday 
               <br />
               he collapsed in speaking to the motion that I 
               <br />
               moved. I know that he opposed the motion with 
               <br />
               complete sincerity. I know his feeling was that it 
               <br />
               was his duty to speak his mind honestly, manful- 
               <br />
               ly, and he was doing that on that occasion. I 
               <br />
               confess I hardly know whetherl would prefer he 
               <br />
               had been supporting or opposing the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">motion.</span> I 
               <br />
               know we can all agree that the loss of his 
               <br />
               presence, even temporarily, will be a severe one. 
               <br />
               Men like Mr. Brown, of manly independence, 
               <br />
               unafraid to express their honest convictions, are 
               <br />
               needed now as they will be in the future. I hope, 
               <br />
