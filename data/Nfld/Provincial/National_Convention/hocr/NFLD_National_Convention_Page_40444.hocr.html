               Mr. Burry I don’t need to rise to support the 
               <br />
               co-operative movement, it has a great deal of 
               <br />
               support throughout the country and in this Con- 
               <br />
               vention. I rise to support the idea that the govem- 
               <br />
               merit should give some support to this movement 
               <br />
               as it has been doing in the past by educating the 
               <br />
               people to get into this thing as their own.... Mr. 
               <br />
               Bailey spoke of the co—operative movement in 
               <br />
               Labrador. As we all know Sir Wilfred Grenfeli 
               <br />
               started it and it failed, and now it has been taken 
               <br />
               over by the co-operative movement and they are 
               <br />
               doing a great job of it. I hope that the government 
               <br />
               of the future will support this movement...

               Mr. Starkes I notice the number of cases that 
               <br />
               came from Notre Dame Bay ~— 3,648 cases, 
               <br />
               which averaged around $45 a case. Part of Notre 
               <br />
               Dame Bay happens to be in my district and I 
               <br />
               certainly would like to see the co-operative 
               <br />
               movement down there if they would bring in 32 
               <br />
               cents a pound to the ﬁshermen for their lobster. 
               <br />
               If the lobster caught in Notre Dame Bay last year 
               <br />
               was sold for 32 cents a pound, that would have 
               <br />
               netted them $70,000 more than they got. I believe 
               <br />
               every member will agree that the co-operative 
               <br />
               movement is a beneﬁt to the ﬁshermen.

               Mr. Newell Before we pass on I should like to 
               <br />
               say that I am simply amazed at the enthusiasm 
               <br />
               which the co-operative movement has been given 
               <br />
               by individual members of this Convention. One 
               <br />
               point I would like to clear up is about the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern»</span> 
               <br />
               rnent putting money into it. The best means of 
               <br />
               deciding whether or not the government was 
               <br />
               justiﬁed in conducting <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cvoperative</span> educational 
               <br />
               policy would be to examine the result which that 
               <br />
               policy has achieved. I feel that since the co-opera- 
               <br />
               tive division has been in existence only some ten 
               <br />
               years, and viewing the situation that we had to 
               <br />
               begin with, the individualistic attitude of the 
               <br />
               average Newfoundland ﬁsherman. the suspicion 
               <br />
               of anything new which we all have, I think that 
               <br />
               the results achieved by this annual expenditure 
               <br />
               have been nothing short of amazing. I can say that 
               <br />
               because none of that money is being spent on my 
               <br />
               salary! What I intended to draw the attention of 
               <br />
               the Convention to was another point in connec- 
               <br />
               tion with the co-operative movement that has not

               been brought out. We have seen how the earnings 
               <br />
               of ﬁshermen have been enhanced, and even in the 
               <br />
               St. Anthony area in one year the co-operative 
               <br />
               society paid out $45,000 in cold cash for salmon, 
               <br />
               plus whatever it paid out for boxes, etc. If that 
               <br />
               salmon had been sold locally it would have 
               <br />
               fetched $18,000. In other words there was a 
               <br />
               $27,000 increase over the local price. When you 
               <br />
               add up all these amounts it must seem obvious 
               <br />
               that purely on the dollar advantage the $50,000 
               <br />
               which the government is spending annually, and 
               <br />
               which seems to be causing some delegates con~ 
               <br />
               cem, is money well spent. And then too I am 
               <br />
               interested in the educational value of a movement 
               <br />
               of this kind, in fact any movement that has an 
               <br />
               educational value. Two or three days ago when 
               <br />
               we were on another section of this report we read 
               <br />
               that the Fisheries Committee endorsed the idea 
               <br />
               that we should try to put the Newfoundland salt 
               <br />
               codﬁshery on a cash basis, and there was a good 
               <br />
               deal said on the advantage of cash trading over 
               <br />
               credit <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taking.</span> I have before me the annual report 
               <br />
               of the Registrar of the Co-operative Societies, 
               <br />
               Dec. 31, 1945, and the co-operative credit 
               <br />
               societies, which are small community banks, 
               <br />
               have loaned to their members $834,667, and if 
               <br />
               you look at what has been done in l946 in loans, 
               <br />
               because the amount is increasing every year, 
               <br />
               among these 60 or 70 credit unions, the amount 
               <br />
               must be well over $1 million at the present time, 
               <br />
               loans that have been made by the people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them,</span> 
               <br />
               selves. I might also point out that the number of 
               <br />
               loans overdue is less than 1% of the total amount 
               <br />
               loaned. The point I am trying to make is this: we 
               <br />
               come in here and talk about the desirability of 
               <br />
               going on a cash trading basis, and here is a group 
               <br />
               of organisations that have a plan for putting that 
               <br />
               idea into effect. I don’t mean to suggest that that 
               <br />
               million dollar loan business was all to ﬁshermen, 
               <br />
               but a great proportion of it was loans to ﬁsher~ 
               <br />
               men, and I have myself seen fishermen borrow- 
               <br />
               ing cash from credit unions to buy motor engines, 
               <br />
               ﬁsheries supplies, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">etc,</span> and very often patronising 
               <br />
               the local merchant with that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cash...</span> The total 
               <br />
               number of members in those societies in 1945 
               <br />
               was 4,640, which is only a small proportion ofthe 
               <br />
               people.
