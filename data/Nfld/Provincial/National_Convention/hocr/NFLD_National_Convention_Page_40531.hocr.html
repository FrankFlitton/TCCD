               [The committee then discussed the sections on 
               <br />
               slate, molybdenum, gypsum, manganese, an- 
               <br />

               <br />
               tion on brick~making] 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood Mr. Chairman, it is quite an 
               <br />
               eye~opener -— two plants in Trinity Bay making 
               <br />
               600,000 bricks each, 1,200,000 bricks, and 
               <br />
               Mr. Dawe over at Makinsons, over 2 million 
               <br />
               bricks a year. It’s amazing. That’s an eye-opener 
               <br />
               to the country. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins I believe that this Section was 
               <br />
               prepared by Mr. Vardy, and he may have some 
               <br />
               comments to add. He will have to be the one to 
               <br />
               answer any comments. 
               <br />
               Mr. Vincent Those Trinity Bay plants have 
               <br />
               modern methods — has Mr. Dawe’s plant? 
               <br />
               Mr. Vardy I worked on this with the other 
               <br />
               members of the Committee, but the plant at 
               <br />
               Snooks Harbour, Mr. Smith’s plant, has some 
               <br />
               modern machinery, but they agree that it is not as 
               <br />
               modern as it should be. They tried to get in some 
               <br />
               machinery duty free but did not succeed, though 
               <br />
               finally they did get in one machine. It is quite an 
               <br />
               old industry, and naturally the people are very 
               <br />
               proud to ﬁnd that the tests of the shale showed an 
               <br />
               abundant quantity, and it has proved very suc— 
               <br />
               cessful. We believe that the time is not far distant 
               <br />
               when the people owning the two brickyards over 
               <br />
               there will amalgamate. The chances are they will 
               <br />
               do that, and there will be a large company formed 
               <br />
               to manufacture brick out of this shale. In conver- 
               <br />
               sation with Professor Hayes, he informed us that 
               <br />
               this shale was of a very high quality, and the brick 
               <br />
               made from that will stand up against the very best 
               <br />
               imported article, and he could not see why there 
               <br />
               should not be an industry there employing from 
               <br />
               100 to 200 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">men.</span> One thing I would like to say for 
               <br />
               that brick industry over there, is that it has gone 
               <br />
               on continuously over a period of 40 or 50 years. 
               <br />
               One of the older brickyards closed down, but 
               <br />
               these other two yards have employed workers 
               <br />
               right through. They paid reasonable wages, and 
               <br />
               although the owners did not earn very much 
               <br />
               proﬁt, yet, at the same time, those employed 
               <br />
               made a comfortable living and the owners of the 
               <br />
               yards have always come through If there is any 
               <br />
               further information I can give I will.

               I may say I was responsible for the section on

               <br />
               England and Wales, and worked in a slate quarry

               when I was so young, that when a Welshman sent 
               <br />
               me in to see what time it was, I went in and looked 
               <br />
               up at the steam guage and told him it was quarter 
               <br />
               past 90. I remember that quite well. I did not even 
               <br />
               know the time. Those quarries were worked for 
               <br />
               the period given in the report, and ﬁnally they 
               <br />
               found that owing to the very great cost of 
               <br />
               transportation in moving the slate from here to 
               <br />
               England, they could not compete with the Welsh 
               <br />
               quarries. The last that was sent over, they ﬁnished 
               <br />
               up loading the ship with cod oil in common casks. 
               <br />
               The ship got out and met rough weather, and by 
               <br />
               the time they got over there the whole thing was 
               <br />
               slate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dust,</span> That ﬁnished it for Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               There is some talk of having the quarries opened 
               <br />
               to manufacture slate dust for mineralised rooﬁng, 
               <br />
               but the smooth rooﬁng seems to have taken the 
               <br />
               place of it, and there is not much hope of doing 
               <br />
               anything about it, but the brick industry has a 
               <br />
               future.

               <br />
               quality is equal to the imported, and they have 
               <br />
               also got a lot of machinery coming in. Further on 
               <br />
               in the report is this, “We understand the company

               the Philadelphia bankers guaranteed this firm and
