               <br />

               in mind the fact that this is an epochal assembly

               now at this crossroads in our island’s story is

               more important to me than anything I know. Time

               My interpretation of the functions, duties and 
               <br />
               scope of this National Convention lies some— 
               <br />
               where in between both their more or less extreme 
               <br />
               views. It is to my mind the only interpretation that 
               <br />
               this Convention should have allowed itself. The

               terms of reference which outlined the work of the

               and discuss among themselves, the ﬁnancial and

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">referendum...”</span> Actually there was no need for 
               <br />
               this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Convention.</span> The British government knew 
               <br />
               the island was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selfasupporting</span> and could have 
               <br />
               arranged a referendum on the basis of this reason- 
               <br />
               ing: “The island is self-supporting, we intend to 
               <br />
               carry out the 1933 agreement, we will give you a 
               <br />
               referendum in which you will be asked to choose 
               <br />
               between Commission of Government and 
               <br />
               responsible government. If you by a majority 
               <br />
               select responsible government, that will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">res»</span>

               tored.” That could have been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">done,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">li‘it</span> had been,

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               However, the British government may have 
               <br />
               argued that there were many people in between 
               <br />
               both forms of government, who wanted the out— 
               <br />
               side control that Commission represented with 
               <br />
               the satisfaction of at least electing a lower house. 
               <br />
               In accordance with the 1933 agreement they 
               <br />
               could not put representative government on the 
               <br />
               referendum, so they evolved the National Con-

               vention to consider and discuss among themsel-

               ves and recommend forms of government for a 
               <br />
               referendum which could, if the Convention saw 
               <br />
               fit, include representative government. If that is 
               <br />
               what they had in mind, ldo not think the Conven-

               tion is a stall or a red herring. Like Mr. Hollett, I 
               <br />
               see nothing and can read nothing in the terms of 
               <br />
               reference that would permit us to recommend to 
               <br />
               the people a form of government (i.e. confedera- 
               <br />
               tion) which might jeopardise the sovereignty of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland and perhaps result in the loss of 
               <br />
               that sovereignty without proper consideration of 
               <br />
               such an unalterable decision under a sovereign 
               <br />
               government responsible to the people.
