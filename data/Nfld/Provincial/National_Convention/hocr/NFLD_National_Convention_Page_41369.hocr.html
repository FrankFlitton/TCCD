               <br />
               sort of statement that has no meaning in real life.

               <br />
               in Newfoundland men and women —— no better, 
               <br />
               no worse than other men and women in their 
               <br />
               ability to progress and improve and work out a 
               <br />
               destiny for themselves. For the same reason I 
               <br />
               believe that that system of self—govemment can 
               <br />
               progress and improve. Otherwise I would not 
               <br />
               advocate it. I believe men and women no longer 
               <br />
               are satisﬁed with government which gives <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">politi~</span> 
               <br />
               cal freedom but denies freedom to carve out in an 
               <br />
               intricate world a means of making a decent 
               <br />
               living. Why should we assume, as has been done 
               <br />
               so often, that self-government is to be a stagnant, 
               <br />
               reactionary, dead thing? Does it not exist as a 
               <br />
               means of implementing the wishes of the people? 
               <br />
               When we are asked what is the good of a vote to 
               <br />
               a man who has nothing to eat, the answer is, “It 
               <br />
               is no good.” But the question itself does not make 
               <br />
               sense. A man does not want a vote instead of 
               <br />
               food. Nobody ever argued that. Neither does he 
               <br />
               want food at a price which will bring the loss of 
               <br />
               his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self‘respect,</span> his power to develop and live 
               <br />
               more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fully.</span> In short, most men who are men at all 
               <br />
               feel that they are entitled to both. And I think they 
               <br />
               are right. I think also, under self—govemment that 
               <br />
               they have at this moment in our history the best 
               <br />
               opportunity of getting both. Otherwise I would 
               <br />
               not be advocating it.

               <br />
               thought, by giving my opinion on the question 
               <br />
               of forms of government, I am in honour bound

               to say something else which is of great impor- 
               <br />
               tance. Whilst I think that Newfoundland and 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders have most to proﬁt from a 
               <br />
               form of government which is free and inde-

               pendent, I am duty bound to say that I believe 
               <br />
               that that form of government does not necessarily 
               <br />
               offer the easiest way. I believe it demands more 
               <br />
               sacrifice, more native ability, more self-ad- 
               <br />
               ministered checks and responsibilities than any 
               <br />
               other form considered in this Convention so far.

               the easiest way out. But just because it is not the

               easiest way out, and because of the future poten- 
               <br />

               <br />
               study, that given the effort, the results will be the 
               <br />
               most rewarding from self-government.
