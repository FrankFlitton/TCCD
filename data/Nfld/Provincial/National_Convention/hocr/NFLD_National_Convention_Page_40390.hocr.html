               Mr. Burry Before the question is put, I would 
               <br />
               like to say a word. I would like to speak against 
               <br />
               the amendment because it is going to deny me 
               <br />
               some information I was sent here to get. The 
               <br />
               people whom I represent want to get it as they 
               <br />
               might want to use it in the future. Four months 
               <br />
               ago I voted on a motion similar to the motion 
               <br />
               before the Chair <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now.</span> I am convinced more than 
               <br />
               ever that I should be in favour of a motion like 
               <br />
               that at the present time. I have studied and 
               <br />
               laboured with the rest of you on various <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commit»</span> 
               <br />
               tee work and I am not convinced yet that we are 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self-supporting,</span> I can see where a budget might 
               <br />
               be balanced, and leave many people in this 
               <br />
               country and Labrador in the same living condi- 
               <br />
               tions they have been in all down through the 
               <br />
               years, when ﬁshermen have had to live on $100 
               <br />
               a year. Balancing a budget like that, we could do 
               <br />
               it. I am not convinced that that is what we are here 
               <br />
               to do. When I think of that $20 million surplus, a 
               <br />
               strange feeling comes over me I am not very 
               <br />
               proud of that surplus I would like to get informa- 
               <br />
               tion on the possibility of joining up with bigger 
               <br />
               units, on the possibility of better living conditions 
               <br />
               and a better system than we have had in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">past.</span> 
               <br />
               I was very interested in the speech of Mr. 
               <br />
               Keough. I ﬁgured to myself that that comes from 
               <br />
               the background of a man of service to the poor 
               <br />
               people of this country. I noticed the spirit he was 
               <br />
               giving it in; knew what was in his mind; knew his 
               <br />
               feelings. I have had experience such as that 
               <br />
               myself; I have lived among people who are living 
               <br />
               in poverty, degradation and misery, great num- 
               <br />
               bers of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them...</span> I am wondering what kind of 
               <br />
               government we can get to enable these people to 
               <br />
               get a more decent living... I am willing to take 
               <br />
               any chance to get information that will enable me 
               <br />
               to come to a decision later that will get this

               Mr. Hollett ....Mr. Burry states all he wants is 
               <br />
               information. If he would read the British North 
               <br />
               America Act he will ﬁnd the information there. 
               <br />
               The only thing they cannot give without argu~ 
               <br />
               ment is how much per capita are they going to 
               <br />
               pay us in the event of our giving up income tax; 
               <br />
               that is the only information a delegation can get. 
               <br />
               All the other things are laid down in the act and 
               <br />
               unless the British government amends that act, 
               <br />
               there can be no other terms, except these. At the 
               <br />
               present time in Canada the federal government is 
               <br />
               in deep argument with the governments of the 
               <br />
               provinces trying to arrive at a satisfactory amount 
               <br />
               of taxes. The idea of sending a delegation to 
               <br />
               Canada is unconstitutional and on that I firmly 
               <br />

               <br />
               not; I am merely stating the point; I do not think 
               <br />
               we have sufﬁcient authority to go <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there...</span>

               Mr. Watton We have a motion here before us 
               <br />
               similar to one we had last <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fall,</span> At that time I 
               <br />
               supported that motion. I still contend the people 
               <br />
               of this country should know the terms of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con»</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">federation.</span> Early this month we sent a delegation 
               <br />
               to confer with the Commission ofGovemment to 
               <br />
               get their advice on certain matters; one was the 
               <br />
               sending of a delegation to Canada to discuss 
               <br />
               terms of federal union. That committee brings 
               <br />
               back a report which says that fiscal, political and 
               <br />
               economic matters are matters entirely between 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">governments.</span> If the delegation to Canada cannot 
               <br />
               discuss these things, what are they going to talk 
               <br />
               about? If the Canadians did give us the terms, we 
               <br />
               could not discuss them. It is a matter between 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">governments.</span> In that case, would a delegation 
               <br />
               from this Convention get the same terms as a duly 
               <br />
               authorised government of this country? We can- 
               <br />
               not bargain. We cannot talk <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">back,</span> I want to get 
               <br />
               the information and I would like to see the terms 
               <br />
               of confederation, but I honestly cannot support 
               <br />
               the sending of a delegation to Canada under these 
               <br />
               conditions. It would be a waste of time. I am 
               <br />
               going to vote for the amendment.
