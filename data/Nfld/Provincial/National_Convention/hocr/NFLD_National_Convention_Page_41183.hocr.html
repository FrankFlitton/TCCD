               any of the points so lucidly explained by Mr.

               Higgins. Like a learned professor of history, he

               took us through a very interesting homily, and he 
               <br />
               used very few political catchphrases as did his

               well—versed associate, the worthy Major. It was

               tion of the lawyer from the prejudices of the

               politician, for both ultimately arrived at the same

               Mr. Butt Last year I voted against sending a 
               <br />

               <br />
               after a number of months in this Convention, I 
               <br />

               that in my opinion, the debate during the last three

               or four weeks has shown to my own satisfaction 
               <br />
               that I am correct and I was justiﬁed in reaching 
               <br />

               <br />
               petent to deal with a number of matters, I kept 
               <br />
               notes of things as they were said both for and 
               <br />
               against the proposed arrangements for the entry 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland into confederation. I looked at 
               <br />
               those notes a few days ago, and if I were to make 
               <br />
               a comment of one minute on every one, I should 
               <br />
               certainly be talking from now until the closure 
               <br />

               <br />
               deal of what has been said has already been 
               <br />

               There are one or two things to which I would 
               <br />
               like specifically to refer, and it will be in the main 
               <br />
               connected with my feelings that Newfoundland 
               <br />
               should not entrust negotiations of this kind to a 
               <br />
               body such as the National Convention. Before I 
               <br />
               do that, however, and so that I will not be ir- 
               <br />
               relevant and immaterial, I would like to read the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst clause in the proposed arrangements: “1. 
               <br />
               Newfoundland will have, as from the date of 
               <br />
               union, the status of a province of Canada with all 
               <br />
               the rights, powers, privileges and responsibilities 
               <br />
               of a province.” It is a plain statement of fact. 
               <br />
               Since this debate on confederation and for a time 
               <br />
               before it, I have heard that clause turned inside 
               <br />
               out and given to me in reverse by a whole series 
               <br />
               of derogatory statements destined to loosen the 
               <br />
               morale of this country, so that we will be able to 
               <br />
               contemplate easily, quietly and very deceitfully 
               <br />
               the loss of dominion status, the loss of a political 
               <br />
               entity of our own, and easily slide into that of the 
               <br />
               baby province of the Dominion of Canada.

               I find it very difﬁcult and a bit embarrassing 
               <br />
               to refer to these things, but I must give expression 
               <br />
               to the faith that is in me, regardless of its un- 
               <br />
               popularity in many quarters. It seems very 
               <br />
               fashionable today in these quarters to play down 
               <br />
               national pride, and I ask members here and 
               <br />
               anyone listening in, to remember the last 16 
               <br />
               months both in and out of this house. New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders, as Major Cashin said the other day, 
               <br />
               have always been prone to be overcritical of 
               <br />
               themselves. This, I think, is a result of a long 
               <br />
               series of incidents in the history of New- 
               <br />
               foundland which has given us the attitude that we 
               <br />
               must, in some way, be an inferior people. If you 
               <br />
               were to meet the ordinary American, he will 
               <br />
               approach you in such a way that you will feel that 
               <br />
               he is bragging. Nothing is further from the truth. 
               <br />
               The real truth of the matter is that he has known 
               <br />
               what it is to be free... We have never allowed
