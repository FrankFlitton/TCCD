               Mr. Butt If that is important, as I think it is, I 
               <br />
               was perfectly right the very ﬁrst day in asking 
               <br />
               where the appendix was (which you said was 
               <br />
               forthcoming) giving a plain statement of fact. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood They say “a special effort”. 
               <br />
               Mr. Butt To do what? To me, it has no real 
               <br />
               meaning when I am thinking of the responsibility 
               <br />
               I have to recommend; I have to cast a vote, that 
               <br />
               is the point I am quarrelling with. Take the 
               <br />
               geological surveys; on that point alone, and bear- 
               <br />
               ing this one in mind as well, we are promised two 
               <br />
               geological survey parties. In Newfoundland last 
               <br />
               year we had ll survey parties in the ﬁeld. In the 
               <br />
               budget you drew up, you left in the salaries for 
               <br />
               the geological department; but you took out 
               <br />
               every cent in the provincial budget for the survey 
               <br />
               parties. We are promised two. We are given this

               vague paragraph and asked to take it on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trust...</span> 
               <br />
               The same holds true if you follow all the way 
               <br />
               down. For instance the question of air surveys —— 
               <br />
               “Air photography required for the surveys and 
               <br />
               mapping outlined above would be supplied by 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Dominion.”‘</span> It may be callous, but I think as 
               <br />
               long as we are finding the facilities for foreign 
               <br />
               countries to do business, and we have no air ﬂeet 
               <br />
               of our own. I think they should pay for the sur— 
               <br />
               veys and pass them on to us. To me it is not a 
               <br />
               concession at all.

               Now, Mr. Chairman, that is pretty plain as to 
               <br />
               their intention. Mr. Higgins said here yesterday 
               <br />
               afternoon that every man and every woman in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland feels in his or her heart that if any 
               <br />
               international trouble starts, we will be, this time, 
               <br />
               in the thick of the fight. If anyone will look at the 
               <br />
               publications by the Ofﬁce of War Information 
               <br />
               published in 1940, he will see there that prior to 
               <br />
               1940 the American government was well aware 
               <br />
               of the fact that Newfoundland was in the possible 
               <br />
               path of the approach to the American continent. 
               <br />
               He will see it in print and in diagram in the form 
               <br />
               of an arrow coming right down straight through 
               <br />
               the St. Lawrence. Surely the people to whom 
               <br />
               concessions have been given without our con~ 
               <br />
               sent, a friendly country who will dominate us to 
               <br />
               the extent that they are not in any way to be 
               <br />
               charged with anything, even to be given the use 
               <br />
               of the roads without having to pay the cost, not 
               <br />
               only the license for the number plates that are on 
               <br />
               them; surely Newfoundland should in a matter of 
               <br />
               this kind have some say and some representation. 
               <br />
               I happen to be aware of the fact that a civilian in 
               <br />
               an important position in Newfoundland, on more 
               <br />
               than one occasion during the last war, had the 
               <br />
               courage to protect civilian rights when they were 
               <br />
               trying to be usurped by the military, unnecessari~ 
               <br />
               ly. I say that a thing like this going into the Black 
               <br />
               Books should have been thoroughly aired, and 
               <br />
               we in Newfoundland should have been given 
               <br />
               something more than has been given. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Right on that point, I come to another made by 
               <br />
               Mr. Harrington and Major Cashin when they 
               <br />
               referred to the number of material things which 
               <br />
               Canada would control. These are purely material 
               <br />
               things and to me they do not count very much. 
               <br />
               Whether Canada controls the Railway, the post 
               <br />
               ofﬁce or other things does not, to me, amount to 
               <br />
               very much. I agree with both gentlemen on that 
               <br />
               point. But I have to ask myself, and I think we 
               <br />
               ought to ask ourselves, in the control of these 
               <br />
               things, what are we really giving up? Here is what 
               <br />
               we are giving up — any possible advantage or 
               <br />
               bargaining power we might get out of our 
               <br />
               strategic position. We may not get a thing, but I 
               <br />
               for one at least, want to make an effort, or the 
               <br />
               people of this country should make an effort in 
               <br />
               that behalf. We are giving up communications,
