               As a matter of fact Newfoundlanders already

               that property tax for 60 years. Sometimes it has 
               <br />
               happened that the man could not pay that tax. 
               <br />
               That has happened in St. John’s, and it has hap-

               pened that the city council has taken his house

               Hollett, in the speech to which I am replying, read 
               <br />
               out an act of the legislature of Nova Scotia, an act 
               <br />

               <br />
               in Nova Scotia to collect certain taxes. He did not 
               <br />
               read out the act of the legislature of New— 
               <br />

               <br />
               Newfoundland to collect property taxes. He did 
               <br />
               not read that out. He had a right not to read it out, 
               <br />
               a perfect right, but I have a right to point out that 
               <br />
               there is such an act in Newfoundland, passed in

               <br />
               for the recess I was addressing myself to the 
               <br />
               question of property taxes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">w</span> who taxes what, 
               <br />
               and I had got as far as pointing out that if New- 
               <br />
               foundland becomes a province, the Government 
               <br />
               of Canada will not collect any property taxes on 
               <br />
               the people of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundlandw</span> And I had got as 
               <br />
               far also as pointing out that the provincial govem~ 
               <br />
               ment is not likely to impose a property tax. What 
               <br />
               we have left therefore are the town councils and 
               <br />
               the city councils. We have only one city council, 
               <br />
               that is St. John’s, but we have at the present time 
               <br />
               20 town councils, and we have ten others that are 
               <br />
               in the process of being formed. That would give 
               <br />
               us 30, and I dare say, in the course of time, we 
               <br />
               will have other town councils, because it is the 
               <br />
               policy of the government, and has been now for 
               <br />
               several years, to encourage the people of the 
               <br />
               larger towns and settlements in Newfoundland to 
               <br />
               form up their own town councils, and these coun— 
               <br />
               cils are doing such good work that we hope to 
               <br />
               have more of them in the near future. My friend 
               <br />
               Mr. Vincent there is a great enthusiast on this 
               <br />
               matter, and my friend behind me, Mr. Miller, is 
               <br />
               the chairman of the town council in the Placentia 
               <br />
               area, and many people are growing very en- 
               <br />
               thusiastic about these town councils, because a 
               <br />
               town council is formed in a community to do 
               <br />
               things for that community which no one else will 
               <br />
               do. The Government of Newfoundland can hard- 
               <br />
               ly be expected to collect the garbage from the 
               <br />
               homes of the people in St. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">John’s.</span> The people of 
               <br />
               St. John’s would scarcely expect the Government 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland to do that, to use money that 
               <br />
               the government collects from all Newfoundland 
               <br />
               to collect the garbage from their doors. The 
               <br />
               people of St. John’s could not expect the Govern~ 
               <br />
               ment of Newfoundland to give them concrete 
               <br />
               sidewalks and drains and curbs and light their 
               <br />
               streets for them, and to provide parks and other 
               <br />
               conveniences and comforts of modem civilisa- 
               <br />
               tion. The people of St. John’s could not expect 
               <br />
               the government to do that, and they don’t expect 
               <br />
               them to do it, and the government don’t do it, 
               <br />
               these things are done by the city council; and in
