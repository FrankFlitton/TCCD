               <br />
               whose policy in all parts of the world is to give 
               <br />
               control of their own affairs to whatever peoples 
               <br />
               of the Empire seek them, can encourage 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders to retain the present dictatorial 
               <br />
               system, particularly in view of the straitened 
               <br />
               circumstances of Great Britain at the present 
               <br />
               time; and this would tend to give some credence 
               <br />
               to the belief still held in many quarters, despite 
               <br />
               the rather ambiguous answer received to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span>

               may not yet appear on the ballot paper; or that a 
               <br />
               statement of Great Britain’s inability to ﬁnance 
               <br />
               the system may be issued coincident with the 
               <br />
               holding of the referendum. I think it is also right 
               <br />
               to point out that at the present time the Commis- 
               <br />
               sion of Government does not hold office by the 
               <br />
               will of the people. However, if at the referendum 
               <br />
               it should be voted into power, it would then be in 
               <br />
               the position of a popular legislature, of a kind, 
               <br />
               and possessed of the authority to put this country 
               <br />
               into union with another country.

               The foundation for the presumed solid en- 
               <br />
               trenchment of the Commission government in 
               <br />
               our midst is the argument that they have extended 
               <br />
               our social services That, it would seem, is the 
               <br />
               only argument. Yet, as I have pointed out, this 
               <br />
               was not commenced in actuality until 1941, and 
               <br />
               the various reports of the committees of this 
               <br />
               Convention which went thoroughly into these 
               <br />
               matters, all indicate that up to 1941 the policy was 
               <br />
               to make both ends meet and no more, and that all 
               <br />
               extensions of such services were coincident with 
               <br />
               the inﬂux of money from the United States and 
               <br />
               elsewhere. So their achievement is that they spent 
               <br />
               money, a lot of money, since 1941. It is fair to 
               <br />
               draw the conclusion, based on their policy of the 
               <br />
               years from 1934 to 1941, that but for the war that 
               <br />
               money would not have been spent, because they 
               <br />
               would not have had it to spend. When that money 
               <br />
               is all gone, as it will be very soon at the present 
               <br />
               rate of spending, what can we in this country 
               <br />
               expect? Surely we do not believe that Great

               <br />

               desire for its return, as against a desire to retain
