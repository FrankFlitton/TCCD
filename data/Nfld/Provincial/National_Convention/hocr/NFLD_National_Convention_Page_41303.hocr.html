               “Has this Convention been a complete waste of 
               <br />

               of you here will agree with me, think that this is 
               <br />
               not so. I submit that if it has done nothing else but 
               <br />
               awaken this country from its torpor, from its long 
               <br />
               sleep, from its lack of interest in all things politi~ 
               <br />
               cal, then it has more than justiﬁed its existence, 
               <br />
               but I say that it’s given to the people of this 
               <br />
               country not only that awakened interest, but a lot 
               <br />
               of valuable facts that in a large measure and to 
               <br />
               great extent a number of us never would have 
               <br />
               acquired. We may say that they have gotten them 
               <br />
               in capsule form, through the radio, but neverthe- 
               <br />
               less they have gotten those facts. I would say that 
               <br />
               the members have put a lot of hard work into this 
               <br />
               Convention, at great inconvenience to themsel- 
               <br />
               ves and in many cases at ﬁnancial loss. If, at 
               <br />
               times, tempers have ﬂared and matters have got— 
               <br />
               ten somewhat out of hand, this was only to be 
               <br />
               expected, and it merely proves to me how 
               <br />
               seriously the members of this Convention were 
               <br />
               taking their duties.

               All things being considered, I am satisﬁed that 
               <br />
               this Convention has justified its existence, and a

               lot of thanks are due to the radio operators and to 
               <br />
               the gentlemen of the press, because all the talking 
               <br />
               we have done would have been to naught if it had 
               <br />
               not been broadcast. It is true that at times we have 
               <br />
               been abusing the radio, but at all events, whether 
               <br />
               it has prolonged the Convention or not, whether 
               <br />
               some people think it has been a pretty high rate

               of entertainment they have received, I say that 
               <br />
               what they have heard on a number of occasions 
               <br />
               is not the true worth of this Convention, and that 
               <br />
               the members have done a good job, and that the 
               <br />
               end has justiﬁed the means.

               However, to return to the motion, and my own

               opinion that we assume our true obligation of 
               <br />
               responsible government. We have heard, here 
               <br />

               <br />
               conﬁned only to our own countrymen, but it 
               <br />
               appears in the columns of that famous Amulree

               <br />
               countrymen and the compilers of that report, I 
               <br />
               want you to consider the revenues of this country 
               <br />
               and the revenues that the men who ran our

               responsible government had to contend with. 
               <br />
               Responsible government was attained in 1855, 
               <br />
               and it is very difﬁcult in this day of big money to 
               <br />
               realise that in 1855 the ﬁrst responsible govern- 
               <br />
               ment of Newfoundland had a total revenue of not 
               <br />
               more than $500,000. And all you have got to do 
               <br />
               for the other ﬁgures is to go to the Finance 
               <br />
               Report, where you have the ﬁgures from 1897 up 
               <br />
               to the present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">day</span> In 1897 there was merely $1.7 
               <br />
               million in revenue, in 1902 there was $23 mil— 
               <br />
               lion, in 1909 $3 million, in 1914 $3.9 million. 
               <br />
               The ﬁrst time we got up to $10 million was in 
               <br />
               1919, and back it went again to $8 million for a 
               <br />
               number of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years.</span> In fact the highest revenue that 
               <br />
               responsible government ever had to run the busi- 
               <br />
               ness of this country was in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">192960,</span> when they 
               <br />
               had the enormous sum of $11.5 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million“.</span> So 
               <br />
               gentlemen, all I can say to you is that to run this 
               <br />
               country on the amount of money that our past 
               <br />
               governments had to run it with, was nothing short 
               <br />
               of miraculous. Where else in the world could it 
               <br />
               have happened? Where else could you get the 
               <br />
               men to do the job? I might be permitted to 
               <br />
               paraphrase Mr. Churchill: “Never did so few do 
               <br />
               so much with so little”; and I might add, “ or so 
               <br />
               little.” 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               What did they get out of it, I ask you? Nothing, 
               <br />
               except the satisfaction of sewing their country. 
               <br />
               All the way down the line from Dr. Carson, the 
               <br />
               ancestor of Mr. Job, our government had good 
               <br />
               men and true, and what did they get for their 
               <br />
               services of this country? Abuse in their lifetime 
               <br />
               and slander of their names after their death. So I 
               <br />
               say to you in all sincerity that Newfoundland has 
               <br />
               a debt you can never repay to these great men of 
               <br />
               our past governments, who served this country 
               <br />
               only too well at the expense of their own happi- 
               <br />
               ness and well-being. Let us in some measure, as 
               <br />
               some recompense for their work and as a tribute 
               <br />
               to their memory, resolve to once again relight the 
               <br />
               ﬁres that they so well lit, and so valiantly and 
               <br />
               nobly created. Let us keep our trust with them, 
               <br />
               and have faith in ourselves and in our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> I
