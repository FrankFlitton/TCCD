               Mr. Smallwood I know it is a lot to do, but 
               <br />
               essentially all they did was this: put some capital 
               <br />
               to work, enough to hire men and to open the mine 
               <br />
               and build the plant in which to separate the ores. 
               <br />
               That’s all they did. You can put quotations 
               <br />
               around “all" if you like, but the point is that that 
               <br />
               mineral was one of the things that God put in the 
               <br />
               country when he made it, and he put it there for 
               <br />
               us, the people of Newfoundland, not for out- 
               <br />
               siders. It is just a case of digging down into the 
               <br />
               earth and getting it and selling <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> The day comes 
               <br />
               when there is no more to take out, and the asset 
               <br />
               is gone, and the net result of it all is that ten years 
               <br />
               from now we may look back with a thrill to 
               <br />
               recognise that we had at Buchans a wonderful 
               <br />
               piece of wealth, that was put there when the 
               <br />
               country was made; and a foreign company came 
               <br />
               in, because we did not have the capital, and was 
               <br />
               given the right to mine it, and, having been there 
               <br />
               from 1927 to 1957, they cleaned up something in 
               <br />
               the nature of $25-30 million and went off, and 
               <br />
               there is no asset <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">left.</span> That’s the hard thing about

               that the capital to develop the mine is usually in 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood Yes, I am coming to that. They 
               <br />
               have paid <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$2.25</span> million in custom duties, but that

               referring to the principle of it. If you start a

               sawmill in White Bay you have to pay customs 
               <br />
               duties on certain materials that you have to use in 
               <br />
               that sawmill. They are not doing us any favour, 
               <br />
               they arejust on a par with every sawmill.

               a gamble in every way, and they were entitled to
