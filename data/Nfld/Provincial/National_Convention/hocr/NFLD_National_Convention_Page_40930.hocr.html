               drove the income tax and the corporation taxes 
               <br />
               up very high; they got the money out of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people.</span> But they have reduced them three times 
               <br />
               since the war. Just after the war ended they called 
               <br />
               the nine provinces together and said, “This war~ 
               <br />
               time agreement will soon be coming to an end; 
               <br />

               <br />
               come tax again." The provinces did not want to 
               <br />
               go back to the old system. The federal govem- 
               <br />
               ment said, “We propose that this arrangement, 
               <br />
               made during the war, we will make that for time 
               <br />
               of peace. We will be the only government who 
               <br />
               will collect income tax and death duties. In 
               <br />
               return, if you will lease to us the right to collect 
               <br />
               these taxes, we will pay you a fixed amount.” 
               <br />
               They worked out the basis, haggling over it; 
               <br />
               various premiers were trying to get the best deal 
               <br />
               possible for their industrial provinces. Seven of 
               <br />
               the nine provinces made that agreement with the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               They offer us in these terms the same agree- 
               <br />
               ment, only a little bit different. The agreement 
               <br />
               with the seven provinces expires in 1952. They 
               <br />
               say to us, “You can have it on the same terms 
               <br />
               to 1952; and if you like, you can have it to 1957. 
               <br />
               You have to decide within six months. After you 
               <br />
               become a province, your government would have 
               <br />
               to make up its mind whether it will sign the tax 
               <br />
               agreementuntil 1952 oruntil 1957. You will have 
               <br />
               to make your choice. But if you decide to make 
               <br />
               it up to 1957, and the agreement with the other 
               <br />
               provinces expires in 1952 and if they negotiate a 
               <br />
               new agreement, a better one, more preferable to 
               <br />
               them, you will not be entitled to any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">improve</span> 
               <br />
               ments they may get starting 1952, you would not 
               <br />
               get that until your agreement expired in 1957.” 
               <br />
               So Newfoundland, if it became a province, would 
               <br />
               have to make up its mind within six months, 
               <br />
               whether to sign the tax agreement until 1952 and 
               <br />
               take a chance on getting a better deal in l952, 
               <br />
               together with the other provinces. The danger of 
               <br />
               signing up to 1957 would be that if 1952 rolled 
               <br />
               around and the other nine provinces had 
               <br />
               negotiated a better deal, a better tax agreement, 
               <br />
               then the province might have to wait until 1957 
               <br />
               before it could get these additional advantages 
               <br />
               and beneﬁts the others had got starting 1952. 
               <br />
               Personally, it is only a matter of opinion, I do not 
               <br />
               think there is any danger that if the other provin- 
               <br />
               ces in 1952 did get a better tax agreement, the 
               <br />
               better agreement would be kept back from New- 
               <br />

               chance on signing up to 1952, feeling there will 
               <br />
               be a better tax agreement negotiated by the other 
               <br />
               provinces in 1952. There may be some questions 
               <br />
               on this section and there may be some to be 
               <br />
               directed to the Government of Canada. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins I wonder would Mr. Smallwood 
               <br />
               give us his opinion — in the event of federal 
               <br />
               union taking place between this country and 
               <br />
               Canada, if he approves of our signing a tax agree- 
               <br />
               ment with Canada? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood I would be in favour, if we 
               <br />
               became a province, of signing a tax agreement for 
               <br />
               this reason — that it is unthinkable that there 
               <br />
               should be two income taxes in Newfoundland, or 
               <br />
               that there should be two corporation taxes, or two 
               <br />
               death duties taxes or inheritance <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taxes.</span> There is 
               <br />
               room for only one. If we refused to make that tax 
               <br />
               agreement, Canada would collect her income tax 
               <br />
               in Canada just the same, and Newfoundland 
               <br />
               would be forced to have its own provincial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in~</span> 
               <br />
               come, corporation and inheritance taxes; which 
               <br />
               would be two such taxes on the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland and that would be something too 
               <br />
               heavy for the people to bear. It may be asked why 
               <br />
               Ontario and Quebec did not make the agree— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ment...</span> The reason is that those provinces had a 
               <br />
               tremendous backlog of money accumulated, so 
               <br />
               for a year they would quite easily ﬁnance them- 
               <br />
               selves without this income tax; they could spend 
               <br />
               their backlog. For reasons of their own they have 
               <br />
               not signed it and they can go on for a year. They 
               <br />
               do not need to put on provincial income tax. But 
               <br />
               the moment they come to impose that on top of 
               <br />
               the other taxes, the governments of Colonel Drew 
               <br />
               and Duplessis would be wiped out. No one wants 
               <br />
               to pay two income taxes. If Newfoundland <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be»</span> 
               <br />
               came a province, i would say let us have that 
               <br />
               agreement with the Government of Canada. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins Is that the only reason? 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood i do not think that is; but that 
               <br />
               would be sufﬁcient for me if I had to decide the 
               <br />
               matter. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins I want to put this position to him. I
