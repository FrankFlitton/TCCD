               <br />
               ments made by that delegation who went to 
               <br />
               Canada, relative to the public buildings in this 
               <br />
               country. I believe they made an estimate or value 
               <br />
               of public buildings in this country. I just hap- 
               <br />
               pened to run down through the list. I know there 
               <br />
               is a public building in Springdale, which cost this 
               <br />
               country $16,000, not listed there; a public build- 
               <br />
               ing in Grand Falls not listed, a public building in 
               <br />
               Burin not listed there. So if the Black Book is 
               <br />
               ofﬁcial, then I want to know who is responsible 
               <br />
               for making these errors. In my opinion this is not 
               <br />
               more ofﬁcial than Joseph R. Smallwood. If I can 
               <br />
               point out just brieﬂy errors in that Black Book, 
               <br />
               am I going to ask the people of this country to 
               <br />
               accept that as ofﬁcial? I put that before you, sir, 
               <br />
               and I say these Black Books are not ofﬁcial and 
               <br />
               I shall not regard them as official. I shall regard 
               <br />
               this Grey Book as official from the Government

               Mr. Chairman My position is, these Black 
               <br />
               Books are to be employed by members, that was 
               <br />
               settled once and for all this afternoon. It appears, 
               <br />
               Mr. Hollett, the opinion I had taken on the matter 
               <br />
               was not universally shared, and it was decided by 
               <br />
               this House that these Black Books are to be 
               <br />
               referred to, and whether they are quasi-ofﬁcial or 
               <br />
               otherwise, it is a matter of indifference to me. If 
               <br />
               there are misstatements, it will be the right of 
               <br />
               members to draw the attention of the Chairman
