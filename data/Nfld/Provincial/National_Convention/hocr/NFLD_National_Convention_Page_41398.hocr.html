               Mr. Fowler I contend, gentlemen, that if we had 
               <br />
               had responsible government during this boom 
               <br />
               period we would be in a far better position than 
               <br />
               we are today. Any body of Newfoundlanders 
               <br />
               would have had the interests of this country more 
               <br />
               at heart, and would have made the most of the 
               <br />
               many opportunities which offered to further the 
               <br />
               interests of their native land. But what happened? 
               <br />
               This dictatorial Commission played Santa Claus 
               <br />
               to all and sundry with utter disregard for the 
               <br />
               people’s future welfare. They have collected un- 
               <br />
               dreamed of revenues, and in the last two or three 
               <br />
               years in particular they have gone to great pains 
               <br />
               to spend every last cent and if possible to create 
               <br />
               a deﬁcit. In my opinion, any government with the 
               <br />
               interests of the country at heart should have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cur;</span> 
               <br />
               tailed expenditures at this time and built up a 
               <br />
               greater surplus, in order to adequately tide us over 
               <br />
               the recession period through which the world is 
               <br />
               bound to pass during the transition from a war to 
               <br />
               peace economy.

               Mr. Chairman, there is but one sane course 
               <br />
               open to the people of this country, and that is to 
               <br />
               become masters in their own house by returning 
               <br />
               to responsible government. Then, and not till 
               <br />
               then, will they be free to give expression to their 
               <br />
               beliefs without fear of outside interference. We 
               <br />
               all know that governments in the past were not 
               <br />
               perfect. No government is, but gentlemen, 
               <br />
               democracy reveals the virtues of the people as 
               <br />
               well as their vices, and it is because their virtues 
               <br />
               are greater than their vices that democracy has 
               <br />
               become the form of government to which the 
               <br />
               most progressive nations of the world adhere. 
               <br />
               Surely, we can do nothing but honour the 
               <br />
               memory of those great Newfoundlanders who 
               <br />
               nearly a century ago won for this country the right 
               <br />
               of self~determination. They realised and ap- 
               <br />
               preciated the freedom of democracy; will not we, 
               <br />
               in this our hour of trial, prove that we too are 
               <br />
               equal to the task and will sustain them in their 
               <br />
               historic decision to be free? We know the errors 
               <br />
               of the past, and would undoubtedly proﬁt by 
               <br />
               them, and I contend that under a responsible 
               <br />
               government set up along the lines suggested by 
               <br />
               Mr. Hickman in his masterly address, we could

               These, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Chairman, are briefly my views on

               the matter of forms of government, or at least on 
               <br />
               the forms within the compass of this resolution. 
               <br />
               They have been my views for a long time, sir, 
               <br />
               long before I heard of this Convention, and as this 
               <br />
               Convention draws to its inevitable end, I feel a 
               <br />
               sense of satisfaction in the fact that during our 
               <br />
               deliberations I have found nothing to cause me to 
               <br />
               change my views, but on the contrary, I have 
               <br />
               found much to conﬁrm and substantiate them. 
               <br />
               Among many things which tended to strengthen 
               <br />
               my belief were the ﬁndings of the several com— 
               <br />
               mittees, the statements of the many prominent 
               <br />
               men I had the privilege of meeting and the hope— 
               <br />
               ful and optimistic attitude of the majority of my 
               <br />
               fellow delegates.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Chairman, I want to draw the attention of 
               <br />
               this Convention to the fact that the cost of living 
               <br />
               has been increasing in all North American 
               <br />
               countries at a very high rate. Newfoundland has 
               <br />
               not been exempt in this respect. However, I want 
               <br />
               to draw to your attention the fact that recently the 
               <br />
               members of the Civil Service Association have 
               <br />
               been negotiating with the Commission of 
               <br />
               Government with regard to obtaining an increase 
               <br />
               in their salaries to cope with this advance in the 
               <br />
               high cost of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">living,</span> Their request has been prac- 
               <br />
               tically ignored by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Commission,</span> Do you think, 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, that such an action can be termed 
               <br />
               fair or honest, particularly in View of the fact that 
               <br />
               less than two years ago the Newfoundland <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">memA</span> 
               <br />
               bers of the Commission had their own salaries 
               <br />
               increased by $2,000 per year, or an increase of 
               <br />
               25%, whilst at the same time the salary of the 
               <br />
               Chairman of the Commission has been increased 
               <br />
               by nearly 40%? Another point in respect to this 
               <br />
               matter is the fact that the British members of the 
               <br />
               Commission receive a sustenance allowance of 
               <br />
               around $4,000 a year annually, and other British 
               <br />
               civil servants receive preferential treatment with 
               <br />
               regard to subsistence allowances. Mr. Chairman, 
               <br />
               I consider such treatment of our own New- 
               <br />
               foundland ofﬁcials nothing short of scandalous, 
               <br />
               and whilst I appreciate that many of the civil 
               <br />
               servants receive substantial salaries, I also know 
               <br />
               that the great majority of them are receiving 
               <br />
               hardly sufﬁcient to keep body and soul together. 
               <br />
