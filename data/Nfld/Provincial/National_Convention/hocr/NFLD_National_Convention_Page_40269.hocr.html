               to show a surplus, and we are able to give instan- 
               <br />
               ces such as this, there is something wrong some- 
               <br />
               where. Why not put some of this surplus into

               Mr. Fudge The Committee made no reference 
               <br />
               to the recent contract for mail bags supplied to 
               <br />
               the Department of Posts and Telegraphs by, I 
               <br />
               understand, a Canadian firm. According to 
               <br />
               rumours this contract was valued at $75,000. I 
               <br />
               think we should ﬁnd out the facts about this 
               <br />
               rumour. If it is correct, then why are local sail- 
               <br />
               makers here in the city of St. John’s left out?.... 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">...,It</span> may be that in Canada they 
               <br />
               turn out these mailbags by the millions, and they 
               <br />
               can be imported at very great savings. I don’t 
               <br />
               know, but unless it is a very considerable saving, 
               <br />
               I don’t see why the order could not be placed with 
               <br />
               a local sailmaker. But I do know that as far back 
               <br />
               as I can remember the mailbags have been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">im&lt;</span> 
               <br />
               ported. I remember there was a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terriﬁc</span> uproar, 10 
               <br />
               or 15 or maybe 18 years ago, when it was learned 
               <br />
               that the mailbags, hampers, etc., had been made 
               <br />
               by prison labour in Canada or the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States...</span> I am 
               <br />
               not protectionist by any means, but in a matter 
               <br />
               like this the whole thing is relatively small, and 
               <br />
               the difference on $75,000 is not going to be so

               the Committee did not take it up. The report of

               the Committee was mimeographed and tabled in

               matter of fact it was brought up by me personally.

               Mr. Reddy If a local company is able to do the

               wish to concur with the previous speakers about 
               <br />

               employed does not get any salary at all. That’s a 
               <br />
               shade worse. I go on record as protesting against 
               <br />
               those low salaries. 
               <br />
               Mr. Bailey I hardly know where to begin in this 
               <br />
               thing here. I was not aware of the fact that mail~ 
               <br />
               bags are being imported from Canada, or else I 
               <br />
               certainly would have dug into it. I believe one 
               <br />
               time in this country mailbags were made in our 
               <br />
               own penitentiary. I don’t think those things 
               <br />
               should be allowed whatever the saving. That is 
               <br />
               not what I got to my feet to speak about, however. 
               <br />
               I want to stand alongside Rev. Mr. Hurry in 
               <br />
               the matter of the service given to the country. I 
               <br />
               believe, in fact I am sure, that never in our history 
               <br />
               has this country had the equipment that was fit 
               <br />
               for the country that we are in, thatcould save lives 
               <br />
               and give us <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">service...</span> If we had a government that 
               <br />
               had been removed a little from the ox-cart age, 
               <br />
               this was a time when we could have got ﬂying 
               <br />
               boats that could have handled our mail system on 
               <br />
               the Labrador in a matter of hours, and boats that 
               <br />
               would be on hand in case of sickness in any part 
               <br />
               of the island where a case wanted to be rushed to 
               <br />
               the hospital and when there is ice we could 
               <br />
               have amphibian planes. I did not intend to bring 
               <br />
               this up until the matter of health and welfare came 
               <br />
               in. Somebody would say it is a big expense, but 
               <br />
               it is not as big an expense as a cottage hospital, 
               <br />
               and we could save <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lives...,</span> I believe that when the 
               <br />
               war was over and those ﬂying boats that I spoke 
               <br />
               about were scrapped we could have had two or 
               <br />
               three of those for practically nothing, and 
               <br />
               amongst our airforce boys we had plenty of good 
               <br />
               pilots. The Labrador could have been looked 
               <br />
               after, whereas now it takes six to eight months to 
               <br />
               get a letter, and I know what that means. There is 
               <br />
               not much that we can say today except to draw 
               <br />
               their attention to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it...</span> There is plenty of work for 
               <br />
               50 of these ﬂying boats, mail, freight, and mercy 
               <br />
               trips, and in places where men have to be moved 
               <br />
               from one part of the island to another, I think 
               <br />
               those boats would pay without any cost to the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> I believe in this way our posts and 
               <br />
               telegraphs service could be extended, and that 
               <br />
               our hospitals could be extended and brought to 
               <br />
               the doors of the people... 
               <br />
               Mr. Newell Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that a 
               <br />
               discussion of this report would be utterly incom-

               plete if we allowed it to pass from our hands 
               <br />
               without making some attempt to correlate the 
               <br />
               various sections of the report. Perhaps self-
