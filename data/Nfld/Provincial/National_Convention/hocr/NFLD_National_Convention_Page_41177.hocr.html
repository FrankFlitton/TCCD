               a list of what kind of taxes it can be raised from.

               loses income and corporation taxes and succes—

               <br />

               Now, Mr. Chairman, I well remember the night 
               <br />
               session at which this particular clause was read 
               <br />
               and explained. The House was in a good humour 
               <br />
               for a change, and there was a lot of joking and 
               <br />
               fun generally about this representation, and who 
               <br />
               were going to be or could be senators and so on. 
               <br />
               Now, sir, I did not find that discussion in the least 
               <br />
               bit funny, when I considered that Newfoundland 
               <br />
               as the tenth and last province would be repre- 
               <br />
               sented in the Dominion parliament by seven 
               <br />
               members out of 265, and in the Senate by six 
               <br />
               members out of 96. I confess it did seem like a 
               <br />
               joke, but the ldnd where the other fellow has the 
               <br />
               laugh. Why, we could not be much worse off if 
               <br />
               we had no representation. How far would we get? 
               <br />
               How often would our voice be heard? To bolster 
               <br />
               the position, pro-confederates cite a possible 
               <br />
               union of Maritime Provinces. It will never come 
               <br />
               in our lifetime, probably never come, as long as 
               <br />
               Quebec and Ontario look upon such a union as a 
               <br />
               possible threat to their sway.
