               Mr. Chairman Well, I interpret that section to 
               <br />
               mean, “Will be entitled for six months from the 
               <br />
               date of union, or six months from the date of 
               <br />

               Mr. Hickman Mr. Chairman, I think this is 
               <br />
               rather important, if there were a lot of factories 
               <br />
               closed down and several thousand or hundred 
               <br />
               people were laid off. It should be clearly laid 
               <br />
               down what they would receive, so i think we 
               <br />
               should get that point cleared up.

               <br />
               particular clause was inserted with the idea that 
               <br />

               lose their employment within six months, are 
               <br />
               entitled to have six months insurance. There is no
