               <br />
               group, or a West Indies group, but you don’t have 
               <br />

               Mr. Smallwood If you had codfish to export to 
               <br />
               three or four markets you would have to join the 
               <br />
               three or four groups, and pay $1,000 to each of 
               <br />
               them, unless you are marketing it all to the one 
               <br />
               agent and then that agent would pay to all groups, 
               <br />
               is that it? Suppose Mr. Crosbie wanted to get a 
               <br />
               lot of co-Operative societies operating, all ﬁsh 
               <br />
               producers. What is the obstacle, if any, to their 
               <br />
               being able to export their own ﬁsh? Has each 
               <br />
               society got to join each group, and pay $1,000 to 
               <br />
               each group? Or is it $1,000 to belong to the Salt 
               <br />
               Codﬁsh Association? Can you explain that? 
               <br />
               Mr. Crosbie You have to pay $1,000 to belong 
               <br />
               to each group. That’s a deposit. You don‘t have 
               <br />
               to put it up every season. The past several years 
               <br />
               the return to the country has been high, and that’s 
               <br />
               the only way you can control it. You can’t set up 
               <br />
               a service to inspect all the people. There has to be 
               <br />
               some control somewhere. I may belong to one 
               <br />
               group and pay $1,000, and there is nothing 
               <br />
               against Mr. Bradley saying to me, “Well now 
               <br />
               Chesley, will you ship out this for me?” And I 
               <br />
               would do so; or someone else may belong to

               can get a license to pack for export, or he can

               become an exporter himself if he wants to.

               past few years codﬁsh has been scarce and has 
               <br />
               been on allocation. Therefore it is natural that the

               countries that have been in the habit in the past 
               <br />

               of fish, more than our regular customers require, 
               <br />
               that’s the time we want to get these new markets 
               <br />
               opened up, and there will be no trouble for a

               person to arrange that through some exporter who 
               <br />
               already has a license. My suggestion to Mr.

               Northcott would be to contact some exporter so

               <br />
               for the last couple of years that one of the big 
               <br />
               reasons why the fishermen are so much in favour 
               <br />
               of the Commission system of government is that 
               <br />
               in the spring of the year, before they have 
               <br />
               launched their boats, before they have taken the 
               <br />
               cod out of the water at all, they know what the 
               <br />
               price of ﬁsh is going to be the rest of the year, that 
               <br />
               sometime in the winter or the spring it is an-

               the rest of the year is going to be such and such. 
               <br />
               That’s been going on for the last two or three

               <br />
               up to the fall, and Christmas, and perhaps the 
               <br />
               middle of the winter, before they found out the
