               Mr. Smallwood When Mr. Hollett made his

               Mr. Chairman ....If you direct to me any re-

               Mr. Cashin Mr. Chairman, this does not come 
               <br />
               as any great surprise to me. This is not an attack 
               <br />
               on me; not an attack on the Finance Committee; 
               <br />
               it is an attack on the country, and I resent the 
               <br />
               whole thing. There has been a brazen, brutal 
               <br />
               attack on the economy of Newfoundland, and on 
               <br />
               Newfoundland itself. As only one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span>

               no greater danger than she is at the present time. 
               <br />
               I may say thatI am not prepared to tolerate it any
