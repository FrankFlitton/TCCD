               <br />
               man become a convert to the present 
               <br />
               government’s reconstruction policy? The day 
               <br />
               that this Convention Opened, every member here 
               <br />
               was presented with what was called “A Proposed 
               <br />
               Reconstruction Programme", every year for ten 
               <br />
               years. We remember Mr. Wild, Commissioner 
               <br />
               for Finance and Customs. Major Cashin brought 
               <br />
               in a resolution, and we adopted it, and Mr. Wild 
               <br />
               came up to a private session of the Convention 
               <br />
               and he was asked a question about this 
               <br />
               reconstruction programme —— $59 million or $60 
               <br />
               million dollars for ten years. “Where do you 
               <br />
               propose to get the money for that?" Every mem- 
               <br />
               ber remembers what he said: “Oh that’s just a 
               <br />
               programme that we think should be carried out, 
               <br />
               provided the money were there to carry it out 
               <br />
               with". I doubt if there is one member in this 
               <br />
               Convention who would take that reconstruction 
               <br />
               programme and agree with it. Out of$60 million 
               <br />
               how much did they propose to spend on the 
               <br />
               ﬁshery? $1 million wasn’t it? On roads I think it 
               <br />
               was $12 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million,</span> There is not a man who agrees 
               <br />
               with the government’s reconstruction 
               <br />
               programme, and Mr. Hickman does not agree any 
               <br />
               more than I do. But now he comes to the debate, 
               <br />
               and it is a different story: $2.5 million you have 
               <br />
               to spend on the govemment’s reconstruction 
               <br />
               programme. It is very convenient to use it al~ 
               <br />
               though he did not agree with it. I apologise for 
               <br />
               being so long, but 1 will come back to it later.

               total expenditure of the provincial government 
               <br />
               for the ﬁrst four years of union would be $151 
               <br />
               million a year, and for the next four years it would 
               <br />
               be $15.5 million or $15.6 million a year, and 
               <br />
               Mr. Hickman claims that it is $2-3 million shon; 
               <br />
               but my answer is this: it is not short, that these 
               <br />
               dollars that he claims should be added on will be 
               <br />
               spent all right, and probably should be spent, as 
               <br />
               this country has not got enough public services. 
               <br />
               We know that, and spending $l5 million a year 
               <br />
               for the first four years, and $l5.5 million for the 
               <br />
               next four years would not create any new services 
               <br />
               at all. I would ask you to take notice that 
               <br />
               provision is made, in these fouryears, for the cost 
               <br />
               of up~keeping new services that we have not got 
               <br />
               now, but those amounts do not cover the cost of 
               <br />
               putting the new services there. But Mr. Hickman 
               <br />
               claims that the cost of creating these new services 
               <br />
               should be shown in the new cost of government 
               <br />
               on the ordinary account <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">side,</span> I hold the exact 
               <br />
               opposite. We need more schools in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> 
               <br />
               foundland; a lot ofschools that we have now need 
               <br />
               to be repaired and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">improved.</span> We need new roads 
               <br />
               and a lot of new services: new hospitals. and a 
               <br />
               numberofnew things. which ifwe are to get them 
               <br />
               at all will have to be got by the provincial govem- 
               <br />
               ment. Some will be gotten by the federal govem- 
               <br />
               ment: bait depots, etc., would come under them, 
               <br />
               but under the provincial government a number of 
               <br />
               new services have to be got. I admit that, and 1 
               <br />
               hold that the ordinary expenditure of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment year by year should cover the cost of keep- 
               <br />
               ing up any public services we have. but the cost 
               <br />
               of new public services —— roads, hospitals, 
               <br />
               schools -—— should not, and does not need to be 
               <br />
               included in ordinary expenditure. They should be 
               <br />
               on extraordinary, special, capital, reconstruction, 
               <br />
               or whatever you like to call it; and for that we 
               <br />
               have money to do thejob. We have $28 million; 
               <br />
               when this ﬁscal year is over we may have $30 
               <br />
               million, which we can put on deposit and draw 
               <br />
               interest on it, and draw out of that sum some 
               <br />
               amount each year to build new schools, new 
               <br />
               roads, new hospitals, and new public services. 
               <br />
               That is what that money would be for, and the 
               <br />
               amount that you would draw out every year to 
               <br />
               spend on capital account should be decided by 
               <br />
               the general conditions of the country. In other 
               <br />
               words, you should time your spending. Now it’s 
               <br />
               been held, and i think rightly, that one mistake 
               <br />
               that our present government is making is to be
