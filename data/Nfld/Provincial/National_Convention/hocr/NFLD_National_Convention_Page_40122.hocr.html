               we are going, and are inclined to drift. This 
               <br />
               certainly applies to the question now being dis- 
               <br />
               cussed. To my mind we must establish certain 
               <br />
               things fII‘SL One of these is whether or not the 
               <br />
               Convention can, and if so, will, discuss this point 
               <br />
               has not been continued beyond any doubt. If the 
               <br />
               answer is no, then let’s put it in the attic; if yes, 
               <br />
               then we might as well recognise it as part of our 
               <br />
               work and drop the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parley,</span> The possible forms of 
               <br />
               government to be discussed should be listed, and 
               <br />
               this should have been done long ago. In this 
               <br />
               respect I claim we are drifting. By not doing this 
               <br />
               we rest on the haphazard manner of having the 
               <br />
               issues introduced by ardent supporters — would- 
               <br />
               be leaders - who in their turn win the an- 
               <br />
               tagonism of the proponents and would-be leaders 
               <br />
               of some other form, and so we get a succession 
               <br />
               of blind rushes accompanied by invective which 
               <br />
               is unnecessary here. Surely we can discuss this 
               <br />
               matter without adopting the low methods of at- 
               <br />
               tack resorted to by some delegates. I have heard 
               <br />
               it said and read in both the local and foreign press, 
               <br />
               that Newfoundland, and the world, looks to the 
               <br />
               men of the National Convention to supply at least 
               <br />
               in part material for future governments. How 
               <br />
               disappointing it is then, and sad, to hear these men 
               <br />
               fall back on low methods of attack. Surely it is a 
               <br />
               poor recommendation for local autonomy. Fur- 
               <br />
               ther still, these blind rushes show always a lenien~ 
               <br />
               cy towards some particular form of government 
               <br />
               desired by the speaker, as well as a move to crush 
               <br />
               any contrary opinion. This is a deﬁnite shortcom- 
               <br />
               ing. I and others like me, would be content to hear 
               <br />
               propositions from all the major powers, England, 
               <br />
               Canada, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">etc..,,</span> Yet there are those so conﬁrmed 
               <br />
               in their opinion that they would narrow the ﬁeld 
               <br />
               of survey. Had we not then better end this Con— 
               <br />
               vention in view of the predominance of this con- 
               <br />
               ﬁrmed opinion? No, we had better go right on 
               <br />
               with our programme, because sitting before me 
               <br />
               are delegates willing to give a fair hearing to all 
               <br />
               issues To these delegates, and I hold it an honour 
               <br />
               to be one of them, I say stand ﬁrm. Not through 
               <br />
               high oratory or low invective is the real issue 
               <br />
               found, but rather in the cool calculated decisions 
               <br />
               I know you are so capable of making. Mr. Job, 
               <br />
               speaking to an earlier meeting and referring to the 
               <br />
               St. John’s merchants, said the old suspicion still 
               <br />
               exists. I will, if I may, make a similar remark 
               <br />
               about the outport members... We read in the 
               <br />
               press and hear in everyday conversation how 
               <br />

               these outport men are being talked over, yea 
               <br />
               bought over, by the would-be leaders. Since this 
               <br />
               opinion has been stated on the ﬂoor of the house 
               <br />
               I deem it-my unpleasant duty to tell any delegates 
               <br />
               who might have short—sighted opinions of the 
               <br />
               outport men, that these men are here with a 
               <br />
               knowledge born of realism; that they are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New.</span> 
               <br />
               foundlanders and have just as much patriotism as

               any member here.

               As I have said, these discussions disclose a 
               <br />
               leniency towards whichever form of government 
               <br />
               a particular speaker closely guards as his secret, 
               <br />
               or, as in some cases, openly declares as his plat- 
               <br />
               form, both to my mind equally harmful. We have 
               <br />
               as a result a wall of suspicion and jealousy build- 
               <br />
               ing up, so much so that name-calling is just 
               <br />
               around the comer, so that the question is not 
               <br />
               discussed, but rather the personalities behind the 
               <br />
               question. I fear that our decisions will not be in 
               <br />
               the best interest of Newfoundland. We have in 
               <br />
               this Convention no Hitlers, no Quislings, no 
               <br />
               Judases, nor do we expect to give to the world a 
               <br />
               new demon or God. Why then discuss per- 
               <br />
               sonalities? Why stand on that philosophical 
               <br />
               pedestal on which some members try so hard to 
               <br />
               balance? There have been instances in the world 
               <br />
               of some born philosophers, but they have been 
               <br />
               rare. Let’s be content with the fact that we are a 
               <br />
               bunch of ordinary Newfoundlanders....

               Mr. Hickman Mr. Chairman, I have been lis- 
               <br />
               tening with considerable interest to these addres- 
               <br />
               ses of yesterday and today, and I have given quite 
               <br />
               a lot of thought to this question, as it is one of the 
               <br />
               most important to come before us up to now. I 
               <br />
               think from what I can gather that the majority of 
               <br />
               the members here, perhaps all of them, are in 
               <br />
               favour of the motion as put by Mr. Smallwood. I 
               <br />
               myself subscribe to the motion, but I cannot 
               <br />
               subscribe to the immediate rush of having this 
               <br />
               submitted at the present time. Some people want 
               <br />
               the Convention to be ﬁnished before Christmas, 
               <br />
               some ﬁnished by January, and there must be an 
               <br />
               election, according to Mr. Smallwood by May. 
               <br />
               This job is probably one of the most important in 
               <br />
               the history of the country, and the few months or 
               <br />
               a year we may take to thoroughly go into this 
               <br />
               question and arrive at a conclusion should not 
               <br />
               interfere. It may be for the benefit of the people 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland for the next 100 years or more, 
               <br />
               and what’s a year in that? I think we are rushing 
               <br />
               too <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">much.,..</span> I have a feeling that even the reports
