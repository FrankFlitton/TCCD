               most of their monopolistic profits go promptly

               <br />
               proﬁts. If confederation did nothing else but

               smash these monopolies and restore freedom of

               Sir, what I have said on this point, I have said

               Itell you frankly, Mr. Chairman, I am growing 
               <br />
               frightened by the growth of monopoly in this 
               <br />
               country; I am growing frightened by the growth 
               <br />
               of concentrated wealth. It is a frightening thing 
               <br />
               to see in a tiny country with a tiny handful of 
               <br />
               struggling people, the rise of a new millionaire 
               <br />
               class. This little country is not big enough for 
               <br />
               millionaires. They become too powerful, too 
               <br />
               strong, too influential. They swing too big a stick. 
               <br />
               If they were spread out in a country ten times 
               <br />
               larger, they could not make their inﬂuence so 
               <br />
               strongly felt. But they are not, they are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con«</span> 
               <br />
               centrated in a very small country, and most of 
               <br />
               them do business within a mile of each other. I 
               <br />
               have nothing in the world against any of these 
               <br />
               men personally. I know most of them and for 
               <br />
               some of them I have genuine liking and respect. 
               <br />
               They do not mean to hurt the country, indeed that 
               <br />
               would be the last thing in their minds. But just the 
               <br />

               <br />

               millionaires who are merely traders — and worst

               <br />
               shocking proﬁts made in this country in the year 
               <br />
               1945. I mentioned that year, because it happened 
               <br />
               to be the latest year for which we had the ofﬁcial 
               <br />
               ﬁgures, given to us by no less a person than the 
               <br />
               Assessor of Taxes. His ﬁgures showed us that 
               <br />
               105 concerns between them made a clean, clear 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               in this little <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> But that was only one year. 
               <br />
               In 1946 they made even more. In 1947 it was 
               <br />
               roughly about the same. Since the war broke out,

               ﬁrms have cleaned up, between them, not less
