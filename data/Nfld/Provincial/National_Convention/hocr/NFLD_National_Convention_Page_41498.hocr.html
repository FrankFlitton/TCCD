               <br />

               before, and I am inclined to accept this latter

               Now let us consider personal income taxes. 
               <br />
               This is, I admit, a more difﬁcult question. The 
               <br />
               only way by which I could arrive at any 
               <br />
               reasonable estimate in regard to income tax was 
               <br />
               to apply the Canadian income groups to similar 
               <br />
               income groups in this country. For the year 1945 
               <br />
               the average Canadian income tax in the income 
               <br />
               group earning less than $2,000 as applied to the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland taxpayer will amount to 
               <br />
               $386,138. The income groups earning between 
               <br />
               $2,000 and $3,000 will pay $620,527; between 
               <br />
               $3,000 and $5,000, $996,425; between $5,000 
               <br />
               and $10,000, $1,561,014; between $10,000 and 
               <br />
               $30,000, $2,003,625; over $30,000 the amount 
               <br />
               will be $1,239,120. A total of $6,806,849. These 
               <br />
               ﬁgures are based on the average tax collected in 
               <br />
               each income group on the estimated totals for the 
               <br />
               year 1945 and are taken from the Canadian 
               <br />
               government ofﬁcial publication. Only 2.82% of 
               <br />
               our population are estimated to be income tax- 
               <br />
               payers for the year 1945, and this number will be 
               <br />
               considerably increased, probably doubled under 
               <br />
               the Canadian tax law. The exemptions will be 
               <br />
               reduced from $1,000 to $750 for single persons 
               <br />
               and from $2,000 to $1,500 for married taxpayers, 
               <br />
               and this will result, in my opinion, in increasing 
               <br />
               the total number of taxpayers in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               to 18,000 persons. In concluding these remarks 
               <br />
               in respect to taxes I want to point out that if we 
               <br />
               took the total Canadian revenues from taxation 
               <br />
               for the year 1946, which amounted to $176.18 per 
               <br />
               head, and applied it to Newfoundland‘s popula- 
               <br />
               tion we get a figure of $56,377,600.

               Now sir, I want to make a few remarks about

               <br />
               will not be of much use to Newfoundland. The

               majority of Newfoundlanders are employed at

               <br />

               <br />
               brought under the provisions of the Act within the 
               <br />
               next few months. Section 86 of the Act provides 
               <br />
               for the extension of the Act and also allows for 
               <br />
               the limiting of this extension to areas as 
               <br />
               prescribed by the Unemployment Commission as 
               <br />
               an insurance area; this does not mean that if the 
               <br />
               Act is extended to embrace all or any of the 
               <br />
               classiﬁcations of employment not now covered

               that these classiﬁcations would be extended to 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. No, for example, stevedoring in 
               <br />
               the City of Halifax could be included and brought 
               <br />
               under the provisions of the Act and the cities of 
               <br />
               St. John’s and Montreal could be left out. It 
               <br />
               depends upon the regularity of employment in 
               <br />
               any classiﬁcation of work as to whether or not an 
               <br />
               area would be prescribed as an insurance area. It 
               <br />
               appears to me that if the Act were to be extended 
               <br />
               to cover most of the present exceptions that it

               workers in respect to the terms? I agree, Mr.

               Chairman, that the Railway workers will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of»</span>

               <br />
               this mean? It means this — as the employees of 
               <br />
               both CNR and the Newfoundland Railway work

               ments, the continuity of service of both these

               railways are governed by the rules set forth in

               these agreements which are very similar in their 
               <br />

               <br />
               necessary would be to give the required notice as

               set out in the working agreement covering the

               various classifications of workers, and
