               In View of this, it is seen that under these 
               <br />
               proposed terms of union that $10 million of this 
               <br />
               accumulated surplus at the time of union shall be 
               <br />
               set aside either in trust or on deposit with the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada at Newfoundland’s op- 
               <br />
               tion, withdrawable by the Newfoundland govem- 
               <br />
               ment as required, only for expenditures on 
               <br />
               current account. Therefore $20 million of this 
               <br />
               surplus remains. Nearly $10 million of this 
               <br />
               money is now to our credit in London in the form 
               <br />
               of interest—free loans to the United Kingdom 
               <br />
               government, and therefore it will become neces- 
               <br />
               sary to convert this money to dollar currency, and 
               <br />
               no provision has been made for this in the 
               <br />
               proposals now before us. Mr. Smallwood tells us 
               <br />
               in an offhand way that he feels conﬁdent that it 
               <br />
               can be arranged. The Canadian government does 
               <br />
               not undertake to do this, either in the Black Books 
               <br />
               or the Grey Book. We therefore, under these 
               <br />
               arrangements find ourselves in the position 
               <br />
               where $10 million has to be set aside in trust for 
               <br />
               current expenditures and another $10 million is 
               <br />
               located in England, and no undertaking to con- 
               <br />
               vert it to dollars. Therefore, there is only another 
               <br />
               $10 million available. Now, of this latter $10 
               <br />
               million, at least $6 million will be necessary for 
               <br />
               the purpose of payment of ﬁsh this past year; so 
               <br />
               out of all our surplus there will remain only $4 
               <br />
               million available in actual dollar currency for 
               <br />
               purposes of capital expenditure. This means that 
               <br />
               $16 million of our surpluses is now held in ster- 
               <br />
               ling and there is no indication when it will be 
               <br />
               converted into dollars. 1 would like to know how 
               <br />
               much money has been paid for the conversion of 
               <br />
               sterling as payments for ﬁsh, particularly in View 
               <br />
               of the fact that in recent weeks the government 
               <br />
               has made available to Italy considerable money, 
               <br />
               and it would have been necessary for us to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               dollar currency for Italian ﬁsh. These are matters 
               <br />
               one can only get if in contact with the government 
               <br />
               daily. We all know the difﬁculties that the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">me</span> having with regard to 
               <br />
               dollar currency, but even despite the shortage in 
               <br />
               Great Britain of American dollars, they have 
               <br />
               been compelled to help Canada with American 
               <br />
               dollars during the past 12 months, and when Mr. 
               <br />
               Dalton was Chancellor of the Exchequer, he 
               <br />
               made a public pronouncement to the effect that 
               <br />

               Canada was in just as great a need of American 
               <br />
               dollars as Great Britain. However, Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood may have something up his sleeve in 
               <br />
               this respect, for if we follow his explanations of 
               <br />
               all these matters we must conclude that he has 
               <br />
               been appointed the representative of the 
               <br />
               Canadian government as well as the Commission 
               <br />
               government. However, I feel certain that any 
               <br />
               such statements made by Mr. Smallwood have 
               <br />
               been based purely on personal opinions, and that 
               <br />
               he has no foundation in fact for any of these wild 
               <br />
               statements he has been making.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Then again, I am forced to refer to the present 
               <br />
               serious ﬁnancial predicament in which Canada 
               <br />
               finds herself. It is only a couple of months ago, 
               <br />
               whilst Prime Minister King was on an ofﬁcial 
               <br />
               visit to England, that serious steps had to be taken 
               <br />
               by the Canadian government to deal with the 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial position. As a matter of fact, unprece- 
               <br />
               dented steps were taken. These were the restric- 
               <br />
               tions of the purchase by Canadians of a long list 
               <br />
               of consumer goods from the United States. In 
               <br />
               addition, extra taxation had to be placed upon 
               <br />
               consumer goods at home and all this was done by 
               <br />
               minute of council. Now it is well known that 
               <br />
               under British procedure, no taxation can be legis— 
               <br />
               lated for by minute of council. Such legislation 
               <br />
               must be passed by Parliament. We had it happen 
               <br />
               here over 50 years ago — an incident whereby a 
               <br />
               certain gentleman who was in public life went 
               <br />
               down on the wharf and took goods off it because 
               <br />
               the budget had not been passed and he got away 
               <br />
               without paying any duty. Some of their relatives 
               <br />
               occupy high positions in the present set-up of our 
               <br />
               civil service. However, I ran into conﬂict before, 
               <br />
               and I do not want to do it again. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               As I said a moment ago, the situation was so 
               <br />
               serious that this present austerity programme was 
               <br />
               instituted by the Canadian cabinet and at the 
               <br />
               present time it is being fought bitterly in the 
               <br />
               Canadian House of Commons. Canada had ap- 
               <br />
               plied many months ago for a loan of $800,000 in 
               <br />
               the United States and was forced to accept a 
               <br />
               temporary loan of but $300,000. In addition, the 
               <br />
               Canadian National Railway, which is seeking a 
               <br />
               loan of some $60 million from the public, has 
               <br />
               been forced to withdraw the application for such 
               <br />
               loan temporarily because underwriters’ offers 
               <br />
               were unsatisfactory, according to reliable reports. 
               <br />
               In view therefore of these known facts, how are 
               <br />
               we to expect the Canadian government to be in a
