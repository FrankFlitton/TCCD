               surely as the cost of living falls, the standard of

               Mr. Chairman, those two reasons would be 
               <br />
               plenty to justify confederation: namely that it 
               <br />
               would bring down the cost of living, and bring 
               <br />
               down taxation, and make taxation more just and 
               <br />
               more fair. But there are many other reasons why 
               <br />
               confederation would be good for our people, 
               <br />
               especially the toiling masses amongst our people. 
               <br />
               They may call family allowances immoral if they 
               <br />
               like, but I for one cannot see anything immoral 
               <br />
               about a plan to pay cash allowances to every child 
               <br />
               under 16 in the country. I cannot see anything 
               <br />
               immoral in sending a cheque every month of the 
               <br />
               year into every home that has children under the 
               <br />
               age of 16. I can see how it would be immoral to 
               <br />
               deprive our children of the chance to beneﬁt from 
               <br />
               family allowances, but I fail completely to see 
               <br />
               how any man can stand here in this chamber and 
               <br />
               say that it is immoral to protect a country’s most 
               <br />
               precious heritage, her children. We have been 
               <br />
               told that we have in Newfoundland 120,000 
               <br />
               children under the age of 16. That is more than 
               <br />
               one-third of our whole population. I can think of 
               <br />
               nothing better, nothing more Christian than to see 
               <br />
               that these future citizens are guaranteed every 
               <br />
               month of the year at least enough to eat, and that 
               <br />
               is exactly what confederation will do through 
               <br />
               family allowances. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               If they call family allowances immoral, why 
               <br />
               don’t they call old age pensions immoral as well? 
               <br />
               If it is immoral to pay allowances to all our 
               <br />
               children under 16, isn’t it just as immoral to pay 
               <br />
               allowances to womout toilers who have reached 
               <br />
               the age of 70? We have 10,000 old people who 
               <br />
               will receive that $30 a month if we become part 
               <br />
               of Canada. Why don’t they get up here and call 
               <br />
               that immoral? They can call these things im- 
               <br />
               moral, butI know that our people, and what they 
               <br />
               are going to call the man who calls these things 
               <br />
               immoral. It won’t be complimentary.

               A great effort was made here to try to make it look

               as though confederation was too hard a thing for 
               <br />

               <br />
               this are banking on something that will not stand 
               <br />
               up. Our people are not what some persons think. 
               <br />
               They have gathered around their radios in their 
               <br />
               thousands, all around the country. They have 
               <br />
               studied this thing, and understand it far more than 
               <br />
               some people realise. You will see how rightI am, 
               <br />
               sir, when the votes are counted in the referendum. 
               <br />
               In common fair play, Mr. Chairman, con- 
               <br />
               federation must be placed on the ballot. Our 
               <br />
               people must have the chance to vote for or against 
               <br />
               confederation. The choice must be theirs. It 
               <br />
               would be a criminal and shameful thing if this 
               <br />
               Convention voted against letting the people 
               <br />
               decide. I know that a majority of the members 
               <br />
               here are against confederation. Well, that is their 
               <br />
               right. They have a right to be against confedera- 
               <br />
               tion, but they have no right to deny the people 
               <br />
               their chance to pass judgement on it in the 
               <br />
               referendum. Some members may be quite care— 
               <br />
               less of what the people think of them. Some may 
               <br />
               even be carried away with the fact that here in 
               <br />
               this Convention they happen to be lined up with 
               <br />
               a majority, but this Convention will soon be a 
               <br />
               thing of the past, and then that majority will be a 
               <br />
               thing of the past. Members would be short sighted 
               <br />
               indeed to defy the people just for the sake of 
               <br />
               pleasing the majority here in the Convention. 
               <br />
               Mr. Higgins I wonder, Mr. Chairman, if we 
               <br />
               might have a recess for ﬁve or ten minutes? 
               <br />
               Mr. Banfield I have only one minute, and if you 
               <br />
               will not mind waiting that long, I will be through. 
               <br />
               Newfoundland cannot stand alone, all our his- 
               <br />
               tory proves that. We need someone at our back. 
               <br />
               We need a strong partner. We cannot and dare not 
               <br />
               face the ﬁght on our own. That great and wealthy 
               <br />
               nation, Canada, invites us to go into partnership 
               <br />
               with them. They hold out their helping hand. Our 
               <br />
               people would want to grasp that hand. Let us give 
               <br />
               them the chance to do so in the referendum. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman We will take a brief recess. I 
               <br />
               wonder Major Cashin, in the meantime, if I could
