               Mr. Penney i did not think you would. I have 
               <br />
               been listening to the debate this last several days, 
               <br />
               and the impression I have is that Newfoundland 
               <br />
               has not got proper protection in the agreement. 
               <br />
               The Grand Falls of Labrador is situated in the 
               <br />
               heart of unexplored territory believed to contain 
               <br />
               precious mineral deposits as well as timber areas, 
               <br />
               and is therefore the key to future development.
