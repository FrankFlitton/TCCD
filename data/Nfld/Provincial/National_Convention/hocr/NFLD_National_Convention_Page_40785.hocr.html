               it lays a foundation for more serious departures 
               <br />
               than in the past. We’ll have to remember this, that 
               <br />
               this Convention is constituted by legislation of 
               <br />
               the Commission of Government. Now the func-

               tions and duties of this Convention are set forth 
               <br />
               in section 3 of the act, and they are of a three—fold 
               <br />
               character. Any is not to be referred to unless of 
               <br />
               course it is incorporated by reference into the act 
               <br />
               constituting this Convention. You have to under- 
               <br />
               stand, your functions and duties and your liber- 
               <br />

               <br />
               3. Therefore, if you can read in the Letters Patent

               suspending our free political institutions, if you 
               <br />

               Mr. Miller ....I intend to conﬁne my remarks to

               the economy of the country and to the survey 
               <br />
               made by Lord Amulree at that period. And to 
               <br />
               draw comparisons if I may with our present 
               <br />

               Mr. Chairman If you don’t mind, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Miller, I 
               <br />
               would prefer if you would deal with the condition 
               <br />
               of things as Amulree found them. And deal with 
               <br />
               our present position if you don’t mind. If you 
               <br />
               would disassociate the Amulree report with any- 
               <br />
               thing you have to say then as far as I am con- 
               <br />
               cemed it is wide open. 
               <br />
               Mr. Miller Well, turning to this Amulree Report 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd such passages as this: “The broad facts 
               <br />
               of the ﬁnancial position in Newfoundland are 
               <br />
               unfortunately all too plain. Ever since the war 
               <br />
               period the country has been living beyond its 
               <br />
               means. The Island is now in extreme ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               difﬁculty.” That is about our ﬁnances and our 
               <br />
               economics at that period. Now our Economic 
               <br />
               Report presents a budget, and a loud clamour is 
               <br />
               raised that its proposed expenditures are too high. 
               <br />
               We want more for this and more for that. We want 
               <br />
               to repeat the mistakes of the 1920s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> spend our 
               <br />
               surplus and have nothing for the rainy day. And 
               <br />
               yet in the same breath they claim that three years 
               <br />
               is not enough to look ahead — it must be 20, 50 
               <br />
               years, what fantastic reasoning...

               And so submitting these passages from the 
               <br />
               Amulree Report, I expect to ﬁnd comparative 
               <br />
               answers in our Economic Report on present day 
               <br />
               circumstances. On page 41 of the Economic 
               <br />
               Report, “all throughout our object has been to 
               <br />
               try and give that good a picture as we possibly 
               <br />
               can of the state of our country. Any ﬁgures used 
               <br />
               by us, in most cases, have already been submitted 
               <br />
               to the Convention in the various committees' 
               <br />
               reports and have received the approval of the 
               <br />
               delegates. And in some cases, where we do ex- 
               <br />
               pect opinions, we have taken care to have their 
               <br />
               correctness endorsed by those competent to do 
               <br />
               so." With these remarks for a background they 
               <br />
               continue on page 43, “Our present revenues 
               <br />
               therefore, are substantially solid in their structure 
               <br />
               and seem capable of carrying on without any 
               <br />
               serious decline. However, in estimating future 
               <br />
               revenue, we prefer to err on the conservative 
               <br />
               side.” From there it goes on to say that whereas 
               <br />
               present revenues have dropped at the $40 million 
               <br />
               mark, in their budget, they make allowances for 
               <br />
               a drop back to a normal ﬁgure, back to $30 
               <br />
               million. Dealing with the country’s capacity to 
               <br />
               maintain this greatly reduced ﬁgure, a step-by- 
               <br />
               step presentation of the position of our country's 
               <br />
               industries is submitted. And may I be again per- 
               <br />
               mitted to examine brieﬂy and comparejust a few 
               <br />
               with the ﬁndings of previous investigators? Min— 
               <br />
               ing — very conservatively the Amulree Report 
               <br />
               said, “In general it may be said that the pos- 
               <br />
               sibilities of mineral development in New- 
               <br />
               foundland have been by no means exhausted.” 
               <br />
               What does Chadwick and Jones say? Very dis- 
               <br />
               creetly they sum up, “it is not however possible, 
               <br />
               at this stage, to indicate what effects these 
               <br />
               developments may ultimately have on the econ-
