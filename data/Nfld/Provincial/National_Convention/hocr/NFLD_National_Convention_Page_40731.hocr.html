               The Newfoundland of the foreseeable future 
               <br />
               is far different from the Newfoundland of recent 
               <br />
               memory, such as in the years before the sad 
               <br />
               accident of war changed us from a relatively 
               <br />
               obscure island to a country of immense strategic 
               <br />
               importance to three friendly nations, and possibly 
               <br />
               to a fourth unfriendly one. As the Committee 
               <br />
               states, the war is over two years and our revenues 
               <br />
               continue to rise. Some of this may be due to the 
               <br />
               momentum of war expenditures, but allowing for 
               <br />
               a gradual recession, it is safe to conclude that it 
               <br />
               will be some time before the revenue sinks as low 
               <br />
               as the $30 million provided in the Committee’s 
               <br />
               estimates. Military and air bases are held by the 
               <br />
               richest and most powerful nation in the modern 
               <br />
               world, the USA; great airports in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               and Labrador are under our sovereignty; in 
               <br />
               Labrador, there is revealed mineral wealth for 
               <br />
               which the world is clamouring, so that the 
               <br />
               imagination is staggered by the fabulous prospect 
               <br />
               of industrial development that is in the offing for 
               <br />
               our northern dependency. 
               <br />

               This then is the Newfoundland that faces the 
               <br />
               future, be it foreseeable or veiled. I have made no 
               <br />
               mention of surpluses, or low per capita debts. 
               <br />
               Neither haveI made any mention of the splendid 
               <br />
               type of men and women who go to make up this 
               <br />
               country of Newfoundlanders, or of the forbears 
               <br />
               from whom they sprang. In 1855 this country was 
               <br />
               a wilderness, and when those same forbears took 
               <br />
               over the running of this primitive land, I don’t 
               <br />
               believe for a moment they bit off more than they 
               <br />
               could chew. In fact, I think it was a great pity that 
               <br />
               circumstances prevented them from taking a big- 
               <br />
               ger bite, a bite which is in the capacity of their 
               <br />
               descendants to take, the bite that includes the 
               <br />
               passing of the Statute of Westminster, by which 
               <br />
               Newfoundland could for the ﬁrst time in its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his»</span>

               I make this point to underscore the observa- 
               <br />
               tions made by the Committee on page 27 which 
               <br />
               refer to the “importance of steps being taken as 
               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. Reddy Mr. Chairman, I wish to add my 
               <br />
               word of praise and thanks to the gentlemen who 
               <br />
               prepared this excellent Economic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Report...</span> 
               <br />
               Brieﬂy, they tell me that at present we owe for 
               <br />
               loans approximately $60 million. Against this we 
               <br />
               have our savings, a total of$74 million. Insurance 
               <br />
               companies owe our policy holders $22 million, 
               <br />
               in addition to this there are another $3-4 million 
               <br />
               that people have in their homes, in the sock so to 
               <br />
               speak, so that our total cash is about $100 million, 
               <br />
               and then of course we have our other assets... A 
               <br />
               businessman who could present such a compara- 
               <br />
               tive showing would be considered very well off 
               <br />
               indeed.

               We are asked to try and determine to what 
               <br />
               extent the war has caused our prosperity. We 
               <br />
               know that wars bring on scarcity and high prices, 
               <br />
               and we have been affected like all countries, but 
               <br />
               it would take an economist of the highest order 
               <br />
               to go further than this. One expert will say that 
               <br />
               wars bring prosperity, and another expert will say 
               <br />
               that prosperity brings on wars, so which is the 
               <br />
               cause, and which is the effect?
