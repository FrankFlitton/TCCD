               Mr. Smallwood We did and it is worse than that. 
               <br />
               In 1944-45 they had a loss of $500,000. In 1945— 
               <br />
               46 they had a loss of $1 million, and in this year, 
               <br />
               which will end March 31, 1947, it will be $1.5 
               <br />
               million. The operating loss is deﬁnitely on the 
               <br />
               increase. It applies to railways all over the world. 
               <br />
               There is an upward trend in operating rates, the 
               <br />
               cost of coal, of supplies of all kinds. For example, 
               <br />
               the cost of coal has increased to the railway by 
               <br />
               100%. The cost of wages has increased, so the 
               <br />
               Railway informs us, by 70%. That does not mean 
               <br />
               a 70% increase in the pay of the railroaders, but 
               <br />
               the number of employees has had to be increased. 
               <br />
               The reason is that there are more trains of all 
               <br />
               kinds, more runs made, and more staff engaged 
               <br />
               to do more work and put in more time, and 
               <br />
               additional freight handlers here and along the 
               <br />
               line. More freight handlers are handling coastal 
               <br />
               boat freight, which in turn calls for more over- 
               <br />
               head staff at headquarters, accounting, auditing, 
               <br />
               etc. There was a time this year when the total 
               <br />
               number employed was 4,300. That was largely 
               <br />
               seasonal staff. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The loss jumped from $500,000 the year 
               <br />
               before last to $1 million last year and $1.5 million 
               <br />
               this year, and the reason is that the cost of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">operat»</span> 
               <br />
               ing is going up faster than their income is going 
               <br />
               up. That is a situation that applies to every rail- 
               <br />
               way in North America today, so the Railway 
               <br />
               informed me. There is not a railway in Canada or 
               <br />
               the States, I am told, that is today even meeting 
               <br />
               its operating costs. Our railway is doing the same 
               <br />
               thing and is going to do so even more in the future 
               <br />
               than it has done up to now.

               Mr. Hollett I just asked the question so that it 
               <br />
               might be brought to the attention of the public. I 
               <br />
               think some mention of that should be made in the

               Mr. Smallwood That is not in the report proper,

               General Manager of the Railway himself, signed 
               <br />

               thoroughly. He speaks of the mounting cost of 
               <br />
               supplies, coal, number of employees, etc. There 
               <br />
               was a small increase given to railway men, but it 
               <br />
               was mostly due to the increased number of men 
               <br />
               employed. It is only fair to say that on behalf of

               Mr. Smallwood No, sir, but for the 26 years that 
               <br />
               the government has been operating this Railway, 
               <br />
               which ended on the 31st of March last, the 
               <br />
               government has had to pay the Railway a total 
               <br />
               amount of $1 8,250,000. Now if you take that $18 
               <br />
               million that the government had to pay the Rail- 
               <br />
               way — ﬁrst of all to meet their losses and then to 
               <br />
               buy new equipment, and for capital and main- 
               <br />
               tenance account, and divide it by the 26 years it 
               <br />
               comes to an average of $702,000 a year. It is true 
               <br />
               that at the bottom of the next page we put it in 
               <br />
               round ﬁgures, but when we say that all the factors 
               <br />
               have been taken into consideration, we do not 
               <br />
               mean as a matter of accountancy — the customs 
               <br />
               duties, income tax paid by railwaymen, etc. We 
               <br />
               do not take it into account as a matter of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">book</span> 
               <br />
               keeping, but into consideration. The position is 
               <br />
               not quite as bad as it sounds. We know it is not a 
               <br />
               dead loss of $700,000. We have got the railway 
               <br />
               and the services performed, 4,000 men get their 
               <br />
               living and they pay income tax, which does help 
               <br />
               the revenue. But I fail completely to understand 
               <br />
               Mr. Job. Does he really mean that we ought to 
               <br />
               have found out exactly how much income tax is 
               <br />
               paid to the government by railroaders, or if we 
               <br />
               were to find it out, how could we deduct it? 
               <br />

               Mr. Job I am talking about the customs duties. 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood All right, take the customs 
               <br />
               duties and purchases. How are you going to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that out? Some of the goods they bought and paid 
               <br />
               duty on them, some of them they imported and 
               <br />
               they were duty free. If they got ﬂour for their 
               <br />
               dining cars they paid no duty. Are we expected, 
               <br />
               as a Committee, to ﬁnd out every detail of what 
               <br />
               the Railway spent, who got it and what it was 
               <br />
               spent on, and follow it through and see what duty 
               <br />
               was paid on all these articles, and then deduct it 
               <br />
               from that $700,000 a year? I don’t think the 
               <br />
               Committee would consider it. If it was to be done 
               <br />
               it would have to be a job for high class auditors.
