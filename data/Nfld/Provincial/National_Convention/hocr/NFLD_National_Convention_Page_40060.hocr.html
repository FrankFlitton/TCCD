               Mr. Bailey Mr. Chairman, much has been said 
               <br />
               on what we are gathered here for. I could not help 
               <br />
               recalling some of the speeches of yesterday. I 
               <br />
               believe we of the Convention realise the respon— 
               <br />
               sibility of what is an historic occasion, and it is 
               <br />
               something, in my estimation, that should not have 
               <br />
               happened. I am learning for the ﬁrst time the 
               <br />
               whole truth about what has happened in the past, 
               <br />
               and the truth still leaves me in that state of mind 
               <br />
               that there should never have been an occasion for 
               <br />
               a National Convention. I agree with my 
               <br />
               honourable colleague, Major Cashin, that we 
               <br />
               should never have surrendered the constitution. 
               <br />
               In that I differ from my learned colleague 
               <br />
               Mr. Brown. At that time I was out of the country. 
               <br />
               In 1929, watching the course of events, I was 
               <br />
               talking to some of the members of the House and 
               <br />
               the matter of borrowing came up. They said we 
               <br />
               had to borrow to get along, I asked, “What are 
               <br />
               you going to do when you can’t borrow, have you 
               <br />
               any plan? You had better get one for your bor— 
               <br />
               rowing days are about over." It seems like 
               <br />
               everybody drifted along with no plan, “laissez 
               <br />
               faire" was the order of the day. That was the time 
               <br />
               to have tried to get the house in order, and when 
               <br />
               the world got in the doldrums in the thirties, the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst thing we should have done was to have 
               <br />
               notiﬁed our debtors that until our markets picked 
               <br />
               up we would acknowledge our debt, and pay a 
               <br />
               token payment of say one third of one percent 
               <br />
               and also tried at the time to get our interest scaled 
               <br />
               down. After all, we had spent a lot of the money 
               <br />
               ﬁghting for democracy, it was just as well to face 
               <br />
               it ﬁrst as last. No, that much was too much for 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, where vested property has sacred 
               <br />
               rights above the call of human rights. Then the 
               <br />
               Tory element came to the fore and we had to 
               <br />
               surrender our franchise, our birthright. Esau sold 
               <br />
               his fora mess of pottage, he made a better bargain 
               <br />
               than us. I don’t know who got anything out of it. 
               <br />
               I am sure the British government didn’t, for since 
               <br />
               1934 all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">liberal»minded</span> people throughout the 
               <br />
               world have reminded her of her treatment of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. When serving on a great ship in 
               <br />
               1940 and talking in the mess about the way the 
               <br />
               democrats let the Spanish republic down, one 
               <br />
               steward who was secretary of the Barcelona 
               <br />
               Labour Party and on the run from Franco said, 
               <br />
               “What did you expect of the Tory element in

               Yankee and British capitalists the interest on her 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               to get and easy to lose. Then we got a Commis-

               <br />
               had the home government given us the power to

               <br />
               today. I doubt if we would have been clamouring

               Let us review our country’s past. With every-

               thing against us for the past 336 years since the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst permanent settlers landed here, taking the 
               <br />
               type of country it’s our lot to own, and the way 
               <br />
               our economic system has worked, we have made 
               <br />
               marvellous progress, and its because our people 
               <br />
               seem to be made out of different clay. The north 
               <br />
               breeds men, and our country bred good men —- 
               <br />
               we must never let them down, and I have great 
               <br />
               faith in the future. I don‘t think it’s going to be 
               <br />
               easy. We don‘t want men of the type who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sur&lt;</span> 
               <br />
               rendered our God-given right to vote. Personally, 
               <br />
               I don’t think we’ll get them, I think we have 
               <br />
               learned our lesson. Let us review our past ﬁnan- 
               <br />
               cially. The ﬁgures, if one is to believe the British 
               <br />
               year book from 1900 to 1930, show that with a 
               <br />
               population of less than 255,000, we exported 
               <br />
               nearly $700 million worth of goods and we im- 
               <br />
               ported just $l4 million less than we exported. Out 
               <br />
               of these imports we built a Grand Falls, a Corner 
               <br />
               Brook, Deer Lake, the dry dock, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> 
               <br />
               foundiand Hotel, hundreds of miles of railroads. 
               <br />
               Added to that we borrowed $70 million, added to 
               <br />
               the wages of a number of men who like myself 
               <br />
               worked outside the country and sent their money 
               <br />
               in, which probably in the 30 years reached nearly 
               <br />
               $100 million. Let us get down to the crux of the 
               <br />
               matter, and find out why, with this wealth in 
               <br />
               sight, we are in the place we are. In 1929 our 
               <br />
               exports totalled $40 million, or $140 per head for 
               <br />
               every man, woman and child in Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               That was our foreign trade. That year the foreign 
               <br />
               trade of the United States, the greatest in her 
               <br />
               history, was $42 per capita. Economists have told 
               <br />
               me we are the largest exporters per capita in the 
               <br />
