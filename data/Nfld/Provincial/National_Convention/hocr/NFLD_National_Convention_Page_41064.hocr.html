               <br />
               Remember they are only leased grants for 99

               years, and while some of us may not be here, 
               <br />
               some of our offspring may be, and these lease 
               <br />
               agreements, whereby part of Newfoundland was 
               <br />
               given away by Great Britain for a few destroyers, 
               <br />
               upon confederation we pass over the whole

               leased territory, the lease goes over and the agree— 
               <br />

               <br />
               very much to me like the alienation of the public

               Iasked that question because I see the serious-

               <br />

               <br />
