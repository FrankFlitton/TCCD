               mitted, perhaps I might be able to make a few 
               <br />
               remarks. What we have here is an estimate made 
               <br />
               by the Government of Canada of how much it 
               <br />
               would collect from the people of Newfoundland 
               <br />

               <br />
               in Newfoundland under one heading or another. 
               <br />
               What we are going to deal with is their estimate 
               <br />
               of how much money they would collect from 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. This estimate was made not by 
               <br />
               government members. It was made by ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               authorities, experts, employed by the Govern- 
               <br />

               a mind which you would rarely meet with in this

               ﬁngers. We met also, from the Bank of Canada, 
               <br />
               Mr. J. Coyne and Mr. A.D. Skelton; and 
               <br />
               Mr. Watts, who has visited Newfoundland and 
               <br />
               who is the author of some of the economic data 
               <br />
               appearing in the book of Dr. MacKay; also 
               <br />
               Dr. Weeks. These estimates were made by those 
               <br />
               men — top-notch economists depended upon by 
               <br />
               the Government of Canada in its own financial 
               <br />
               and economic affairs... They made estimates 
               <br />
               based on two kinds of information — one, the 
               <br />
               information which the Ottawa delegation fur- 
               <br />
               nished, and two, the information they had 
               <br />
               gathered throughout the years from the Depart- 
               <br />
               ment of Finance and the Auditor General. They 
               <br />
               had made a study of Newfoundland conditions 
               <br />
               and public affairs, and Newfoundland trade and 
               <br />
               commerce. One of the most important sources of 
               <br />
               information was the Canadian Department of 
               <br />
               Trade and Commerce which is represented here 
               <br />
               by Mr. Britton, Trade Commissioner.... They 
               <br />
               have a most intimate knowledge of our trade and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commerce...</span> They have an exactitude of 
               <br />
               knowledge about our trade that I imagine no one 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland possesses today. Of course, it 
               <br />
               is their job. They have that same type of informa- 
               <br />
               tion about other countries with whom they do 
               <br />
               business. On the basis of all this information, the 
               <br />
               experts have made these estimates of what 
               <br />
               revenue the government of Canada would get 
               <br />
               from the people of Newfoundland if we became 
               <br />
               a province. I want to draw your attention par- 
               <br />

               <br />
               collect from the Newfoundland people. 
               <br />
               Revenue calculations for example, are 
               <br />
               based on a continuation of present levels of
