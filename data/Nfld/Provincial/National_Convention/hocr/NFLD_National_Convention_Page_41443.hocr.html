               which is apparently unavoidable. We are bound

               <br />

               Carson, John Kent and many others -—- and, sir, I 
               <br />
               have heard what I consider disrespectful words

               used towards these ancestors of ours -— I say they 
               <br />
               were brave men. They had nothing much to stand 
               <br />
               up for at that time, but still they believed in the 
               <br />

               Mr. Vardy Mr. Chairman, the question now 
               <br />
               before the Convention is the one which is causing 
               <br />
               so much confusion in the minds of our people, 
               <br />
               and there are a very large number who cannot see 
               <br />
               why they should not, if they want to, vote for 
               <br />
               confederation with Canada in the referendum in 
               <br />
               the coming spring, and it is these very people who 
               <br />
               must be protected against themselves, for their

               surely if such an important step is really good for

               negotiations between our two sovereign govem-

               merits, who on our side would have full powers

               to argue for the best possible terms for New-

               foundland. It is utter folly and nonsense for

               anyone to argue that Newfoundland has not got

               a much greater bargaining power today than ever

               <br />
               matter of confederation. We have carefully 
               <br />
               studied this matter, and in the opinion of the great 
               <br />
               majority, the price or terms offered are not con- 
               <br />
               ducive to the best interest of our people. That 
               <br />
               being so, I would say to our critics, “Would it be 
               <br />
               honourable or honest on our part to advise our 
               <br />
               people to close the deal?” If Mr. Smallwood sent 
               <br />
               me out to look at a piece of land he was consider— 
               <br />
               ing buying, and I considered the land worth 
               <br />
               $2,000, and the price was $5,000, would Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood consider me honest and honourable 
               <br />
               to advise him to pay the ﬁve, at the same time 
               <br />
               knowing in my opinion it was not worth over 
               <br />
               two? If he would pay the five, would he not
