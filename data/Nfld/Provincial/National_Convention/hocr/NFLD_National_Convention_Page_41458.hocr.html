               “are heartsick at seeing our governments feeding

               Mr. Chairman, I work for a living, you do also. 
               <br />
               All of us here do. We were sent here for a speciﬁc 
               <br />
               purpose, to endeavour to assist the people of this 
               <br />
               country in making up their minds as to what type 
               <br />
               of government they wanted. Not to inﬂame them; 
               <br />
               not to set class against class. I feel that I work as 
               <br />
               hard for a living as any of my countrymen. In a 
               <br />
               different way, I will admit, but still I feel, just as 
               <br />
               hard. I may not be a producer, but a necessary 
               <br />
               evil. I earn my money, and it is clean money. I 
               <br />
               resent this type of inflammatory talk. It is un- 
               <br />
               necessary and not part of our job to indulge in 
               <br />
               propaganda of any kind, and certainly not of this 
               <br />
               kind. If confederation means this manner of 
               <br />
               thinking being introduced into Newfoundland, I 
               <br />
               want no part of it - now, or any other time. 
               <br />

               I agree that the rights of labour should be 
               <br />
               recognised. I agree that the producers in the 
               <br />
               country should be recognised. I agree that labour 
               <br />
               must be represented in any government of the 
               <br />
               future, and represented in a manner that will 
               <br />
               protect fully the rights of labour. But, Mr. Chair- 
               <br />
               man, in my opinion, expressions such as I have 
               <br />
               drawn your attention to, are doing a disservice to 
               <br />
               labour. In Newfoundland, to my knowledge, rela~ 
               <br />
               tions between capital and labour have been 
               <br />
               happy. None of us in Newfoundland are 
               <br />
               bluebloods. Some must necessarily be masters 
               <br />
               and some employees, but I say without fear of

               I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, that an article 
               <br />
               in a local newspaper, of which you, Mr. Chair- 
               <br />
               man, are legal adviser, is very pertinent. It is the 
               <br />
               paper dated January 25, Sunday last, and is an 
               <br />
               article written by a Newfoundlander —- Mr. F. 
               <br />
               Reardon of 1988 Notre Dame St. West, Montreal. 
               <br />
               Mr. Reardon stated that he had been persuaded 
               <br />
               by a friend to attend a meeting of the local union 
               <br />
               which had headquarters in Montreal. The meet- 
               <br />
               ing was actually a dinner for one of the union 
               <br />
               leaders. The hall was decorated with pictures of 
               <br />
               Lenin and Stalin. In the course of the speech by 
               <br />
               this union leader, he stated that labour in New- 
               <br />
               foundland was ripe for the sowing of communism 
               <br />
               and that of the 43,000 workers in the country, 
               <br />
               4,000 were already organized for communism. 
               <br />
               The speaker stressed the importance of helping 
               <br />
               to make confederation a reality.

               In referring to a statement I made during the 
               <br />
               debate on this matter in committee of the whole, 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood quoted me as saying, “Here is 
               <br />
               Newfoundland sitting with a pat hand.” What I 
               <br />
               meant to infer, of course, was that Newfound- 
               <br />
               land, for all the reasons I had enumerated, her 
               <br />
               strategic position and her mineral wealth, was in 
               <br />
               an excellent bargaining position. As an answer to 
               <br />
               this Mr. Smallwood said, “I wonder if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Hig- 
               <br />
               gins is aware of the factthat we have nearly 1,200 
               <br />
               veterans of the late war out of jobs right here in 
               <br />
               St. John’s tonight? I wonder if he is aware that 
               <br />
               we have thousands on the dole in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               at this moment?” I am by no means unsym- 
               <br />
               pathetic in this unfortunate situation, but in jus- 
               <br />
               tice to our country I would like to point out the 
               <br />
               following with respect to unemployment here 
               <br />
               and in Canada. I have taken the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               ﬁgures from the Evening Telegram. It was stated 
               <br />
               in one of their issues of last week that 8,076

               secure employment received assistance for the
