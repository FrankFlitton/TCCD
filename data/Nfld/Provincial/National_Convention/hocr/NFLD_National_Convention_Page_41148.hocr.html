               Mr. Cashin Mr. Chairman, I am glad Mr. Small- 
               <br />
               wood brought that matter up. With regard to 
               <br />
               closure, it is immaterial to me; but I want to point 
               <br />
               out that before the Ottawa delegation left last 
               <br />
               year, this Convention was practically assured it 
               <br />
               would reconvene again around the middle of 
               <br />
               July, but the Ottawa delegation ignored that; they 
               <br />
               did not have the decency to communicate with 
               <br />
               the Secretary telling him to advise the members 
               <br />
               of the Convention that they were sorry about the 
               <br />
               delay; we had to take it upon ourselves to com— 
               <br />
               municate with them, and we were told we were 
               <br />
               committing an act of national treachery. Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood can reply all he likes to my remarks. 
               <br />
               This confederation issue has been before this 
               <br />
               house for 16 months. That is all we have heard. 
               <br />
               Every report has been torn abroad and told what 
               <br />
               confederation would do. The thing should never 
               <br />
               have happened. Even the Evening Telegram 
               <br />
               practically said it was a farce. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               A few items have been drawn to my attention 
               <br />
               to bring up, and there are many points I omitted, 
               <br />
               particularly from the point of ﬁnancial interest. 
               <br />
               A party asked me today to inquire what is going 
               <br />
               to happen to the Newfoundland Savings Bank in 
               <br />
               which there are $20 million belonging to our 
               <br />
               people at 2.5%. When the Ottawa delegation was 
               <br />
               discussing these matters, did they ask the Ottawa 
               <br />
               government what would become of the bank? It 
               <br />
               is a very important matter.... I am one of those 
               <br />
               who believes in that bank. If those savings are 
               <br />
               going to be reduced in annual interest charges, 
               <br />
               that money should be withdrawn; and for those 
               <br />
               in the country who have their savings in that 
               <br />
               bank, I am going to direct a question to the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance. 1 will draft a question. 
               <br />

               This so-called budget of Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Smallwood’sl</span> 
               <br />
               indicates to me that, in addition to paying an 
               <br />
               annual federal tax of around $230 per annum, 
               <br />
               every Newfoundlander, will have to ﬁnd an ad- 
               <br />
               ditional $30 per year in provincial taxation. In all, 
               <br />
               therefore, the people of the country would have 
               <br />
               to ﬁnd over $80 million each year to pay both 
               <br />
               federal and provincial taxation. In short, the 
               <br />
               whole thing means that the people of New— 
               <br />

               Mr. Chairman, there is a saying that there is

               none so blind as those who will not see, and it is 
               <br />
               certain that many of us refuse to see things as they 
               <br />
               are in this country today. They cannot plead 
               <br />
               ignorance, they cannot say they have not been 
               <br />
               told that the threats to our country have not been 
               <br />
               pointed out to them. Time and time again, the call 
               <br />
               has come to them to assume the duty which as 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders is rightly theirs. And whatever 
               <br />
               befalls us in the future, whatever disasters happen 
               <br />
               to us, the people generally cannot say that have 
               <br />
               not been asked to stave off such disasters. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Iam not speaking to hear the sound of my own 
               <br />
               voice. Nor am I trying to warp the judgement of 
               <br />
               the delegates to this Convention or the people of 
               <br />
               the country, or influence their minds with any 
               <br />
               more airy rhetoric or political spellbinding. My 
               <br />
               purpose has been, at this time particularly, to give 
               <br />
               hard, cold facts which cannot be denied or talked 
               <br />
               away. What I have said emanates from my sin— 
               <br />
               cere political belief which is based on the solid 
               <br />
               and eternal doctrine: first, a country belongs to its 
               <br />
               people; second, it is the solemn duty of the people 
               <br />
               of that country to shoulder the responsibility of 
               <br />
               governin g it. Any divergence or avoidance of that 
               <br />
               doctrine, any excuse for acting contrary to that 
               <br />
               fundamental truth is cowardly, unediical and im- 
               <br />
               moral. The challenge which faces the people of 
               <br />
               this country today is the patriotic and moral chal- 
               <br />
               lenge to do their duty and to face their respon- 
               <br />
               sibilities like real men and women. It is a 
               <br />
               clear-cut issue —— as clear and unambiguous as 
               <br />
               the challenge of right and wrong. But again I say, 
               <br />
               there are those amongst us who have shown that 
               <br />
               they are unwilling, or have not the capabilities of 
               <br />
               facing their responsibilities and accepting <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">obliga-</span> 
               <br />
               tions of democratic decency. They are prepared 
               <br />
               instead to assume the garb of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mendicants»</span> and go 
               <br />
               begging at the back door of some outside country, 
               <br />
               asking to be taken in out of the rough world which 
               <br />
               they fear to face. Like Shakespeare’s character, 
               <br />
               they are prepared to crawl under the huge legs of 
               <br />
               some foreign colossus and find themselves dis- 
               <br />
               honourable graves. But I know that there are 
               <br />
