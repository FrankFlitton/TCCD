               However, my major concern for the immedi- 
               <br />
               ate future is rooted in the uncertainty that hangs 
               <br />
               over the whole world. If everything goes just 
               <br />

               <br />
               consequences. Two months ago something did 
               <br />
               not go right — England froze the convertibility 
               <br />
               of sterling. Overnight we were no longer so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cer~</span> 
               <br />
               tain that we were self—supporting. We needed $7 
               <br />
               million to tide us over the crisis and the winter. 
               <br />
               Such was the meager measure of our much-

               vaunted <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self«supporti</span> And had it happened that 
               <br />
               we were not able to dig down in our own pocket 
               <br />
               for that, a great many of our ﬁshermen would be 
               <br />
               ﬁnding little evidence of self-support in their
