               going to be smothered with the lies and propagan- 
               <br />
               da of 1869. It was easy enough in 1869 to bluff 
               <br />
               the people with lies about their property being 
               <br />
               taxed, but this time the anticonfederates are not 
               <br />
               going to get away with it, not even if every 
               <br />
               millionaire, half-millionaire and quarter-mil- 
               <br />
               lionaire in the country rallies to the side of the 
               <br />
               anticonfederates. The day is gone when their 
               <br />
               money-bags will tell our people how to vote. That 
               <br />
               day is gone, and we live in a different age. Our 
               <br />
               people are no longer in the mood to bow down 
               <br />
               and almost worship a man just because he has 
               <br />
               managed somehow or other to make a great for- 
               <br />
               tune for himself. They no longer measure a man’s 
               <br />
               patriotism or his loyal heart by the money he has 
               <br />
               in the bank. When we say we have a stake in the 
               <br />
               country we no longer mean how much money a 
               <br />
               man has, but how many children he has, what is 
               <br />
               the size of his family, what is his love for the 
               <br />
               country. When we talk of “men of substance” 
               <br />
               today, we include something more than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">money,</span> 
               <br />
               Our people are on the march in their tens of 
               <br />
               thousands. They have formed great trade unions 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cooperative</span> societies, and cannot so easily 
               <br />
               be bluffed any more. They have learned a lot the 
               <br />
               past few years, and they ask questions, questions 
               <br />
               that they never dared to ask in the bad old days. 
               <br />
               They ask questions about our vicious system of 
               <br />
               taxation. They ask questions about the cruel and 
               <br />
               oppressive cost of living. They ask questions 
               <br />
               about a system of taxation and of government that 
               <br />
               has held them down and made it impossible for a 
               <br />
               working man to live decently and rear a family 
               <br />
               by his honest earnings. Yes, our people are in the 
               <br />
               mood to ask many questions today that they never 
               <br />
               asked before. They are not so easy to bluff as our

               <br />
               ty taxes. This is the topic that the anticonfederates 
               <br />
               are going to harp on through the remainder of the 
               <br />
               period before the referendum. Their campaign 
               <br />
               against confederation is going to be based very 
               <br />
               largely on this claim. They will set out to per- 
               <br />
               suade our people that under confederation their 
               <br />
               property will be taxed, and also their land and 
               <br />
               outhouses and ﬂakes and stages and ﬁshing room 
               <br />
               and boats and fishing gear and live stock. You 
               <br />
               will have to pay taxes on all these things, the 
               <br />
               anticonfederates will tell you. They will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">try</span> to put 
               <br />
               the fear of God in our people about the property 
               <br />
               taxes. That is their trump card, so they believe. 
               <br />
               They will try the same game that certain people 
               <br />
               used in Newfoundland where the people voted on 
               <br />
               town councils only last year. Certain people who 
               <br />
               were against town councils went around and said 
               <br />
               to the people, “Surely you are not going to vote 
               <br />
               for town councils — they will tax your garden 
               <br />
               and your house and everything in your house, so 
               <br />
               much for a cat and a dog and a hen and a pig...”

               <br />
               town councils. That is what the anticonfederates 
               <br />
               are going to try on a grand scale, a national scale 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland. They will tell you that your 
               <br />
               property will be taxed, and you will be ground to 
               <br />
