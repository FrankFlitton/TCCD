               <br />
               I am satisﬁed that I can recommend for submis—

               responsible government and Commission

               <br />
               ment can be achieved, for if you modify it you 
               <br />
               have to do one of two things: provide for the 
               <br />
               election of enough Newfoundlanders to carry a 
               <br />
               decision in case of dispute, or provide for a 
               <br />
               preponderance of Commonwealth Ofﬁce ap- 
               <br />
               pointees. In a modiﬁed Commission in which 
               <br />
               elected Newfoundlanders would be in the 
               <br />
               majority you would have, in effect, in all but 
               <br />
               name, responsible government; so why not have 
               <br />
               it by name, and by restoration of our suspended 
               <br />
               constitution? It may be that “a rose by any other 
               <br />
               name would smell as sweet", but not in this 
               <br />
               island, if what would be in effect responsible 
               <br />
               government were still called Commission. But on 
               <br />
               the other hand, in a modiﬁed Commission in 
               <br />
               which elected Newfoundlanders would be in the 
               <br />
               minority, you would have in effect representative 
               <br />
               government, and you would have in addition all 
               <br />
               the furor, all the dissension, all the bickering that 
               <br />
               went with representative government before. 
               <br />
               Yes, and no throwing into the balance advisory 
               <br />
               councils or anything else would make for peace, 
               <br />
               quiet and good government in a body partly 
               <br />

               I am convinced that one of the choices to be

               <br />
               me say this. Because I like to give credit where

               credit is due, I have not joined in the diatribes

               <br />
               tion has from time to time indulged. Some of the 
               <br />
               criticisms of Commission that have been 
               <br />
               mouthed have been justified, for the Commission 
               <br />
               did fall far short of making the most of the golden 
               <br />
               opportunities that Came its way; but hardly a 
               <br />
               word of credit has been given to the Commission, 
               <br />
               and that has been just simply the old game of 
               <br />
               playing politics. In order to redress in some little 
               <br />
               manner the injury the Commission has suffered 
               <br />
               at our hands, I avail of this opportunity to say this 
               <br />
               much in its favour; that notwithstanding its 
               <br />
               shortcomings, Commission of Government has 
               <br />
               done as much, and perhaps more, for the ordinary 
               <br />
               people in this country, the ﬁshermen and farmers 
               <br />
               and the loggers, than any government within 
               <br />
               living memory; and in saying that I am voicing 
               <br />
               the opinion of people all over this country whose 
               <br />
               memories can go back much farther than my own. 
               <br />
               It would serve no useful purpose for me to 
               <br />
               enumerate here the excellencies and negligence 
               <br />
               of Commission of Government. The ordinary 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland are not likely to forget 
               <br />
               overnight wherein the Commission of Govcm- 
               <br />
               merit has served them well, and tlu's Convention 
               <br />
               has done its best to see to it that they will not 
               <br />
               forget wherein it has failed, and so I will forego 
               <br />
               any recital of hallelujahs and lamentations. There 
               <br />
               is this, however, that I think deserving of special 
               <br />
               mention.

               We hear it said these days that the British 
               <br />
               government promised that we would have politi- 
               <br />
               cal education during the days of Commission 
               <br />
               government, and that that pledge was not 
               <br />
               honoured. That, as far as I am concerned, is 
               <br />
               something decidedly open to question. It seems 
               <br />
               to me that during the days of Commission of 
               <br />
               Government Newfoundlanders have grown to a 
               <br />
               greater political perspicacity than has ever been 
               <br />
               there. Commission of Government has been 
               <br />
               criticised as dictatorial, and whilst deﬁnitely an 
               <br />
               oligarchy, it has put into effect policies that have 
               <br />
               made the people more politically adequate than 
               <br />
               they have ever been. These policies have led to 
               <br />
               the growth of many small organisations wherein 
               <br />
               many Newfoundlanders have learned the rudi- 
               <br />
               ments of parliamentary procedure, how to talk on 
               <br />
               their feet, how to think their way through to 
               <br />
               resolutions of a community’s problems, what to 
               <br />
               look for in a proposal to make it worth their 
               <br />
               concern, how to select leaders from among them—
