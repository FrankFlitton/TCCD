               our paper — we are very fortunate in being able 
               <br />
               to sell America paper, because it gives us a lot of 
               <br />
               American dollars. We know that Canada has a 
               <br />
               shortage of American dollars, that does not 
               <br />
               reﬂect any weakness in Canada, nor would it 
               <br />
               reflect any particular strength in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               because she happened to have a surplus of 
               <br />
               American dollars. It’s only a matter of having 
               <br />
               goods available which America wants and can 
               <br />
               take. How do we know that we can get these 
               <br />
               terms extended, if we turn them down now? If 
               <br />
               there’s any doubt about being able to get better 
               <br />
               terms, then why not ask our government? There’s 
               <br />
               been a lot of talk about governments negotiating 
               <br />
               instead of members of a delegation, so why not 
               <br />
               ask the Commission of Government to inquire 
               <br />
               and see whether or not Canada can improve upon 
               <br />
               the terms, and then we’d know for sure.

               to think that America would do for New-

               prepared to do with her largest customer -

               Canada? How far could Newfoundland get with 
               <br />
               the Bond—Blaine treaty when Canada stepped in 
               <br />
               and said, “What about our ﬁshermen? What are 
               <br />
               you going to do for our ﬁshermen?” And surely 
               <br />
               she had had as much right to look after the rights 
               <br />
               of her ﬁshermen as the Newfoundland govern- 
               <br />
               ment had to look after the rights of hers? If there

               is any economic union coming between Canada 
               <br />
               and the States, we, if we were part of Canada,

               would certainly come in under it at that time.

               Now, sir, if we can now barely balance our

               It has been said by Mr. Smallwood that we’re

               about the size of a small city, split upinto 1,300

               do it with the millions that Canada is prepared to

               Now, sir, as regards provincial government 
               <br />
               taxes. We realise that if we become a province 
               <br />
               we shall have a smaller revenue then we have at 
               <br />
               the present time. But what will that mean? That 
               <br />
               will mean of necessity a closer watch on how 
               <br />
               these taxes are expended. We have had to cut the 
               <br />
               garment according to the cloth. And if taxes were 
               <br />
               raised clearly and squarely, no doubt they will be 
               <br />
               well spent because the people will take an interest 
               <br />
               in how they are being spent when they know 
               <br />
               exactly what taxes they are paying. I maintain the 
               <br />
               people do not know exactly how much taxes they 
               <br />
               are paying, except as a gross sum when we get 
               <br />
               the budget at the end of the ﬁscal year. I have 
               <br />
               reason to believe that a closer scrutiny will be 
               <br />
               exercised by our people and a closer watch on 
               <br />
               expenditure. If fairly applied and wisely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">spent,</span> 
               <br />
               true value will be received by our people... The 
               <br />
               government is put in the saddle by the people but 
               <br />
               the people are the ﬁnal masters.

               It has been said here that it would be criminal 
               <br />
               to accept these proposals. I can’t understand that 
               <br />
               reasoning. Do members think that Canada 
               <br />
               would submit anything to us that would be 
               <br />
               criminal to accept? Nonsense! Now, if we join up 
               <br />
               with Canada, we would be within the great 
               <br />
               British Empire. I believe that we would make a 
               <br />
               tremendous amount of progress with Canada. 
               <br />
               The difference in the per capita debt of Canada 
               <br />
               and Newfoundland has been spoken of: yes, there 
               <br />
               is quite a difference. But look at the resources of 
               <br />
               the two countries, see them as you come across 
               <br />
               them, the broad expanse of Canada from the

               Atlantic to the Paciﬁc. Look at her resources. The
