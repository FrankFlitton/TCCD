               Mr. Roberts Yes. They paid pretty nearly what 
               <br />
               the people were getting for tinned. Then 
               <br />
               Maritime Packers came in, they opened branches 
               <br />
               at Lark Harbour and Bonne Bay and after a 
               <br />
               couple of years, the co-operative business was 
               <br />
               introduced by the government. The ﬁeld workers 
               <br />
               showed the people where they could double their 
               <br />
               earnings by getting the lobster to market and 
               <br />
               cutting out the middle men. The ﬁrst year the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cooperatives</span> sold lobsters, they got 20 cents; the 
               <br />
               Maritime Packers paying 10 cents. They had a lot 
               <br />
               of expense. The co-operatives began to grow and 
               <br />
               in three years the whole coast had gone <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">co‘opera-</span> 
               <br />
               tive. Maritime Packers still held their plant at 
               <br />
               Lark Harbour and were not a branch of the 
               <br />
               society. Last year they paid 14 cents to 17 cents; 
               <br />
               average 16 cents a pound. The co~operative 
               <br />
               society at Rocky Harbour and Bonne Bay 
               <br />
               averaged after all expenses paid, or loss to the 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen, 35 cents a pound. There is a great 
               <br />
               spread between 17 cents and 35 cents a pound. It 
               <br />
               means the ﬁshermen are doubling their wages. It 
               <br />
               does not mean they are banking this money - 
               <br />
               they have more to spend and their standard of 
               <br />
               living is higher. Another good thing is this — it 
               <br />
               has centralised the industry. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cooperative</span> 
               <br />
               ofﬁcials or inspectors, when a boat comes in, go 
               <br />
               through the catch and the small lobsters and 
               <br />
               spawning lobsters are thrown overboard. They 
               <br />
               cannot be sold. Instead of the industry <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">decreas</span> 
               <br />
               ing, it is increasing every year.

               Mr. Bailey Mr. Chairman, I believe in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">co“</span> 
               <br />
               operative movement, and l think it was in the 
               <br />
               north where the ﬁrst co-operative movement 
               <br />
               started in this country. I am sure it was a good 
               <br />
               thing, but unfortunately transportation was one 
               <br />
               of the reasons that it was killed. I don’t know 
               <br />
               whether Rev. Burry is conversant with the way 
               <br />
               the Labrador coast was, back in the years when 
               <br />
               even if you had money you could not buy any- 
               <br />
               thing. Everybody that came along with a pedlar’s 
               <br />
               pack went out of it with the packjust as heavy as 
               <br />
               when they came in. There was no limit to what 
               <br />
               they had to sell and the people could not afford 
               <br />
               it. Dr. Grenfell put in ten stores. The people were 
               <br />
               up against it, but the stores carried on until 1928 
               <br />
               anyway, I don’t know if they are still in operation 
               <br />
               now, but I believe if they had had the right system 
               <br />
               the people would have beneﬁtted a lot.

               The question was put here yesterday, “Was 
               <br />
               the government behind the co-operative <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">move</span> 
               <br />
               ment”? Absolutely, l am sure ofthat, but an awful 
               <br />
               long way behind. l don‘t know whether the rest 
               <br />
               of the members of this Convention believe that 
               <br />
               the co—operative movement is a long time over— 
               <br />
               due in this country, but I certainly do. I don’t see 
               <br />
               why we have to be at the beck and call of some— 
               <br />
               body else when we can get together and produce, 
               <br />
               and I believe the day will come when New- 
               <br />
               foundland is going to come to the top, and every 
               <br />
               man that is interested will be able to market what 
               <br />
               he produces. lcame in here in 1939 from a district 
               <br />
               that was suffering, and on the way home I met a 
               <br />
               bunch of lads and lasses between Winterton and 
               <br />
               Ham‘s Harbour and l was wondering if 1 could 
               <br />
               get a lift home. I asked who they were and they 
               <br />
               said they were the co-operative workers. 1 said 
               <br />
               the government needed to get the people inter- 
               <br />
               ested in co-operation. I believe the government 
               <br />
               would have done a lot in those days with a clear, 
               <br />
               sane policy, when they had to give out the money 
               <br />
               to the people. There was not a village in New- 
               <br />
               foundland that did not have a percentage of 
               <br />
               people on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dole.</span> They could have taken a truck 
               <br />
               and gone to some central place and bought the 
               <br />
               food and divided it among themselves instead of 
               <br />
               buying from the retailer. You would have had the
