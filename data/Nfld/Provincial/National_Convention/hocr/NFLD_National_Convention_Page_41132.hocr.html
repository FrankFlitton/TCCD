               Mr. Smallwood any deﬁnite information, we 
               <br />
               ﬁnally encouraged him to present to this Conven-

               tion and to the country a proposed budget of the

               anticipated revenue and expenditure of the New— 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Ottawa delegation, but rather by Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood himself, and we must therefore con- 
               <br />
               clude that the Ottawa delegation had no act or 
               <br />
               part in its compilation. At the outset, let me say 
               <br />
               that in my 25 years experience as a member of 
               <br />
               the House of Assembly, and as a close student of 
               <br />
               our ﬁnancial affairs — after having read every 
               <br />
               budget speech since 1909, Imust confess that Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood’s attempt displays the most glaring 
               <br />
               and highfiying attempt at “frenzied finance” that 
               <br />
               I have ever witnessed. Well do we remember Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood’s deliberate attempt to belittle the 
               <br />
               efforts of the Finance Committee in its presenta- 
               <br />
               tion of both the Financial and Economic Report, 
               <br />
               how he used every conceivable method to show 
               <br />
               to the country the hopelessness of our financial 
               <br />
               and economic position; now he has the gall to 
               <br />
               attempt to shove down the throats of the delegates 
               <br />
               and the people of Newfoundland this proposed
