            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. Smallwood I was not saying it for your 
               <br />
               beneﬁt. The difference is this, under the BNA 
               <br />
               Act, if section 93 applied to Newfoundland the 
               <br />
               school system we have now would be frozen 
               <br />
               upon us. It could never change, the denomina- 
               <br />
               tions now have schools and would go on having 
               <br />
               them for all time; no two denominations could 
               <br />
               unite their schools if they wanted to do so. In the 
               <br />
               clause in our terms, all denominations are 
               <br />
               guaranteed the right to go on forever, as long as 
               <br />
               they want to go on, with their own separate 
               <br />
               schools. But there is something else added: any 
               <br />
               two denominations or more that should ever wish 
               <br />
               to unite their schools, that right is given in this 
               <br />
               clause. All interests are protected, all conscience 
               <br />
               is protected; the beliefs of all people are 
               <br />
               protected; no one is denied any right at all. You 
               <br />
               can stay as you are, or unite with somebody else. 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman Your point, Mr. Higgins, is that 
               <br />
               it is frozen, unless this amendment or alteration 
               <br />
               is cited, by amalgamation between two or more 
               <br />
               bodies?

               <br />
               appreciate that in Ottawa it was one thing to be

               be talking about matters in which they believe 
               <br />
               deeply. The last thing we wanted or would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wel«</span> 
               <br />
               come would be to run counter to the beliefs or

               faiths of the people of Newfoundland. Naturally, 
               <br />
               we had to go pretty deeply into this question.

               There is a danger, if section 93 applied to New-

               <br />

               <br />
               and Protestant. In other words, the danger would 
               <br />
               be that all Protestant schools, whether they liked 
               <br />
               it or not, might be forced to unite. Now there is 
               <br />
               no good reason why any denomination would be 
               <br />
               forced to unite or not to unite. The application of 
               <br />
               section 93 might mean exactly that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~</span> forcing 
               <br />
               that there be only two classes of schools, Catholic
