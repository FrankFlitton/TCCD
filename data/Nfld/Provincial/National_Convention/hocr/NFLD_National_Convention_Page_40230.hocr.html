               Mr. Miller Before I get too indignant over this 
               <br />
               Tourist Board business, I think it essential for us 
               <br />
               to have the cost of the proposed programme We 
               <br />
               have what it cost under different headings —- we 
               <br />
               know we must have better roads, but at $50,000 
               <br />
               a mile, how many of these can we afford? We also 
               <br />
               must have cabins; we must have ferry service on 
               <br />
               the Gulf; but we do not know what all this is going 
               <br />
               to cost, and that is the essential information. We 
               <br />
               have a surplus of $27 million — this programme 
               <br />
               looks extensive — would it cost $27 million? I 
               <br />
               do not think it would be justiﬁed. If it cost $2 
               <br />
               million, yes. I do not know how far this 
               <br />
               programme was recommended to the govem~ 
               <br />
               ment, I do not know what it will cost. If some- 
               <br />
               thing better than a guess should have been made 
               <br />
               and should have been presented here, then I could 
               <br />
               really feel that the Tourist Board were handed out 
               <br />
               an injustice. It is essential for us to have that. It is 
               <br />
               an important point and one to which we will, 
               <br />
               possibly, have to look to in the future when the 
               <br />
               thing is considered again. With regard to the 
               <br />
               government’s setting up of cabins, I disagree, I 
               <br />
               think that should be done by private enterprise. 
               <br />
               The government should find the roads and 
               <br />
               facilities Sometime the highway will be inevit— 
               <br />
               able. But the cabins should be done by private 
               <br />
               enterprise <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> the least we get the government into 
               <br />
               business, the better for Newfoundland.

               Mr. Smallwood There were three points raised. 
               <br />
               In one of these reports the amount of money 
               <br />
               which the Tourist Board proposed to be spent was 
               <br />
               stated. It is not even $2 million. As to the point 
               <br />
               about this being the job for private enterprise <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~—</span> 
               <br />
               yes, the reports all say that it should be done by 
               <br />
               private enterprise, but they point out that this is a 
               <br />
               country in which businessmen who have money 
               <br />
               to invest don’t seem to have great deal of faith in 
               <br />
               it, and the pioneer work should be done by the 
               <br />
               government. The government should build just 
               <br />
               one to test it out and see if it works. If the 
               <br />
               government built them all it would cost about $2 
               <br />
               million, but for one it would cost $100,000. 
               <br />

               dealt with in one of these reports He ventures to 
               <br />
               assume that roads for tourists must be paved. It 
               <br />
               says in the Mathes report that a paved road is 
               <br />
               better than gravel, nevertheless tourists coming 
               <br />
               to Newfoundland would not be expecting to find 
               <br />
               paved roads, but a half-decent gravel road over 
               <br />
               which they could travel at 25 or 30 miles an hour. 
               <br />
               The fact that a road is not paved, but gravel, is 
               <br />
               rather quaint and different to tourists 
               <br />
               Mr. Penney With the spirit and principle of the 
               <br />
               Tourist Board before us I am in sympathy and 
               <br />
               appreciate the services of the very fine men who 
               <br />
               served on that Board for so many years without 
               <br />
               any pay, but sitting here this afternoon and listen- 
               <br />
               ing, Mr. Smallwood made me a little nervous in 
               <br />
               talking about the development of the tourist <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">traf»</span> 
               <br />
               fie, where he envisaged thousands of motor cars 
               <br />
               up there in North Sydney trying to get across and 
               <br />
               come down this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">way,</span> I felt very nervous over it, 
               <br />
               because they will drive to the right, and half the 
               <br />
               people around Conception Bay might be wiped 
               <br />
               out. Then again they are going to catch our sal- 
               <br />
               mon and sea trout, our partridge and snipe, and 
               <br />
               take away our venison, and even if we have lots 
               <br />
               of money we won’t have so much fish. Insofar as 
               <br />
               the principle of the tourist traffic is concerned, I 
               <br />
               humbly step in with the rest of the men who have 
               <br />
               spoken regarding the members of the Tourist 
               <br />
               Board, but if we left our natural resources open 
               <br />
               to a great multitude of tourists we will hardly 
               <br />
               have anything left but money. 
               <br />
               Mr. Vardy I agree with the previous speakers. 
               <br />
               We are all too conscious of the fact that almost 
               <br />
               every bit of advertising that Newfoundland has 
               <br />
               had has been usually had, apan from the little bit 
               <br />
               of favourable publicity given us by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New.</span> 
               <br />
               foundland Tourist Board. We who have travelled 
               <br />
               on the various continents know that. I have seen 
               <br />
               five of the seven <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seas,</span> In view of my knowledge

               of what little has been done in the way of adver~ 
               <br />
               tising our country abroad, I was not surprised to 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that so little is knOWn of Newfoundland. A 
               <br />
               few days ago I received a letter from New 
               <br />
               Zealand, addressed to “Newfoundland, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada",</span> 
               <br />
               Not long ago I received a letter from a friend in 
               <br />
               Australia addressed “Newfoundland, North 
               <br />
               America". He was probably correct!
