               Mr. Newell I did not intend to have anything to 
               <br />
               say on this. As far as I know, the co-operative is 
               <br />
               a good thing. It has not only the strong endorse— 
               <br />
               ment but the ﬂattering OK of the Fisheries Com- 
               <br />
               rnittee. I was prepared to leave it at that. I am not 
               <br />
               entirely in a position to speak for the government 
               <br />
               or the Co-operative Division. I have never 
               <br />
               worked for the (Jo-operative Division of the 
               <br />
               government. I think, though, I am doing the same 
               <br />
               kind of work as their ﬁeld workers are. As far as 
               <br />
               I know, there is no co-operative society in this 
               <br />
               country today receiving financial assistance from 
               <br />
               the government. When the idea of co-operatives 
               <br />
               was ﬁrst mooted by the government - it was 
               <br />
               mooted long before that by Sir Wilfred Grenfell, 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">co—operative</span> was organised by him 35 to 
               <br />
               40 years ago -— but when the idea was ﬁrst 
               <br />
               mooted by the government they brought over an 
               <br />
               expert from England. He was an expert on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">co»</span> 
               <br />
               operatives but not an expert on Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               because he recommended, I understand, that the 
               <br />
               only way we could get a start here would be by 
               <br />
               government loans. I believe considerable sums 
               <br />
               were loaned to three <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cooperative</span> societies. One 
               <br />
               of these was known to exist years afterwards and 
               <br />
               the people took it over and built a good strong 
               <br />
               society. Whether the other two or three ever paid 
               <br />
               off their loans, I am not in a position to say. That 
               <br />
               ﬁrst experiment on the basis of loans was written 
               <br />
               off as a failure generally. The past did sow in the 
               <br />
               minds of the people the idea of co-operatives. As 
               <br />
               far as I know, not one cent of government money 
               <br />
               was invested in this society which was taken over 
               <br />
               by the people.

               were co-operatives they would not make proﬁts, 
               <br />
               but some of them do make profits. By that I mean 
               <br />
               they sell goods to people who are not members 
               <br />
               of the societies and thereby make proﬁts. They 
               <br />

               <br />
               were the only producing co-operatives. As far as 
               <br />
               salmon was concerned they shipped a high
