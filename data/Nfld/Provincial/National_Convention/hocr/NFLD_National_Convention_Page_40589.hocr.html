               Mr. Fudge Before I proceed with my few 
               <br />
               remarks I would like to refer to what Mr. 
               <br />
               Smallwood said, that the British government is 
               <br />
               not prepared to discuss base deals with us. The 
               <br />
               British government is prepared to leave that mat- 
               <br />
               ter in the hands of Newfoundlanders — provided, 
               <br />
               however, they get their own government; then 
               <br />
               they will discuss the matter with us. As far as this 
               <br />
               self-supporting business is concerned, it is a nig- 
               <br />
               ger in the woodpile. Who is self-supporting? Is 
               <br />
               Great Britain self-supporting? Is Canada self- 
               <br />
               supporting? Not at all! Why put the burden on top 
               <br />
               of us, gentlemen?.... We are the only people who 
               <br />
               pay cash for democracy; the rest can have it 
               <br />
               charged.

               As a member of the delegation I feel that I am 
               <br />
               called upon to add my cements to those which 
               <br />
               you have already heard. I fully endorse the 
               <br />
               opinions expressed by Major Cashin and 
               <br />
               Mr. Crosbie. I, like them, have come back from 
               <br />
               our visit keenly disappointed with the results 
               <br />
               obtained, and the general tenor of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reception.</span> 
               <br />
               I feel as if I had been on some kind of a wild goose 
               <br />
               chase. On the plane which brought us back to this 
               <br />
               country, we might have marked the words: 
               <br />
               “Returned Empty."

               During my years as a representative of labour 
               <br />
               unions, I have had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">die</span> experience of being a 
               <br />
               member of many delegations and sitting in at 
               <br />
               meetings with many official bodies, both 
               <br />
               governmental and otherwise. But in all such 
               <br />
               cases I came away from such meetings knowing 
               <br />
               that matters had been discussed openly and frank- 
               <br />
               ly, and in a common sense manner. But that was 
               <br />
               not my experience on this delegation, for I found 
               <br />
               little of common sense and less of frankness. I 
               <br />
               had the new experience of seeing certain persons 
               <br />
               present whispering into the Chairman’s ear. I saw 
               <br />
               people pulling other people’s coat-tails, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fur</span> 
               <br />
               ther whispering take place. It made me wonder 
               <br />
               sometimes where I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was.</span> Was this a meeting with 
               <br />
               representatives of the British government? Or

               Like Major Cashin, I was witness to the man- 
               <br />
               ner in which the Chairman, Lord Addison, acted. 
               <br />
               I saw the great exhibition which he gave us as 
               <br />
               how not to answer a question, and how to avoid 
               <br />
               an issue. The noble lord had three stock answers, 
               <br />
               and when one failed he used the others. He said 
               <br />
               either that our question was one which we could 
               <br />
               not discuss as it was only in the power of the 
               <br />
               government to do so; or he said that the matter 
               <br />
               was already under consideration by the Commis- 
               <br />
               sion; and when all else failed, and he was ap~ 
               <br />
               parently stuck for an answer, he said he would 
               <br />
               make a note of what we said. I am prepared to 
               <br />
               believe that if the Chairman had been asked if we 
               <br />
               could have Bell Island towed to the mainland, he 
               <br />
               would reply that the Commission of Government 
               <br />
               had it under consideration. 
               <br />

               Some people in this country were somewhat 
               <br />
               astonished by the reports of the meetings of the 
               <br />
               delegation which appeared in the English papers, 
               <br />
               condemning the treatment we received. But 
               <br />
               having been on the inside I can say that the 
               <br />
               reports were what the old politicians used to call 
               <br />
               “critically correct." We brought home nothing 
               <br />
               from this trip, and the simple reason is that we 
               <br />
               were given nothing we could bring home. But it 
               <br />
               is often said that good sometimes comes out of 
               <br />
               evil. And from this angle I can say that we did 
               <br />
               bring something home, and that was the lesson 
               <br />
               that we can expect nothing from any outside 
               <br />
               sources that will be of any assistance to us in our 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">future.</span> It taught me that if Newfoundland is to get 
               <br />
               anywhere, if she is to make any progress, she 
               <br />
               must go ahead under her own steam and with her 
               <br />
               own native sons at the wheel.

               As a representative of the common man, as

               one whose adult life has been spent in the ranks 
               <br />
               of the workers, I have always had the interests of 
               <br />
               my fellow workers in mind. My politics are the 
               <br />
               politics of the common man. I know that if labour 
               <br />
               goes down to defeat, I must go with it. I know that 
               <br />
               if labour prospers, l prosper. And so it is that 
               <br />
               when I regard the position of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               today, I look at it from the attitude of the working

               man. In the present instance I tell the worker of 
               <br />

               <br />
               the United Kingdom or anywhere else for his 
               <br />
               future. He must, and I must, and we all must, look 
               <br />
