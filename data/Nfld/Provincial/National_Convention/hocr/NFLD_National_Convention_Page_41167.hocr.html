               unfair methods used by their opponents to gain 
               <br />
               their seats, but it is a signiﬁcant fact that New- 
               <br />
               foundland history was made not by confederates 
               <br />
               against anticonfederates, but by anticonfederates 
               <br />
               against confederates, for in the district of Burin, 
               <br />
               Carter and Evans, confederates, were elected by 
               <br />
               a matter of a few votes over LeMessurier and 
               <br />
               Woods, antis, and a celebrated case arose in 1870 
               <br />
               when the Assembly opened, with a question of 
               <br />
               who had actually been elected. When the hue and 
               <br />
               cry died down, Carter and Evans were sustained. 
               <br />
               You can be sure, Mr. Chairman, that if the con- 
               <br />
               federates had any reasonable ground for 
               <br />
               suspicion that they had been manoeuvered out of 
               <br />
               election by unfair practices, they would be the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst to raise a howl in every district, but as I said, 
               <br />
               the only side which did have good grounds for 
               <br />
               suspicion of unfair practices was the anticon—

               Now if there is any doubt in our minds that 
               <br />
               Britain was pushing confederation in 1869 and 
               <br />
               that that fact helped to wreck confederation

               Governor in connection with the terms of the

               learn, none of the ostentatious and rather silly

               theatricals which accompanied the reception of 
               <br />
               the proposals now under discussion. The 
               <br />
               despatches were from Lord Granville, Secretary 
               <br />
               of State for the Colonies, and said: “I have ex- 
               <br />
               pressed the hope that nothing will occur in New- 
               <br />
               foundland to delay the measures from which I 
               <br />
               confidently anticipate advantages to the 
               <br />
               Dominion Government and to the Colony.” A 
               <br />
               second despatch, sent to the Governor-General of 
               <br />
               Canada, said in part: “I believe it is in the interest 
               <br />
               of the whole of the British North American 
               <br />
               Colonies that they should be united under one 
               <br />
               government, and Her Majesty’s Government 
               <br />
               watches with much interest the successive steps 
               <br />
               that are being taken towards the accomplishment 
               <br />
               of this great end.” That was before the election 
               <br />
               was held. And after it was held, when the anticon- 
               <br />
               federate House of Assembly was opened on 
               <br />
               February 3, 1870, Governor Hill, in his opening 
               <br />
               speech said, amongst other things, with reference 
               <br />
               to the question of confederation, “The views of

               highest authorities on colonial affairs need no 
               <br />
               endorsement from me, for it is quite clear that the 
               <br />
               current of opinion and events has strongly set in 
               <br />
               towards union, and I firmly trust that nothing will 
               <br />
               occur to check, turn or defraud Newfoundland 
               <br />
               from gliding onward, and that the advance al- 
               <br />
               ready made may be continued until the Colony 
               <br />
               joins the Dominion, thus completing the great

               end so anxiously desired by the Imperial Govern-

               things, said, with reference to that paragraph in 
               <br />
               the Govemor’s speech just quoted, “The subject
