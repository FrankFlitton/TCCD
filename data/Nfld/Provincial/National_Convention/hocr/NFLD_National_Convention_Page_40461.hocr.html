               The family doctor is ﬁlling and has ﬁlled a

               inﬂuence which, when he is no longer available, 
               <br />
               leaves a void very difﬁcult to fill. The modern 
               <br />
               tendency for the majority of doctors graduating 
               <br />

               <br />
               tal facilities are readily procurable. In the rapid 
               <br />
               strides and advances that have taken place in the 
               <br />
               field of medical science and scientiﬁc knowledge 
               <br />
               it is admitted even by the layman that methods 
               <br />
               may quickly become outmoded; thus it is under- 
               <br />
               standable that doctors may prefer to join the staff 
               <br />
               of a hospital, but in the viewpoint of many who 
               <br />
               have had the valuable services of the family 
               <br />
               practitioner, they still much prefer to see the

               genial face of the family doctor, rather than 
               <br />
               having to take their sick to the hospital. There 
               <br />
               may be some who wonder if our medical services 
               <br />
               have not been extended too rapidly and spread 
               <br />
               out too thin, so to speak, and question if the 
               <br />
               country can afford to carry them. But the big 
               <br />
               question is, can the country afford not to have 
               <br />
               them? These cottage hospitals (a special feature 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland) are part of a system of

               The shortage of nurses is a serious problem. It 
               <br />
               is readily understood that hospitals require <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">doc»</span> 
               <br />
               tors and many nurses to staff them, and if they are

               this shortage will be gradually overcome. Many

               are not available. It has been questioned whether

               the spirit of self~sacriﬁce in this noble profession 
               <br />
               is not dying out. Personally I do not think it is. I

               understand the same situation exists in Canada.

               <br />
               may account for some of the shortage. During the 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               many entered the teaching profession.
