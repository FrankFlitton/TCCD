               Mr. Crosbie As far as I know the government 
               <br />
               purchased the 5,000 sacks for Canada because 
               <br />
               the Canadian price is much higher than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ours,</span> To

               amount of other feed and our government ab- 
               <br />
               sorbed the extra loss. We are only allowed to 
               <br />
               export sufﬁcient ﬁsh meal so that there would be 
               <br />
               enough left for the country. As far as the shortage 
               <br />
               now is concerned, I don’t think it can be serious 
               <br />
               because there is a firm in Burin (the Monroe
