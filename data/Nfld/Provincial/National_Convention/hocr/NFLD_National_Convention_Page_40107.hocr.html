               matter that concerns both ethics and morals, 
               <br />
               especially when today’s doctrine of materialism 
               <br />
               has crept, it seems, even into our own councils of 
               <br />
               state. “Every man for himself and the devil take 
               <br />

               <br />
               and don’t be bothered by scruples. Proponents of 
               <br />
               this doctrine always make one mistake. They 
               <br />
               forget the integrity of the individual conscience; 
               <br />

               <br />
               may be just as wise in honour; are quite blind to 
               <br />
               the fact that some men will not barter that honour

               others, if we supported the motion now before the 
               <br />
               house. To put it even more clearly, I was told by 
               <br />
               Mr. Small-wood, that I was slated to be a member 
               <br />

               The members of this Convention are supposed 
               <br />
               to have an open mind. They are supposed to ﬁrst 
               <br />
               examine the country’s position to see whether or 
               <br />

               honest opinion, even at this stage, there is a limit

               One member at the earlier public sessions of 
               <br />
               the Convention expressed himself rather strongly 
               <br />
               on forms of government and other things, and 
               <br />
               was unfavourably criticised. Yet another mem- 
               <br />
               ber, elected on a deﬁnite platform, has been as 
               <br />

               majority of them to his hotel room, and en—

               Smallwood’s point of view, but when we con-

               <br />
               the Canadian government, or simply for his con-

               not yet fully informed on matters affecting the 
               <br />
               economy of Newfoundland I do not understand 
               <br />
               why we should take any action in connection with 
               <br />
               confederation at this time; may I therefore move 
               <br />
               as an amendment to Mr. Smallwood’s motion
