               Mr. Cashin Mr. Chairman, I move that the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               item on the order paper be deferred, and draw 
               <br />
               your attention, and the attention of the House to 
               <br />
               the fact that a couple of questions have not been 
               <br />
               answered — one I asked on Friday last in connec- 
               <br />
               tion with the Savings Bank, and another one 
               <br />
               asked on November 24. Part of it has been 
               <br />
               answered; and another part has not been 
               <br />
               answered, that is die part relative to the Bank of 
               <br />
               Canada. I am very anxious that we be either 
               <br />
               denied such an answer or given one, because as I 
               <br />
               said on Friday, these two particular matters are of 
               <br />
               the utmost importance, one part on the New- 
               <br />
               foundland Savings Bank, and the other part on 
               <br />
               the Bank of Canada. Our whole discussion rests, 
               <br />
               in my opinion, on these two matters. I would like 
               <br />
               to have the Secretary ask the government whether 
               <br />
               we are going to get these answers or not.

               Mr. Chairman With regard to your question 
               <br />
               about the Savings Bank, Major Cashin, I am 
               <br />
               afraid I will have to assume responsibility be—

               <br />
               my attention until this afternoon. It was tabled 
               <br />
               Friday, and I missed it, and it was not until this 
               <br />
               afternoon that my attention was drawn to it. Im- 
               <br />
               mediately after I called a meeting of the Informa- 
               <br />

               <br />

               of the utmost importance, and our request has 
               <br />

               other questions regarding Canadian ﬁnancial

               <br />
               information. The debate on these confederation 
               <br />
               terms is coming rapidly to an end, it will come to 
               <br />
               an end this week, and I take it that a number of 
               <br />
               members in the Convention desire to speak, and 
               <br />
               I am wondering just what is the right method, and 
               <br />
               the best method, of deciding who may and who 
               <br />
               may not speak. Now I took particular notice of 
               <br />
               the fact that when Major Cashin gave a nod to 
               <br />
               Mr. Fogwill, he got up to speak, and when Major 
               <br />
               Cashin gave a nod to Mr. Higgins, Mr. Higgins 
               <br />
               got up and spoke.

               <br />
               Higgins. Now what I want to know is this, to 
               <br />
               whom is the next nod to be given, after Mr. 
               <br />
               Higgins ﬁnishes? Is Mr. Cashin to give the nod, 
               <br />
               or Mr. Higgins? If Mr. Butt, for example, is to 
               <br />
               follow Mr. Higgins, will he wait till Mr. Higgins 
               <br />

               <br />
               get the nod from him. Well, sir, would he get it , 
               <br />
               from you? Who is Chairman here? Who decides, 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               did not give me a nod.... There is no giving nods 
               <br />
               around here. As far as I am concerned there’s no 
               <br />
               giving nods to people. Mr. Smallwood has been 
               <br />
               giving nods himself a long time now. We will 
               <br />
