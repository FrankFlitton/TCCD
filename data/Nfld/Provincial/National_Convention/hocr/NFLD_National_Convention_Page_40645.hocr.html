               of our per capita debt. Every now and then a great 
               <br />
               furor is made over the fact that our per capita debt 
               <br />
               is comparatively lower than that of some other 
               <br />
               countries. Thus the Finance Report notes with a 
               <br />
               gleam in its eye or maybe with its tongue in its 
               <br />
               check, that our per capita debt is $237, the per 
               <br />
               capita debt of Canada is $1,387, that of Great 
               <br />
               Britain approximately $1,900, and that of the 
               <br />
               United States $1,853. So far, so good. But all that 
               <br />
               is a lot of statistics, sound and fury signifying 
               <br />
               nothing much in particular. Our per capita debt 
               <br />
               has a certain signiﬁcance when it comes to the 
               <br />
               interpretation of our ﬁnancial position. But the 
               <br />
               fact that it is lower than that of some other 
               <br />
               countries is of absolutely no signiﬁcance as an 
               <br />
               index of our economic power to provide for our— 
               <br />
               selves. Nevertheless, many Newfoundlanders 
               <br />
               seem to derive some measure of economic as— 
               <br />
               surance for the morrow from these facts. That 
               <br />
               comes very likely from the confused notion that 
               <br />
               the average Newfoundlander is, in some mystic 
               <br />
               way, better off than the average Canadian, be- 
               <br />
               cause he has but $250 per capita debt hanging 
               <br />
               over his head, whereas his counterpart across the 
               <br />
               Gulf has a per capita debt of $1,375 hanging over 
               <br />
               his. However, the economy of Canada is much 
               <br />
               more capable of carrying the burden of its per 
               <br />
               capita debt than is the economy of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               at carrying ours. I may add that in the instance of 
               <br />
               Canada and the United States, the national debts 
               <br />
               are to a large extent internally contained, whilst 
               <br />
               ours is overwhelmingly an external debt. They 
               <br />
               owe their per capita debts across the street. We 
               <br />
               owe ours across the Atlantic. These are the essen- 
               <br />
               tial considerations, and as I have said the current 
               <br />
               comparison of the per capitas signiﬁes nothing 
               <br />
               much in particular. Something of decided sig- 
               <br />
               nificance would be if comparative statistics of 
               <br />
               our per capita income were to show New- 
               <br />
               foundland well out in front. However, such statis- 
               <br />
               tics we rarely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">see,</span> and I wonder if it could be 
               <br />
               because they do in actual fact show New- 
               <br />
               foundland well to the rear.

               The second example I have in mind arises out 
               <br />
               of the current protestations that Newfoundland is 
               <br />

               If we consult the statistics of revenue and

               expenditure over the years, we observe that 
               <br />
               public finance in this island has ﬂuctuated

               <br />
               adventure of being sovereign unto ourselves, the 
               <br />
               revenue of Newfoundland was but a meager half- 
               <br />
               million dollars. There may be some among us 
               <br />
               who may be inclined to work themselves up into 
               <br />
               italics at the thought that government in those 
               <br />
               days could manage with so little, and who work 
               <br />
               themselves up further into injunctions to the 
               <br />
               government of these days to go and do likewise. 
               <br />
               There are others, however, well inclined to 
               <br />
               wonder, and l have heard them wondering so, out 
               <br />
               loud, if, since there was a gaunt half-million 
               <br />
               dollars to manage with in the ﬁrst place, we 
               <br />
               should have been granted responsible govem- 
               <br />
               ment at all. After all, they reason, to undertake 
               <br />
               responsible government is to undertake to pro- 
               <br />
               vide the population with many more public and 
               <br />
               social services. We still had those 6,000 miles of 
               <br />
               coastline in those days, even if there was only 
               <br />
               120,000—odd people to spread along them; and 
               <br />
               just how could it have been expected to serve in 
               <br />
               any adequate manner or fashion, so little spread 
               <br />
               out so widely? They are inclined to think that it 
               <br />
               would have made just as much sense, perhaps 
               <br />
               more, to have granted responsible government to 
               <br />
               Ferryland or Bell Island. They wonder if the 
               <br />
               founding fathers of this nation did not bite off
