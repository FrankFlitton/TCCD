               <br />

               case the proposal is favourably reported upon, it 
               <br />
               will then be submitted to the electorate for their

               That is a definite pledge to the people of this 
               <br />
               country. On that pledge that party was elected to 
               <br />
               ofﬁce. They carried out the ﬁrst part of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro»</span>

               gram. A royal commission was appointed, came

               On February 28, 1933, the same gentleman, now 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister, introduced a resolution 
               <br />
               which I am not going to bore you by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reading:</span> It 
               <br />
               is interesting to note extracts from his talk on that 
               <br />
               momentous <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">occasion,</span> He said, “We are a part of 
               <br />
               the British Commonwealth of Nations and it is a 
               <br />
               proud boast that no British Dominion ever went 
               <br />
               back on its pledged <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">word.</span> Are we to be the first? 
               <br />
               What will it profit us if we retain responsible 
               <br />
               government and lose our souls, our honour, in the 
               <br />
               end?” Mr. Alderdice said ~— and I want this to be 
               <br />
               listened to attentively <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~</span> he had always felt that 
               <br />
               after all the vote was a theoretical thing and not 
               <br />
               all that it was cracked up to be. He said, “In the 
               <br />
               new form” —— meaning the Commission — “not 
               <br />
               one man will know the difference and he could 
               <br />
               see as a result of it more prosperity in the 
               <br />
               country.” He could see more capital invested 
               <br />
               because capitalists would see they are taking no 
               <br />
               chances. Commenting on the conversion of our 
               <br />
               debt to 3% he said, “The United Kingdom

               wound up his remarks on this famous or infamous

               These words speak for themselves. These

               pened? You, sir, as leader of the Opposition, 
               <br />
               asked that the resolution be deferred for a week.

               resolutions, in which it was stated that as soon as

               request of the people, responsible government 
               <br />
