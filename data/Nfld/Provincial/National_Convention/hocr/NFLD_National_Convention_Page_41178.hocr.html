               education clause —~ not only read it, but take note 
               <br />
               of the most peculiar position that arose out of the 
               <br />
               debate before Christmas I cannot recall the exact 
               <br />
               day that Mr. Smallwood made, what I consider, 
               <br />
               a revelation. On this matter Mr. Smallwood was 
               <br />
               rather humble, I thought; not only on behalf of 
               <br />
               himself, but of the rest of us as well. I do not recall 
               <br />
               the exact words, but I think the gist of his remarks 
               <br />
               went something like this: now here is this educa- 
               <br />
               tion question — a matter of conscience as the 
               <br />
               Canadian Prime Minister pointed out in his letter 
               <br />
               — something on which Newfoundlanders feel 
               <br />
               very strongly. Now, we in this Convention are 
               <br />
               just a bunch of ordinary fellows, ﬂoundering 
               <br />
               through, so to speak —- we’re not the heads of the 
               <br />
               denominations, so we cannot be expected to ap— 
               <br />
               preciate the implications of this clause. There- 
               <br />

               <br />
               perfectly at liberty to address a letter or some 
               <br />
               other communication to —— now I’m not sure if 
               <br />
               Mr. Smallwood said the Convention or the 
               <br />
               Canadian government, but I believe it was the 
               <br />
               latter, expressing their opinions and suggesting 
               <br />
               changes or alterations.

               most peculiar position that has arisen in this

               <br />
               most assuredly, as far as I am concerned, take on 
               <br />
               the aspects of negotiation and nothing else.

               Now, on the clause as it stands. It appears to

               have covered every angle and stopped all the 
               <br />
               loopholes, but before leaving it I would like to 
               <br />
               point out that other and similar clauses were 
               <br />
               written into the BNA Act on the same matter 
               <br />
               when other provinces were being taken into con- 
               <br />
               federation — “taken in” is probably the right term 
               <br />
               for it, too. For instance, Manitoba — BNA Act, 
               <br />
               section 22 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(2).,"</span> That was in 1870 when 
               <br />
               Manitoba became a province. But what happened 
               <br />
               in 1890, 20 years after? The Liberal government 
               <br />
               of the day uniﬁed the schools in a non-sectarian 
               <br />
               system. There was a great stir over it, an appeal 
               <br />
               was made to the clause in Manitoba’s terms, 
               <br />
               especially the section which, in effect, meant that 
               <br />
               the federal government could override the 
               <br />
               provincial govemment’s decision on this matter. 
               <br />
               But when the appeal was made, Sir Wilfred 
               <br />
               Laurier pointed out that while the federal govem- 
               <br />
               merit might by legislation direct the correction of 
               <br />
               the grievance, it had no power to intervene in the 
               <br />
               administration of education in Manitoba; for 
               <br />
               education, after all, was a responsibility of the 
               <br />
               province. So that clause to safeguard the separate 
               <br />
               denominational schools in Manitoba was not 
               <br />
               worth the paper it was written on, anymore than 
               <br />
               clause 19 in these so~called terms. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now, sir, I have ﬁnished my references to 
               <br />
               specific clauses and I wish to make a few 
               <br />
               general remarks on the Grey Book. In the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               place, they are not terms of union, as their 
               <br />
               proponents are striving so hard to assert. The 
               <br />
               delegation to Ottawa had no power to negotiate 
               <br />
               terms. Its job was to ascertain if a fair and equi- 
               <br />
               table basis existed for the entry of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               into the Dominion of Canada. Out of their three 
               <br />
               month stay came the two Black Books, incom- 
               <br />
               plete as we have discovered, and regardless of 
               <br />
               how or when it came, this Grey Book, titled 
               <br />
               Proposed Arrangementr for the Entry of New- 
               <br />
               foundland into Confederation. The dictionary 
               <br />
               deﬁnes “arrangement” as the “act of arranging or 
               <br />
               putting in an orderly condition, the state of being 
               <br />
               so arranged; disposition in suitable form”. A very 
               <br />
               general deﬁnition, and one which ﬁts this Grey 
               <br />
               Book very well. It is a nice arrangement of a basis 
               <br />
               of union set down in 23 clauses and several 
               <br />
               annexes. The dictionary deﬁnes “terms”, on the
