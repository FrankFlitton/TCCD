               We also know of the inﬂationary processes 
               <br />
               which are at work, which have been controlled to 
               <br />
               a certain extent by rationing and by rigid govem— 
               <br />
               ment control. These forces of inﬂation are forces 
               <br />
               over which we have very little control; and we 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that there is a tendency for these things to 
               <br />
               encroach upon our economy. Not only are these 
               <br />
               controls being exercised over foodstuffs, but also 
               <br />
               over foreign exchange, and that has a tendency to 
               <br />
               stagnate trade. When the time comes when goods 
               <br />
               will flow freely, then we know trade will prosper. 
               <br />
               Progress is limited by how much debt load the 
               <br />
               people can carry. I am not unmindful of the fact 
               <br />
               that when Newfoundland lost its credit, it lost its 
               <br />
               government. Governments depend upon money 
               <br />
               to ﬁnance them and governments have to extract 
               <br />
               certain amounts from the people in order to 
               <br />
               ﬁnance not only their ordinary expenditures, but 
               <br />
               also to provide as best they can for capital expen- 
               <br />
               ditures. When we consider the revenues and ex- 
               <br />
               penditures of the governments of the past, when 
               <br />
               we see the total revenue on the one side, I would 
               <br />
               like to see the total expenditure on the other side. 
               <br />
               How can I draw a fair picture, if I see a total on 
               <br />
               one side and do not see a total on the other side? 
               <br />
               That is why it is rather difﬁcult for a layman to 
               <br />
               understand the intricacies of government 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁnance.“</span> That is one thing I would like to ask 
               <br />
               Major Cashin. Having given us the total revenue, 
               <br />
               could he give us the total expenditure? 
               <br />

               Mr. Cashin In recent years the budget speeches 
               <br />
               included capital expenditure as well as ordinary 
               <br />
               expenditure. It is difﬁcult to segregate them. It 
               <br />
               would have taken considerable time if we had. In 
               <br />
               the Finance Report we did our best to separate the 
               <br />
               capital expenditure from the ordinary expendi- 
               <br />
               ture. In the Economic Report we have attempted 
               <br />
               to point out that we consider $25 million to be the 
               <br />
               ordinary expenditure, to pay the ordinary expen- 
               <br />
               ses of the country; anything over and above that 
               <br />
               would be capital expenditure. Is that what you 
               <br />
               want to know?

               Mr. Cashin I cannot tell you offhand I will

               check up.... Since Commission of Government

               tures all capital expenditures as well as ordinary 
               <br />
               expenditures. For the period of the last 12 or 13 
               <br />
               years, particularly during the last ﬁve or six 
               <br />
               years, they spent a considerable amount in addi- 
               <br />
               tion to the ordinary administration of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern»</span> 
               <br />
               ment. They have spent, so far as we could tell 
               <br />
               from the accounts, approximately $20 million, 
               <br />
               probably more, on capital or construction or spe— 
               <br />
               cial expenditures. You will find it in the estimates 
               <br />
               for each year. You will find estimates for expen- 
               <br />
               ditures have always been exceeded, as well as 
               <br />
               estimates of revenue. In 1946-47 they budgeted 
               <br />
               for $30 million in revenues, and the revenues 
               <br />
               went up to $34-37 million. They also budgeted 
               <br />
               for expenditures of $34 million. When the ac- 
               <br />
               counts were wound up, we ﬁnd the expenditures 
               <br />
               were $37 million. So while the revenues have 
               <br />
               increased, the expenditures have increased 
               <br />
               proportionately each year.
