               I believe would take a matter of several weeks; 
               <br />
               so that we might then picture at some future date 
               <br />
               ——— two or three weeks from now —— a reply, 
               <br />
               through you, coming to this house to the effect 
               <br />
               that the Government of Canada will not deal with 
               <br />
               this Convention; or a reply from the Government 
               <br />
               of Canada that they will deal with this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Con»</span> 
               <br />
               vention. That would be the next step that this 
               <br />
               Convention would hear about, if the motion is 
               <br />
               adopted. Two or three weeks from now a reply 
               <br />
               would be brought in to us through you, sir, that 
               <br />
               the Government of Canada would or would not 
               <br />
               receive a delegation from this National Conven- 
               <br />
               tion. If it would not receive such a delegation, 
               <br />
               then the matter dies so far as this Convention and 
               <br />
               the succeeding national referendum are con— 
               <br />
               cerned. On the other hand, if the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada will receive a delegation of this Conven- 
               <br />
               tion, and to those delegates impart the terms as 
               <br />
               that government saw them, of confederation of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland with Canada, then it would still 
               <br />
               be some time after that word was received before 
               <br />
               the delegation could go. I do not see myself, in 
               <br />
               the nature of things, in the circumstances, how 
               <br />
               any such delegation could actually go before 
               <br />
               some time in December and possibly some time 
               <br />
               in the month of January. By December or by 
               <br />
               January this Convention, we hope, if it is not to 
               <br />
               sit here forever, will have received a number of 
               <br />
               reports from the committees and will have com- 
               <br />
               pleted its debate on some of these reports and will 
               <br />
               probably have them, or nearly all of them, in hand 
               <br />
               and under discussion. These reports are the data 
               <br />
               and facts of Commission government; they are 
               <br />
               the data and facts of responsible government; the 
               <br />
               thing we lack is the facts and data of confed- 
               <br />
               eration. If any gentleman in this House will move 
               <br />
               that we approach the Government of the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom seeking to learn from them what help, 
               <br />
               if any, they will give this country under Commis- 
               <br />
               sion Government, I will support that motion. If 
               <br />
               any gentleman moves that we approach the 
               <br />
               United States, not for federal union, because that 
               <br />
               is not allowed unless we pass a resolution extra- 
               <br />
               legal and extra-constitutional, and that I will not 
               <br />
               support; I will support any motion proposing any 
               <br />

               more upon the motion itself, but merely the 
               <br />
               amendment. 1 wish it could be understood by the 
               <br />
               gentlemen of this Convention, whatever they 
               <br />
               may think of me—I wish it would be understood, 
               <br />

               <br />
               this result, that if in the month of October, the 
               <br />
               month of November and part of the month of 
               <br />
               December we are debating the various reports of 
               <br />
               the above committees, and perhaps carry those 
               <br />
               debates over into the month of January, perhaps 
               <br />
               February, and then, having debated Commission

               government and responsible government, be- 
               <br />
               cause that’s what these reports are, having then 
               <br />
               done that, we decide rather late, maybe up in the 
               <br />
               winter, that we have none of the facts of con- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">federation.</span> It could be a month or two months 
               <br />
               after we had decided to seek those facts from 
               <br />
               Canada before we got them. It might be up in the 
               <br />
               month or March or April before we have the facts 
               <br />
               of confederation. That is why, sir, I oppose the 
               <br />
               amendment moved by my friend Mr. Penney, on 
               <br />
               the ground that delay, for even a month or two, 
               <br />
               might result in our debating the facts of con- 
               <br />
               federation in March, April or May of next year, 
               <br />

               <br />
               we have to adopt the motion now, and that’s why 
               <br />
               I oppose Mr. Penney’s amendment, which I 
               <br />
               believe he moved with all sincerity and genuine
