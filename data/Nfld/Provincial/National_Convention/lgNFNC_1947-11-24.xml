            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> Mr. Chairman, we have come to the 
     <lb/>
     famous "diaper bonus" and I was surprised at the 
     <lb/>
     complacent attitude of Mr. Smallwood that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Job would pay. As a layman, I was wondering 
     <lb/>
     how Mr. Job would pay, since when I am finished 
     <lb/>
     with this job I intend to go fishing, and to land 
     <lb/>
     and sell at Bonavista Cold Storage, of which, I 
     <lb/>
     am informed, Mr. Job and associates are the 
     <lb/>
     owners. Now, I am perplexed. Will Mr. Job for<lb break="no"/>get he has a "diaper bonus" to pay and give me 
     <lb/>
     the full value for the fish I'll land, or go in a dory 
     <lb/>
     and fish for the bonus himself, or will he, with 
     <lb/>
     that bonus in mind, take it out of me? I'm afraid 
     <lb/>
     he will. I have dragged up my family, and it looks 
     <lb/>
     like I've got to help bring up others. You have 
     <lb/>
     always got to pay it, even a young man today, 
     <lb/>
     when he gets up to the age of 40, with kids up to 
     <lb/>
     16; you go on paying the "diaper bonus" until you 
     <lb/>
     are 70, when you get the "whisker bonus". 
     <lb/>
     Another vicious circle. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have been doing a little delving this past 
     <lb/>
     10-30 years into matters of taxation and I have 
     <lb/>
     some figures before me which I think should be 
     <lb/>
     brought before our people, for if this farce goes 
     <lb/>
     through and our people ever get tax-conscious, 
     <lb/>
     they will be in virtual revolt. Let us examine the 
     <lb/>
     happy Zion to which our confederate apostle is 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           

     leading us. The leader of this movement is paint<lb break="no"/>ing a picture that cannot but cheer the heart of 
     <lb/>
     every toiler in this island home of ours. I wish I 
     <lb/>
     could subscribe to it, but I must have used up all 
     <lb/>
     my optimism on the Economic Report. Why the 
     <lb/>
     pessimism? It's simply this: ever since I came 
     <lb/>
     into this Convention I have heard nothing but the 
     <lb/>
     hardships of our system of taxation, and I had 
     <lb/>
     really hoped that in the leap towards Zion that 
     <lb/>
     tough road would be smoothed over; but I am 
     <lb/>
     disappointed! First fixings first. I don't want to go 
     <lb/>
     meandering around from Quirpon to Grand Falls, 
     <lb/>
     so here it is. We heard a royal address about 
     <lb/>
     taking from the rich and giving to the poor. I'll 
     <lb/>
     say more about that later, for that's up my alley, 
     <lb/>
     but this before us unfortunately is not so, for I'm 
     <lb/>
     going to lump the two big social sums together, 
     <lb/>
     the "diaper bonus" and the "whisker bonus". 
     <lb/>
     They cost, together, $342 million. 
     <lb/> </p>

            <p>Now in that grand Dominion they have a sales 
     <lb/>tax and I'll quote:<ref target="#fn_02">[2]</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>The sales tax hitherto has always been con<lb break="no"/>sidered as one of the most vicious forms of 
     <lb/>regional taxation. It hits every man, woman, 
     <lb/>child and babe in arms, totally regardless of 
     <lb/>income; but the federal government plans to 
     <lb/>collect $325 million in sales tax this year, 
     <lb/>against $298 million collected last year, for 
     <lb/>the major taxpayers in Canada are the poor 
     <lb/>people of Canada, not only in the income tax 
     <lb/>as the figures readily prove, but in the fact

            <p>
     ....I have no way to tell the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country what this will cost them, no way to find 
     <lb/>
     out what the sales tax will cost this country, as I 
     <lb/>
     don't think there is any way to find out the 
     <lb/>
     volume of business; but I believe the federal sales 
     <lb/>
     tax is 8%. Let us see how this tax works out with 
     <lb/>
     regard to Mr. Smallwood's assertion that the rich 
     <lb/>
     would pay for this family allowance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This most vicious tax hits every man, woman, 
     <lb/>
     child and babe in arms after they collect from 
     <lb/>
     those citizens, old and young. First we have a 
     <lb/>
     sales tax income of $325 million which will pay 
     <lb/>
     for the family bonus of $260 million and the old 
     <lb/>
     age pension of $82 million within $17 million of 
     <lb/>
     both expenses. Now in heaven's name, how can 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood say that this is soaking the rich; 
     <lb/>
     it even soaks the family allowance itself, for if a 
     <lb/>
     woman with one child buys $5 worth of essentials 
     <lb/>
     per month, she chips back into the family al<lb break="no"/>lowance ante 40 cents. Is that soaking the rich? I 
     <lb/>
     think this should clear up this matter of who soaks 
     <lb/>
     who. The unassailable fact is that the cents are 
     <lb/>
     taken from everybody. The man who has his 
     <lb/>
     family dragged up, and wants to go a little easier, 
     <lb/>
     every time his wife goes to the shop to spend a 
     <lb/>
     buck, she chips in eight cents towards the raising 
     <lb/>
     of somebody else's kids; even if he is 60 and finds 
     <lb/>
     it hard to do a day's work. It's simple for us to 
     <lb/>
     have a baby bonus that way. So, to me at least, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood's plan is not so good. He has 
     <lb/>
     made a wonderful table of all the places by dis<lb break="no"/>tricts. Let us take the shops in those districts and 
     <lb/>
     find out the volume of business they do. Put on 
     <lb/>
     the sales tax and see what they will send out to 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa. Remember it will be taken from the 
     <lb/>
     earnings of the berries, the rabbits, the spuds you 
     <lb/>
     sell, also the few dozen eggs. Everything goes in 
     <lb/>
     the ante, as I see it. Just figure to yourself. Just 
     <lb/>
     count the number of dollars you spend in a year 
     <lb/>
     and take eight cents out of each of them, and 
     <lb/>
     you'll find out what the baby bonus and the old 
     <lb/>
     age pension will cost you. Remember this bonus 
     <lb/>
     doesn't come from the federal government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. It comes from the people.... Sorry this is 
     <lb/>
     so long, but I want the people to know.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     They have also in Canada what is known as 
     <lb/>
     excise taxes which bear heavily on the common 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
           

     man. It amounts to $290 million. Time forbids me 
     <lb/>
     to handle it here, only to point out that added to 
     <lb/>
     the sales tax of $325 million it brings in $615 
     <lb/>
     million, enough to pay for the family allowance 
     <lb/>
     and the old age pension and leave a balance of 
     <lb/>
     $273 million. This excise tax is a superduper 
     <lb/>
     sales tax of which I will have more to say later. 
     <lb/>
     The reason for referring to it now is to show that 
     <lb/>
     it is not the rich who are paying for those services, 
     <lb/>
     but the very poor as well. It is a case of passing it 
     <lb/>
     from one pocket to another. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think in all honesty, the next time we send a 
     <lb/>
     delegation to Canada, in light of this, we should 
     <lb/>
     get a financial expert, for had I been there I would 
     <lb/>
     have pushed it down their throats that this was 
     <lb/>
     anything but a bargain. They may be able to fool 
     <lb/>
     all their people, and we may be too green to burn, 
     <lb/>
     but they can't fool a green Newfoundlander. 
     <lb/>
     Some people take umbrage at the word "baby 
     <lb/>
     bonus" but to my mind I can call it nothing else 
     <lb/>
     — an inducement for people to have children, but 
     <lb/>
     it's not financially sound and tends not to the 
     <lb/>
     betterment of a people. If the money could be 
     <lb/>
     raised by another way but by a sales tax, then I 
     <lb/>
     could see the good of it, but this way it's a 
     <lb/>
     detriment to a man who is trying to get ahead, 
     <lb/>
     while it subsidises those who look on life as a 
     <lb/>
     period of procreative activity. I don't give much 
     <lb/>
     credit for the financial brains of this Dominion if 
     <lb/>
     they can't devise a better way to produce the 
     <lb/>
     funds to pay for those great services. Let us have 
     <lb/>
     them. I know it can be done, and of that I will 
     <lb/>
     speak later. I think this is a good argument against 
     <lb/>
     our turning our country over again to remote 
     <lb/>
     control. It seems we have been pikers in the past 
     <lb/>
     in the art of tax collection. See how easy it is. 
     <lb/>
     Anybody who has a shop is a tax collector. I can 
     <lb/>
     now see a reason for all the stores in New<lb break="no"/>foundland. They can now take the place of the 
     <lb/>
     civil service.<ref target="#fn_03">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I will now read the list of goods exempted 
     <lb/>
     from sales tax in Canada, as you will find in the 
     <lb/>
     Black Book....<ref target="#fn_04">[2]</ref> These are your exemptions from 
     <lb/>
     the sales tax. If for instance, take my friend Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Northcott across the way, if he was to hang his 
     <lb/>
     hand — as I have seen in the small stores in the 
     <lb/>
     United States — over the cash register, and you 
     <lb/>
     drop in your 8% on every dollar you spend, I 
     <lb/>
     wouldn't be surprised at the end of the year that 
     <lb/>

     Mr. Northcott would be able to pay a pretty good 
     <lb/>
     baby bonus in the district of Lewisporte. Now I 
     <lb/>
     think I've come to the end of what I've got to say. 
     <lb/>
     And I believe that we should not pass these terms. 
     <lb/>
     There's been a lot of talk about them, and I think 
     <lb/>
     the time has come for our people to know just 
     <lb/>
     what they are. And I believe that we should 
     <lb/>
     debate them in every way, bit by bit, even if we're 
     <lb/>
     here till Tib's Eve,<ref target="#fn_05">[1]</ref> and thrash it out so that our 
     <lb/>
     people can understand what it's all about. I know 
     <lb/>
     that our people today are looking for a promised 
     <lb/>
     land. It's something they've heard so much 
     <lb/>
     about, a land of lower taxes; but, what is it going 
     <lb/>
     to gain us tomorrow if we take off the customs 
     <lb/>
     tax, put on a sales tax and a superduper excise 
     <lb/>
     tax? We can easily have a family allowance in 
     <lb/>
     this country and old age pensions if we wish to 
     <lb/>
     take 8% out of every dollar that goes around, no 
     <lb/>
     odds how many times it goes around in this 
     <lb/>
     country. I'm afraid when you come to weigh up 
     <lb/>
     the 117,000 children and weigh up what money 
     <lb/>
     they're taking, we have no way to find out. One 
     <lb/>
     record we couldn't find in this country as we've 
     <lb/>
     been going through our work, is the amount of 
     <lb/>
     business that's done in the country. Because you 
     <lb/>
     can't gauge the money in a country by looking at 
     <lb/>
     what it sends out and brings in. You have to have 
     <lb/>
     a bird's-eye view of how many times that dollar 
     <lb/>
     goes around, when you're paying taxes on the 
     <lb/>
     dollar that's moving around. So Mr. Chairman 
     <lb/>
     and gentlemen, I believe that we're going to learn 
     <lb/>
     a lot from this Ottawa vacation. So let's have 
     <lb/>
     some more of it from Mr. Smallwood.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
    <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Bailey, I don't think you're 
     <lb/>
     justified in referring to it as a vacation. I've 
     <lb/>
     already ruled Mr. Smallwood out of order on that 
     <lb/>
     point and I'm entitled to assume that however 
     <lb/>
     erroneous or mistaken the members of that 
     <lb/>
     delegation may have been in the proper evalua<lb break="no"/>tion of their duties, I'm not prepared to allow the 
     <lb/>
     remark to stand that they were on a vacation. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I apologise, Mr. Chairman. I only 
     <lb/>meant it as a joke. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I've already ruled that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood couldn't make that remark and I.... 
     <lb/>
     You made the remark, you directed the remark to 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins and I had to ask you to withdraw it 
     <lb/>
     the other day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Sir, I was only referring to the 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
         

     remark that he had made.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I know. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> So let us have some more. "Avant", 
     <lb/>
     as they would say in Quebec. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CRAN1">Mr. Cranford</persName> It seems to me if I am correct, the 
     <lb/>
     list Mr. Bailey read out is all exempt from 8% 
     <lb/>
     sales tax. We have to pay no sales tax at all. I 
     <lb/>
     don't know if I'm correct on that or not. But the 
     <lb/>
     list that he read out, it makes it all clear of 
     <lb/>
     everything 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> On page 139,<ref target="#fn_06">[2]</ref> foodstuffs, exemp<lb break="no"/>tions under foodstuffs — salt. I was wondering is 
     <lb/>
     fisheries salt exempted from sales tax? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I don't know if it's the intention 
     <lb/>
     of the gentlemen in the Convention to discuss 
     <lb/>
     taxation in Canada and Newfoundland at every 
     <lb/>
     point where a clause comes up for debate. Satur<lb break="no"/>day, we debated family allowances. The next 
     <lb/>
     item is old age pensions and pensions for the 
     <lb/>
     blind. The item after that is unemployment in<lb break="no"/>surance and then sick mariners' benefits for mer<lb break="no"/>chant seamen and fishermen, and after that 
     <lb/>
     assistance for housing. If we're going to have a 
     <lb/>
     discussion of taxation on each one of these items, 
     <lb/>
     I would be optimistic and say that we should 
     <lb/>
     finish this Convention sometime in 1953. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> At the same time, if you don't 
     <lb/>
     mind Mr. Smallwood, the impact of taxation 
     <lb/>
     upon the people of this country has to be taken 
     <lb/>
     into account, and side by side with any benefits 
     <lb/>
     which are proposed to be conferred. Because let 
     <lb/>
     us remember that benefits and liabilities are co<lb break="no"/>dependent.... I think it perfectly relevant.... 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes sir, I'm not at all for a 
     <lb/>
     moment...

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> This arose out of you being asked 
     <lb/>
     point-blank to state who was going to pay this

     <lb/>
     the rich. I just tried to tell the people in my 
     <lb/>
     estimation, now I may be wrong....

     under the thin guise of point of order. You can

     only interrupt the Speaker if you rise to either a

     ruling, I'm not for one moment questioning the 
     <lb/>
     right of the Convention to raise the question of 
     <lb/>
     taxation as and when it likes all through this 
     <lb/>
     debate on these terms. But if that is to be done, 
     <lb/>
     where will we be when we arrive at the point in 
     <lb/>
     our debate where taxation is to be discussed? 
     <lb/>
     There is a point in this document where taxation 
     <lb/>
     will be gone into. But if all we're going to hear 
     <lb/>
     when family allowances, old age pensions, pen<lb break="no"/>sions for the blind, unemployment insurance, 
     <lb/>
     sick mariners' benefits for merchant seamen and 
     <lb/>
     fishermen, and every point that's raised here, is 
     <lb/>
     taxation, while it may be perfectly legal and 
     <lb/>
     perfectly parliamentary, I do suggest it is going 
     <lb/>
     to cover a vast range of ground and take a tremen<lb break="no"/>dous amount of time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I accept that position Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, butI'll remind you that I'm absolute<lb break="no"/>ly helpless on the matter. If in connection with 
     <lb/>
     this proposed arrangement, the question of taxa<lb break="no"/>tion is raised, that is touching the ability of per<lb break="no"/>sons to pay, then obviously I think out of 
     <lb/>
     necessity I must rule that the remarks are in 
     <lb/>
     order.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I would suggest, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, to the gentlemen of the Convention it might 
     <lb/>
     help us to get along a bit quicker if they reserve 
     <lb/>
     discussion of taxation till the time when the mat<lb break="no"/>ter comes up. They will not find me slow or 
     <lb/>
     unwilling to discuss taxation in Canada, and the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian taxation that would apply to New<lb break="no"/>foundland and I don't think they will find me 
     <lb/>
     entirely ignorant of the subject. I think on the 
     <lb/>
     contrary they may discover that I've given the 
     <lb/>
     matter some study. I didn't spend three months in 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa exactly doing nothing. So with your per<lb break="no"/>mission sir.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I quite agree that a considerable 
     <lb/>
     time may be saved if members could note the 
     <lb/>
     various questions that they want to make on 
     <lb/>
     various items, then ask them when we've got 
     <lb/>
     through this document. Instead of making a series 
     <lb/>
     of speeches, perhaps they could cover all the 
     <lb/>
     points they had in mind by perhaps one speech or 
     <lb/>
     two speeches as the case may be. Otherwise it 
     <lb/>
     may very well be, as I previously said, that in<lb break="no"/>stead of completing the business of this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion and getting through by Christmas, we may 
     <lb/>
     be here till Judgement morning.

     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Excuse me one second. It's not my 
     <lb/>
     intention to interrupt you Mr. Smallwood, but I 
     <lb/>
     think that it might be relevant to point out that 
     <lb/>
     $250 million annually spent on baby bonuses or 
     <lb/>
     family allowances, represents a 60% increase 
     <lb/>
     over the normal expenditure of the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada in 1939. I don't think that's a question 
     <lb/>
     of taxation, but it might be relevant to point that 
     <lb/>
     out. It represents for Canada in ordinary expen<lb break="no"/>diture on government account an increase of 
     <lb/>
     60%. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> Mr. Chairman, on Friday Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood stated that the population of Canada is 
     <lb/>
     around 12,500,000. They get $250 million in 
     <lb/>
     baby bonuses, we'll call them for the time being, 
     <lb/>
     that works out around $20 per head. So on the 
     <lb/>
     same basis I presume that Newfoundland would 
     <lb/>
     have about the same proportion of children under 
     <lb/>
     16 years of age as they would have in Canada. 
     <lb/>
     It's not a matter of being critical at all, it's just to 
     <lb/>
     keep the record straight because our people were 
     <lb/>
     listening in, and I've been asked already on the 
     <lb/>
     street how we arrived at these figures. We say our 
     <lb/>
     population is around 320,000, approximately. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore we would get around $6,400,000. Now 
     <lb/>
     the chairman of the Ottawa committee reported 
     <lb/>
     it to be in the vicinity of $8,200,000 and in 
     <lb/>
     another statement he said around $750,000 a 
     <lb/>
     month, which would work out around $9 million, 
     <lb/>
     which is one-third over the approximate amount 
     <lb/>
     I take it we would get, admitting that we have 
     <lb/>
     117,000 children.... Of course, I don't know what 
     <lb/>
     the Chairman feels about that, I find it difficult to 
     <lb/>
     see how we can evade talking forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment when we're debating a form of government 
     <lb/>
     in itself. I'm wondering what position our Chair<lb break="no"/>man is going to be in when we touch a rather 
     <lb/>
     delicate point. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I'd like to put you straight on 
     <lb/>
     that question now. The procedure under which 
     <lb/>
     this report was to be debated was not a matter for 
     <lb/>
     the Chairman at all. It was a question of proce<lb break="no"/>dure which was decided by the Convention itself 
     <lb/>
     when the motion to resolve the Convention into 
     <lb/>
     a committee of the whole was adopted. As far as 
     <lb/>
     I'm concerned the manner in which any docu<lb break="no"/>ment coming before the Chair is to be discussed, 
     <lb/>
     or the procedure to be employed in the discussion 
     <lb/>
     of any document, is one for the Convention. I 
     <lb/>
     would like to point out, Mr. Vardy, I quite realise 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="818" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-24_Page_0818.jpg"/>

     the difficulties, but at the same time I would ask 
     <lb/>
     members to remember that we're discussing the 
     <lb/>
     financial terms, and I would like members to 
     <lb/>
     confine themselves, insofar as practically pos<lb break="no"/>sible, to confine themselves to the financial 
     <lb/>
     aspects rather than the purely political aspects to 
     <lb/>
     which we'll come in due course after and when 
     <lb/>
     we terminate the present debate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> That is exactly the view I've taken 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, and so far as we've gone I believe 
     <lb/>
     that most of the members have agreed fairly well 
     <lb/>
     in that respect. But I was a bit puzzled at the 
     <lb/>
     beginning, wondering if we wouldn't in a very 
     <lb/>
     short time reach a deadlock. But I feel that I 
     <lb/>
     would appeal to Mr. Smallwood — rather than 
     <lb/>
     get sore at him — to try to cut short the various 
     <lb/>
     explanations. I have no wish in the world to cut 
     <lb/>
     short this debate. I voted, as you all know, to send 
     <lb/>
     a delegation to Canada on each occasion the 
     <lb/>
     resolution came up. I have no regrets along these 
     <lb/>
     lines except that there were certain disappoint<lb break="no"/>ments in the length of time it took. But we're into 
     <lb/>
     this thing now and I believe we should let the 
     <lb/>
     public know the facts to the best of our ability, so 
     <lb/>
     that eventually they will be able to arrive at the 
     <lb/>
     proper conclusions and digest the various bits of 
     <lb/>
     information as we hand it out to them. I feel that 
     <lb/>
     ...everyone of us should go all out to make a very 
     <lb/>
     special effort to wind up the work of this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion before the end of the year. I really think we 
     <lb/>
     have wasted some time. So I think we should be 
     <lb/>
     very conscious over this fact and when we rise to 
     <lb/>
     our feet, try to be as constructive as possible and 
     <lb/>
     let the people know the truth as we see it. In that 
     <lb/>
     way only will we be able to do justice to the 
     <lb/>
     districts we represent and the country as a whole. 
     <lb/>
     Now I believe we're moving on to old age pen<lb break="no"/>sions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> To be fair to you, Mr. Vardy, I 
     <lb/>
     must identify myself unqualifiedly with every<lb break="no"/>thing that you said.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> I'm satisfied, sir, to take up the 
     <lb/>
     question of taxation when we come to it, that's if 
     <lb/>
     we do. But while Captain Bailey did raise the 
     <lb/>
     question of general sales tax, I was curious to 
     <lb/>
     know whether the sales tax was applied to or 
     <lb/>
     imposed on fishery salt. I'd like to have an answer 
     <lb/>
     to that. Where do we find the exemption in these 
     <lb/>
     books? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> If it's not in the book, I'll 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
          

     produce documentary evidence officially to that 
     <lb/>
     effect. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> I cannot find it in the book. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I understand that. Now, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Is there any other... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Vardy seemed a little 
     <lb/>
     doubtful about the actual amount of money that 
     <lb/>
     would be paid out in Newfoundland, to children 
     <lb/>
     under 16, in family allowances each year. We had 
     <lb/>
     in 1945, 117,000 children under sixteen. That is 
     <lb/>
     official from the census of 1945. Because our 
     <lb/>
     population is increasing at the rate of 1.1% per 
     <lb/>
     year, that would make today a little over 1 17,000 
     <lb/>
     children under the age of 16. The average taken 
     <lb/>
     based on actual experience is $6 a child each 
     <lb/>
     month. The amount varies according to the 
     <lb/>
     child's age. It's $5 a month up to the age of six; 
     <lb/>
     $6 over the age of six and under ten; $7 over ten 
     <lb/>
     and under 13; $8 over 13 and under 16. When I 
     <lb/>
     say under 16, I mean, up to the last day before the 
     <lb/>
     sixteenth birthday is counted as 15 years of age. 
     <lb/>
     Now, there are little reductions. When you pass 
     <lb/>
     the fourth child in a family, that child gets a dollar 
     <lb/>
     less per month and the fifth child I think the same. 
     <lb/>
     The sixth child is cut by $2. But the average is 
     <lb/>
     taken universally in all government records, 
     <lb/>
     based on their experience, at being $6 a month. 
     <lb/>
     Well, 117,000 children in Newfoundland in 1945 
     <lb/>
     at $6 is $702,000 a month or $8,424,000 a year. 
     <lb/>
     And the actual amount will increase accordingly, 
     <lb/>
     as our population is increasing at the rate of 1.1%. 
     <lb/>
     So it's a fair anticipation that in three or four 
     <lb/>
     years, instead of 117,000 children under 16, it'll 
     <lb/>
     be well over 120,000; in another three, four or 
     <lb/>
     five years it'll be up around 125,000; and as that 
     <lb/>
     number grows, so will the amount of money paid 
     <lb/>
     out. That's just in reply to Mr. Vardy. I am not 
     <lb/>
     going, at this time, to reply to his point about 
     <lb/>
     where the money comes from to pay the family 
     <lb/>
     allowances. We all know it comes from the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> In fairness to Mr. Vardy and

     other members, it is your intention, is it, to wel<lb break="no"/>come at least these other questions?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Of course, sir, of course. We 
     <lb/>
     can't discuss this business without knowing ex<lb break="no"/>actly what the taxation system is in Canada,

     because if we were to become a province, that

            <p>
     Old age pensions and pensions for blind
<lb/>persons are non-contributary pensions sub<lb break="no"/>ject to a means test and paid under a
<lb/>Dominion-provincial plan. The provinces are
<lb/>responsible for the administration, and the
<lb/>Dominion pays 75% of the cost of the pen<lb break="no"/>sions paid in accordance with the terms of the
<lb/>agreements made under the authority of the
<lb/>Dominion's Old Age Pensions Act. Before
<lb/>entering into an agreement with the
<lb/>Dominion, the province must have legisla<lb break="no"/>tion authorising the provincial government to
<lb/>pay pensions and to make an agreement with
<lb/>the Dominion for reimbursement by the
<lb/>Dominion of its share of the cost of pensions.
<lb/>Before an agreement can come into force the
<lb/>plan for the administration of pensions 
     <lb/>proposed to be adopted by the province must
<lb/>be approved by the Governor in Council.
<lb/>(That is of course the governor in council of
<lb/>the Government of Canada.) An agreement
<lb/>continues in force so long as the provincial
<lb/>statute remains in operation, or until after the
<lb/>expiration of ten years from the date the
<lb/>Dominion notifies the province of its inten<lb break="no"/>tion to terminate the agreement. Under the
<lb/>provisions of the Dominion Act, the province
<lb/>is free to fix in its agreement both the maxi<lb break="no"/>mum pension payable and the maximum in<lb break="no"/>come allowed within the limits specified in
<lb/>the act. The Dominion's contribution, how<lb break="no"/>ever, can not exceed 75% of $30 a month in
<lb/>any case, and is payable only where the pen<lb break="no"/>sioners fulfill the requirements set forth in the
<lb/>Dominion Act and the regulations made there
<lb/>under.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The principal requirements are age, resi<lb break="no"/>dence and income. For an old age pensioner,
<lb/>the age at which pension may be granted is<lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            

        70 years and for a blind pensioner 21 years.
<lb/>The act requires that an applicant must have
<lb/>resided in Canada for the 20 years immedi<lb break="no"/>ately preceding the date of the proposed com<lb break="no"/>mencement of the pension. Both the act and
<lb/>the regulations, however, make special
<lb/>provision for pensioners who have been ab<lb break="no"/>sent during the 20 year period. The maximum
<lb/>income, including the pension allowed in the
<lb/>case of an unmarried old age pensioner, is
<lb/>$600 a year; and in the case of a married old<lb/> 
               <lb/>
    age pensioner, $1,080 a year. Higher 
     <lb/>amounts are allowed for blind pensioners and 
     <lb/>for married old age pensioners with spouses 
     <lb/>who are blind. The transfer of property by an 
     <lb/>applicant or his spouse may delay the grant<lb break="no"/>ing of a pension. The provincial pension 
     <lb/>authority must decide whether or not an as<lb break="no"/>signment or transfer of property was made 
     <lb/>for the purpose of qualifying the applicant for 
     <lb/>pension, or for a higher pension then he 
     <lb/>would otherwise receive. After pension is 
     <lb/>granted, a provincial pension authority may, 
     <lb/>if authorised by provincial legislation, en<lb break="no"/>cumber any real property owned by the pen<lb break="no"/>sioner. No province requires an applicant to 
     <lb/>turn over his property to the provincial 
     <lb/>government either before or after granting 
     <lb/>pension. In its agreement with the Dominion, 
     <lb/>a province agrees to deal with an application 
     <lb/>in manner prescribed by regulation, and to 
     <lb/>grant pension to any person residing in the 
     <lb/>province if satisfied that he is eligible to 
     <lb/>receive pension. Each province also agrees to 
     <lb/>pay the pension of any pensioner who trans<lb break="no"/>fers his permanent residence to such 
     <lb/>province, and to reimburse any other 
     <lb/>province to the extent of 25% of $30 monthly 
     <lb/>or the amount of pension granted, whichever 
     <lb/>is the lesser, where the pensioner during the 
     <lb/>last 1,095 days that he was present in Canada 
     <lb/>prior to reaching pensionable age, or prior to 
     <lb/>making application whichever is the later, 
     <lb/>was present in such province for a greater 
     <lb/>number of days than in any other province. 
     <lb/>The details of administration are contained in 
     <lb/>the Dominion Old Age Pension Regulations. 
     <lb/>The act authorises the Governor in Council 
     <lb/>to make the regulation setting up an inter-

     pensions regulations are regulations made by

     Now, I don't know to what extent that 
     <lb/>
     memorandum will be intelligible to the members 
     <lb/>
     without having it before them to read, and pos<lb break="no"/>sibly the Secretary of the Convention might be 
     <lb/>
     prepared to mimeograph it and lay it on the desk 
     <lb/>
     of each member. But in brief the story is this:<ref target="#fn_07">[1]</ref> it 
     <lb/>
     is not the Government of Canada which pays the 
     <lb/>
     old age pension to the people of Canada. It is the 
     <lb/>
     provinces — each one of the nine provinces pays 
     <lb/>
     the pension, and it pays it according to its own 
     <lb/>
     provincial law.... The province can pay $1,000 a 
     <lb/>
     month if it likes, but if the provincial pensions 
     <lb/>
     authority enters into an agreement with the 
     <lb/>
     federal government, the federal government 
     <lb/>
     says, "We will hand over to you 75% every 
     <lb/>
     month of $30 ($22.50) a month." But if the 
     <lb/>
     federal government hands over $22.50 to be paid 
     <lb/>
     out in old age pension, the provincial government 
     <lb/>
     must put $7.50 with it, making it up to $30 per 
     <lb/>
     month for people who have reached the age of 70 
     <lb/>
     years. It is not paid to everyone as the family 
     <lb/>
     allowance is. There is a means test. You can get 
     <lb/>
     $30 a month old age pension if you need it. You 
     <lb/>
     can get it and still have a private income of your 
     <lb/>
     own from any source whatever of $240 a year, 
     <lb/>
     $600 altogether.... If you earn over that much, 
     <lb/>
     here is what happens. If you get $250 a year, $10 
     <lb/>
     will be taken off the pension. If I should have a 
     <lb/>
     private income of $300 a year, then my old age 
     <lb/>
     pension is not $360 a year, it is cut down to $310. 
     <lb/>
     If I have a wife, the same thing applies. If she is 
     <lb/>
     70 she gets $30 in just the same way. That is $60 
     <lb/>
     a month from old age pensions between the two. 
     <lb/>
     The only difference is that when the man and wife 
     <lb/>
     get a pension of $720 a year, they are not allowed 
     <lb/>
     more than $1,080 total income.... Take a man 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
          

     living in an outport; owns his own home; not 
     <lb/>
     earning any money at all; maybe he is sick; 
     <lb/>
     maybe he cannot work; maybe he cannot get a 
     <lb/>
     job. He does not get $240 a year; maybe he does 
     <lb/>
     not get 240 cents. But he has a house; if he did 
     <lb/>
     not have a house, he would have to pay rent. So 
     <lb/>
     the provincial pensions authority has the right to 
     <lb/>
     say this, ... "If you did not own that house you 
     <lb/>
     would have to pay rent, that is worth $96 a year 
     <lb/>
     income because you own and occupy that house." 
     <lb/>
     If it is worth $10 a month, that is $120 a year. He 
     <lb/>
     is still under the $240 — $20 a month is counted 
     <lb/>
     as income. How many homes in the outports that 
     <lb/>
     are worth up to $20 a month rent and occupied 
     <lb/>
     by persons of 70 and over, I do not know.... If 
     <lb/>
     they are, that is $240 a year income. If the rental 
     <lb/>
     value be $260, then that is $20 taken off the old 
     <lb/>
     age pension. It is not taken off his wife's pension 
     <lb/>
     — it is taken off the person who owns the house. 
     <lb/>
     One other point: the pension is paid starting at the 
     <lb/>
     age of 70 only to those who need it; 75% comes 
     <lb/>
     from the Government of Canada and 25% from 
     <lb/>
     the provincial government. $750,000 a year 
     <lb/>
     would be our share of the old age pensions. We 
     <lb/>
     now pay $260 a year for old age pensions, be<lb break="no"/>cause we do not pay until a man is 75 and then 
     <lb/>
     only $30 a quarter for two — man and wife — 
     <lb/>
     $10 a month, that is what we pay....  
     <lb/> </p>

            <p>But this must be made very clear. If a person 
     <lb/>reaches the age of 70 and gets the old age pension, 
     <lb/>until he dies his property is his own. No one else 
     <lb/>owns it but himself. When he dies it is his 
     <lb/>widow's; nobody gets it but her. When she dies, 
     <lb/>if no one has contributed to their support, the 
     <lb/>government steps in, and out of the estate, if it is 
     <lb/>worth $2,000 or more, the government takes back 
     <lb/>the pension it paid. The idea is this: the old age 
     <lb/>pension is only paid to those who need it. It was 
     <lb/>not got up for rich men, wealthy men, men fairly 
     <lb/>well off, or for people who have sons and 
     <lb/>daughters who can help them out. It was gotten 
     <lb/>up for people who need the help. There is a means 
     <lb/>test.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HILL2">Mr. Hillier</persName> I would like to ask Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>a question. We all want to be fully informed on 
     <lb/>these matters and we want to be sure things are 
     <lb/>as they are. In the case of old age pensions, will 
     <lb/>any claim be made by pension authorities on 
     <lb/>property of a pensioner after his death? Or will a 
     <lb/>son, to whom said property may be willed, be 
     <lb/>

     it is not necessary to make any long comments or

     <lb/>
     of our ability.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> One point I did not mention 
     <lb/>
     was the blind. If a blind person of 21 years or

     older, who has satisfied the same residence

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> Mr. Chairman, we are dealing now 
     <lb/>
     with aged people, up around 70 years of age, and 
     <lb/>
     I think that the one thing above all others we 
     <lb/>
     should not do is, we should not try to kid the 
     <lb/>
     children. Let's try to give them a fair, true angle 
     <lb/>
     as it stands. Now I believe the facts are, and I am 
     <lb/>
     sure Mr. Smallwood will correct me if I go 
     <lb/>
     wrong, that we have around 12,000 persons in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland around 70 years of age. I take it 
     <lb/>
     that not more than 5% of these would be living in 
     <lb/>
     rented homes. The first qualification on the ap<lb break="no"/>plication, or the means test, that is given to these 
     <lb/>
     men, would be that they could not at any time 
     <lb/>
     during the period when they would be receiving 
     <lb/>
     old age pensions assign or transfer their property 
     <lb/>
     to their heirs or successors, in order to evade 
     <lb/>
     having the state come in eventually and take their 
     <lb/>
     property for the amount of pension they have 
     <lb/>
     received. Now in my time I have filled out, 
     <lb/>
     without exaggeration, anwhere from 40 to 50 old 
     <lb/>
     age pension forms for people, and while Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood was explaining this clause my 
     <lb/>
     thoughts were going back to thees people. I can 
     <lb/>
     think of them at this moment almost by name, in 
     <lb/>
     the past 30 years or around there, and I have been 
     <lb/>
     at various time in various communities, and I can 
     <lb/>
     say without fear of contradiction that I have never 
     <lb/>
     signed an old age pension form without having it 
     <lb/>
     go through. Now if any of these men had to 
     <lb/>
     submit to the means test, as I understand it ... 
     <lb/>
     think of one individual who would today be 
     <lb/>
     receiving his old age pension. For the simple fact 
     <lb/>
     is that if they knew, or his sons, married or single 
     <lb/>
     knew, that when poor old dad reaches 72 or 75 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            

     and passes on to his great reward the state steps 
     <lb/>
     in and takes the property to pay for the old age 
     <lb/>
     pension he received, to begin with they would not 
     <lb/>
     allow him to accept his old age pension. If these 
     <lb/>
     old age pensioners knew that that was going to 
     <lb/>
     happen they would not apply for that old age 
     <lb/>
     pension — in a great many cases, there are iso<lb break="no"/>lated cases of course. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Up to $2,000 or more. The es<lb break="no"/>tate must be valued at around $2,000 or more. 
     <lb/></p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> Of course it depends also on the 
     <lb/>value that would be put on the property in the 
     <lb/>outports. For instance a humble little home of two 
     <lb/>stories 20 x30 and so on, in the city of St. John's 
     <lb/>would be valued at around $3-4,000 probably, 
     <lb/>whereas the same home in the outports would be 
     <lb/>valued at $3-400....A $2,000 home in an outport 
     <lb/>in Newfoundland, on a forced sale, has to be quite 
     <lb/>a good property. And I take it also that the 
     <lb/>auditors would give the applicant for the old age 
     <lb/>pension the benefit of the doubt. No one would 
     <lb/>be incline to over-estimate the value of any 
     <lb/>property, but... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Could I interrupt? The assess<lb break="no"/>ing of the value of the property is done by the 
     <lb/>
     local, the Newfoundland pensions authority. It is 
     <lb/>
     they who fix the value of the property, not the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada, but the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, and they base it on the general 
     <lb/>
     value of the property in and around the same 
     <lb/>
     locality. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Maybe, Mr. Vardy, you could 
     <lb/>
     clear up something for me. Maybe while you are 
     <lb/>
     on the subject you might care to address Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood on whether or not I am correct in 
     <lb/>
     assuming that the assessment does not take place 
     <lb/>
     unless and until the property is taken over. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> ... I honestly feel that there would be 
     <lb/>
     a very limited number under these conditions in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland qualified for, or even applying for 
     <lb/>
     the old age pension. The feeling exists in New<lb break="no"/>foundland, rightly or wrongly, among the old, 
     <lb/>
     aged fishermen, that when they reach the age of 
     <lb/>
     75 years, even though they have a few dollars in 
     <lb/>
     the sock as it is often referred to, and they have a 
     <lb/>
     humble property around them, the boys take over 
     <lb/>
     the fishing gear and go about their way to make 
     <lb/>
     their living, that they should get the old age 
     <lb/>
     pension, and I believe that if the means test was 
     <lb/>
     very severe, that there would be a number at this 
     <lb/>
     very moment eliminated from the list. I would not 
     <lb/>
           

            <pb n="822" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-24_Page_0822.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">822</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw>
          

     agree with it. Personally I feel that we cannot do 
     <lb/>
     too much for these people who toiled and sup<lb break="no"/>ported a family, all of them raised large families, 
     <lb/>
     and contributed so much towards the general 
     <lb/>
     revenue of this country, that we should go on, as 
     <lb/>
     far as possible, increasing the amounts paid the 
     <lb/>
     old age pensioners. We know we have not 
     <lb/>
     reached the stage yet where we have done any<lb break="no"/>thing like full justice to these people. But they 
     <lb/>
     are, Mr. Smallwood, they are as I see it very 
     <lb/>
     stringent qualifications. You can get the pension, 
     <lb/>
     yes sure, providing your property is not valued at 
     <lb/>
     over $2,000, but... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No, no. You can get the pen<lb break="no"/>sion if your income each year is not over $600. 
     <lb/>
     Your yearly income must be $600 before you are 
     <lb/>
     barred from getting the old age pension. If it is 
     <lb/>
     $500 a year then you get $100 pension. If your 
     <lb/>
     income is $400 a year then you get $200 pension 
     <lb/>
     a year. You have got to have an income of $600 
     <lb/>
     a year all your own before you are barred from 
     <lb/>
     the old age pension. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Now then, the other point Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Vardy wants to know is whether or not the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of your property enters into it at all. Is there 
     <lb/>
     any question of assessment where the property 
     <lb/>
     occupied by the pensioner does not exceed 
     <lb/>
     $2,000? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No sir, it does not matter what 
     <lb/>
     the property of a man is, once he reaches the age 
     <lb/>
     of 70, providing his income from that property 
     <lb/>
     does not go over $600 a year. It does not matter 
     <lb/>
     if it is worth $10,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> Could Mr. Smallwood tell us 
     <lb/>
     what part of the act that $2,000 refers to? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am glad Mr. Hickman raised 
     <lb/>
     that. If Mr. Vardy does not mind there, the posi<lb break="no"/>tion is this: there is an Old Age Pensions Act. 
     <lb/>
     Here it is. There was an amendment passed to it 
     <lb/>
     by the Parliament while we were in Ottawa. Here 
     <lb/>
     is is, July 1947, and then here are the statutory 
     <lb/>
     orders and regulations made under the Old Age 
     <lb/>
     Pensions Act, and it is the regulations that govern 
     <lb/>
     the conditions under which the whole thing is 
     <lb/>
     carried out. Now these regulations are made by 
     <lb/>
     the interprovincial Old Age Pensions Authority. 
     <lb/>
     Every province has its own old age pensions 
     <lb/>
     authority, say three men appointed to administer 
     <lb/>
     old age pensions. Every province has that. Now 
     <lb/>
     on top of all of them there is an interprovincial 
     <lb/>
     Old Age Pension Authority, made up of provin<lb break="no"/><cb/>cial authorities. They meet once or twice a year, 
     <lb/>
     and every province is represented in it. They meet 
     <lb/>
     once or twice a year to decide all questions under 
     <lb/>
     the act, but the actual carrying out of it is done in 
     <lb/>
     the province itself by the provincial authority, 
     <lb/>
     and the figure that has been fixed throughout the 
     <lb/>
     entire Dominion by the interprovincial authority, 
     <lb/>
     made up of all the nine provinces (ten if we were 
     <lb/>
     in) is $2,000 per house. Not house only, but 
     <lb/>
     house, land, boats and any property a man has, 
     <lb/>
     must be worth $2,000 or more, before that part of 
     <lb/>
     it comes in at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Hickman's question is 
     <lb/>
     when and how was that arbitrary figure of $2,000

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, sir, I have the act in my

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> It is not in the act. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No; the act cannot cover every<lb break="no"/>thing, so they set up regulations under the act, like 
     <lb/>
     all acts of Parliament the very act itself gives the 
     <lb/>
     authority, who are going to administer the act, 
     <lb/>
     power to make regulations under the act. These 
     <lb/>
     regulations must not be different from the act 
     <lb/>
     itself. Well, to make these regulations there is this 
     <lb/>
     interprovincial authority, made up of all the old 
     <lb/>
     age pensions authorities of all the provinces. 
     <lb/>
     They make the regulations and they meet once or 
     <lb/>
     twice a year for that purpose, and all the provin<lb break="no"/>ces are represented in it. Here's the actual 
     <lb/>
     memo....

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> Is that binding on every pro<lb break="no"/>vince?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, because all the provinces 
     <lb/>
     are represented in the Interprovincial Pensions

     would be represented in it too, and it is binding 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes. If you will allow me - <lb/> the provincial government can subscribe as much 
     <lb/>
     as it likes. For instance in the province of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     today the old age pension is $40 a month, but the 
     <lb/>
     federal government only contributes $22.50 a 
     <lb/>
     month, and the rest is paid by the province. The 
     <lb/>
     province could make it $50 a month, but the 
     <lb/>
     federal government only gives $22.50. You see? 
     <lb/>
     Is that clear? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> Let's get down to realities now, Mr. 
     <lb/>

     Smallwood, because I am not anxious at all to 
     <lb/>
     paint a gloomy or pessimistic picture, but the 
     <lb/>
     position is really this: that in order to qualify the 
     <lb/>
     first thing you have to do is literally rent your own 
     <lb/>
     home from yourself. You place a value on it of 
     <lb/>
     say $20 a month, say $240 a year. That is con<lb break="no"/>sidered as part of your yearly income. You stated 
     <lb/>
     that yourself. Let's accept that as a fact. Now then 
     <lb/>
     the pension is valued next — $30 a month, $360 
     <lb/>
     a year—so that gives us the $600. In other words 
     <lb/>
     a pensioner can't really have any income outside 
     <lb/>
     the home he is living in, and the pension he hopes 
     <lb/>
     to receive. That is really the position isn't it? If 
     <lb/>
     he has any other income he can't qualify for a 
     <lb/>
     pension on that income or be assisted in some 
     <lb/>
     way or another. Is there such a thing as a part 
     <lb/>
     pension, say $100 a year, or $200 a year? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, of course. If an old age 
     <lb/>
     pensioner has a house in Joe Batt's Arm, and it is 
     <lb/>
     valued at $240 a year, that is $240 a year income 
     <lb/>
     he has — if it is valued at $20 a month, which is 
     <lb/>
     pretty high; $20 a month in most outports would 
     <lb/>
     be very, very high. It is nearer $5, or $6 or $8 or 
     <lb/>
     $10 a month. But if it is valued at $240 a year, 
     <lb/>
     $20 a month straight, then he can still make $100 
     <lb/>
     ayear, but that cuts his pension by $100 a year, 
     <lb/>
     and instead of getting $360 a year then he gets 
     <lb/>
     $260. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
           

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> In other words you may be getting 
     <lb/>
     $240 a year from the government towards your 
     <lb/>
     pension, and I may be getting $360. Is that it? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, that's right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> I never heard it explained that way. 
     <lb/>
     I did not know that such a scheme existed. I 
     <lb/>
     thought you had to qualify or disqualify for your 
     <lb/>
     pension. Let us assume that is the position. There 
     <lb/>
     is one undeniable fact, isn't there Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood, in fairness to these people that we owe the 
     <lb/>
     whole truth to, it is a fact that they must hold their 
     <lb/>
     property while they are drawing the old age pen<lb break="no"/>sion from the state, and in the end finally the state 
     <lb/>
     would take the position that if the sons or 
     <lb/>
     daughters refused to assist in any way towards 
     <lb/>
     their support, that it would be the state's right, if 
     <lb/>
     they accepted the old age pension under these 
     <lb/>
     conditions, to step in and take over sufficient of 
     <lb/>
     the property to repay the state for the amount they 
     <lb/>
     had paid out in old age pension? I take it that's 
     <lb/>
     the true position isn't it? Give the people the 
     <lb/>
     facts, that's my idea. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That's right. I thought I had 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
          

     said that. Now bearing on that, as I said before 
     <lb/>
     the old age pension is only given to people who 
     <lb/>
     need it. It is not meant for people who don't need 
     <lb/>
     it. But if a person is qualified for the old age 
     <lb/>
     pension by age, in other words he is 70 years of 
     <lb/>
     age, then they come to figure the income of that 
     <lb/>
     person, mother's allowances will not be included 
     <lb/>
     as income. You can get mother's allowance of 
     <lb/>
     course, but you would be pretty old at 70 to get 
     <lb/>
     mother's allowance, but there may be cases of it. 
     <lb/>
     Family Allowances again, at 70 if you were a 
     <lb/>
     woman you would be pretty old at 70 to have 
     <lb/>
     children under 16, but that is not counted as 
     <lb/>
     income, cost of living allowances are not counted 
     <lb/>
     as income.... If a man gets a military allotment 
     <lb/>
     from a son or daughter in active service in time 
     <lb/>
     of war that is not counted as income. Direct relief 
     <lb/>
     ... is not counted as income. Casual gifts of small 
     <lb/>
     value all not counted as income.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now further, when for the purpose of assess<lb break="no"/>ing the value of a man's house, what the yearly 
     <lb/>
     value would be in that locality the Pension 
     <lb/>
     Auditor says this house in Joe Batt's Arm is worth 
     <lb/>
     $9 a month (the same house in St. John's might 
     <lb/>
     be worth a lot more), but it's taken $3 a month to 
     <lb/>
     keep it up. It gets a coat of paint every four years, 
     <lb/>
     or a coat of tar every year or second year. 
     <lb/>
     Whatever the average cost of maintaining the 
     <lb/>
     house is, that's taken off from the annual rental 
     <lb/>
     value. I don't know if there is any other point 
     <lb/>
     here. This is the act itself that I am quoting 
     <lb/>
     from.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If I may, on this old age pension, I don't want 
     <lb/>
     to delay the matter, I am finished now when I 
     <lb/>
     make this observation. Here Mr. Starkes could be 
     <lb/>
     of a great deal of help if he would be so kind. The 
     <lb/>
     question is: "What is the value of the average 
     <lb/>
     home in the outports?" Now I know there are 
     <lb/>
     places in Newfoundland besides the outports, St. 
     <lb/>
     John's is not an outport, but thinking for a minute 
     <lb/>
     of the outports. What is the average home worth? 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Vardy puts it at $5-800, or $1,200-1,500. He 
     <lb/>
     did not get up as far as $2,000. In Admiral's Cove 
     <lb/>
     in Mr. Starkes's district there are four persons of 
     <lb/>
     70 and over. No, I have got the wrong district, I 
     <lb/>
     mean Mr. Goodridge's district. In Aquaforte, 
     <lb/>
     there are four persons. In Bay Bulls 46, in Bear 
     <lb/>
     Cove one, Big Pond two, Biscay Bay five, Brigus 
     <lb/>
     South one, Calvert five, Cape Broyle 15, Cape 
     <lb/>
     Pine 27, Cape Race one, Cappahayden none, 
     <lb/>
     Collier's Cove six, Stanleys Point three, Drook 
     <lb/>

     Point one, Ferryland l6, Goulds 14, Island Cove 
     <lb/>
     one, Kingman's Cove 13, La Manche one, Long 
     <lb/>

     Cove nine, River Head four, St. Michaels four,

    Ferryland-St.  Mary's as it was in the last general  
     <lb/>election. That is the way they take it in the census. 
     <lb/>The census district is the same as the House of 
     <lb/>Assembly district. In those groups where the 
     <lb/>average house occupied by these people of 70 and 
     <lb/>over if they died, would these properties run, or 
     <lb/>would many of them run, up to $2,000 or over? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:GOOD1">Mr. Goodridge</persName> No, I should not think much 
     <lb/>more than $4-500. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I think we may take it that both 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Vardy and Mr. Goodridge are right, and all 
     <lb/>
     of us with our knowledge of Newfoundland, I 
     <lb/>
     think that in the average outport it is a rare home 
     <lb/>
     that will be worth $2,000 at the death of the 
     <lb/>
     pensioner. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> Mr. Chairman, I feel I should clarify 
     <lb/>
     that a little, and qualify my statement there to 
     <lb/>
     some extent, in fairness to everyone. I did not say 
     <lb/>
     that the average home in the outports would not 
     <lb/>
     be worth more than $400. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No, I did not understand you to 
     <lb/>
     say that. What I understood you to say was that a 
     <lb/>
     house that might fetch $3,000 in St. John's would 
     <lb/>
     be worth $3-400 in an outport. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> To give the true position, it is exactly 
     <lb/>
     this: I have never yet seen an application for old 
     <lb/>
     age pension where they valued their property at 
     <lb/>
     more than $2,000. Now the question arises of 
     <lb/>
     course, and the question we should ask ourselves 
     <lb/>
     in fairness to these people is this: Will the pension 
     <lb/>
     authorities under a provincial government place 
     <lb/>
     a different value on an applicant's property in the 
     <lb/>
     outports or in St. John's from the value placed by 
     <lb/>
     the applicant himself? You see we must look at 
     <lb/>
     both sides of it. Here is the applicant. Here is the 
     <lb/>
     authority. I have many times seen application 
     <lb/>
     forms for various kinds of assistance questioned 
     <lb/>
     on the grounds that the means test may be perhaps 
     <lb/>
     coloured a little. An old age pensioner goes to a 
     <lb/>
     clergyman and gets his form filled out and then 
     <lb/>
     he goes to a J P and two or three others and gets 
     <lb/>
     them to sign it, and someone has to pull a few 
     <lb/>
     strings or do a little scratching down in the 
     <lb/>
     department in the course of the next six months 
     <lb/>
     to get his name on the list. Now I honestly feel 
     <lb/>
     that while on a forced sale the average old age 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
           

     pensioner in the outports would not value his 
     <lb/>
     property at more than $500 to $1,500, at the same 
     <lb/>
     time I fear that under any new set-up the amounts 
     <lb/>
     are going to be increased, and the burden would 
     <lb/>
     be perhaps increased to such a position that they 
     <lb/>
     would have to move cautiously in accepting the 
     <lb/>
     various applications, the means test would be 
     <lb/>
     more severe. We must be fair to these people and 
     <lb/>
     tell them the whole truth, and in doing that we 
     <lb/>
     have to show both sides of the picture. The 
     <lb/>
     average outport home, as we know the property 
     <lb/>
     around them is worth such more than the amount 
     <lb/>
     I have stated for the average person who would 
     <lb/>
     be applying for an old age pension and submitting 
     <lb/>
     to a means test. His property would not be worth 
     <lb/>
     more than around $500 to $1,500. That is the real 
     <lb/>
     true picture. Let's give the people the facts so that 
     <lb/>
     they will understand it right. There's two sides to 
     <lb/>
     it. The auditors may value that property at $2,000 
     <lb/>
     or $2,500, and these people would be up against 
     <lb/>
     a stone wall in getting the old age pensions. That 
     <lb/>
     is the position.

     the province, or whether it is the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada, I don't know — has a lien on all 
     <lb/>
     old age pensioners' property. With regard to 
     <lb/>
     property being valued at $2,000, a great bulk of 
     <lb/>
     the property in my locality could not be replaced 
     <lb/>
     at less than $5,000. Whatever value the govern<lb break="no"/>ment would put on it, I do not know. Take this 
     <lb/>
     lien. You have to remember we are in the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of Newfoundland, not the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     of Canada. Take young boys, six or eight years 
     <lb/>
     old; they start carrying rocks off the ground and 
     <lb/>
     they work on the land right up to the time they 
     <lb/>
     are young men. Sometimes they are on it 40 years 
     <lb/>
     before the old man passes out; the property 
     <lb/>
     belongs to them just as much as it does to their 
     <lb/>
     father. When father married he took over virgin 
     <lb/>
     territory; as the sons grew up they helped clear 
     <lb/>
     the land, now my sons are on it. I know of some 
     <lb/>
     people today who are getting old age pensions 
     <lb/>
     and whose sons are absolutely helpless to assist 
     <lb/>
     them. One is in hospital and there is no way for 
     <lb/>
     that son to help his father out. I have here some 
     <lb/>
     findings by legal authorities and in this weekly, 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">The Prairie Farmer</hi>, of 1 1/2 million readers, it

     says that in every question asked those legal

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The opinion of that article is 
     <lb/>
     simply the author's conception of what the law 
     <lb/>
     is; from a lawyer's point of view there is no 
     <lb/>
     authority for anything except a previously 
     <lb/>
     decided case.

     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> We are told we get increased 
     <lb/>
     benefits; we cannot hope to get increased benefits 
     <lb/>
     without increased responsibilities. One goes 
     <lb/>
     hand in hand with the other. I for one would not 
     <lb/>
     like us to go into confederation and for someone 
     <lb/>
     to turn around and say to me afterwards, "You 
     <lb/>
     did not explain this." I want the people to know. 
     <lb/>
     All I know is the means test is there....

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> They cannot take it if it is worth 
     <lb/>
     $2,000. If the widow lives, she gets it. If the 
     <lb/>
     widow dies, someone in the family or a stranger 
     <lb/>
     who has contributed to the support of that person 
     <lb/>
     gets it. But in any case, the state can only get back 
     <lb/>
     what it gave where the estate is worth over $2,000 
     <lb/>

     helped out the old couple. About this lien. There 
     <lb/>
     is just a little in what Mr. Bailey says. It's the first 
     <lb/>
     time Mr. Bailey and I partially agreed in public 
     <lb/>
     since the Convention began. Here is the answer. 
     <lb/>
     "No province requires an applicant [for old age 
     <lb/>
     pensions] to turn over his property to the provin<lb break="no"/>cial government either before or after granting a 
     <lb/>
     pension. After a pension is granted a provincial 
     <lb/>
     pensions authority may, if authorised by provin<lb break="no"/>cial legislation, encumber any real property 
     <lb/>
     owned by the pensioner." That means if a 
     <lb/>
     province has its own provincial law requiring its 
     <lb/>
     pension authority to encumber any real property 
     <lb/>
     of the old age pensioner, then that authority can 
     <lb/>
     do so. There may be provinces where there is 
     <lb/>
     such a provincial law, that is their business. If we 
     <lb/>
     became a province, and if the legislature passed 
     <lb/>
     a law giving authority to the pensions authority 
     <lb/>
     to encumber and take a lien, then it can do so, but 
     <lb/>
     there has to be a Newfoundland law to authorise 
     <lb/>
     them to do it.... There is no such Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     law now. We are not compelled to pass any such 
     <lb/>
     law. If we have a legislature they will be our 
     <lb/>
     elected representatives. I doubt very much if an 
     <lb/>
     elected House of Assembly in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     would pass a law to give power to the old age 
     <lb/>
     pension authority to encumber the property.... 
     <lb/></p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Your point is, the lien to which 
     <lb/>Captain Bailey refers arises under legislation 
     <lb/>passed by the provincial government, which 
     <lb/>makes it a purely statutory lien? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Purely provincial. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> Mr. Smallwood's explanation 
     <lb/>
     may point out that the government cannot take 
     <lb/>
     the lien. Mr. Bailey is correct, for the simple 
     <lb/>
     reason, as I understand the act, you cannot trans<lb break="no"/>fer the property while or after you are receiving 
     <lb/>
     the pension, can you? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That is right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> Read section 3, page 6 of the 
     <lb/>
     Pensions Act.... He cannot transfer his property, 
     <lb/>
     therefore he must retain it in his own name. The 
     <lb/>
     government authority has the first lien. In effect 
     <lb/>
     they take back what they gave him. Going on 
     <lb/>
     further, you said anybody, whether related or not, 
     <lb/>
     who supported the old age pensioner would then 
     <lb/>
     be entitled to receive the property. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr.Smallwood</persName> That is roughly the case, but not 
     <lb/>exactly.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> You will find that anybody who

     has contributed to the support of the pensioner by

     a payment of money or otherwise, must have 
     <lb/>
     done so for a period. I think, of three years during 
     <lb/>
     which the pension was paid and that contribution 
     <lb/>
     must have been a reasonable one within his in<lb break="no"/>come.... I do not think you went far enough in 
     <lb/>
     explaining it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Page 9 of the regulations, sec<lb break="no"/>tion 20.... Suppose I am 64 1/2 years old. I know 
     <lb/>
     at the age of 70 I am going to get the old age 
     <lb/>
     pension of $30 per month; I have my wife too. I 
     <lb/>
     am allowed $240 a year private income. I know 
     <lb/>
     that they may come and assess my house as being 
     <lb/>
     worth $10 a month or $120 a year. Then I would 
     <lb/>
     be allowed to earn only $120 a year. So I transfer 
     <lb/>
     my house over to my son within five years. or say 
     <lb/>
     four years and nine months before I am 70, so that 
     <lb/>
     when I apply for the old age pension at 70 I have 
     <lb/>
     no income; I do not own the house. To prevent 
     <lb/>
     that from happening, if it is worth $500 or more, 
     <lb/>
     the government can say — you transferred your 
     <lb/>
     house within the last five years. Was that done 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of qualifying for the pension, so 
     <lb/>
     that you could meet the means test? In that case 
     <lb/>
     they can remedy it. Remember always the old age 
     <lb/>
     pension is only for those who need it. They have 
     <lb/>
     a scheme coming up in the next two or three years 
     <lb/>
     for universal old age pensions for everyone alive 
     <lb/>
     in Canada at the age of 65. That is a horse of a 
     <lb/>
     different colour.... That is a contributory scheme. 
     <lb/> </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> You interrupted me to give an 
     <lb/>answer on the three years' support. You went off 
     <lb/>on something else. Now that you have got on it, 
     <lb/>it means that if the old age pensioner wishes to 
     <lb/>apply for and obtain a pension at the age of 70, 
     <lb/>he then has to make over his property to his 
     <lb/>children before he is 65 and has to go on for six 
     <lb/>years before he receives a pension, with no 
     <lb/>property in his own name. He would have to 
     <lb/>make over his property six years before he be<lb break="no"/>came pensionable, otherwise he cannot make a 
     <lb/>transfer under that section of the act? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> Mr. Smallwood spoke about the dif<lb break="no"/>ferent provinces. I do not know how many of 
     <lb/>
     them have the same act; I have seen nothing to 
     <lb/>
     the contrary in the greater bulk of them. I im<lb break="no"/>agine, if we went into confederation with 
     <lb/>
     Canada, our laws governing this province have 
     <lb/>
     to be along the same lines of the other nine 
     <lb/>
     provinces. Pressure would be brought to bear on 
     <lb/>
     us if we are getting increased benefits. I cannot 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           

     see how Mr. Smallwood can justify it — if 
     <lb/>
     anyone comes into this House they will have to 
     <lb/>
     fall in line with the general charters of the provin<lb break="no"/>ces. This is the sore spot in this. Mr. Hickman has 
     <lb/>
     put his finger on it. No odds how much we care 
     <lb/>
     for our sons and want to help them, I do not think 
     <lb/>
     we want to transfer our property until we have 
     <lb/>
     finished with it. There are cases where people 
     <lb/>
     who transferred their property over, even to their 
     <lb/>
     own sons, have had a pretty tough time after<lb break="no"/>wards. The whole thing does not look good to me. 
     <lb/>
     I do not know which way to take it. We have 
     <lb/>
     worked hard and done the best we can, and if the 
     <lb/>
     country gives us a pension, it should be given 
     <lb/>
     with no strings to it.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It is entirely wrong to assume 
     <lb/>
     as Mr. Bailey has done that the laws the Province 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland may pass are the laws other 
     <lb/>
     provinces pass. The laws the provinces pass will 
     <lb/>
     depend on the kind of legislature and House of 
     <lb/>
     Assembly each has. In British Columbia there is 
     <lb/>
     a coalition, a House of Assembly made up of 
     <lb/>
     Liberals and Tories; there is the Alberta govern<lb break="no"/>ment made up of the Social Credit party; in 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan they have a CCF legislature; 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba has a Liberal legislature; Ontario is 
     <lb/>
     Conservative or Tory; the Province of Quebec is 
     <lb/>
     nationalistic — Union Nationale; Nova Scotia, 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick have 
     <lb/>
     Liberal legislatures. The kind of laws that the 
     <lb/>
     legislature for each province will pass, and the 
     <lb/>
     kind of laws the Newfoundland House of As<lb break="no"/>sembly will pass, will depend on the kind of 
     <lb/>
     government it has.... Let any other province have 
     <lb/>
     any other law it likes, that has nothing to do with 
     <lb/>
     us. We make our own laws. Take for instance 
     <lb/>
     education, you have not the same laws in all the 
     <lb/>
     provinces. Education is an entirely provincial 
     <lb/>
     matter; so it is in a hundred other things. Where 
     <lb/>
     the province rules it rules. They are not told how 
     <lb/>
     to rule by anyone else. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I am not interested in the kinds of 
     <lb/>
     government in Canada; my point is, whoever is 
     <lb/>
     in the government in this country will have to find 
     <lb/>
     the money to run it. Those nine provinces have 
     <lb/>
     had nearly 100 years of confederation and they 
     <lb/>
     ought to know something about it. We are com<lb break="no"/>ing into a field we have not been in before. We 
     <lb/>
     have to follow some precedent. Whether we are 
     <lb/>
     Conservatives or Union Nationale, we have to 
     <lb/>
     find the money to do this. I have no doubt that in 
     <lb/>

     the Province of Manitoba the legislature is not 
     <lb/>
     enamoured with the idea of taking the property 
     <lb/>
     from the son, but circumstances force them to do 
     <lb/>
     it. That is what you have to keep in mind. If it is 
     <lb/>
     going to be done, how is it going to be done?.... 
     <lb/>
     The only precedent we have to follow is the 
     <lb/>
     precedent of the nine provinces.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> Mr. Bailey's point is that no matter 
     <lb/>
     what form of government there is in the nine 
     <lb/>
     provinces, you must find the money for whatever 
     <lb/>
     services you have, and I agree with him. What I

     would like to know is this, if not <hi rendition="simple:italic">after</hi> but <hi rendition="simple:italic">before</hi>

     a debate on those acts and regulations, would it

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That was my understanding.... 
     <lb/>
     Before we went into committee of the whole the 
     <lb/>
     point was raised by Mr. Higgins as to what mode 
     <lb/>
     of procedure was going to be employed. To 
     <lb/>
     reduce the matter to the simplest framework, it 
     <lb/>
     was ultimately agreed that Mr. Smallwood would 
     <lb/>
     read the section, and give the interpretation of the 
     <lb/>
     section, but that he was not to revert to the Black 
     <lb/>
     Books unless any statement that he made was 
     <lb/>
     questioned or challenged and the answer was to 
     <lb/>
     be found in the Black Books. That may be unfair 
     <lb/>
     to Mr. Smallwood; it may be cramping his style; 
     <lb/>
     it may be coming between him and the people 
     <lb/>
     outside, but I am like Pontius Pilate, I say the 
     <lb/>
     responsibility is the Convention's and not 
     <lb/>
     mine.... Mr. Smallwood now finds himself in the 
     <lb/>
     comparatively unfair position where he cannot, 
     <lb/>
     unlike all the rest of the members, revert to the 
     <lb/>

     Black Books unless his interpretation is ques<lb break="no"/>tioned. On the next point, I feel that the question 
     <lb/>
     raised by Mr. Crosbie is tenable and proper. 
     <lb/>
     Insofar as the legislation of the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment or governments is to be referred to by you, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood, I think some endeavour, some 
     <lb/>
     agreement ought to be arrived at between Captain 
     <lb/>
     Warren and yourself so that we can list them and 
     <lb/>
     know whether the requests for these documents 
     <lb/>
     have all gone out, making sure that members will 
     <lb/>
     have access to any legislation to which you have 
     <lb/>
     already referred or to which in the course of 
     <lb/>
     debate you may refer. In that way all concerned 
     <lb/>
     are treated alike. Insofar as it is your future inten<lb break="no"/>tion to refer to any memoranda or any memoran<lb break="no"/>da you have already referred to, then I think and 
     <lb/>
     I make the direction now, the memoranda should 
     <lb/>
     be mimeographed and copies placed in members' 
     <lb/>
     hands. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The decision that I should not 
     <lb/>
     read from the Black Books unless my statement 
     <lb/>
     on the clause has been challenged, is not my 
     <lb/>
     agreement. I remember vividly what I said and I 
     <lb/>
     have had the subsequent advantage of listening 
     <lb/>
     to the recording and heard it. I said I would read 
     <lb/>
     the clause, make a brief explanation and consult 
     <lb/>
     the Black Books by way of explanation. When 
     <lb/>
     we went into committee of the whole, it was on 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins' memory of what I said that you 
     <lb/>
     made your ruling....

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If I unfairly left you with any 
     <lb/>
     misapprehensions, I will have the transcript 
     <lb/>
     prepared and will go over it.... We went into 
     <lb/>
     committee of the whole, and unless I am doing 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins some injury, I understood him to say, 
     <lb/>
     and I understood members to concur with his 
     <lb/>
     suggestion that we were not, in his words, "to 
     <lb/>
     wade through these Black Books". There was a 
     <lb/>
     compromise position reached between Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood on the one hand and the views of 
     <lb/>
     some other members on the other hand, whereby 
     <lb/>
     it was agreed that the section should be read, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood's interpretation would be given, and 
     <lb/>
     in conformity with the suggestion made by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins that we should not wade through the 
     <lb/>
     Black Books, that Mr. Smallwood would only 
     <lb/>
     refer to the Black Books if and when he were 
     <lb/>
     required, perhaps under challenge, to supply in<lb break="no"/>dependent corroboration of what he had stated.... 
     <lb/>
     However fair or unfair it may be to Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood or to anyone else, that is the mode of 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
          

     procedure that the Convention decided to adopt.

     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> Referring to this afternoon's dis<lb break="no"/>cussion in connection with the property of pen<lb break="no"/>sioners after they die. I am not quite satisfied on 
     <lb/>
     that $2,000 value of the estate of the deceased 
     <lb/>
     pensioner. I cannot find anything here in the act 
     <lb/>
     about it.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> ....The position is this: ....these 
     <lb/>
     provincial old age pensions authorities meet once 
     <lb/>
     or twice a year, and at this interprovincial confer<lb break="no"/>ence they make regulations insofar as they are 
     <lb/>
     allowed to under the act itself. They have to be 
     <lb/>
     guided by the act. Within the power conferred 
     <lb/>
     upon them they make these regulations in such 
     <lb/>
     matters of practice as this point — does the 
     <lb/>
     government step in and recover the old age pen<lb break="no"/>sion that was paid to the pensioner after the 
     <lb/>
     pensioner dies? Yes and no. That is what they 
     <lb/>
     have to decide. Will we get it back no matter what 
     <lb/>
     estate is left by the pensioner who dies, or will we 
     <lb/>
     fix an amount? ....So they set the amount at 
     <lb/>
     $2,000. When the pensioner dies, if his estate is 
     <lb/>
     worth less than $2,000 then the government does 
     <lb/>
     not bother. If he has an estate valued over $2,000, 
     <lb/>
     then under certain conditions the government 
     <lb/>
     will get back the pension that it had paid. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Do you know whether or not the 
     <lb/>
     $2,000 figure is universally accepted by the nine 
     <lb/>
     provinces? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, that is a ruling made by 
     <lb/>
     the provinces themselves in this interprovincial 
     <lb/>
     conference.... I do not know if that is the answer 
     <lb/>
     to Mr. Hickman's question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> I forget the wording but that is a 
     <lb/>
     different interpretation than I saw in it this after<lb break="no"/>noon. I was under the impression that it was only 
     <lb/>
     in cases where the estate or property was over 
     <lb/>
     $2,000 that they could take action. Why I ask is, 
     <lb/>
     it says here, "the pension authorities would be 
     <lb/>
     required to make a claim against an estate where 
     <lb/>
     the net value was in excess of $2,000". They 
     <lb/>
     would not have any choice. It does not say they 
     <lb/>
     cannot make one under $2,000. There is nothing 
     <lb/>
     here to say they would not. If it is over $2,000 it 
     <lb/>
     is not the choice of the pension authorities, they 
     <lb/>
     would be compelled to do it. They have no alter<lb break="no"/><pb n="829" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-24_Page_0829.jpg"/>

     native. 
     <lb/>
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Your point is where it is over 
     <lb/>$2,000, then they have no discretion in the matter 
     <lb/>at all. Where it is under $2,000, if we had a 
     <lb/>provincial legislature, it would depend upon what 
     <lb/>comparable legislation had been in the past? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> I understood the pension auth<lb break="no"/>orities had the choice. From reading this, I would 
     <lb/>say they would be compelled to make a claim 
     <lb/>against the estate where the estate is in excess of 
     <lb/>$2,000 and also in the case of less than $2,000 
     <lb/>they could make a claim to recover the pension if 
     <lb/>they so desired. Their optional right is there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I do not want to get into the 
     <lb/>intricacies of constitutional law, but I want to 
     <lb/>express a legal opinion. In my judgement the 
     <lb/>position taken by Mr. Hickman is perfectly jus<lb break="no"/>tified.... Theoretically it is within the competence 
     <lb/>of the provincial legislature to deal with estates 
     <lb/>under $2,000, should that legislature be so 
     <lb/>minded. Over $2,000 it has no discretion at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I was not questioning that.... 
     <lb/>However, we can easily clean up the matter in this 
     <lb/>way. I will give notice before the sitting ends of 
     <lb/>a question to ask the Government of Canada to 
     <lb/>give us a memorandum showing clearly what the 
     <lb/>practice is in connection with old age pensions, 
     <lb/>and it will be beyond all doubt. I can assure you 
     <lb/>now, pending the receipt of an official reply, that 
     <lb/>where the value of an estate left by an old age 
     <lb/>pensioner is under $2,000 nothing is taken out; 
     <lb/>over $2,000 something is taken out only after the 
     <lb/>widow who is herself a pensioner has died and 
     <lb/>only if none of his children or anyone else has 
     <lb/>contributed regularly to the support of the pen<lb break="no"/>sioner.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is just one point I want to make before 
     <lb/>
     I pass on to unemployment insurance.... A man 
     <lb/>
     or woman, whose father or mother being 70 years 
     <lb/>
     of age, gets the old age pension, who wishes to 
     <lb/>
     fall in for his father's or his mother's property, 
     <lb/>
     has only one thing to do, that is to help to support 
     <lb/>
     the old people and ... contribute regularly for 
     <lb/>
     three years. If no person does it and the govern<lb break="no"/>ment has to do it, then the government can get the 
     <lb/>
     money back out of the pensioner's estate when 
     <lb/>
     he or she dies, if the estate is worth more than 
     <lb/>
     $2,000 net. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> Before we move on, when we were 
     <lb/>dealing with family allowances, we had a known 
     <lb/>number, 117,000 children in the country, we also 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
        
     had a known amount; when we move into the old 
     <lb/>
     age pensions, we move into a field of conjecture. 
     <lb/>
     Some suggested we have 12,000 people in New<lb break="no"/>foundland over the age of 70; they assume 10,000 
     <lb/>
     of that 12,000 would apply for and receive the old 
     <lb/>
     age pension. If that 10,000 did receive it we know 
     <lb/>
     it is a known figure; we would have to contribute 
     <lb/>
     $7.50 a month for each person and the grand total 
     <lb/>
     is given as $750,000. Now that is not even cor<lb break="no"/>rect; it should be $900,000. That is a matter of 
     <lb/>
     only $150,000. I would refer you to Black Book 
     <lb/>
     Vol. 2, page 60 — there is an amount there of 
     <lb/>
     $510,000— that is what the province would have 
     <lb/>
     to pay. That is why the $7.50 is given. There is a 
     <lb/>
     difference of $400,000 from our method of cal<lb break="no"/>culation.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Bearing on that, Mr. Miller is 
     <lb/>
     pointing out that the $510,000 shown is incorrect, 
     <lb/>
     and the amount will be corrected when we get 
     <lb/>
     around to it further on in the debate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> It will have the effect of driving up 
     <lb/>
     the expenditures, and driving up the amount we

     will have to collect by $400,000.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That is so. I give notice that I

     will on tomorrow ask His Excellency the Gover<lb break="no"/>nor in Commission to lay on the table a statement

     the fund received from the employer and

     <lb/>
     prepared by the Unemployment Insurance 
     <lb/>
     Commission's Chief Commissioner — they 
     <lb/>
     produced it at our request. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MILL5">Mr. Miller</persName> That table ends at $30 per week. I 
     <lb/>
     was surprised to note that it started at $7 per 
     <lb/>
     week, and to note that people in Canada work for 
     <lb/>
     as low as $5.40 a week. Does it go beyond $30 a 
     <lb/>
     week? Does it take in incomes higher than that? 
     <lb/></p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I think it reads as follows: "In 
     <lb/>addition persons earning more than $2,400 on a 
     <lb/>monthly basis, or $3,120 or more on a weekly 
     <lb/>basis are not insured, but workers paid by the 
     <lb/>hour or day, at piece rates or mileage rates are 
     <lb/>covered regardless of the amount of their annual 
     <lb/>earnings." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> One question only I would like 
     <lb/>
     to ask Mr. Smallwood in connection with un<lb break="no"/>employment insurance. He referred to a figure of 
     <lb/>
     $400 million. Has he any figures to show whether 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
            

     at the present time there are any large amounts 
     <lb/>
     being paid out of that in any part of Canada? 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The payments out are utterly 
     <lb/>insignificant. I do not know if I have the table or 
     <lb/>not — the benefit payments in July were $2 
     <lb/>million. The total amount paid out 1942-47 in<lb break="no"/>clusive to the end of July was $43 million out of 
     <lb/>a total received in of $400 million.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> It seems obvious that there were a 
     <lb/>
     lot of people in the Maritimes not in on that 
     <lb/>
     insurance scheme according to the amount of 
     <lb/>
     unemployment insurance paid out. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> These payments were made 
     <lb/>
     during war years, when there was very little 
     <lb/>
     unemployment either here or abroad. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> As a matter of fact if you can 
     <lb/>
     look at the schedule, there were payments out 
     <lb/>
     consistently from 1942-47 both inclusive, during 
     <lb/>
     the war years, as you say. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The explanation is this: Can<lb break="no"/>ada is a country of 12.5 million people; there are 
     <lb/>
     vast numbers of industries; a certain amount of 
     <lb/>
     ups and downs, comings and goings, men getting 
     <lb/>
     work and men losing work; you would naturally 
     <lb/>
     expect a tremendous shift of population in 12.5 
     <lb/>
     million people. At the present time, the latest 
     <lb/>
     figures I read in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Financial Post</hi> gave the 
     <lb/>
     figure of unemployed in Canada as 80,000 and 
     <lb/>
     the Unemployment Insurance Service are seek<lb break="no"/>ing 85,000 workers. There are 5,000 jobs more 
     <lb/>
     than workers to fill them, although there were 
     <lb/>
     80,000 unemployed... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I wonder if Mr. Smallwood could 
     <lb/>
     tell me exactly why fishermen are not included 
     <lb/>
     in this unemployment scheme? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I cannot tell you exactly why 
     <lb/>
     they are not included in that unemployment 
     <lb/>
     scheme, in general I would say it is due to the 
     <lb/>
     nature of their employment. Many fishermen, not 
     <lb/>
     all, are not working for wages and so far they 
     <lb/>
     have not been included. They tell us it is their 
     <lb/>
     intention to have all workers insured under the 
     <lb/>
     act. While we were in Ottawa they were busy 
     <lb/>
     getting plans ready to bring in all loggers and 
     <lb/>
     longshoremen under the act. The next step will 
     <lb/>
     be to bring all workers under the act and have 
     <lb/>
     them insured.

     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Who told Mr. Smallwood that?

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> It is their intention to bring in all 
     <lb/>
     workers, including stevedores and loggers within 
     <lb/>
     the next few months, they say. Beyond that there 
     <lb/>
     is nothing official. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Is that official? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The Black Book is official from 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> The Black Book is not from the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada. A lot of it is from Mr. 
     <lb/>
     J.R. Smallwood, one of the members of the Na<lb break="no"/>tional Convention. I believe there are some state<lb break="no"/>ments made by that delegation who went to 
     <lb/>
     Canada, relative to the public buildings in this 
     <lb/>
     country. I believe they made an estimate or value 
     <lb/>
     of public buildings in this country. I just hap<lb break="no"/>pened to run down through the list. I know there 
     <lb/>
     is a public building in Springdale, which cost this 
     <lb/>
     country $16,000, not listed there; a public build<lb break="no"/>ing in Grand Falls not listed, a public building in 
     <lb/>
     Burin not listed there. So if the Black Book is 
     <lb/>
     official, then I want to know who is responsible 
     <lb/>
     for making these errors. In my opinion this is not 
     <lb/>
     more official than Joseph R. Smallwood. If I can 
     <lb/>
     point out just briefly errors in that Black Book, 
     <lb/>
     am I going to ask the people of this country to 
     <lb/>
     accept that as official? I put that before you, sir, 
     <lb/>
     and I say these Black Books are not official and 
     <lb/>
     I shall not regard them as official. I shall regard 
     <lb/>
     this Grey Book as official from the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, nothing else. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> My position is, these Black 
     <lb/>
     Books are to be employed by members, that was 
     <lb/>
     settled once and for all this afternoon. It appears, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hollett, the opinion I had taken on the matter 
     <lb/>
     was not universally shared, and it was decided by 
     <lb/>
     this House that these Black Books are to be 
     <lb/>
     referred to, and whether they are quasi-official or 
     <lb/>
     otherwise, it is a matter of indifference to me. If 
     <lb/>
     there are misstatements, it will be the right of 
     <lb/>
     members to draw the attention of the Chairman 
     <lb/>
     to them, and if you do not mind, Mr. Hollett, take 
     <lb/>
     your seat, please!.... My ruling is that these Black 
     <lb/>
     Books may be referred to. If there is anything in 
     <lb/>
     the Black Books that is incorrect for any reason, 
     <lb/>
     it is perfectly within the competence of any mem<lb break="no"/>ber to say it is, and to express his reasons.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Inaccuracies. Look at these books

     with a certain amount of care. Mr. Smallwood

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I was going to ask Mr. Smallwood if he 
     <lb/>
     would make it perfectly clear as to whether there 
     <lb/>
     is any prospect of including fishermen under the 
     <lb/>
     unemployment insurance scheme. It would seem 
     <lb/>
     our fishermen are practically all employers them<lb break="no"/>selves, they are not employees. I can see it would 
     <lb/>
     be difficult to include fishermen working for 
     <lb/>
     themselves, and I can understand that men in a 
     <lb/>
     boat under wages could be included, but it would 
     <lb/>
     not apply even to sharemen, who we are mainly 
     <lb/>
     interested in here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I feel like Mr. Job. Fishermen, 
     <lb/>
     like farmers, will probably be the last, if ever, to 
     <lb/>
     be brought under the scheme. They are not work<lb break="no"/>ing for annual wages, fixed amounts of pay. They 
     <lb/>
     are working as small businessmen on their own, 
     <lb/>
     and it would be extremely difficult to bring them

     in, except fishermen definitely working for 
     <lb/>
     wages at any time.... Frankly I think it would be 
     <lb/>
     many a day yet, if ever, when the average fisher<lb break="no"/><pb n="832" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-24_Page_0832.jpg"/>

     <lb/>
     brought under the unemployment insurance 
     <lb/>
     scheme. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> I understand this Unemployment 
     <lb/>
     Act is compulsory for all those eligible and the 
     <lb/>
     maximum benefit is limited to one year, no mat<lb break="no"/>ter how long they pay into the fund? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It is compulsory, on the first 
     <lb/>
     point, for those classes of workers designated by 
     <lb/>
     the Unemployment Insurance Commission who, 
     <lb/>
     incidentally, have the power to recommend it to 
     <lb/>
     cabinet, who in turn have the power to include 
     <lb/>
     any new class of workers without amending the 
     <lb/>
     act. As to the maximum period during which 
     <lb/>
     employees may receive benefits, frankly, I do not 
     <lb/>
     know. I do not know if it is limited to a year or if 
     <lb/>
     it is not. I will undertake to find it out. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> I think it is in one of the books, but 
     <lb/>
     I cannot find it at the moment. From the para<lb break="no"/>graph here, he is allowed one-fifth of his total 
     <lb/>
     payment — if he paid in five years he would be 
     <lb/>
     allowed benefits for one year, but if a person paid 
     <lb/>
     in for 20 years, his maximum benefits would still 
     <lb/>
     be confined to one year. If he was out of employ<lb break="no"/>ment for two years, he would have to start all over 
     <lb/>
     again.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Fogwill may be right or he 
     <lb/>
     may be wrong. I will certainly check on it and

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> I was wondering if Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood had any figures or estimates of what New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders would benefit under this scheme? 
     <lb/>
     If it excludes "agriculture and horticulture, fish<lb break="no"/>ing, hunting, and trapping, lumbering and log<lb break="no"/>ging, stevedoring, private domestic service, 
     <lb/>
     employment in hospitals and charitable institu<lb break="no"/>tions not carried on for gain, teachers, members 
     <lb/>
     of the police forces and permanent federal, 
     <lb/>
     provincial and municipal employees," etc. etc., 
     <lb/>
     how many would be left in the country who 
     <lb/>
     would be able to come in under this scheme? 
     <lb/></p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> To begin with, loggers and 
     <lb/>longshoremen before this year is over will be 
     <lb/>under this scheme. If you take in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>all the loggers, longshoremen, mill workers, all 
     <lb/>factory workers in and out of St. John's, all 
     <lb/>miners and railroaders, office workers, labourers 
     <lb/>— you would have possibly 50,000 men brought 
     <lb/>under unemployment insurance, more brought in 
     <lb/>than left out. You would have teachers, domestic 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
           

     servants, civil servants, whether provincial or 
     <lb/>
     federal. Still you have fishermen left out, and that 
     <lb/>
     would account for 25,000 or 30,000 right off. 
     <lb/>
     Possibly it would be half and half; we are only 
     <lb/>
     guessing, I have not got the figures. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Page 89, Book 1<ref target="#fn_08">[1]</ref> reads, "The 
     <lb/>
     amount of benefits which may be paid to an 
     <lb/>
     unemployed person depends upon the number of 
     <lb/>
     contributions which he has made to the fund, but 
     <lb/>
     under no circumstances can an unbroken period 
     <lb/>
     of benefit exceed one year."

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That makes it clear...

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> The point I want to make clear is, 
     <lb/>
     "One of the conditions of unemployment daily 
     <lb/>
     contributions for two years prior to his claim." In

     the case of a person who is paying into this 
     <lb/>
     unemployment fund for 20 years and then be<lb break="no"/>comes unemployed, he would get one year's 
     <lb/>
     benefit. If unemployed for another year, he would 
     <lb/>
     have to start all over again after paying in for 20 
     <lb/>
     years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It is a great pity that when the 
     <lb/>
     war broke out in Newfoundland they did not 
     <lb/>
     introduce unemployment insurance; they could 
     <lb/>
     have $5-8 million in Newfoundland today.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I would like to have the point raised 
     <lb/>
     by Mr. Fogwill clarified properly.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Smallwood accepts, I think, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Fogwill's interpretation.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> You would not have to work for 
     <lb/>
     two years, you would have to work for a short 
     <lb/>
     period. Assuming a man uses up his year's un<lb break="no"/>employment benefits after that period, he must be 
     <lb/>
     employed for a further period; then he would 
     <lb/>
     have to start as a new member into the fund. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I do not know whether Mr. 
     <lb/>Fogwill's interpretation is correct. I will look into 
     <lb/>the matter and get some confirmation of it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> It is not a question of Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood looking into the matter. We want an official

     statement about that. I would like to raise that 
     <lb/>
     issue through you as Chairman of the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I cannot do anything about it 
     <lb/>
     unless requested from a member of the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion; I can then forward the request to a depart<lb break="no"/>ment of government....

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK5">Mr. Jackman</persName> I would like to ask Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood, is that really correct, sir, is the weekly

 <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I think not. That is not sup<lb break="no"/>posed scales of pay which are in fact paid. That 
     <lb/>
     is a list; if anyone gets such and such a scale, he 
     <lb/>
     pays such and such an amount — nowhere does 
     <lb/>
     it say these are rates payable in Canada. I am sure 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Jackman does not think those are the rates 
     <lb/>
     being paid. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK5">Mr. Jackman</persName> It is quite possible that the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government would not allow workers 
     <lb/>
     to be paid $5.40 a week; but it must be possible, 
     <lb/>
     or it would not be here. Would you say there is a 
     <lb/>
     possibility employers pay $5.40 a week? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> If on the dial of a new motor car 
     <lb/>
     — the speed limit is 90 miles — it does not say 
     <lb/>
     it goes to 120 because that is on the dial. And for 
     <lb/>
     the same reason they must be paid $5.40 because 
     <lb/>
     it is in the books. Could we go on? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I do not think Mr. Smallwood is 
     <lb/>
     going on until we get this properly clarified. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Jackman, being a labour man, has raised this 
     <lb/>
     point and Mr. Smallwood wants to evade the 
     <lb/>
     whole issue. If somebody is earning such and 
     <lb/>
     such he will be taxed this or this. Where did Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood get these figures from? Are they 
     <lb/>
     figures for Canada?....

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> He has promised that the infor<lb break="no"/>mation will be sought from official quarters.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK5">Mr. Jackman</persName> I say it. If the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment is satisfied to allow an employer to pay out 
     <lb/>
     $5.40 to a human being, I would not consider that 
     <lb/>
     under the heading of "wages". I would consider

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> May I ask whether these levies apply to 
     <lb/>
     every ship that enters, whether foreign or other<lb break="no"/>wise? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That applies only to Canadian 
     <lb/>
     ships. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> Are you quite sure of that?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Quite sure. It would apply to 
     <lb/>
     our ships and boats only if we were a province. 
     <lb/>
     The scheme very briefly is the skipper of any 
     <lb/>
     fishing boat or schooner, by paying at least $2 a 
     <lb/>
     year or 6 cents a ton of his registered tonnage, 
     <lb/>
     brings himself and his whole crew for a whole 
     <lb/>
     year under the scheme. He and his crew are 
     <lb/>
     entitled to free hospitalisation and treatment. I am 
     <lb/>
     sorry Mr. Higgins is not here at the moment. He 
     <lb/>
     was present when we were informed in Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     by the Department of Health.... They told us, in 
     <lb/>
     connection with fishermen's hospitalisation 
     <lb/>
     scheme, that they planned to erect in New<lb break="no"/>foundland two or three small TB sanatoria along 
     <lb/>
     the coast, because quite a proportion of the sick<lb break="no"/>ness that would occur under the scheme would be 
     <lb/>
     TB, and treatment would require not an ordinary 
     <lb/>
     hospital but rather a sanatorium... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Was that for fishermen? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That is for any person coming 
     <lb/>
     under this scheme, free hospitalisation, or an 
     <lb/>
     almost free scheme for mariners and fishermen. 
     <lb/>
     
    </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> This last section seems to be all up 
     <lb/>in the air. "The ship to which he belongs." It is 
     <lb/>customary all my lifetime, if you get a sick man 
     <lb/>on the Banks, you send the man in, in another 
     <lb/>vessel. Apparently in this case you would have to 
     <lb/>come to land yourself to get him hospitalised. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> In the case of a fishing vessel it 
     <lb/>has not left the country at all. She is in coastal 
     <lb/>waters.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I would like to draw to your atten<lb break="no"/>tion the fact we in this country have a scheme 
     <lb/>
     whereby people who contact TB are properly 
     <lb/>
     taken care of. It not only applies to fishermen, it 
     <lb/>
     applies to the country as a whole. I wonder would 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood tell us about that. Do not tell us

     what they have — tell us about our fund costing 
     <lb/>
     $7 million. I would like Mr. Smallwood to tell the 
     <lb/>
     country about that. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No. If you want to address your<lb break="no"/>self on the comparable benefits, that is your right. 
     <lb/>
     The point is, Mr. Smallwood is endeavouring to 
     <lb/>
     explain those terms. Obviously he is explaining 
     <lb/>
     how the standpoint would be as it would apply to 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland were it to come into effect. If any

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> May I ask Mr. Smallwood what 
     <lb/>
     happens to a sick mariner who comes into any

     port, be he a Newfoundlander, in Newfoundland? 
     <lb/>
     If he has broken his arm or done anything else, 
     <lb/>
     would Mr. Smallwood explain what happens to 
     <lb/>
     that man?

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> If the skipper of the boat has

            <p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I must uphold him. We are not

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Am I not right in asking Mr.

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:JACK5">Mr. Jackman</persName> Mr. Smallwood spoke of the

     <lb/>wonder, do they know the condition of personnel

     <lb/>nurses in this country? I happen to know some<lb break="no"/>thing about it, I am connected with the TB As<lb break="no"/>sociation. We do not want to put things over the 
     <lb/>air and paint a rosy picture to persuade people. If 
     <lb/>they are going to erect sanatoria, they will also 
     <lb/>have to be responsible for the personnel because 
     <lb/>there is not sufficient personnel in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>to look after the sanatoria. That is the reason why 
     <lb/>so many people suffering from TB cannot be 
     <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
          

     hospitalised. If the Canadians are going to erect 
     <lb/>
     sanatoria, you will have to tell them to bring their 
     <lb/>
     personnel with them.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> When recess was taken, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Jackman had addressed a question to you, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, asking how it is proposed to over<lb break="no"/>come the difficulty of staffing the sanatoria... 
     <lb/> </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It is not my responsibility, as 
     <lb/>Mr. Jackman will appreciate. It will be the prob<lb break="no"/>lem of the Canadian government, if they erect 
     <lb/>sanatoria in Newfoundland for sick mariners, to 
     <lb/>find the help and to maintain them. I would 
     <lb/>remind Mr. Jackman we will not be a province of 
     <lb/>Canada for a year yet; and it will be a year or two 
     <lb/>after that before the sanatoria are erected. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Point of order. Are we going to be 
     <lb/>
     a province of Canada a year hence? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I must sustain you on that point. 
     <lb/>
     The question as to whether or not we are at any 
     <lb/>
     time to be a province of Canada is one for the 
     <lb/>
     sovereign people of this country to determine. I 
     <lb/>
     do not think any predictions or prophecies are in 
     <lb/>
     order at this time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I would not dare prophesy. I 
     <lb/>
     think it is a fairly safe statement to make that if 
     <lb/>
     we become a province, we could not be a 
     <lb/>
     province for about a year and it will take a year 
     <lb/>
     or two after that to build the sanatoria. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I rise to a point of order. He just said 
     <lb/>
     "if we become a province it will not be for a year 
     <lb/>
     at least". I want him to withdraw that in relation<lb break="no"/>ship to a statement he made on his return trip. 
     <lb/></p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am not interested in what Mr.

     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> One point I would like to get 
     <lb/>
     cleared up — this sick mariners' benefit comes 
     <lb/>
     under public services provided by Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Volume 2, page 30-32.<ref target="#fn_10">[1]</ref> The following table 
     <lb/>
     shows revenue and expenditure of sick mariners' 
     <lb/>
     dues by province for fiscal year 1946-47. Then it 
     <lb/>
     gives a table of revenue and expenditure and 
     <lb/>
     amount. I cannot reconcile that table of provin<lb break="no"/>cial figures with this other public service sup<lb break="no"/>posedly collected by the federal government.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> He wants to know what is the 
     <lb/>
     exact relation of the figures set forth on page 30 
     <lb/>
     under the caption or heading "Sick Mariners' 
     <lb/>
     Dues by Province" and giving a list of provinces. 
     <lb/>
     This is supposed to be a public service provided 
     <lb/>
     by Canada. Mr. Harrington directs our attention 
     <lb/>
     to the fact that on page 30, immediately opposite 
     <lb/>
     the various provinces listed, there are various 
     <lb/>
     figures; he wants to know in what way these 
     <lb/>
     figures relate to or are tied up with the providing 
     <lb/>
     of public services by the Government of Canada. 
     <lb/></p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That is easily explained.... That 
     <lb/>is revenue received by the federal government in 
     <lb/>these provinces by that scheme; and expenditure 
     <lb/>made by the federal government in those provin<lb break="no"/>ces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK5">Mr. Jackman</persName> Just before recess I put a question 
     <lb/>
     to Mr. Smallwood regarding the personnel of 
     <lb/>
     sanatoria. I did that for a certain reason. I do not 
     <lb/>
     want Mr. Smallwood to put false hopes in the 
     <lb/>
     hearts of those suffering from TB, because there 
     <lb/>
     is a real problem we are up against regarding 
     <lb/>
     personnel. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> To which he has already replied. 
     <lb/>
     He does realise it, but that will be a matter for the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government to worry about. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> I think Mr. Smallwood will confirm 
     <lb/>
     that that statement was nothing more than con<lb break="no"/>jecture on his part. There may or may not be 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           

     sanatoria erected. I think we must stick to this 
     <lb/>
     document as nearly as possible — to the written 
     <lb/>
     word we have before us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I quite agree. If we concern our<lb break="no"/>selves with the contents of this document instead 
     <lb/>
     of wandering, it would be better. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> This is not my previous conception of 
     <lb/>
     what the sick mariners' service was intended to 
     <lb/>
     be. I thought the service was intended to take care 
     <lb/>
     of people who should become sick while, say, out 
     <lb/>
     on the Banks ... but not to take care of long-term 
     <lb/>
     illnesses such as TB. That would be open to 
     <lb/>
     tremendous abuse. Suppose I was unfortunate 
     <lb/>
     enough to believe I had some serious illness 
     <lb/>
     while at home. There is no earthly reason, if I 
     <lb/>
     could stand on my feet, why I could not get 
     <lb/>
     myself signed on as a cookee, and in that way get 
     <lb/>
     myself into a hospital free, although I could jolly 
     <lb/>
     well afford to pay for hospitalisation. I would like 
     <lb/>
     to think about this and get something more 
     <lb/>
     precise on the matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is your right.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I think it is rather late in the evening 
     <lb/>
     to start a new section like assistance in housing. 
     <lb/>
     I therefore move that the committee rise, report 
     <lb/>
     progress and ask leave to sit again tomorrow.
