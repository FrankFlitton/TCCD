<!-- GL, 2017-09-19, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day -->

     <!--in the hearing of my voice knows there was only 
     <lb/>
     a portion of our trade monopolised under respon<lb break="no"/>sible government, which can, at this enlightened 
     <lb/>
     age, be remedied by ourselves. But to give 
     <lb/>
     Canada, or any country, a monopoly of all our 
     <lb/>
     trade is ridiculous. What is behind it all? Are 
     <lb/>
     there any selfish motives? That is the question we 
     <lb/>
     may ask ourselves also. What do we see in the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian proposals that may cause us to throw 
     <lb/>
     in our all to them, and give them the monopoly 
     <lb/>
     of all our trade, and leave it to the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada to say who we shall deal with or who 
     <lb/>
     we shall not deal with? To me, the idea is 
     <lb/>
     ridiculous. I have come to the conclusion that the 
     <lb/>
     information that we now have is not conducive 
     <lb/>
     enough to cause us to leap in the dark by voting 
     <lb/>
     for confederation with Canada.

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, maybe this is the last time that

     I may have the privilege of rising in this chamber

     <lb/>
     today who will be back. I would like to ask them 
     <lb/>
     that whenever anything arises that is not in the 
     <lb/>
     best interest of the country, such as monopolies, 
     <lb/>
     to think of me. Thank you and God bless you all.

     position on this matter be in any way

     misunderstood, I am personally ready to sit here 
     <lb/>
     until seven o'clock tomorrow rather than have 
     <lb/>
     any suggestion subsequently arise that I was 
     <lb/>
     hindering directly or indirectly any member from 
     <lb/>
     addressing himself to the business before the

     <persName ref="pers:BRAD3">Mr. Bradley</persName> Mr. Chairman, I don't know 
     <lb/>
     whether the order of the day is open for debate 
     <lb/>
     now, is it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> There is just one matter I want 
     <lb/>
     to dispose of first. Members will recall that on 
     <lb/>
     Thursday the 22nd inst. there was a resolution 
     <lb/>
     passed by the House, requiring me to record the 
     <lb/>
     vote of any member on forms of government who 
     <lb/>
     was absent through illness or through other un<lb break="no"/>controllable or unforseen circumstances. In the 
     <lb/>
     case of the Hon. Mr. Brown, who the House 
     <lb/>
     knows has been convalescing for some time on 
     <lb/>
     his doctor's orders, it was not possible for him to 
     <lb/>
     be in the House at the time the vote on Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins' motion on responsible government and 
     <lb/>
     Commission government was taken, and I have 
     <lb/>
     received a note from Mr. Brown that he was in 
     <lb/>
     favour of the motion, but he had no preference. 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>


     In conformity with the spirit of the motion I have 
     <lb/>
     requested the Secretary to record Mr. Brown as 
     <lb/>
     supporting Mr. Higgins' motion, and also stating 
     <lb/>
     that he had no preference between the two forms 
     <lb/>
     of government included in that motion. In the 
     <lb/>
     case of the member for Bell Island, Mr. Jackman, 
     <lb/>
     he was also absent because of illness; he con<lb break="no"/>sulted me about the matter today, and I told him 
     <lb/>
     I would feel duty bound to report his attitude on 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins motion, and he is to instruct me in 
     <lb/>
     writing. That Mr. Jackman proposes to do, and 
     <lb/>
     upon receipt of his instructions in writing, like in 
     <lb/>
     the case of Mr. Brown and Mr. Job, I propose to 
     <lb/>
     record Mr. Jackrnan's views on the motion itself, 
     <lb/>
     together with any preference that he may express 
     <lb/>
     between the two forms of government covered by 
     <lb/>
     the motion. Will you take notice of that, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Secretary?

     Minister of Canada in October last. There is not

     fortunately there is no need to do it, for the details 
     <lb/>
     have all been published by newspaper and radio, 
     <lb/>
     and a long, if somewhat blurred and distorted 
     <lb/>
     debate on the proposals and terms has taken place 
     <lb/>
     in this chamber. I deem it necessary, however, to 
     <lb/>
     endeavour to correct some misconceptions and 
     <lb/>
     misinterpretations which have been placed upon 
     <lb/>
     these proposals, to dissipate some unworthy and 
     <lb/>
     even sneering references to some of the results of 
     <lb/>
     confederation, to dispose of certain unfounded 
     <lb/>
     charges of dishonesty and double-dealing made 
     <lb/>
     against governmental bodies, and to draw the 
     <lb/>
     attention of this Convention and the people of the 
     <lb/>
     country to the grave uncertainties which await us 
     <lb/>
     in this world of seething unrest and insecurity. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Up until today an unfortunate illness has made 
     <lb/>
     it impossible for me to take any part in the debate 
     <lb/>
     on the confederation proposals which were intro<lb break="no"/>duced by my motion of last October. I have, 
     <lb/>
     however, followed the debate in my home, and I 
     <lb/>
     am compelled to admit that it was a most depress<lb break="no"/>ing and disappointing experience. Never in my 
     <lb/>
     whole life have I known the quality of debate 
     <lb/>
     upon so important a matter to fall to such a low 
     <lb/>
     level. During that period I was in the very heart 
     <lb/>
     of the largest fishing town of this country,<ref target="#fn_01">[1]</ref> and I 
     <lb/>
     have to admit that the people there, and I feel that 
     <lb/>
     the whole country shared the feeling, were shock<lb break="no"/>ed by the refusal of many members of this Con<lb break="no"/>vention to treat this great question with the 
     <lb/>
     sincere impartiality and the friendly spirit of co<lb break="no"/>operation in search of truth which its importance 
     <lb/>
     demanded. I can assure you, sir, that their com<lb break="no"/>ments were caustic rather than complimentary, 
     <lb/>
     and they were unanimous, nor did they hesitate 
     <lb/>
     to express their disgust and indignation. Sir, I 
     <lb/>
     could not deny the justice of their criticism — it 
     <lb/>
     was too true. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     While the people were expecting what was 
     <lb/>
     their undoubted right, a straightforward and im<lb break="no"/>partial and cooperative discussion of what con<lb break="no"/>federation would mean to them, they were treated 
     <lb/>
     instead to a senseless barrage of heated mis<lb break="no"/>representation and distortion, to pretty prejudice 
     <lb/>
     and personal antagonism. The Convention be<lb break="no"/>came a veritable battleground. Instead of making 
     <lb/>
     an effort to understand the terms and make them 
     <lb/>
     plain to our people, some members seemed deter<lb break="no"/>mined to make it appear that confederation is 
     <lb/>
     such a complicated and confused question that 


   

            <cb/>
         

     nobody in or out of the Convention could possib<lb break="no"/>ly understand it. I shall not soon forget the dis<lb break="no"/>graceful climax to that unworthy campaign of 
     <lb/>
     obstruction which I had the misfortune to witness 
     <lb/>
     here on December 12 last, when we were closing 
     <lb/>
     for the Christmas vacation, when a majority of 
     <lb/>
     members walked out of the chamber with the 
     <lb/>
     perfectly obvious intention of preventing any 
     <lb/>
     reply to several hours of twisting and distorting 
     <lb/>
     of the Canadian proposals. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now there is a very urgent need indeed that in 
     <lb/>
     the interests of clear thinking a number of mis<lb break="no"/>conceptions that have grown up or been thrown 
     <lb/>
     up around this whole question should be cor<lb break="no"/>rected. Amongst these, sir, is the utterly foolish 
     <lb/>
     notion that the very fact that we are discussing 
     <lb/>
     confederation at all is the result of a breach of 
     <lb/>
     faith by Britain, that if she had carried out her 
     <lb/>
     obligation to us no confederation question would 
     <lb/>
     have arisen at all. Great currency has been given 
     <lb/>
     to this notion. Indeed it has been actively and 
     <lb/>
     sedulously circulated. This notion has grown into 
     <lb/>
     the more vicious and equally unfounded charge 
     <lb/>
     that Britain is false, that Britain is not to be 
     <lb/>
     trusted, that Britain is trying to cheat us out of our 
     <lb/>
     rights, including the right of responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment, that Britain is actively plotting to thrust us 
     <lb/>
     into confederation whether we want it or not, that 
     <lb/>
     Britain is plotting to retain Commission govern<lb break="no"/>ment. In fact about the only political crime that is 
     <lb/>
     not charged up to Britain today is that of trying 
     <lb/>
     to foist responsible government on us. It is in no 
     <lb/>
     way surprising, therefore, to find that almost 
     <lb/>
     invariably, if not exclusively, every one of these 
     <lb/>
     charges is voiced by a supporter of responsible 
     <lb/>
     government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now what are the bases of these charges? The 
     <lb/>
     argument runs something like this: in 1933-34 the 
     <lb/>
     British government promised that when New<lb break="no"/>foundland became self-supporting responsible 
     <lb/>
     government would be restored if the people 
     <lb/>
     wanted it. Newfoundland is now technically self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     supporting, and it remains therefore only for 
     <lb/>
     Britain to give us back responsible government 
     <lb/>
     and clear out. "Give us back what we had, give 
     <lb/>
     us back responsible government", that is the cry. 
     <lb/>
     What are the real facts? It is quite true that the 
     <lb/>
     British government of 1933 did promise to re<lb break="no"/>store responsible government to Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     if and when she became self-supporting, and if 


            <pb n="1388"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-27-28_Page_1388.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1388</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
        

     the people requested it. Of that there can be no 
     <lb/>
     doubt whatever, and it is also true that New<lb break="no"/>foundland, at least in the official sense, is self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     supporting today — we do not presently require 
     <lb/>
     grants from Britain to pay our government bills. 
     <lb/>
     But just where and how has that promise of 
     <lb/>
     Britain been broken? Is there not to be a national 
     <lb/>
     referendum? Are not the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland to vote at that referendum? Will not 
     <lb/>
     responsible government be one of the forms for 
     <lb/>
     which they may vote on the ballot at that referen<lb break="no"/>dum? And if the people of Newfoundland, by a 
     <lb/>
     majority, request a return of responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment does anyone here suggest that Britain will 
     <lb/>
     refuse to carry out that wish? Where, I ask you, 
     <lb/>
     is the broken promise? What then is it that rouses 
     <lb/>
     the ire of these responsible governmentites al<lb break="no"/>most to the pitch of frenzy? I will tell you. It is 
     <lb/>
     not that Britain has failed to carry out that 
     <lb/>
     promise of 1933, but that she has done more than 
     <lb/>
     honour what these people are pleased to term her 
     <lb/>
     bond. She has not only undertaken to give us back 
     <lb/>
     responsible government if we want it, but also to 
     <lb/>
     give us any other form of government (within 
     <lb/>
     reason, of course) which we may request. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let me put the position to you by a very simple 
     <lb/>
     illustration. Let us suppose a man takes his young 
     <lb/>
     son to a house which he, the father, owns, and 
     <lb/>
     says, "Son, when you are 21 years of age I will 
     <lb/>
     give you this house if you want it." The boy 
     <lb/>
     reaches the age of 21, and the father now says to 
     <lb/>
     him, "Son, some years ago I promised you this 
     <lb/>
     house if you asked me for it when you became 
     <lb/>
     21. You are now 21, and I intend to keep my 
     <lb/>
     promise, but before you ask me for it I want to 
     <lb/>
     show you two other houses that I own." There<lb break="no"/>upon he shows the young man these two other 
     <lb/>
     houses, and says, "Now you can have your choice 
     <lb/>
     of the three." Has that man broken his promise to 
     <lb/>
     his son? He has not, he has enlarged it, he has 
     <lb/>
     extended it. In exactly the same way Britain has 
     <lb/>
     fulfilled her so-called bond to the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. She says to us, in effect, "You New<lb break="no"/>foundland people may have a return of 
     <lb/>
     responsible government if you want it, or if you 
     <lb/>
     prefer you may have Commission government, 
     <lb/>
     or confederation; or tell me what you do want and 
     <lb/>
     I will give you anything within reason." Britain 
     <lb/>
     has given us more than she promised. And so we 
     <lb/>
     see that the real complaint of these followers of 
     <lb/>
     responsible government is not that Britain failed 


            <cb/>
        

     to honour her promise, but that she fulfilled it 
     <lb/>
     pressed down and running over. She has given us 
     <lb/>
     more than she agreed to give, and it is that <hi rendition="simple:italic">more</hi> 
     <lb/>
     to which the responsible governmentites object. 
     <lb/>
     They don't want anything but responsible 
     <lb/>
     government. "Give us what we had", is their cry. 
     <lb/>
     In their hearts they want no Convention, no 
     <lb/>
     recommendations, no referendum, no choice for 
     <lb/>
     the people. In fact their real desire is to thrust a 
     <lb/>
     return of responsible government on the people, 
     <lb/>
     whether the people want it or not. They see in this 
     <lb/>
     free choice a grave danger that their own faith 
     <lb/>
     may be cast out. They stand in deadly fear that it 
     <lb/>
     will. These people who profess the democratic 
     <lb/>
     way of life, and who would destroy the referen<lb break="no"/>dum by a resolution if they could, and thus wipe 
     <lb/>
     the people out of the picture, complain bitterly 
     <lb/>
     that Britain has broken her promise, and is false, 
     <lb/>
     and is not to be trusted, because she has given the 
     <lb/>
     people more than she agreed to give. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let us have no more of this stupid, and in some 
     <lb/>
     instances I fear, dishonest chatter about Britain 
     <lb/>
     having broken faith. Responsible government 
     <lb/>
     will be on the ballot. The people can, if they wish, 
     <lb/>
     request its restoration. And if they do it will be 
     <lb/>
     restored. And if anybody holds that confedera<lb break="no"/>tion should not be discussed, let him not blame 
     <lb/>
     the British government, nor the Commission 
     <lb/>
     government, nor the Canadian government. It 
     <lb/>
     was this Convention, I remind you, that voted 24 
     <lb/>
     to 16 to send a delegation to Ottawa to ascertain 
     <lb/>
     conditions of union. Let no one be blamed for 
     <lb/>
     what we did ourselves by a substantial majority. 
     <lb/>
     And even more fantastic is the misconception 
     <lb/>
     that has been stated again and again here and 
     <lb/>
     elsewhere, that we must get responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment before considering confederation at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are several points that are overlooked 
     <lb/>
     by those who repeat this absurd contention. First, 
     <lb/>
     what guarantee have we that the people will vote 
     <lb/>
     for responsible government? And yet they must, 
     <lb/>
     according to this contention, before confedera<lb break="no"/>tion can be considered at all. If a consideration of 
     <lb/>
     confederation is to be postponed until our people 
     <lb/>
     vote for responsible government, then it will be 
     <lb/>
     a very, very long day indeed before we come 
     <lb/>
     around to a consideration of it. And again, assum<lb break="no"/>ing that the people want confederation, will some 
     <lb/>
     one kindly explain to me just why they should be 
     <lb/>
     saddled with, why they should have forced upon 
     <lb/>
     them, a form of government which they don't

     want in order to get what they do want, why the 
     <lb/>
     responsible government which they reject should 
     <lb/>
     be imposed upon them in spite of their wishes? 
     <lb/>
     Why, if a majority of Newfoundlanders want 
     <lb/>
     confederation today, they must be subject to 
     <lb/>
     responsible government which they don't want? 
     <lb/>
     Will somebody kindly explain that to me? Such 
     <lb/>
     a proceeding, sir, has about it a very strong smell 
     <lb/>
     of Hitlerism, of that dictatorship which these 
     <lb/>
     persons who advocate the idea profess to hate so 
     <lb/>
     utterly. It is coolly suggested that the people shall 
     <lb/>
     be forced to vote for what they don't want in order 
     <lb/>
     to get what they do want. If that is not the very 
     <lb/>
     spirit of dictatorship I do not know what it is. 
     <lb/>
       </p>


            <p>Again, these anticonfederate addicts have 
     <lb/>another refrain. They tell us that the Ottawa 
     <lb/>delegation had no power to negotiate, and that a 
     <lb/>duly elected government would have authority to 
     <lb/>enter into a bargain with the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and that therefore an elected government 
     <lb/>would get better terms. "Oh yes", they say, "these 
     <lb/>terms are pretty good, but an elected government 
     <lb/>would get better." Let us take a look at that theory 
     <lb/>for a moment. In the first place there are two 
     <lb/>alternatives involved in this idea that an elected 
     <lb/>government should get the terms. Firstly, that 
     <lb/>having got the deal with Canada the elected 
     <lb/>government would put that deal through without 
     <lb/>consulting the people. The people would then 
     <lb/>have no voice in the terms at all — none 
     <lb/>whatever. Is that what they want? Or second, the 
     <lb/>elected government would, after making the deal, 
     <lb/>submit it to the people, in which case they would 
     <lb/>have had no more authority to speak for the 
     <lb/>people than our Ottawa delegation had. And 
     <lb/>make no mistake about it, sir, it is the voice of the 
     <lb/>people of Newfoundland that the Canadian 
     <lb/>government wishes to hear, and not that of a 
     <lb/>government forced upon them by Britain or this 
     <lb/>Convention. And let no one imagine that 
     <lb/>Newfoundland's entry into the Canadian union is 
     <lb/>a matter of horse-trading, or that the statesmen of 
     <lb/>Canada, that greatest dominion of the British 
     <lb/>Commonwealth, are trying to put a shady deal 
     <lb/>over on this little people who are their own kith 
     <lb/>and kin. I well remember the words of Canada's 
     <lb/>Minister of External Affairs, the Right Honour<lb break="no"/>able Mr. St. Laurent, who was chairman of this 
     <lb/>conference — words uttered by him at the very 
     <lb/>outset of our discussions: "What we are trying to 
     <lb/>discover", he said, "is whether union of our two 
 

            <cb/>
 

     countries will work. Whether it will work to the 
     <lb/>
     mutual advantage of both. We must discover 
     <lb/>
     whether confederation under the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act will actually work out in practice." 
     <lb/>
     And that, sir was the spirit that permeated all our 
     <lb/>
     discussions. Those are not the words of a truck<lb break="no"/>ling tinhorn politician, but of a statesman who is 
     <lb/>
     held in profound respect by all shades of opinion 
     <lb/>
     in Canada, a man who was never a politician, but 
     <lb/>
     who was called into his country's counsels in the 
     <lb/>
     early stages of the war because of his character, 
     <lb/>
     his skill and his unimpeachable integrity. And it 
     <lb/>
     is with him, and with statesmen of his calibre that 
     <lb/>
     it is suggested that a delegation sent by a respon<lb break="no"/>sible government no less, a responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment forced upon the people perhaps against its 
     <lb/>
     will, might do a little horse-trading. Sir, I wonder 
     <lb/>
     if those who visualise the making of the terms of 
     <lb/>
     federal union as something akin to the chattering 
     <lb/>
     of a housewife over a basket of vegetables in the 
     <lb/>
     marketplace, I wonder if they appreciate the true 
     <lb/>
     Canada of today? Do they realise that this Canada 
     <lb/>
     is a great and a generous nation, the third largest 
     <lb/>
     exporting country in the world, whose generous 
     <lb/>
     policy towards the mother country, both during 
     <lb/>
     the war and ever since, is eloquent testimony not 
     <lb/>
     only to her great wealth, but to her realisation of 
     <lb/>
     the high moral obligation which rests upon her as 
     <lb/>
     a member of the Commonwealth. While the con<lb break="no"/>flict was in progress she gave and loaned to 
     <lb/>
     Britain literally thousands of millions of dollars, 
     <lb/>
     and since then she has continued that policy, as 
     <lb/>
     well as the policy of supplying that war-torn and 
     <lb/>
     impoverished land with millions of tons of food 
     <lb/>
     at amazingly low prices. And yet this is the 
     <lb/>
     country that the anticonfederates would liken 
     <lb/>
     unto a housewife haggling over a basket of 
     <lb/>
     potatoes. Don't they realise that confederation is 
     <lb/>
     not the making of a merely commercial bargain 
     <lb/>
     between a couple of private businessmen? Con<lb break="no"/>federation is a proposal for political union. A 
     <lb/>
     partnership between Newfoundland and Canada 
     <lb/>
     presupposes that we shall become one more 
     <lb/>
     among the provinces that constitute that union. 
     <lb/>
     </p>

            <p>Far from being a trading corporation, those 
     <lb/>nine provinces are bound together by a constitu<lb break="no"/>tion known as the British North America Act. 
     <lb/>This act, which was passed by the British Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment 80 years ago, lays down the terms and 
     <lb/>conditions of that union, and this act must govern 
     <lb/>the entry of any country into that union, be it 


            <pb n="1390"

     Newfoundland or any other. Confederation 
     <lb/>
     therefore is not a case of a couple of businessmen 
     <lb/>
     driving a bargain; it is not a case of a couple of 
     <lb/>
     horsetraders, each trying to outsmart the other; it 
     <lb/>
     is not a matter of haggling, or bargaining, or even 
     <lb/>
     negotiating, except in the very broadest and 
     <lb/>
     loosest sense of that term. It is a case of ascertain<lb break="no"/>ing what are the terms of union as laid down by 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act, and by the various 
     <lb/>
     regulations and agreements having their roots in 
     <lb/>
     that act. Nor can the federal government dis<lb break="no"/>criminate against, or unduly favour any province 
     <lb/>
     or proposed province. It has a duty not to unduly 
     <lb/>
     favour any province at the expense of others. All 
     <lb/>
     that any delegation, whether it be from an elected 
     <lb/>
     government or from this Convention can do, is to 
     <lb/>
     learn the limits of what is possible under 
     <lb/>
     Canada's constitution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, that has been done by the Ottawa delega<lb break="no"/>tion, and the Prime Minister of Canada himself 
     <lb/>
     tells us plainly in his letter to His Excellency the 
     <lb/>
     Governor, that on the financial side the proposals 
     <lb/>
     he has laid before us are the best that Canada can 
     <lb/>
     offer. No delegation of an elected government, or 
     <lb/>
     any other government could do more. But not<lb break="no"/>withstanding all these hard facts the anticon<lb break="no"/>federates continue their refrain. "Give us back 
     <lb/>
     what we had", they insist, "and in the first general 
     <lb/>
     election the confederates can enter a political 
     <lb/>
     party. If they win a majority they will be the 
     <lb/>
     government, and they can go to Ottawa and 
     <lb/>
     negotiate terms." That is the plan they have rather 
     <lb/>
     clumsily worked out. Let us take a look at that. I 
     <lb/>
     have already pointed out that responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment might not win at the referendum. The 
     <lb/>
     people may refuse to vote for it, for the simple 
     <lb/>
     reason that they don't want it. In that event con<lb break="no"/>federation would not be submitted to the people 
     <lb/>
     at all, if the anticonfederate plans were worked 
     <lb/>
     out. Thus would they cheat the people out of their 
     <lb/>
     right to consider confederation by forcing them 
     <lb/>
     to vote for what they don't want in order to get 
     <lb/>
     what they do want. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And if we assume, <hi rendition="simple:italic">if we assume</hi> that respon<lb break="no"/>sible government is accepted under these im<lb break="no"/>moral conditions. it might well happen that no 
     <lb/>
     political party favourable to confederation would 
     <lb/>
     enter the field, for it requires both money and 
     <lb/>
     organisation to fight an election. That alone could 
     <lb/>
     defeat the wishes of tens of thousands of New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders who want to vote on this question 


            <cb/>
      

     of confederation. And even if a confederate party 
     <lb/>
     were formed, what assurance is there that it 
     <lb/>
     would win a majority of the districts? It might 
     <lb/>
     have no election funds, or it might have some but 
     <lb/>
     still be smothered under the weight of anticon<lb break="no"/>federate money. All these possibilities exist. We 
     <lb/>
     all know what has happened in elections in this 
     <lb/>
     country before, and the same things can happen 
     <lb/>
     again. A general election is no way to decide so 
     <lb/>
     vitally important a matter as the very nature and 
     <lb/>
     very form of the future government of this 
     <lb/>
     country. In the noise and excitement of party 
     <lb/>
     contest, amidst all the hysteria and propaganda, 
     <lb/>
     with all the charges and counter-charges and 
     <lb/>
     political catch-cries and abuse, the promises of 
     <lb/>
     grants to sectional interests, jobs and concessions 
     <lb/>
     to individuals, in all that chaos of excitement 
     <lb/>
     what possible chance would any form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment have of being calmly considered on its 
     <lb/>
     merits? People might indeed desire to give it that 
     <lb/>
     calm and careful consideration, but they would 
     <lb/>
     be badgered and hounded, and confused and be<lb break="no"/>wildered by the propaganda and personalities, 
     <lb/>
     and the wild political charges and promises so 
     <lb/>
     characteristic of general elections in the past. No 
     <lb/>
     sir, the time for the people to give careful con<lb break="no"/>sideration to such a vital matter is not in the heat 
     <lb/>
     and bitterness of a general election, where can<lb break="no"/>didates are vying with each other to get votes, but 
     <lb/>
     in the far cooler and more rational atmosphere of 
     <lb/>
     a referendum, where there are no candidates 
     <lb/>
     seeking election, and where the people themsel<lb break="no"/>ves are selecting the very form of government of 
     <lb/>
     their choice. They are not true friends of New<lb break="no"/>foundland or of her people, who would plunge 
     <lb/>
     this country and her people into the boiling pot 
     <lb/>
     of a party contest, and subject it to the distorting 
     <lb/>
     and fighting and squabbling of a general election, 
     <lb/>
     where the personal popularity, the promises, and 
     <lb/>
     speaking ability of candidates are such important 
     <lb/>
     factors. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In this connection there is another point which 
     <lb/>
     is of great importance. This plan might easily 
     <lb/>
     bring a decision contrary to the wishes of the 
     <lb/>
     majority. I want to repeat that, sir. This plan 
     <lb/>
     might very well bring a decision contrary to the 
     <lb/>
     wishes of the majority. What guarantee have we 
     <lb/>
     that the party which secures the majority of the 
     <lb/>
     seats in the House of Assembly will have a 
     <lb/>
     majority of the total vote polled? I have seen 
     <lb/>
     candidates elected by five votes, and others by 


            <pb n="1391"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-27-28_Page_1391.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1391</fw>
         

     2,500. It has happened before, and it might well 
     <lb/>
     happen again, that the successful party would poll 
     <lb/>
     less than half the number of votes cast. Thus 
     <lb/>
     would the majority of the people — the will of 
     <lb/>
     the majority — be completely defeated by a 
     <lb/>
     minority vote. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And let me ask this further simple question: 
     <lb/>
     why is it suggested that forms of government 
     <lb/>
     should be split up in this unreasonable fashion — 
     <lb/>
     two to be submitted to the people for their choice 
     <lb/>
     at the referendum, and a third to be held back and 
     <lb/>
     subsequently thrown into the confusion and 
     <lb/>
     chaos of a general election? Three forms of 
     <lb/>
     government are on men's lips today. Why should 
     <lb/>
     one of them be put to such a disadvantage? It is 
     <lb/>
     noteworthy, sir, that the suggestion comes not 
     <lb/>
     from those who want our people to have a free 
     <lb/>
     choice, but rather from those who would force 
     <lb/>
     responsible government down the people's 
     <lb/>
     throats like a dose of evil-tasting medicine. I ask 
     <lb/>
     you to remember that it is the anticonfederates, 
     <lb/>
     the responsible government champions, who 
     <lb/>
     would thus prevent the people from giving their 
     <lb/>
     verdict upon a form of government laid before 
     <lb/>
     them by this Convention itself as a result of 
     <lb/>
     Britain's complete good faith — who would 
     <lb/>
     force the people to vote, not for what they want, 
     <lb/>
     but for what they don't want in order to get what 
     <lb/>
     they want. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And finally, does it not occur to these anticon<lb break="no"/>federates that the referendum is the proper, the 
     <lb/>
     only just method of deciding the issue of forms 
     <lb/>
     of government? It is the people, and not political 
     <lb/>
     parties, who will be subject to the new govern<lb break="no"/>ment, whatever that new government may be. 
     <lb/>
     Who, then, should directly, and without the med<lb break="no"/>dling of any political party, decide the matter? Is 
     <lb/>
     anyone going to tell me that the people are not fit 
     <lb/>
     to make that decision? Is anyone going to say that 
     <lb/>
     the people should not be trusted to decide the type 
     <lb/>
     of government by which they shall be ruled? And 
     <lb/>
     yet these anticonfederates would say, they do say, 
     <lb/>
     to the people, "No! You shall not choose from 
     <lb/>
     these three forms. We don't believe in one of 
     <lb/>
     them, therefore it must be postponed. You must 
     <lb/>
     accept first the one which we want. When you 
     <lb/>
     have done that, perhaps you will get a chance to 
     <lb/>
     vote for the other. Even though you don't want 
     <lb/>
     our form, you must vote for it. You must vote for 
     <lb/>
     what you don't want in order to get what you 
    

            <cb/>
      

     want. You shall not vote for confederation unless 
     <lb/>
     you vote for responsible government first." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Only once in our history has the question of 
     <lb/>
     confederation been submitted to our people. That 
     <lb/>
     was in 1869, two years after the then four British 
     <lb/>
     colonies on the mainland were united to form 
     <lb/>
     Canada. The Canadian union was then in its 
     <lb/>
     experimental stage, and there was no certainty 
     <lb/>
     that it would succeed or even survive. It lacked 
     <lb/>
     financial strength, the prairies were unpopulated, 
     <lb/>
     the transcontinental railway not even con<lb break="no"/>templated, and the country's economy almost 
     <lb/>
     entirely agricultural. Here in Newfoundland our 
     <lb/>
     people were uneducated. Few ever saw a news<lb break="no"/>paper. There was no radio. The whole question 
     <lb/>
     of confederation was deliberately turned into a 
     <lb/>
     political squabble. The anticonfederate party was 
     <lb/>
     led by a great merchant who spared no expense 
     <lb/>
     to win. An army of party hacks were sent around 
     <lb/>
     the Island to poison the people's minds against 
     <lb/>
     confederation. These henchmen traded on the 
     <lb/>
     people's ignorance and assured them that their 
     <lb/>
     property would be taxed — their homes, their 
     <lb/>
     furniture, their gardens, boats, flakes, stages, 
     <lb/>
     fishing gear, their poultry and animals, the very 
     <lb/>
     panes of glass in their homes. A horde of 
     <lb/>
     Canadian tax-gatherers would swarm over the 
     <lb/>
     land, the anticonfederates declared, and woe 
     <lb/>
     betide the unfortunates who didn't have the hard 
     <lb/>
     cash to pay up, for the hungry tax collectors 
     <lb/>
     would seize their property, put them on the street. 
     <lb/>
     Canada would seize their young men to fight her 
     <lb/>
     wars, and their bones would be left to bleach on 
     <lb/>
     the desert sands of Canada. Their very babies 
     <lb/>
     would be used as gun-wads in the Canadian can<lb break="no"/>non. Sir, if you cannot credit these statements, 
     <lb/>
     you have only to turn to Prowse's <hi rendition="simple:italic">History of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland</hi>. There was no secret ballot in 
     <lb/>
     those days. There was no manhood suffrage. 
     <lb/>
     There was no woman's vote at all. The unfor<lb break="no"/>tunate voter had to declare his vote aloud in the 
     <lb/>
     presence of the party agent — often the employee 
     <lb/>
     of the local merchant, and it was a bold man who 
     <lb/>
     would brave the anger of his supplier in those 
     <lb/>
     semi-feudal days. As we look back upon that 
     <lb/>
     story of 1869, it is difficult to believe that any 
     <lb/>
     men voted for confederation; but thousands did, 
     <lb/>
     and it is of tremendous significance that out of 30 
     <lb/>
     members elected to the House of Assembly, ten 
     <lb/>
     were confederates.<ref target="#fn_02">[1]</ref>

<p>
     How vastly different is the whole prospect 
     <lb/>
     today. Canada is a rich and powerful nation — 
     <lb/>
     no longer a strange and foreign land, but a friend<lb break="no"/>ly neighbour in which many thousands of our 
     <lb/>
     own Newfoundland people are prospering at this 
     <lb/>
     very moment. And our Newfoundland people are 
     <lb/>
     educated today, they are better informed, they 
     <lb/>
     read the newspaper and magazines, they have 
     <lb/>
     radios, they have relatives and friends in Canada. 
     <lb/>
     No longer are they under the thumb of anyone, 
     <lb/>
     merchant or otherwise. They have full manhood 
     <lb/>
     suffrage, both men and women. And they have 
     <lb/>
     the secret ballot. And, sir, they have something 
     <lb/>
     more: they have experience of two forms of 
     <lb/>
     government, Commission and responsible. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is, however, one thing which has not 
     <lb/>
     changed. The same policy of twisting and distort<lb break="no"/>ing and misrepresenting the facts is again to be 
     <lb/>
     seen. The tax scare, which worked so well in 
     <lb/>
     1869, is again put to work. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But these despicable political dodges are a bit 
     <lb/>
     stale and ineffectual, and so the anticonfederates 
     <lb/>
     have coined a new one, the Labrador scare. "If 
     <lb/>
     we become part of Canada, Quebec will chisel us 
     <lb/>
     out of Labrador." Sir, these men in their despera<lb break="no"/>tion forget that our people know full well that 
     <lb/>
     Labrador was awarded to Newfoundland by the 
     <lb/>
     Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and that 
     <lb/>
     there is no way whatever to upset that award. 
     <lb/>
     They know further that the terms of union now 
     <lb/>
     before us contain a definite undertaking by the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government that Labrador shall form 
     <lb/>
     part of the Province of Newfoundland. They 
     <lb/>
     know that the British North America Act, which 
     <lb/>
     even the Government of Canada must obey, dis<lb break="no"/>tinctly and clearly lays down the condition that 
     <lb/>
     no territory of a province can be taken from it. 
     <lb/>
     That is one of the terms of union. This silly 
     <lb/>
     catch-cry will fail, sir, as will the old and mouldy 
     <lb/>
     wail about taxing people's property. I do not 
     <lb/>
     know whether these anticonfederates are aware 
     <lb/>
     of it, but it is strictly true to say that since the 
     <lb/>
     beginning of Canadian confederation some 80 
     <lb/>
     years ago there never has been, and there is not 
     <lb/>
     now, any tax of any kind whatever imposed by 
     <lb/>
     Canada upon people's property. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is a grave decision which faces our people 
     <lb/>
     today — the form and nature of their future 
     <lb/>
     government. Only three forms seem to have been 
     <lb/>
     considered at all, whether in this Convention or 
     <lb/>
     among the citizens. They are the Commission, 


            <cb/>
        

     responsible and confederation forms. I under<lb break="no"/>stand, sir, that I am not permitted to discuss now 
     <lb/>
     either responsible or Commission government. I 
     <lb/>
     would have liked to do so, for neither of them is 
     <lb/>
     all good nor all bad. I must, however, bow to your 
     <lb/>
     ruling and confine myself to the third form, con<lb break="no"/>federation, which proposes that Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     should enter the Canadian union as the tenth 
     <lb/>
     province or partner. Notice, please, that it is not 
     <lb/>
     a case either of annexation or absorption or taking 
     <lb/>
     over. We go in as a partner, retaining our own 
     <lb/>
     identity, governing ourselves as to local matters, 
     <lb/>
     and sharing in the government of all Canada in 
     <lb/>
     matters of national interest. We will retain our 
     <lb/>
     own legislature right here in St. John's, with 
     <lb/>
     which nobody will interfere. We will also send 
     <lb/>
     elected members to represent us in the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons, just as each province now 
     <lb/>
     does. We will not be a dependency without a 
     <lb/>
     word in our cheeks, but a partner with a full voice 
     <lb/>
     in Canada's councils, and complete control of 
     <lb/>
     local Newfoundland affairs. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Eighty years ago it might have been sound to 
     <lb/>
     say that to join in the union then would have been 
     <lb/>
     risky. The union had no assurance of success or 
     <lb/>
     even of continued existence. Today the prospect 
     <lb/>
     is far different. Those four weak provinces have 
     <lb/>
     grown and expanded into a mighty nation whose 
     <lb/>
     institutions have a world reputation for sound<lb break="no"/>ness and stability, and whose social, commercial 
     <lb/>
     and financial services are in the front rank of 
     <lb/>
     sane, modern development, and whose standard 
     <lb/>
     of living is far ahead of ours. If you doubt this 
     <lb/>
     latter statement, ask the people of the southwest 
     <lb/>
     coast, and of Labrador and northern New<lb break="no"/>foundland, who are in constant touch with 
     <lb/>
     Canada. Truly, Canada has proved that in union 
     <lb/>
     there is strength, and it would now appear in<lb break="no"/>evitable that had we joined the union in 1869, the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland people would be better off today. 
     <lb/>
     Of course the standard of living is higher in some 
     <lb/>
     parts of Canada than in other parts, just as in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland the people of the paper towns are 
     <lb/>
     better situated than those of the fishing settle<lb break="no"/>ments. These variations are inevitable in any 
     <lb/>
     country, as they depend on the resources of the 
     <lb/>
     particular locality. But there is no province of 
     <lb/>
     Canada which cannot show a better standard of 
     <lb/>
     living than we have experienced. That is a 
     <lb/>
     definite result of union, the system of taxation 
     <lb/>
     and distribution of revenue, and the power which 
  

            <pb n="1393"

     the united provinces wield in the world. The 
     <lb/>
     individual provinces don't count for very much, 
     <lb/>
     but when Canada speaks the nations of the world 
     <lb/>
     listen. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Under confederation we would be relieved of 
     <lb/>
     the cost of many public services which at present 
     <lb/>
     are a terrible load for this little country to carry. 
     <lb/>
     We would be relieved of that terrible but neces<lb break="no"/>sary burden, the railway. The postal, airport and 
     <lb/>
     veterans' services would be taken off our 
     <lb/>
     shoulders and improved. In the field of social 
     <lb/>
     service we would enjoy the benefits of family 
     <lb/>
     allowances, old age pensions, unemployment in<lb break="no"/>surance and sick mariners' and fishermen's 
     <lb/>
     hospitalisation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have heard some strange pronouncements 
     <lb/>
     voiced both in and out of this chamber within the 
     <lb/>
     past couple of months, but none more curious 
     <lb/>
     than the assertions that Newfoundlanders were 
     <lb/>
     lazy and that family allowances were immoral, 
     <lb/>
     degrading and would result in people ceasing to 
     <lb/>
     earn a living. The first of these statements I pass 
     <lb/>
     by as beneath contempt. But the latter cannot be 
     <lb/>
     allowed to go unchallenged. Family allowances 
     <lb/>
     are paid by the Canadian government to every 
     <lb/>
     child in Canada (and that would include New<lb break="no"/>foundland if our people chose confederation) 
     <lb/>
     from birth to the age of 16 years. The amount 
     <lb/>
     varies according to age from $5 to $8 per month 
     <lb/>
     for each child, or from $60 to $96 per year per 
     <lb/>
     child. The purpose is obvious. It is to ensure that 
     <lb/>
     every child in Canada shall have as far as possible 
     <lb/>
     appropriate food, sufficient clothing and educa<lb break="no"/>tion, notwithstanding that its parents are not 
     <lb/>
     prosperous. And, in order that the stigma of 
     <lb/>
     pauperism might not attach to the payments, 
     <lb/>
     these allowances are payable to all children, rich 
     <lb/>
     and poor alike. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, I wonder if these professors of moral 
     <lb/>
     science, these dilettante arm-chair philosophers 
     <lb/>
     with their smug noses in the air, their full bellies, 
     <lb/>
     warm clothes and comfortable homes, can find 
     <lb/>
     one solitary clergyman of any denomination in 
     <lb/>
     the whole length and breadth of Canada — or 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland — who has ever condemned these 
     <lb/>
     family allowances. On the contrary, they have 
     <lb/>
     hailed them as one of the most Christian pieces 
     <lb/>
     of legislation ever placed upon the statute book 
     <lb/>
     of any country. Are these clergymen immoral 
     <lb/>
     also? In Australia, New Zealand, the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom and every other country that is for<lb break="no"/>
           

            <cb/>
    

tunate enough to have them, this Christian and 
     <lb/>
     highly moral method of fostering child and fami<lb break="no"/>ly life merits and receives unstinted praise from 
     <lb/>
     all thinking men. It was quite moral, I suppose, 
     <lb/>
     to condemn thousands of our children to the dole, 
     <lb/>
     but to pay them family allowances is immoral. 
     <lb/>
     Sir, I wonder if these people do really mean What 
     <lb/>
     they say? Are they lost to all sense of sympathy 
     <lb/>
     for the innocent child who is unfortunately 
     <lb/>
     placed? Would they deprive him of proper food, 
     <lb/>
     clothing and a chance to attend school? Have 
     <lb/>
     their hearts become gizzards and their bowels 
     <lb/>
     bass rope? I think not. I wonder if the truth is that 
     <lb/>
     this eminently Christian and moral protection of 
     <lb/>
     the children will constitute a powerful factor in 
     <lb/>
     attracting thinking people and fathers, and more 
     <lb/>
     particularly mothers, to confederation, and away 
     <lb/>
     from that dearest wish of their hearts, responsible 
     <lb/>
     government? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Much has been said of taxation. I have not the 
     <lb/>
     time to go into that matter. I would point out, 
     <lb/>
     however, that the Canadian government's 
     <lb/>
     expenditures here will be at least $36 million a 
     <lb/>
     year, and their receipts from us in taxes are offi<lb break="no"/>cially estimated at $20 million. Moreover, as to 
     <lb/>
     more than half our provincial revenue, it will be 
     <lb/>
     provided by the federal government, leaving $5-6 
     <lb/>
     million to be collected in local taxation. In other 
     <lb/>
     words, in return for our paying a total of $26 
     <lb/>
     million a year in taxes, we shall in federal and 
     <lb/>
     provincial services, both public and social, 
     <lb/>
     receive the equivalent of $51 million a year. The 
     <lb/>
     red herring of per capita debt has been drawn into 
     <lb/>
     this matter, and we have been told that every man, 
     <lb/>
     woman and child in this country will be saddled 
     <lb/>
     with his share of some $1,400. Why don't these 
     <lb/>
     distorters of fact go to the logical limit of absur<lb break="no"/>dity and tell us that unless this is promptly paid a 
     <lb/>
     writ will be served on every infant in the cradle 
     <lb/>
     and his napkins sold to pay the bill? I never heard 
     <lb/>
     such trash before. Of course that debt is serviced 
     <lb/>
     out of the general revenues of Canada, which is 
     <lb/>
     collected mainly by income tax from corpora<lb break="no"/>tions and individuals best able to pay, according 
     <lb/>
     to their profits. That is the whole policy of 
     <lb/>
     Canadian taxation — to put the burden on the 
     <lb/>
     broadest shoulders. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, the whole campaign against confederation 
     <lb/>
     has been a continuous barrage of bald statements 
     <lb/>
     unsupported by any logical proof. "Give us back 
     <lb/>
     what we had", they cry. "Canada will tax your 
   

            <pb n="1394"

     property; Quebec will get the Labrador; respon<lb break="no"/>sible government will get better terms." Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, here are the terms of union. The 
     <lb/>
     people have them now. Let <hi rendition="simple:italic">them</hi> decide the issue. 
     <lb/>
     It is their absolute right, and if the members of 
     <lb/>
     this Convention in inconceivable arrogance at<lb break="no"/>tempt to cheat them of that right, I warn them that 
     <lb/>
     the people will know how to deal with them. 
     <lb/>
     
      </p>

            <p>Sir, my duties as a Convention member are 
     <lb/>now all but ended. What I have done throughout 
     <lb/>is to try as best I could to reach no decision as to 
     <lb/>the comparative merits of the different forms of 
     <lb/>government until all the facts possible had been 
     <lb/>ascertained and discussed. And for that reason I 
     <lb/>have made no confession of political faith in this 
     <lb/>chamber. Some of you will remember that years 
     <lb/>ago I strongly opposed the introduction of Com<lb break="no"/>mission government. While I did not then and do 
     <lb/>not now favour that form, my hostility to its 
     <lb/>introduction was based mainly upon the fact that 
     <lb/>it was imposed upon the people without even 
     <lb/>asking their consent. It robbed the people of the 
     <lb/>right to say how they should be ruled. What was 
     <lb/>done then was undemocratic and politically in<lb break="no"/>decent. Again I am faced with a similar question 
     <lb/>today. There is to be a referendum at which the 
     <lb/>people are to decide what form of government 
     <lb/>they want. The defeat of this motion may rob 
     <lb/>them of their right to vote for one of the forms of 
     <lb/>government. I would not be a party to such rob<lb break="no"/>bery in 1933, and I will notbe a party to it in 1948. 
     <lb/>I will not join the enemies of the people. Who are 
     <lb/>the 45 individuals who sit here to say to the 
     <lb/>Newfoundland people, "You <hi rendition="simple:italic">shall not</hi> have an 
     <lb/>opportunity to vote for confederation?" What 
     <lb/>right have we to tell them that we will save them 
     <lb/>from themselves by denying them that right 
     <lb/>which was always theirs morally, and which 
     <lb/>Britain has returned to them now in full measure? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I shall vote for this motion. In my view it is 
     <lb/>the only course open to an honest man and a 
     <lb/>democrat. But I have, like every member, a 
     <lb/>preference of my own. I have given the matter a 
     <lb/>great deal of thought within the past 18 months, 
     <lb/>and I have at least had as good an opportunity to 
     <lb/>judge of the merits of the several forms of 
     <lb/>government as any man in Newfoundland, and I 
     <lb/>have come to a definite conclusion. I am not 
     <lb/>bound to disclose that conclusion here, but as 
     <lb/>many have made this Convention the means of 
     <lb/>proclaiming their political faiths, there is no 


            <cb/>
      

     reason why I should not tell the people where I 
     <lb/>
     stand. Naturally I hope the people will agree with 
     <lb/>
     me, but whatever form of government they 
     <lb/>
     choose I shall accept it loyally. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Because confederation will reduce the cost of 
     <lb/>
     living for our people and raise their standard of 
     <lb/>
     living; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Because confederation will reduce the burden 
     <lb/>
     of taxation on our people and apportion the bur<lb break="no"/>den more fairly amongst them;

            <p>

     social services such as no other form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment would give them;

            </p>

            <p>
     Because confederation will provide our 
     <lb/>
     people with wider opportunities of employment; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Because confederation will provide our 
     <lb/>
     people with greatly improved railway and other 
     <lb/>
     transportation services;

     <lb/>
     grants; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     Because confederation will make New<lb break="no"/>foundland one of the family of Canadian provin<lb break="no"/>ces and bring her into union with the great, 
     <lb/>
     wealthy and growing Canadian nation, which has 
     <lb/>
     flourished under union while we have marched 
     <lb/>
     with snail's pace under isolation; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Because of these irresistible benefits offered 
     <lb/>
     our struggling people, sir, I am a confederate. 
     <lb/>
     
   </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> First of all, I would like to offer my 
     <lb/>congratulations to my learned friend Mr. Bradley 
     <lb/>on a very fine Speech indeed. I have admired Mr. 
     <lb/>Bradley's forensic ability for some time and 
     <lb/>today his speech was of the same order. It was 
     <lb/>also fully apparent to me that Mr. Bradley was 
     <lb/>pleading a case which he himself was not fully 
     <lb/>satisfied with. With respect to the remarks made 
     <lb/>by Mr. Bradley in his address in referring to the 
     <lb/>conduct of members here prior to the Christmas 
     <lb/>recess, whatever that conduct was, we have been 
     <lb/>very fair. Nobody can say that this confederation 
     <lb/>proposal has not been given anything but the 
     <lb/>fullest attention of the house for a longer period 
     <lb/>than any other form of government or any other 
     <lb/>report, and as Mr. Smallwood admitted at the end 
     <lb/>of the debate, he was fully satisfied with all the 
     <lb/>publicity given it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would also like to say I concur with the 
     <lb/>
     previous speakers in the views expressed by them 
     <lb/>
     on the cornmunistic tinge of Mr. Smallwood's 
     <lb/>
     remarks during this debate. I would also like to

     draw your attention in this respect to the remarks 
     <lb/>
     made by him in speaking to the resolution we 
     <lb/>
     recently adopted. "They" (meaning the people) 
     <lb/>
     "are heartsick at seeing our governments feeding 
     <lb/>
     the fat sow. Truly, this is a country of which it 
     <lb/>
     can be said 'To him that hath shall be added, and 
     <lb/>
     from him that hath not, shall be taken away, even 
     <lb/>
     the little that he hath'." Then he said:

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I work for a living, you do also. 
     <lb/>All of us here do. We were sent here for a specific 
     <lb/>purpose, to endeavour to assist the people of this 
     <lb/>country in making up their minds as to what type 
     <lb/>of government they wanted. Not to inflame them; 
     <lb/>not to set class against class. I feel that I work as 
     <lb/>hard for a living as any of my countrymen. In a 
     <lb/>different way, I will admit, but still I feel, just as 
     <lb/>hard. I may not be a producer, but a necessary 
     <lb/>evil. I earn my money, and it is clean money. I 
     <lb/>resent this type of inflammatory talk. It is un<lb break="no"/>necessary and not part of our job to indulge in 
     <lb/>propaganda of any kind, and certainly not of this 
     <lb/>kind. If confederation means this manner of 
     <lb/>thinking being introduced into Newfoundland, I 
     <lb/>want no part of it — now, or any other time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I agree that the rights of labour should be 
     <lb/>
     recognised. I agree that the producers in the 
     <lb/>
     country should be recognised. I agree that labour 
     <lb/>
     must be represented in any government of the 
     <lb/>
     future, and represented in a manner that will 
     <lb/>
     protect fully the rights of labour. But, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, in my opinion, expressions such as I have 
     <lb/>
     drawn your attention to, are doing a disservice to 
     <lb/>
     labour. In Newfoundland, to my knowledge, rela<lb break="no"/>tions between capital and labour have been 
     <lb/>
     happy. None of us in Newfoundland are 
     <lb/>
     bluebloods. Some must necessarily be masters 
     <lb/>
     and some employees, but I say without fear of 


            <cb/>
        

     contradiction that no country in the world has as 
     <lb/>
     happy a relationship in this respect as we have 
     <lb/>
     here. If Mr. Smallwood's form of oratory is con<lb break="no"/>sidered to be in the best interests of New<lb break="no"/>foundland and of the representatives of labour in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, then, Mr. Chairman, I just cannot 
     <lb/>
     be thinking straight. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, that an article 
     <lb/>
     in a local newspaper, of which you, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, are legal adviser, is very pertinent. It is the 
     <lb/>
     paper dated January 25, Sunday last, and is an 
     <lb/>
     article written by a Newfoundlander — Mr. F. 
     <lb/>
     Reardon of 1988 Notre Dame St. West, Montreal. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Reardon stated that he had been persuaded 
     <lb/>
     by a friend to attend a meeting of the local union 
     <lb/>
     which had headquarters in Montreal. The meet<lb break="no"/>ing was actually a dinner for one of the union 
     <lb/>
     leaders. The hall was decorated with pictures of 
     <lb/>
     Lenin and Stalin. In the course of the speech by 
     <lb/>
     this union leader, he stated that labour in New<lb break="no"/>foundland was ripe for the sowing of communism 
     <lb/>
     and that of the 43,000 workers in the country, 
     <lb/>
     4,000 were already organized for communism. 
     <lb/>
     The speaker stressed the importance of helping 
     <lb/>
     to make confederation a reality. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In referring to a statement I made during the 
     <lb/>
     debate on this matter in committee of the whole, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood quoted me as saying, "Here is 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland sitting with a pat hand." What I 
     <lb/>
     meant to infer, of course, was that Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, for all the reasons I had enumerated, her 
     <lb/>
     strategic position and her mineral wealth, was in 
     <lb/>
     an excellent bargaining position. As an answer to 
     <lb/>
     this Mr. Smallwood said, "I wonder if Mr. Hig<lb break="no"/>gins is aware of the factthat we have nearly 1,200 
     <lb/>
     veterans of the late war out of jobs right here in 
     <lb/>
     St. John's tonight? I wonder if he is aware that 
     <lb/>
     we have thousands on the dole in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     at this moment?" I am by no means unsym<lb break="no"/>pathetic in this unfortunate situation, but in jus<lb break="no"/>tice to our country I would like to point out the 
     <lb/>
     following with respect to unemployment here 
     <lb/>
     and in Canada. I have taken the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     figures from the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Evening Telegram</hi>. It was stated 
     <lb/>
     in one of their issues of last week that 8,076 
     <lb/>
     persons who were able to work but could not 
     <lb/>
     secure employment received assistance for the 
     <lb/>
     year. These were figures released by the Depart<lb break="no"/>ment of Public Health and Welfare — 8,706 
     <lb/>
     people for the 12 months ending in December. 
     <lb/>
     The latest figure of registered unemployment

     applicants in Canada totalled 135,000. The latest 
     <lb/>
     available figures are up to December 18, 1947. 
     <lb/>
     They show an increase of 29,000 since Novem<lb break="no"/>ber 13, 1947. This 135,000 unemployed merely 
     <lb/>
     represents the number who have actually 
     <lb/>
     registered at unemployment offices. How many 
     <lb/>
     more there are unregistered is unknown. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are some statements made by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood when we debated this matter in com<lb break="no"/>mittee of the whole that I want to draw your 
     <lb/>
     attention to. In replying to Mr. Northcott, who 
     <lb/>
     asked him what the position would be in respect 
     <lb/>
     to divorce in the event of Newfoundland's enter<lb break="no"/>ing union with Canada, Mr. Smallwood stated:<ref target="#fn_03">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     ....I am going to say something about divorce 
     <lb/>
     in case we become a province of Canada. Sir, 
     <lb/>
     we have no divorce laws in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     We never did, and I hope we never will. 
     <lb/>
     Those provinces of Canada that are in union 
     <lb/>
     now, some of them had divorce laws, before 
     <lb/>
     confederation was started in 1867. They took 
     <lb/>
     their own laws into the union with them.... I 
     <lb/>
     don't think that any other province since then 
     <lb/>
     has passed a divorce law of its own. If New<lb break="no"/>foundland goes into confederation, I would 
     <lb/>
     give it as my opinion that it is ... highly 
     <lb/>
     unlikely that our House of Assembly will 
     <lb/>
     pass a divorce law.... If Mr. Northcott was a 
     <lb/>
     member of the provincial House of Assemb<lb break="no"/>ly, I don't think he will vote for it I don't 
     <lb/>
     think Mr. Starkes, Mr. Vincent or Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Jackman or any of us here will ever vote 
     <lb/>
     to pass a divorce law. That's very unlikely. 
     <lb/>
     </p></quote>

            <p>I say to you that by these words Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>was making a deliberate attempt to deceive the 
     <lb/>members of this Convention and possibly the 
     <lb/>people of this country. He attempted to convey 
     <lb/>the idea that in the event of federal union it was 
     <lb/>a matter for the parliament of the province 
     <lb/>whether a divorce law was passed and divorce 
     <lb/>courts set up here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That is definitely untrue, and Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     when making the statement knew it was untrue. 
     <lb/>
     The fact is that in the event of union, the matter 
     <lb/>
     of divorce is taken out of the hands of the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Newfoundland. The parliament of New<lb break="no"/>foundland would have no power to either set up 
     <lb/>
     divorce courts or to prevent them from being set 
     <lb/>
     up. That is a matter solely and entirely within the 
     <lb/>
     province of the federal government. I would refer 


            <cb/>
          

     you to the British North American Act and to 
     <lb/>
     your Black Book with respect to this matter. Then 
     <lb/>
     again in the course of his reply to Mr. Northcott, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood said, "Mind you, there are only 
     <lb/>
     two grounds for divorce in Canada — adultery 
     <lb/>
     and desertion." That is definitely untrue and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood knew at the time he made the state<lb break="no"/>ment that it was untrue. I would refer you again 
     <lb/>
     to your Black Book on this matter. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood is always bragging about his wonder<lb break="no"/>ful memory, so what are we to understand by 
     <lb/>
     these mis-statements? I would suggest to you quite 
     <lb/>
     definitely that they are deliberately misleading. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have pointed out to you the definite fact that 
     <lb/>
     in the event of federal union with Canada, the sole 
     <lb/>
     right and authority to pass a divorce law and to 
     <lb/>
     set up divorce courts in Newfoundland rests with 
     <lb/>
     the federal government at Ottawa and with that 
     <lb/>
     government alone. With union between the two 
     <lb/>
     countries the provincial legislature of New<lb break="no"/>foundland would have <hi rendition="simple:italic">no</hi> discretion to say "yes" 
     <lb/>
    or "no" in this matter. Unless a provision was 
     <lb/>included in the terms of union, clearly stating that 
     <lb/>the federal parliament at Ottawa would forego for 
     <lb/>all time the right to legislate for divorce in New<lb break="no"/>foundland and undertake to have the British 
     <lb/>North America Act amended accordingly, then 
     <lb/>without such provision, such terms would be 
     <lb/>unacceptable to the Catholic people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. As no such provision is made in the 
     <lb/>proposals received from the Right Honourable 
     <lb/>the Prime Minister of Canada, I must advise you, 
     <lb/>Mr. Chairman, that the proposals <hi rendition="simple:italic">cannot be ac<lb break="no"/>cepted</hi> by our Catholic people.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName>, during that same debate,

     <lb/>
     terms." That is not exactly what I said; however, 
     <lb/>
     he then went on to explain what wonderful men

            <p>I would like to repeat again what I did say on that 
     <lb/>occasion to which Mr. Smallwood made answer. 
     <lb/>I quoted from the reply from the Canadian 
     <lb/>government to our request for these discussions. 
     <lb/>"The Canadian government is of the opinion that 
     <lb/>the questions to be discussed with the delegation 
     <lb/>are of such complexity and of such significance 
     <lb/>for both countries that it is essential to have a 
     <lb/>complete and comprehensive exchange of infor<lb break="no"/>mation and a full and careful exploration by both 
     <lb/>parties of all the issues involved, so that an ac<lb break="no"/>curate appreciation of the position may be gained 
     <lb/>on each side." I drew your attention to the word<lb break="no"/>ing of this reply and, in particular, "the questions 
     <lb/>to be discussed with the delegation are of such 
     <lb/>complexity" and again, "so that an accurate ap<lb break="no"/>preciation of the position may be gained on each 
     <lb/>side." I then stated:

            </p>
   
    
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     As you are aware, our delegation had no 
     <lb/>
     expert assistance of any kind. Application 
     <lb/>
     was made to the Commission of Government 
     <lb/>
     for such assistance, but the application was 
     <lb/>
     refused. On the Canadian side, the cabinet 
     <lb/>
     members designated to take part in the dis<lb break="no"/>cussions were flanked by some of the top men 
     <lb/>
     of the civil service of Canada. Moreover, the 
     <lb/>
     problem of confederation had been under 
     <lb/>
     active study by this particular group since 
     <lb/>
     October of last year. Actually, Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government officials have been studying the 
     <lb/>
     proposition for some years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As you are aware, our delegation had no 
     <lb/>
     such opportunity of preparation and certainly 
     <lb/>
     no such assistance during the discussions. In 
     <lb/>
     my opinion, our delegation was not com<lb break="no"/>petent to discuss fully such an important mat<lb break="no"/>ter without proper assistance and without an 
     <lb/>
     adequate study of the problem. I say to you 
     <lb/>
     quite sincerely, that for any person, member 
     <lb/>
     of this Convention or not, to advise the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country to join in federal union 
     <lb/>
     with Canada without the necessary study of 
  
            <cb/>
         

     all the implications of such union, is nothing 
     <lb/>
     less than criminal. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What you say, is the proper approach? In 
     <lb/>
     my opinion before union should be recom<lb break="no"/>mended, a complete study of the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     system should be made by the various 
     <lb/>
     departmental heads of our civil service, to see 
     <lb/>
     and advise the effect such Union would have. 
     <lb/>
     The heads of these departments would then 
     <lb/>
     confer with a delegation having full powers 
     <lb/>
     to negotiate. In other words, the case for 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland would be carefully prepared 
     <lb/>
     and fully understood by those who are to 
     <lb/>
     present it, and moreover, the delegation rep<lb break="no"/>resenting Newfoundland should have with 
     <lb/>
     them these same departmental heads to ad<lb break="no"/>vise and assist throughout the negotiations.

     delegation will not take it that I am making 
     <lb/>
     any reflection on them when I say that the 
     <lb/>
     delegation was not competent to discuss the 
     <lb/>
     matters we were discussing. This is not in<lb break="no"/>tended to be a reflection on the ability of any 
     <lb/>
     one of them, but simply (except possibly in 
     <lb/>
     the case of Mr. Smallwood), that none of us 
     <lb/>
     had studied the matter thoroughly before the 
     <lb/>
     appointment of the delegation, and we were 
     <lb/>
     at a tremendous disadvantage with no tech<lb break="no"/>nical advice, and lastly, but most important 
     <lb/>
     of all, we had no power to negotiate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I must frankly confess that the offer we 
     <lb/>
     have received appears to be fair, but I am 
     <lb/>
     fully confident that a delegation properly in<lb break="no"/>formed, assisted by competent advisers, and 
     <lb/>
     with the power to negotiate would receive a 
     <lb/>
     better offer from Canada than we have 
     <lb/>
     received I say that with full knowledge of 
     <lb/>
     what I am saying. From information I 
     <lb/>
     gathered from various sources during our 
     <lb/>
     visit to Ottawa, I am certain that the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government would have given us a better 
     <lb/>
     offer than we have gotten had the case been 
     <lb/>
     properly presented Again I repeat with full 
     <lb/>
     knowledge of what I am saying, that we can 
     <lb/>
     still get a better offer or, if you will, more 
     <lb/>
     favourable terms of confederation, if the ap<lb break="no"/>proach is made by a government elected by 
     <lb/>
     and representative of Newfoundland.

            <p>
     I mean no reflection on the members of the 
     <lb/>
     delegation but I say again, that we were not 
     <lb/>
     competent to bargain for terms of confederation 
 

            <pb n="1398"

     as we had not given sufficient study to the 
     <lb/>
     problems, we were without proper assistance and 
     <lb/>
     above all, we had no power to negotiate. I say, 
     <lb/>
     and repeat again, that I am certain that We would 
     <lb/>
     have received a better offer if the approach had 
     <lb/>
     been by representatives of a duly elected govern<lb break="no"/>ment properly informed and with full powers to 
     <lb/>
     negotiate. Mr. Smallwood says that that is not 
     <lb/>
     true. I say it is true, and I leave it to you to decide 
     <lb/>
     who is telling the truth. Mr. Bradley read an 
     <lb/>
     extract from Mr. King's letter: "The Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada believes that the arrangements go as 
     <lb/>
     far as the government can go <hi rendition="simple:italic">under the cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances</hi>", meaning "with the facts presented 
     <lb/>
     to them". 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> in his reply in that same 
     <lb/>
     debate stated positively that if we entered federal 
     <lb/>
     union and did not like it, we could always leave 
     <lb/>
     the union. I feel certain that the incorrectness of 
     <lb/>
     this statementhas been proved to you quite amply 
     <lb/>
     by Hon. Mr. Job. I would quote to you further 
     <lb/>
     from the book by Professor Wheare: "It is indeed 
     <lb/>
     significant that the one modem government 
     <lb/>
     claiming to be federal which grants the right to 
     <lb/>
     secede, the USSR, is the one where the exercise 
     <lb/>
     of the right is least likely to be permitted." Yet 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood says we can always leave the 
     <lb/>
     union if we join up with Canada — maybe it is 
     <lb/>
     Russian. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In attempting to discredit me, Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     described me as a weather-vane That may be Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood's opinion, but I should hope, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman and gentlemen, that you will ap<lb break="no"/>preciate that I am merely an honest person who 
     <lb/>
     is sufficiently broad-minded to be able to change 
     <lb/>
     his opinion, and with the courage to say so. I do 
     <lb/>
     not, moreover, deal in untruths. The two points 
     <lb/>
     on which I changed my opinion were some state<lb break="no"/>ments by Major Cashin relative to the set-up of 
     <lb/>
     the Convention, and the question of discussing 
     <lb/>
     union with the USA as raised by Mr. Jackman's 
     <lb/>
     motion. Only two members of the Convention to 
     <lb/>
     my recollection supported this motion — Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Figary and Mr Reddy. With respect to union with 
     <lb/>
     the States. As we are aware, there does exist a 
     <lb/>
     very definite wish amongst a number of our 
     <lb/>
     countrymen that the ballot at the referendum 
     <lb/>
     should include union with the United States. It is 
     <lb/>
     too late now for this Convention to explore the 
     <lb/>
     possibility of union with that great country, and 
     <lb/>
     consequently the Convention will be unable to 
     

            <cb/>
       

     recommend that this form of government be 
     <lb/>
     placed on the ballot. Whilst it is quite definite that 
     <lb/>
     the future economic security of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     makes it essential that we have a definite arran<lb break="no"/>gement with the United States, this now must be 
     <lb/>
     left for an elected government to handle. If this 
     <lb/>
     country were to federate with Canada, the oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity to negotiate with the United States for trade 
     <lb/>
     concessions would be impossible, and any wish 
     <lb/>
     to join in union with the United States would be 
     <lb/>
     lost forever. Most thinking people agree that at 
     <lb/>
     some time in the future the North American con<lb break="no"/>tinent will be in union. That is, the United States 
     <lb/>
     will assimilate Canada. The time when such 
     <lb/>
     union takes place may be greatly accelerated by 
     <lb/>
     world events. What a position to bargain New<lb break="no"/>foundland would be in, if she was independent 
     <lb/>
     when such union takes place! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In mentioning the United States, another most 
     <lb/>
     important matter in considering confederation 
     <lb/>
     with Canada arises. We have listened for many, 
     <lb/>
     many months to the advantages of joining with 
     <lb/>
     this land of heart's desire — Canada. Would Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood in his reply care to state why so many 
     <lb/>
     Canadians are leaving Canada to reside in the 
     <lb/>
     United States? In the 90 years between 1851 and 
     <lb/>
     1941, 6,700,000 people immigrated to Canada. 
     <lb/>
     With all the hard work put in by the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government, and all the money spent in 90 years 
     <lb/>
     to encourage immigration, the net gain was 
     <lb/>
     400,000 people. In the last boom period from 
     <lb/>
     1920 to 1930, Canada lost some 500,000 of her 
     <lb/>
     citizens to the United States, an average of 50,000 
     <lb/>
     a year. Since the end of the war in Europe in 1945, 
     <lb/>
     it is stated that about 40,000 Canadians per year 
     <lb/>
     have made applications to emigrate to the United 
     <lb/>
     States. How many Canadians go across the bor<lb break="no"/>der without being granted permission is impos<lb break="no"/>sible to estimate. It is stated that two-thirds of all 
     <lb/>
     those emigrating to the United States from 
     <lb/>
     Canada are under 37 years of age. Due to United 
     <lb/>
     States immigration requirements, those granted 
     <lb/>
     permission are usually a picked group, and the 
     <lb/>
     result is Canada is losing her best type of citizens, 
     <lb/>
     the thrifty and better-trained people. The chief 
     <lb/>
     reason for the immigration appears to be the 
     <lb/>
     better wages paid in the United States. The earn<lb break="no"/>ings in manufacturing in the United States 
     <lb/>
     averaged $1.20 per hour to the Canadian 78 cents 
     <lb/>
     per hour. The statement that the increased wages 
     <lb/>
     in the United States is equalised by the higher 
 

            <pb n="1399"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-27-28_Page_1399.jpg"/>

     cost of living does not appear to be correct. It 
     <lb/>
     would appear that for the same standard of living 
     <lb/>
     of a middle-income group, the weekly expendi<lb break="no"/>ture for cost of living is $5 higher in the States 
     <lb/>
     but wages are $20 higher per week there than in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. The reasons given for the difference in 
     <lb/>
     the wage scale is that business firms in Canada 
     <lb/>
     cannot afford to pay the same wages as paid in 
     <lb/>
     the United States. This argument, however, 
     <lb/>
     should not apply to the pulp and paper industry 
     <lb/>
     in which the Canadians believe they lead the 
     <lb/>
     world. In this industry, the average hourly earn<lb break="no"/>ings of pulp and paper workers in Canada is 85 
     <lb/>
     cents and in the United States $1.43. The real 
     <lb/>
     reason however, for this difference in wages is 
     <lb/>
     not in industry, but in the Canadian people them<lb break="no"/>selves, because of what they pay their citizens in 
     <lb/>
     Canadian schools, colleges and the civil service. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Canadian agricultural research should lead the 
     <lb/>
     world, because of the necessity for such research 
     <lb/>
     in farming a land which requires it so much. It 
     <lb/>
     should be, as a writer puts it, "a mecca for agricul<lb break="no"/>tural scientists". Yet at the experimental farm at 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa, of which Mr. Smallwood has talked so 
     <lb/>
     much, a man was employed who started at 35 
     <lb/>
     cents per hour. After eight years, one of which he 
     <lb/>
     took off to get his master's degree, he was getting 
     <lb/>
     $1,800 per year. He had a chance then from the 
     <lb/>
     United States to earn a salary while working for 
     <lb/>
     his Ph.D, He said that, "After the successful 
     <lb/>
     completion of two year's study I was informed 
     <lb/>
     that the highest salary I could expect on return to 
     <lb/>
     Canada was $1,800." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With respect to teachers. One young man has 
     <lb/>
     stated: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     In Canada there are about 12 provincial 
     <lb/>
     normal schools as well as a few universities

     which train teachers. I wrote to each asking 
     <lb/>
     if they had any faculty openings. Only two 
     <lb/>
     offered any hope. One, a normal school,

            <p>And so on down the line; but I am sure the facts 
     <lb/>are known to you. I would, however, recommend 
     <lb/>you to an article by Mr. Blair Fraser, the Ottawa 
     <lb/>editor of <hi rendition="simple:italic">Maclean's Magazine</hi>, dated October 



    
            <cb/>
        

     1947, and entitled "Why Canadians Leave Home". 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And now, permit me to refer to the famous 
     <lb/>
     matter of taxes — particularly property taxes on 
     <lb/>
     which Mr. Smallwood has been harping so much. 
     <lb/>
     He has told you that this is a provincial matter and 
     <lb/>
     therefore in the event of union you will never 
     <lb/>
     have property tax imposed in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     This is absolute nonsense, as Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     well knows. How many provinces of Canada 
     <lb/>
     have property taxes and why are they imposed? 
     <lb/>
     Let Mr. Smallwood answer, if he likes. Would 
     <lb/>
     they be imposed in Newfoundland in the event of 
     <lb/>
     union? Of course they would, by the provincial 
     <lb/>
     parliament. They would have to be if the country 
     <lb/>
     is to continue to keep up the necessary services 
     <lb/>
     and to make the necessary improvements. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As a province, Newfoundland would lose her 
     <lb/>
     main sources of revenue, yet some of our costliest 
     <lb/>
     services would be left to be kept up — our public 
     <lb/>
     health and welfare, our education and our roads. 
     <lb/>
     Who would provide the money for the roads in 
     <lb/>
     the outports? Canada will not. With the amount 
     <lb/>
     left to the provincial parliament they cannot, ex<lb break="no"/>cept with extra taxes. The provincial parliament, 
     <lb/>
     instead of collecting these taxes directly may 
     <lb/>
     avoid it by forming town councils. However, if it 
     <lb/>
     is done, it will necessitate increased taxation. 
     <lb/>
     And what is the logical way this taxation will be 
     <lb/>
     imposed? The logical way and one of the ways it 
     <lb/>
     is done in Canada is by property taxes. All those 
     <lb/>
     taxes which Mr. Smallwood has been crying out 
     <lb/>
     would not be imposed by the federal government 
     <lb/>
     in the event of union will of necessity have to be 
     <lb/>
     imposed in Newfoundland whether it be by the 
     <lb/>
     provincial government or by town councils 
     <lb/>
     which will have to be formed. They will have to 
     <lb/>
     be imposed or the provincial government will not 
     <lb/>
     be able to carry on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now let me revert to our so-called iniquitous 
     <lb/>
     taxation system here at present. Our customs 
     <lb/>
     duties: well, whether it is high or low, it is being 
     <lb/>
     collected solely by Newfoundland and is being 
     <lb/>
     spent in Newfoundland. I would submit that the 
     <lb/>
     monies being collected by our customs duties are 
     <lb/>
     being used in a great measure to provide services 
     <lb/>
     for the not so well-to-do people in our country. 
     <lb/>
     They help pay the cost of public health and wel<lb break="no"/>fare, which is to a large extent helping our less- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     privileged people, in providing hospitalisation 
     <lb/>
     and other public health services, in pensions and 
     <lb/>
     relief, etc. The chief recipients of our public 
  

            <pb n="1400"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-27-28_Page_1400.jpg"/>

     health service are the less fortunate people of the 
     <lb/>
     island. The same applies to education. Even if our 
     <lb/>
     tariff is high, our people are still getting the 
     <lb/>
     benefit of it. It is merely robbing Peter to pay 
     <lb/>
     Paul. Mr. Smallwood may say, "Oh yes, but the 
     <lb/>
     wealthy are still making money out of it." That I 
     <lb/>
     admit, and under any form of government, how<lb break="no"/>ever the taxes are raised, you will always have 
     <lb/>
     some people making more money than other 
     <lb/>
     people. That is the capitalistic system under 
     <lb/>
     which we live and under which Canada lives. If 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood wishes us to become converts to 
     <lb/>
     Karl Marxism and bow down to the doctrines of 
     <lb/>
     Joseph Stalin, he should now make a motiOn that 
     <lb/>
     we federate with Russia. But even in holy mother 
     <lb/>
     Russia, the share-the-wealth policy is by no 
     <lb/>
     means universal. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I should like to refer to a very important state<lb break="no"/>ment made by Mr. Crosbie some few days ago. 
     <lb/>
     He said, Mr. Chairman, that our sales of fish to 
     <lb/>
     Spain and Italy were only possible because of 
     <lb/>
     trade arrangements made through the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom government. In the event of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion these arrangements would not apply, conse<lb break="no"/>quently Newfoundland would be unable to make 
     <lb/>
     a sale to these countries. Last night, in an address 
     <lb/>
     at Burns Night, Mr. Gushue, Chairman of the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland Fisheries Board, said that New<lb break="no"/>foundland produces for export around a million 
     <lb/>
     quintals of salt cod per year. At least half, at times 
     <lb/>
     more than half, is sold to European markets. The 
     <lb/>
     loss of these markets would be a death blow to 
     <lb/>
     the industry. Our trade has been made possible 
     <lb/>
     by the use of sterling convened into dollars. 
     <lb/>
     Before the war, when two of these countries were 
     <lb/>
     short of pounds, our exports were able to be 
     <lb/>
     continued as a result of our being included in 
     <lb/>
     trades and payments agreements made between 
     <lb/>
     these countries and the United Kingdom. As a 
     <lb/>
     result we received payment in dollars. Whilst Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Gushue did not say so last night, I know for a fact 
     <lb/>
     that Canada wanted to sell fish to these countries 
     <lb/>
     at that time and could not. Mr. Gushue admitted 
     <lb/>
     that due to abnormal after-war conditions, we 
     <lb/>
     could not convert the sterling into dollars and the 
     <lb/>
     government had to step in and help out the situa<lb break="no"/>tion. Then he said we must satisfy ourselves 
     <lb/>
     which of the forms of government under discus<lb break="no"/>sion can make sure the continuance of this trade, 
     <lb/>
     without which we would be in a very awkward 
     <lb/>
     position. That, said Mr. Gushue, was one prob<lb break="no"/>
       
            <cb/>

lem that had not been discussed in the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, and the other was the type of currency best 
     <lb/>
     suited to Newfoundland. Newfoundland is tied to 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian dollar and the Canadian exchange 
     <lb/>
     control. For some years we had a surplus of US 
     <lb/>
     dollars which the Canadian exchange control got 
     <lb/>
     the benefit of. Canada has a huge recurring deficit 
     <lb/>
     in its dollar account with the United States. If 
     <lb/>
     sterling cannot be converted what will our posi<lb break="no"/>tion be? We sell to Europe much more than we 
     <lb/>
     buy. Then he said, should we not satisfy oursel<lb break="no"/>ves which currency is best suited to the complex 
     <lb/>
     trading position of Newfoundland? There is no 
     <lb/>
     man or body of men in Newfoundland today who 
     <lb/>
     can answer that question, but the question cannot 
     <lb/>
     be ignored as probably the whole future of the 
     <lb/>
     country depends on the answer. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would suggest to Mr. Smallwood, who is 
     <lb/>
     most anxious to be prime minister of Canada's 
     <lb/>
     tenth province, that there is no reason why he 
     <lb/>
     cannot realize this announced ambition of his. 
     <lb/>
     Canada, as he has told us so often, is the third 
     <lb/>
     largest country in area in the world, yet only has 
     <lb/>
     a population of 12.5 million. Even now she is 
     <lb/>
     bringing in immigrants, displaced persons, from 
     <lb/>
     Europe, and any others that she can encourage to 
     <lb/>
     enter Canada. I would imagine with the contacts 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood has with the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment that he might very well have an area set 
     <lb/>
     aside from which a new province could be 
     <lb/>
     founded. As was suggested before in one of our 
     <lb/>
     local papers, this province might very well be 
     <lb/>
     named Small-Brad-land. He might take with him 
     <lb/>
     all those people who want to be Canadians. He 
     <lb/>
     could be the prime minister and those in this 
     <lb/>
     Convention who adhere to his ideas could very 
     <lb/>
     well be his cabinet. Then with the government of 
     <lb/>
     his heart's desire, as he described it, in his new 
     <lb/>
     province he might very well exercise all the 
     <lb/>
     power he is so anxious to acquire. Why, he might 
     <lb/>
     be even as powerful as the gentleman he 
     <lb/>
     described as that Fascist, that Nazi, that slimy 
     <lb/>
     person, the Premier of Quebec. There then he and 
     <lb/>
     his supporters could really ascertain if a fair and 
     <lb/>
     equitable basis for union is present. He could give 
     <lb/>
     a true account of the taxes that would be neces<lb break="no"/>sary to be paid and the value of all the wonderful 
     <lb/>
     services. After ten years he could come back to 
     <lb/>
     us here in Newfoundland and tell us the real 
     <lb/>
     picture of life in that wonderful country, and then 
     <lb/>
     we will make up our minds on the whole idea. To

     me it seems a very fair suggestion, everybody 
     <lb/>
     will be happy then.

            <p>For the benefit of the member from Bonavista

            <p><persName ref="pers:MACD12">Mr. MacDonald</persName> Mr. Chairman, in spite of the 
     <lb/>quotation just made by Mr. Higgins, I heartily 
     <lb/>support the motion now before the Chair with the 
     <lb/>same sense of duty as a member of this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, as I did when I supported Mr. Higgins' 
     <lb/>motion to recommend two possible forms of 
     <lb/>government to be placed before the people at the 
     <lb/>forthcoming referendum. I contend, sir, that any 
     <lb/>member of this Convention who does not support 
     <lb/>this motion places himself in the unenviable posi<lb break="no"/>tion of trying to restrict the people whom they 
     <lb/>represent in their free choice of forms of govern<lb break="no"/>ment. I suggest to the gentlemen who have politi<lb break="no"/>cal aspirations, and who intend to oppose this 
     <lb/>motion, that they are making a political mistake.

            <p>
     Our Newfoundland people generally — and I 
     <lb/>
     know them fairly well — are a fair-minded race, 
     <lb/>
     and although there are some who will oppose 
     <lb/>
     federal union with Canada, yet they will likely 
     <lb/>
     resent any attempt to restrain their friend or 
     <lb/>
     neighbour from exercising his or her right to 
     <lb/>
     choose the form of government he or she wishes, 
     <lb/>
     even though his neighbour's political leanings 
     <lb/>
     may not be the same as his own. The spirit of fair 
     <lb/>
     play is one of the attributes of our people. I throw 
     <lb/>
     out the hint to members concerned freely, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not know, sir, whether any of the members 
     <lb/>
     of this Convention came here with any mandate 
     <lb/>
     from their district to choose or support any par<lb break="no"/>
           

            <cb/>

ticular form of government. I certainly did not. I 
     <lb/>
     understood, and I think rightly, that I was chosen 
     <lb/>
     to come here to consider and discuss the financial 
     <lb/>
     and economic position of Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     recommend possible forms of government as it 
     <lb/>
     applied to the welfare of Newfoundland in 
     <lb/>
     general; not any district in particular. We are a 
     <lb/>
     National Convention, not a group of men repre<lb break="no"/>senting districts only. And in passing, I consider 
     <lb/>
     it was a good idea of the Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to have residents representative of the 
     <lb/>
     country as a whole, inexperienced and all as they 
     <lb/>
     might be. Otherwise, we might have had a Na<lb break="no"/>tional Convention made up of residents of the 
     <lb/>
     Avalon Peninsula, who might possibly hold the 
     <lb/>
     same opinion, as one of the members of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention from St. John's, who intimated that 
     <lb/>
     as far as he was concerned, the Avalon Peninsula 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">was</hi> Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I have endeavoured during the 
     <lb/>
     life of this Convention, to maintain an attitude of 
     <lb/>
     neutrality as between the different political 
     <lb/>
     ideologies. Indeed, I was named by a certain 
     <lb/>
     radio commentator as "Middle-of-the-road Mac<lb break="no"/>Donald". I take that as a great compliment and 
     <lb/>
     thank the commentator for pointing out that I was 
     <lb/>
     trying to do the job I was sent here to do. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now that our work as a Convention is at long 
     <lb/>
     last coming to an end, and we are asked as in<lb break="no"/>dividuals to make our preference as to the par<lb break="no"/>ticular form of government which, in our opinion, 
     <lb/>
     will be for the best interests of our country and its 
     <lb/>
     people, I find it is time to step off the middle of 
     <lb/>
     the road, and I must admit that it has been pretty 
     <lb/>
     lonely there for a long time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, after due consideration, and 
     <lb/>
     trying not to be influenced by the impassioned 
     <lb/>
     oratory of my friend Major Cashin, or the fiery 
     <lb/>
     eloquence of my friend Mr. Smallwood, but judg<lb break="no"/>ing wholly by the evidence before us, I have come 
     <lb/>
     to the personal conclusion that federal union with 
     <lb/>
     Canada is the most acceptable form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment for Newfoundland out of the three choices 
     <lb/>
     before us, and the one which will be in the best 
     <lb/>
     interests of our country and for the following 
     <lb/>
     reasons: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     1. We will not forfeit the democratic way of life 
     <lb/>
     we talk so much about; no person can reasonably 
     <lb/>
     think that the Canadian way of life is not 
     <lb/>
     democratic. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2. Federal union with Canada will reduce our 


            <pb n="1402"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-27-28_Page_1402.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1402</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
      

     cost of living generally. I think that must be 
     <lb/>
     admitted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     3. Federal union will do the greatest good for the 
     <lb/>
     greatest number; which I am sure is or should be 
     <lb/>
     the object of all the members of this Convention 
     <lb/>
     It will place the burden of taxation where it 
     <lb/>
     belongs, on the shoulders of those who have the 
     <lb/>
     capacity to pay. It will give our people social 
     <lb/>
     security in the way of old age pensions to an 
     <lb/>
     extent which we have been unable to reach either 
     <lb/>
     under our own government or Commission in the 
     <lb/>
     past, and I doubt if we could ever hope to reach 
     <lb/>
     to that extent in the future under the governments 
     <lb/>
     I have mentioned. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Federal union will give us the benefits which 
     <lb/>
     family allowances will bring, not only directly to 
     <lb/>
     the persons concerned, but indirectly in the way 
     <lb/>
     of general business. It is estimated that 120,000 
     <lb/>
     children under the age of 16 would be eligible for 
     <lb/>
     the family allowances. At an average of $72 per 
     <lb/>
     child per year, this would amount to $8,640,000. 
     <lb/>
     It is also estimated that the number of persons 
     <lb/>
     over 70 is 10,000. When we allow that 7,000 of 
     <lb/>
     these are eligible for pensions at $30 per month, 
     <lb/>
     this would amount to another $2.5 million. 
     <lb/>
     Making a grand total of over $11 million per year 
     <lb/>
     put into circulation in this country each year in 
     <lb/>
     these two services alone — and that's no chick<lb break="no"/>en-feed, sir, despite the criticisms levelled 
     <lb/>
     against it. It has been stated that we will have to 
     <lb/>
     pay for these services. Of course we will have to 
     <lb/>
     pay our proportional share as a province, but we 
     <lb/>
     will have the help of about 12 million people in 
     <lb/>
     doing it. The point is, could we ever hope to 
     <lb/>
     accomplish this on our own? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Federal union will also bring us unemploy<lb break="no"/>ment benefits, with which I am sure my friends 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Fudge, Mr. Jackman, Mr. Fogwill and other 
     <lb/>
     labour men will not disagree. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Federal union would provide the same 
     <lb/>
     facilities to us as enjoyed by Canadian citizens in 
     <lb/>
     all nine provinces, viz. that of having free entry 
     <lb/>
     to other provinces for our people, particularly our 
     <lb/>
     young people who may wish a wider field of 
     <lb/>
     endeavour in their chosen professions or trades 
     <lb/>
     and not be treated as foreigners and admitted on 
     <lb/>
     a quota. It will not be the first time in our history 
     <lb/>
     that through depression or other causes, our 
     <lb/>
     people have been forced to seek work elsewhere, 
     <lb/>
     in times when there were not jobs enough even 
     <lb/>
     to go around; from what I can hear there are not 
   

            <cb/>
         

     enough jobs even now to carry our people over, 
     <lb/>
     in spite of an expression made in this Convention 
     <lb/>
     in connection with a certain place that there was 
     <lb/>
     plenty of work, if the people were not too lazy to 
     <lb/>
     look for it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, we have increasing numbers of 
     <lb/>
     young people graduating from Memorial Univer<lb break="no"/>sity. What have we to offer them in New<lb break="no"/>foundland in order that they may carry on their 
     <lb/>
     chosen careers? Federal union will give them an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity on an equality with the young people 
     <lb/>
     of our neighbouring dominion to go forward in 
     <lb/>
     their various professions. If we cannot provide 
     <lb/>
     sufficient employment for our growing popula<lb break="no"/>tion, let us then in the name of goodness try and 
     <lb/>
     clear the way for them to seek it elsewhere. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I rise to a point of privilege. I un<lb break="no"/>derstand Mr. MacDonald made reference to 
     <lb/>
     something I was supposed to have said in connec<lb break="no"/>tion with men being too lazy to work. I have had 
     <lb/>
     another slap at me from Mr. Bradley about the 
     <lb/>
     same supposed statement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> And by me. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> You are not worth mentioning. 
     <lb/>
     Before there is any further reference to that sup<lb break="no"/>posed statement, I insist that the full text be

     produced.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Please, Mr. Smallwood. How 
     <lb/>
     can I deal with a question of privilege if I have 
     <lb/>
     interruptions? I am not going to have them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> The point is this. Is Mr. MacDonald

     Mr. Hollett said it. I said it was made here in this

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Hollett rose to a question of

            <p><persName ref="pers:MACD12">Mr. MacDonald</persName> There are many other points I

     <lb/>in the Convention and it would be only repetition 
     <lb/>to carry them further. In general, Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>I believe that federal union with Canada will be 
     <lb/>a solution of a great number of our difficulties. 
     <lb/>We will be joining a growing nation, and with it 
     <lb/>we will grow. On our own, we will possibly find 
     <lb/>ourselves within a very few years back to where 
     <lb/>we were in the 1920s and 1930s. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, as this is probably the last time 
     <lb/>
     I will have the privilege of addressing this Con<lb break="no"/>vention, I take this opportunity to say that it has 
     <lb/>
     been a pleasure to me to attend this Convention. 
     <lb/>
     I have learned a good deal, and I agree with Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin that friendships have been formed which 
     <lb/>
     will last as long as life itself, and which will 
     <lb/>
     undoubtedly have a good effect on the country at 
     <lb/>
     large in the days that are ahead. Before I resume 
     <lb/>
     my seat, may I personally express my humble, 
     <lb/>
     but none the less sincere appreciation of the man<lb break="no"/>ner in which you, sir, have conducted the 
     <lb/>
     proceedings of this Convention since you were 
     <lb/>
     appointed as our Chairman. It has not been an 
     <lb/>
     easy task, but you have, in my opinion, been 
     <lb/>
     strictly impartial in your many rulings. You have 
     <lb/>
     kept us strictly to the rules of procedure and the 
     <lb/>
     terms of reference as laid down, and you were 
 

            <cb/>
       

     always ready to guide and instruct us in every 
     <lb/>
     way possible; and I feel sure, sir, that you have 
     <lb/>
     earned the respect and admiration of the members 
     <lb/>
     of this National Convention.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> Mr. Chairman, before us today we 
     <lb/>
     have a job which now and again crops up in our 
     <lb/>
     history. Perhaps I may be pardoned if I were to 
     <lb/>
     quote Mark Twain, the great American 
     <lb/>
     humourist, who when writing about King 
     <lb/>
     Arthur's court, said of the knights in search of the 
     <lb/>
     Holy Grail, "Every now and again the boys went 
     <lb/>
     agrailing." Again our boys have gone agrailing. 
     <lb/>
     While I know it is not the holy vessel, yet to my 
     <lb/>
     mind it is something just as elusive — to better 
     <lb/>
     your condition by throwing your troubles upon 
     <lb/>
     the shoulders of a second power or person. In my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, if a person or nation cannot solve their 
     <lb/>
     own problems, how can a second person or power 
     <lb/>
     do that, when they have the same troubles them<lb break="no"/>selves? There are aspects of this search which, if 
     <lb/>
     I may quote a learned jurist, "To me there is an 
     <lb/>
     odour in the state of Denmark." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     During the debate there were statements made 
     <lb/>
     either through ignorance or a wish to deceive the 
     <lb/>
     people, for instance the statement of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood and Mr. Ashbourne that New<lb break="no"/>foundland once in confederation could get out 
     <lb/>
     was a deliberate falsehood. If they knew no more 
     <lb/>
     about it than that, they should have left it 
     <lb/>
     deliberately alone. For we will turn back the 
     <lb/>
     pages of history. The BNA Act "gave all legisla<lb break="no"/>tive power to the federal government except over 
     <lb/>
     matters expressly reserved to the provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Power to levy any kind of taxes, to make any and 
     <lb/>
     every regulation of commerce, of money, and 
     <lb/>
     banking and to disallow any provincial statute it 
     <lb/>
     proposed to disallow." The result of this, nothing 
     <lb/>
     was clear in intent, nothing has proven more 
     <lb/>
     fallacious in its issue. The lean kind were to eat 
     <lb/>
     up the fat. The feeble provinces of 1867, ap<lb break="no"/>parently denuded of revenue, and devoid of all 
     <lb/>
     but the meager and necessary, were to be changed 
     <lb/>
     by altered circumstances and by judicial inter<lb break="no"/>pretation into the autonomous units of 70 years 
     <lb/>
     later, a sort of heptarchy (or a country ruled by 
     <lb/>
     different governments) whose members control 
     <lb/>
     the public domain, and vast revenues from sour<lb break="no"/>ces unknown at confederation. Now, all that was 
     <lb/>
     to come later. The provinces felt themselves 
     <lb/>
     overshadowed by the Dominion, and no longer in 
    

            <pb n="1404"

     control of home and patrimony. But once in, there 
     <lb/>
     was no way out. Nova Scotia appealed in vain to 
     <lb/>
     Westminster for repeal. How in the light of this 
     <lb/>
     two members of the Ottawa delegation can get up 
     <lb/>
     and say we can get out, leaves me deaf and dumb. 
     <lb/>
     If such was the case, why wasn't it embodied in 
     <lb/>
     the terms? Then we would know there was some 
     <lb/>
     weight in it. But say, if in ten years time we 
     <lb/>
     wanted to withdraw from confederation, what an 
     <lb/>
     argument to present to the federal government 
     <lb/>
     and the Privy Council — the people voted for 
     <lb/>
     confederation with the understanding that they 
     <lb/>
     could withdraw if it did not suit them. They had 
     <lb/>
     it on the authority of Messrs. Smallwood and 
     <lb/>
     Ashbourne. British Columbia for 20 years 
     <lb/>
     demanded secession, but is still in. Now in the 
     <lb/>
     light of this, members of the National Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, please, in Heaven's name, tell the people the 
     <lb/>
     truth. I see no difference in a political lie than any 
     <lb/>
     other kind of a lie; and this, in the light of the 
     <lb/>
     knowledge I have, is a political lie. We have 
     <lb/>
     heard a lot about finances, internal borrowing 
     <lb/>
     that don't cost anything! I have found in a 
     <lb/>
     lifetime that I had to pay. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I will try to give a summary of the impact of 
     <lb/>
     the depression on Canada and her industries in 
     <lb/>
     the 1930 crisis. For the truth is, the whole 
     <lb/>
     economic life of Canada was dislocated by the 
     <lb/>
     industrial collapse. She was not alone. Following 
     <lb/>
     1930, Canadian currency in 1933 was inconver<lb break="no"/>tible, like other currency. Then we had the perni<lb break="no"/>cious system of trade and exchange quotas that 
     <lb/>
     was strangling everything when the war brought 
     <lb/>
     it to a quick end. Canada felt this to the full. First, 
     <lb/>
     because it still depends largely on exports from 
     <lb/>
     primary industries, like Newfoundland. The 
     <lb/>
     second reason she felt it was because, like New<lb break="no"/>foundland, she is exporting cash profits out of the 
     <lb/>
     country because of the large amounts of foreign 
     <lb/>
     investments in the country. It was estimated in 
     <lb/>
     1937 there was some $2,684,000,000 of British 
     <lb/>
     capital invested in Canada. This was held in fixed 
     <lb/>
     obligations and in railway shares; besides this, 
     <lb/>
     there was $3,932,000,000 of American capital, 
     <lb/>
     held in common stocks, municipal bonds and 
     <lb/>
     investments in subsidiary companies. All in all, 
     <lb/>
     it represented a volume of interest payments, 
     <lb/>
     much of it contracted in the terms of foreign 
     <lb/>
     currency. This gave a total of $6,616,000,000 of 
     <lb/>
     foreign investment, which caused both govern<lb break="no"/>ment and people some anxiety. I want to bring 


            <cb/>
       

     this to the fore when people say Canada will 
     <lb/>
     invest money here. There is need for money in 
     <lb/>
     her own economy. Perhaps that is the reason, as 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Reddy pointed out, that there is so little 
     <lb/>
     Canadian money invested here. They simply 
     <lb/>
     have not got it and they have furthered their own 
     <lb/>
     economy by handling our finances and insuran<lb break="no"/>ces, always a cash transaction and a very lucra<lb break="no"/>tive profession. In fact we have been a cow to get 
     <lb/>
     milked, and we have been milked very thorough<lb break="no"/>ly, and if this goes through we will be beefed as 
     <lb/>
     well. In coming back to this, I won't go into the 
     <lb/>
     case of the individual John Doe Canadian citizen 
     <lb/>
     in this upheaval, but the farmers held out as best 
     <lb/>
     they could while new aid and relief, total or 
     <lb/>
     partial, extended to 870,000 persons in 1938. It 
     <lb/>
     took a war to wipe the slate clean, and I guess 
     <lb/>
     after the war a new slate will be wanted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I'll come to the matter of the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     national debt. I shall not stress it. I think Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin has done justice to that, but something has 
     <lb/>
     been left out. I agree with Mr. Smallwood that 
     <lb/>
     this is something that our people are afraid of. 
     <lb/>
     They have had some painful memories of nation<lb break="no"/>al debt and paying the interest on it. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood has gone merrily along, telling us that 
     <lb/>
     it does not matter how large the national debt of 
     <lb/>
     Canada is, as it is held by Canadians. Strange to 
     <lb/>
     say, I agree with Mr. Smallwood to a point, that 
     <lb/>
     interest will circulate again in Canada when it is 
     <lb/>
     paid in Canada, but now I'm perplexed — how? 
     <lb/>
     Because if we go into confederation as new 
     <lb/>
     Canadians, with no bonds or very little bonds 
     <lb/>
     held here in Newfoundland, although we will 
     <lb/>
     shoulder our share of this debt, said to run from 
     <lb/>
     $900 per capita by the confederates to $1,500 per 
     <lb/>
     capita by the anticonfederates, how are we going 
     <lb/>
     to share in the cut of the interest take? Are we, 
     <lb/>
     after confederation, going to cut this island up in 
     <lb/>
     squares and fit the pieces into the nine provinces 
     <lb/>
     that hold the bonds? It seems to me Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood's arguments are hogwash, for if we 
     <lb/>
     are a province, the money we send to pay the 
     <lb/>
     interest on the bonds in Canada will be just as far 
     <lb/>
     out of the island of Newfoundland and the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador as regards doing us any good, as the 
     <lb/>
     interest we send to England. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> went to long lengths to 
     <lb/>
     describe the huge surplus that Canada had last 
     <lb/>
     year, and the sound healthy position she was in, 
     <lb/>
     he poohpoohed the idea that she would have any 


            <pb n="1405"

     trouble. The dollar bills just showered down in 
     <lb/>
     this rock-candy mountain. But I have a recollec<lb break="no"/>tion that Britain had a balanced budget and a large 
     <lb/>
     surplus. I don't think Mr. Smallwood or anyone 
     <lb/>
     else would admit that she was in a strong, healthy 
     <lb/>
     financial position. The reason was, she did not 
     <lb/>
     have exports to buy her imports. You can always 
     <lb/>
     balance a budget with a printing press. You can 
     <lb/>
     also export with the same, but the time comes 
     <lb/>
     when even that won't give you the market. 
     <lb/>
     Britain was in straits although she had a balanced 
     <lb/>
     budget, because she did not have exports to pay 
     <lb/>
     for the imports. Canada is in a jam because the 
     <lb/>
     countries she can export to ... have not the exports 
     <lb/>
     or gold to pay for Canada's exports; a vicious 
     <lb/>
     circle, Mr. Smallwood, but then just the same I'll 
     <lb/>
     forgive you. It's a world's saying that journalists 
     <lb/>
     and lawyers are the world's worst economists. 
     <lb/>
     But you must tell people that you know how you 
     <lb/>
     must keep it up. "Would that God that gift would 
     <lb/>
     to give us To see ourselves as others see us." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am trying to show this Convention the holes 
     <lb/>
     that are in this proposition, and I think you can 
     <lb/>
     row through them. I have a decision to make, and 
     <lb/>
     I must show the reason why I am making that 
     <lb/>
     decision. In referring to my speech on the 
     <lb/>
     municipal taxes, Mr. Smallwood said I was 
     <lb/>
     shrewd, as I knew what hurt people. Taxes, yes. 
     <lb/>
     Nothing hurts like taxes, especially when you 
     <lb/>
     have nothing to pay them with. And there is a law 
     <lb/>
     saying they must be paid, or else. Now again, I 
     <lb/>
     must agree with Mr. Smallwood's explanation 
     <lb/>
     that the federal government does not tax property. 
     <lb/>
     I think that's clear to everybody, for the Black 
     <lb/>
     Books stated that is left for the municipal govern<lb break="no"/>ment, not town councils — there are no town 
     <lb/>
     councils mentioned in the Black Books, they are 
     <lb/>
     called municipal governments. I also agree with 
     <lb/>
     him that the provincial government does not tax 
     <lb/>
     property unless there is no municipal govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Take the case of PEI, the provincial 
     <lb/>
     government there and the school districts do tax 
     <lb/>
     property as throughout the other eight provinces. 
     <lb/>
     The municipal governments do tax property and 
     <lb/>
     they collect as much in this tax as one-third to a 
     <lb/>
     half the revenues of the provincial government, 
     <lb/>
     and when it was put before the Ottawa delegation 
     <lb/>
     that we could not run the province on what we 
     <lb/>
     would get from the federal government, the 
     <lb/>
     answer was, "Use up your surplus or put on more 
     <lb/>
     taxes." And we will find out when that royal 
 

            <cb/>
         

     commission comes here that they will show the 
     <lb/>
     provincial government how to go about it, and 
     <lb/>
     then fur will fly. I am, shall I say, brutally frank. 
     <lb/>
     I tell them they will be taxed and I'm going to 
     <lb/>
     have a lot of fun out of it, because if we go into 
     <lb/>
     confederation, for a few years in this country it 
     <lb/>
     will be as good as seeing the "Pirates of Pen<lb break="no"/>zance". I know I won't be in any government, 
     <lb/>
     municipal or provincial, that will have to put 
     <lb/>
     them on. I am going to try to show the people the 
     <lb/>
     taxes the provinces are using to give them the 
     <lb/>
     conveniences they are having. I am going to let 
     <lb/>
     them read them themselves, and if it does not 
     <lb/>
     change them, and if they get them, it is their own 
     <lb/>
     hard luck. If I were an ardent confederate I would 
     <lb/>
     do that, forI know our people and I want to live 
     <lb/>
     with them, and I know that if you fool them, they 
     <lb/>
     have long memories. I believe this time that 
     <lb/>
     Shakespeare's quotation will be very apt only it 
     <lb/>
     will include men as well as women. I don't want 
     <lb/>
     to be one to fool the people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In this I am going to quote some of the assess<lb break="no"/>ments of our neighbouring province of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia. Perhaps we are going to do on $15 million 
     <lb/>
     what they do on $30 million, our people have 
     <lb/>
     been told they will have the same living condi<lb break="no"/>tions in Newfoundland as they have in Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia. That is the battle cry of those who favour 
     <lb/>
     this form of government. It is strange to me that 
     <lb/>
     in the years I have lived and worked amongst 
     <lb/>
     those people I did not find it so. The sea was 
     <lb/>
     always a struggle, the Gaspé coast bleak with its 
     <lb/>
     small fishing villages, no harbours, their homes 
     <lb/>
     like any fishing village, say Pouch Cove or Por<lb break="no"/>tugal Cove. The homes, some better than others, 
     <lb/>
     some worse. You won't find the chesterfields 
     <lb/>
     there, but you'll find the settle of our father's day, 
     <lb/>
     hand carved by some old habitant. The land is 
     <lb/>
     better than ours on the whole, with the exception 
     <lb/>
     of Howley and Codroy Valley, but to the fisher<lb break="no"/>man-farmer, their life is the same hard grind and 
     <lb/>
     the same as here, from the boat to the garden and 
     <lb/>
     when the fishery fails, the woods. There is no 
     <lb/>
     luxury. The province has a back log. They have 
     <lb/>
     their factories and the large port of Montreal to 
     <lb/>
     take up the slack, but we have no factories here 
     <lb/>
     to give our people ease from these taxes, neither 
     <lb/>
     have we the great port of Montreal, or any other, 
     <lb/>
     to ease our fishermen's burdens. Montreal col<lb break="no"/>lects from all the provinces that ship through her 
     <lb/>

     that do not go through Churchill or Vancouver. 
     <lb/>
     The ships that pay the light dues, even pay the 
     <lb/>
     dues to keep nine lights that are kept in New<lb break="no"/>foundland waters. It is all right to compare this 
     <lb/>
     with that, but consider the comparison — go in 
     <lb/>
     Chaleur Bay, Miramichi Bay, talk to the fisher<lb break="no"/>men, farmers, loggers there, you'll find the same, 
     <lb/>
     just like our own folk doing the same. As a 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlander told me at Shediac in 1934, "It's 
     <lb/>
     tough", only he emphasised it. Come to Pugwash, 
     <lb/>
     lumber, bricks, you see its counterpart in Smith's 
     <lb/>
     Sound, PEI, where the annual earnings are even 
     <lb/>
     lower than ours, who are looking to New<lb break="no"/>foundland for their market for produce, where the 
     <lb/>
     farmer is getting about $1.50 per cwt. for 
     <lb/>
     potatoes. Time forbids me quoting other prices. 
     <lb/>
     Go to Cape Breton and it is the same, hundreds 
     <lb/>
     of farmers gone back to the country their fathers 
     <lb/>
     got good livings from. The younger generation 
     <lb/>
     has left for the industrial centres, although when 
     <lb/>
     God made Cape Breton he smiled on it, he gave 
     <lb/>
     it coal, lumber, good farming land and fishing 
     <lb/>
     and with Newfoundland ore, it could be a 
     <lb/>
     paradise. The raw material is brought to a certain 
     <lb/>
     point, then it is taken away to be finished in 
     <lb/>
     Ontario or Quebec and as the profits are exported 
     <lb/>
     also, what is left is not enough to give the people 
     <lb/>
     a good living, and certain parts are slums or a 
     <lb/>
     little better. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We go to the Magdalen Islands, they have 
     <lb/>
     been forgotten the past few years. They have had 
     <lb/>
     a representative who has taken a keen interest in 
     <lb/>
     them and who has alleviated their condition 
     <lb/>
     somewhat, but before that, like our Labrador, 
     <lb/>
     they only lived to produce taxes to be spent 
     <lb/>
     somewhere else. Come to south Nova Scotia. The 
     <lb/>
     fine fishermen of years ago, unable to bring ends 
     <lb/>
     together, have moved away to form the bulk, with 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders, of the Boston and New Bed<lb break="no"/>ford fleet, which today is using a large number of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders to man their vessels. Always 
     <lb/>
     the cry was that taxation was killing them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I could go on, as their coasts are to me like my 
     <lb/>
     own coasts, and I know that if nature would allow 
     <lb/>
     us to fish from our homes nearly all the year 
     <lb/>
     around ... our people would have a living as good 
     <lb/>
     or better than anybody in the world. Our 
     <lb/>
     fishermen's season is roughly from three to six 
     <lb/>
     months. You'll see there are no bankers outfitting 
     <lb/>
     yet in Newfoundland, but the Lunenburg fisher<lb break="no"/>men are gone nearly a month ago. A draft of 
  

            <cb/>
        

     saltfish is today $14 in Nova Scotia and the same 
     <lb/>
     at Harbour Grace. I could go on like Tennyson's 
     <lb/>
     brook, forever, and tell lots of things about why 
     <lb/>
     fishermen here can't make the wages they make 
     <lb/>
     to the west... To pay taxes, you must earn. I did 
     <lb/>
     not come to this Convention to study confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. I discovered Canada early in life, and from 
     <lb/>
     the Gaspé coast to the River St. Croix I have a 
     <lb/>
     very intimate knowledge of the men who with 
     <lb/>
     their hands produce the wealth wrested from 
     <lb/>
     land, woods, mines and sea. I have yet to meet 
     <lb/>
     one that did not curse confederation, I mean from 
     <lb/>
     the rural districts, and my mind goes back to 
     <lb/>
     1912, and we were anchored in the Magellan 
     <lb/>
     Strait, awaiting daylight. The second mate and 
     <lb/>
     myself were on the bridge, and there the talk 
     <lb/>
     turned to confederation. He had been master of 
     <lb/>
     one of Nova Scotia's last iron windjammers. He 
     <lb/>
     said, "Charlie, if our fathers had any savvy and 
     <lb/>
     formed a confederation of New Brunswick, Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, PEI and Newfoundland, the world would 
     <lb/>
     be a worthwhile place for us today." He told me 
     <lb/>
     that at the time of confederation we had a large 
     <lb/>
     fleet of ships, and if we had joined hands then, 
     <lb/>
     nobody could have touched us. All four provin<lb break="no"/>ces owned their own homes and lands, we could 
     <lb/>
     have sailed ships cheaper than any of the rest of 
     <lb/>
     the world. We could have been a maritime nation 
     <lb/>
     as we had the men, and that's a country's best 
     <lb/>
     asset. "But", he said, "we were forced into con<lb break="no"/>federation, you stayed out. Britain did not want 
     <lb/>
     any rivals in the maritime field and here are you 
     <lb/>
     and I working under what is to us a foreign flag." 
     <lb/>
     The ship was registered in Britain, owned in the 
     <lb/>
     United States. I could see it then, as he pointed it 
     <lb/>
     out to me, I believe that would be confederation 
     <lb/>
     worthwhile... Nova Scotia cannot get a break 
     <lb/>
     now as all the money is in Ontario and God did 
     <lb/>
     not intend them to be sailors. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have given this deep thought and I am firmly 
     <lb/>
     convinced even if the people vote against it, we 
     <lb/>
     will go into confederation unless we watch our 
     <lb/>
     balance. For it is a $64 question how Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     got in at that time. The Nova Scotia elections 
     <lb/>
     went terrible against the confederation, 54 out of 
     <lb/>
     57 seats being against it. The House of Commons 
     <lb/>
     was advised by a very able member, Mr. John 
     <lb/>
     Bright, not to include Nova Scotia, but to allow 
     <lb/>
     the general election to take place to ascertain the 
     <lb/>
     opinion of the colony; but the government and 
     <lb/>
     the House was deaf to this counsel.... They went

     in with a parliament against it, and today we have 
     <lb/>
     no parliament. I think this time we have the 
     <lb/>
     chance of the celluloid cat in Dante's inferno 
     <lb/>
     chased by an asbestos dog. The only reason this 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Codvention</hi> was called was to get that $30,000 
     <lb/>
     messenger service to Ottawa, for something that 
     <lb/>
     was there four years before they went, according 
     <lb/>
     to the wise man from the East End in reporting 
     <lb/>
     on the Black Books, the amount of work done by 
     <lb/>
     the delegation there, those secret documents I 
     <lb/>
     have before me — the scratch log, I call it. Never 
     <lb/>
     in the history of human endeavour did so much 
     <lb/>
     come out of so little. What manner of men do they 
     <lb/>
     think we are? They forget Honest Abe said, "You 
     <lb/>
     can't fool all the people, all the time." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There has been a lot of talk about flour and the 
     <lb/>
     price. Everybody seems to forget that in 
     <lb/>
     peacetimes we get flour cheaper than any other 
     <lb/>
     part of the world. I know in 1929, I put six barrels 
     <lb/>
     of flour in my house for $4.86 a barrel. I wish I 
     <lb/>
     could put it there today. About a month later at 
     <lb/>
     Halifax, I was in my sister's home when she paid 
     <lb/>
     $5.60 for the same brand of flour, and a month 
     <lb/>
     afterwards, making up the vessel's accounts at 
     <lb/>
     Gloucester, flour was charged at $6.50 per barrel. 
     <lb/>
     1939 flour cost landed $3.40 per barrel, was sold 
     <lb/>
     to grocers in St. John's for $3.80 per barrel, while 
     <lb/>
     flour was retailing for $5.20 per barrel in Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia. But see how they treat us now?... Now the 
     <lb/>
     price of flour is $9.20 per 100 lb. sack. The trade 
     <lb/>
     here wanted to take only enough to fill the north<lb break="no"/>ern orders, but Canada forced them to take the 
     <lb/>
     full allocation, thus depriving Newfoundland of 
     <lb/>
     the advantage of the lower wheat price and forc<lb break="no"/>ing our people to pay 46 cents more per barrel for 
     <lb/>
     flour for Newfoundlanders, we being their best 
     <lb/>
     customer. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, I cannot support this fraud that 
     <lb/>
     is being put over on the people of this country, to 
     <lb/>
     me it is plain power politics. That's the suspicion 
     <lb/>
     I had at the beginning. and the way things have 
     <lb/>
     gone in this house only makes me more certain 
     <lb/>
     that I have taken part in the greatest piece of 
     <lb/>
     codology that was ever foisted on an innocent and 
     <lb/>
     long-suffering people, and I cannot support it. I 
     <lb/>
     must apologise to the people whose money I have 
     <lb/>
     squandered, it's been an education to me. I hope 
     <lb/>
     it has done some good to the country. I have one 
     <lb/>
     thing more to speak about, Mr. Chairman, it is a 
     <lb/>
     speech made a few days ago about politics being 
     <lb/>
     brought into the Convention. By whom? By me? 
   

            <cb/>
       

     I had never heard the word confederation men<lb break="no"/>tioned, and I had hardly time to get a haircut 
     <lb/>
     before I was buttonholed about that form of 
     <lb/>
     government by that same gentleman that made 
     <lb/>
     that speech. Now I hate to lie down under the 
     <lb/>
     accusation that I injected anything into this, that 
     <lb/>
     was contrary to the job we had to do, but try to 
     <lb/>
     ram something down my throat! But a week after 
     <lb/>
     I came in, I found out from Canada and Company 
     <lb/>
     that I was digging my political grave... I said 
     <lb/>
     before that I would not touch it with an insulated 
     <lb/>
     fish fork, and I cannot vote for it in any shape or 
     <lb/>
     form. For if we do not accept it, I know the British 
     <lb/>
     government will put it on. If it goes through I 
     <lb/>
     hope and pray it will be a good thing for the 
     <lb/>
     country. I won't worry if I'm called a fool — only 
     <lb/>
     too glad to be called so. For I want the best for 
     <lb/>
     our people and I do not think this is the best. In 
     <lb/>
     fact, while the world is in the flux and chaos it is 
     <lb/>
     in today, I would put nothing on the country 
     <lb/>
     which the people could not change. I think there 
     <lb/>
     are better days ahead, and if we can reach that 
     <lb/>
     point all will be well. As I see it now, if the British 
     <lb/>
     government puts it through against the advice of 
     <lb/>
     the majority of the Convention, then if it doesn't 
     <lb/>
     work and I do not think it will, then our people 
     <lb/>
     will be in a fighting frame of mind and through 
     <lb/>
     agitation with good leaders they will get a better 
     <lb/>
     subsidy or a bribe to keep their mouths shut. I'm 
     <lb/>
     sure Canada is going to get a bear by the tail if 
     <lb/>
     she gets Newfoundland, and I know it, and I am 
     <lb/>
     not going to support it. I am not going to tie any 
     <lb/>
     leader's hands of the future. I'll be alongside his 
     <lb/>
     elbow if you can come back. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     One thing, I listened to Mr. Smallwood's 
     <lb/>
     graphic description of profits. I was glad to hear 
     <lb/>
     that, for I have taken an oath that if it ever comes 
     <lb/>
     again, if it's a crust for one, it's a crust for all. 
     <lb/>
     Well, Mr. Smallwood's idea of the commission 
     <lb/>
     merchant was graphic. I call him a muleskinner. 
     <lb/>
     Now that animal does not work alone in the 
     <lb/>
     woods on Water Street; he is on all the streets and 
     <lb/>
     he is going to turn the world upside down if he 
     <lb/>
     keeps on. Now in that Paradise Harbour that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood is piloting this ship of state to, the 
     <lb/>
     woods are full of them. He forgot to mention that, 
     <lb/>
     and our Uncle Sam has so many of them, he has 
     <lb/>
     got them in his beard. I think he invented them or 
     <lb/>
     he brought them up to scratch. Those down here 
     <lb/>
     are only pikers, but they are learning fast. I 
     <lb/>
     remember 1939, we loaded here in St. John's, we

     had oil on deck. After I had landed it I left the 
     <lb/>
     vessel, and one day went into an oil manufacturer 
     <lb/>
     to see a friend of mine. I saw the oil we landed. 
     <lb/>
     Happened to speak about it to the manager, he lit 
     <lb/>
     in to me, and asked if we were gone crazy down 
     <lb/>
     here in Newfoundland. I asked, "Why?" "I paid 
     <lb/>
     $360 per ton for that oil." "Well," I said, "I can't 
     <lb/>
     enlighten you much, but I know the fishermen got 
     <lb/>
     $89 per ton, but some day I'll find out." Fifteen 
     <lb/>
     months later I came home and I found out the 
     <lb/>
     price was $123 ex-wharf. And who got the dif<lb break="no"/>ference? I tried two firms, it was the same price. 
     <lb/>
     I went back to Boston, saw my friend and found 
     <lb/>
     out his agent got $237 less expenses. Not a bad 
     <lb/>
     profit to make with a pencil, and that's how it 
     <lb/>
     goes, gentlemen. In Canada the woods are full of 
     <lb/>
     them. We will have to do more than confederate 
     <lb/>
     to get clear of the mule skinner. The only answer 
     <lb/>
     to it is the co-op. Get a good large wholesale 
     <lb/>
     import and export co—operative society. Your 
     <lb/>
     small retails might change your charter, so 
     <lb/>
     money can be ploughed back in the business. Get 
     <lb/>
     the people together, then we can lick the mules<lb break="no"/>kinner. You can lick them all, but you have to 
     <lb/>
     organise... There is the answer to it. I agree with 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood's finding the disease, but he is a 
     <lb/>
     long way out on the cure..., 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The time has come to wind her up and I' m glad 
     <lb/>
     to join the old sea—shanty, to "Leave her, Johnny, 
     <lb/>
     leave her" — and to wish our country bon 
     <lb/>
     voyage. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KENN3">Mr. Kennedy</persName> Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, I 
     <lb/>
     rise at this time to speak on the motion now before 
     <lb/>
     the Chair, fervently believing it to be an evasion 
     <lb/>
     of the rights due to our people under the 1933- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     1934 act. We have not at this time, nor have we 
     <lb/>
     had in Newfoundland since 1933 a government 
     <lb/>
     representative of the people. Any decisions 
     <lb/>
     reached by the Commission of Government 
     <lb/>
     entertained no more consideration nor respect for 
     <lb/>
     the beliefs of our people than did the leasing of 
     <lb/>
     our territory to foreign interests bear any refer<lb break="no"/>ence to individual Newfoundlanders, many of 
     <lb/>
     whom at that time were paying for the defending 
     <lb/>
     of this island with their blood. As I stated before, 
     <lb/>
     my generation has had the right to fight for New<lb break="no"/>foundland, but never the privilege of speaking for 
     <lb/>
     her, much less voting. In some of the speeches 
     <lb/>
     given in support of this motion reference has been 
     <lb/>
     made not only to post-Convention propaganda, 
     <lb/>
     but also to the sentiments prevalent in various 
 

            <cb/>
        

     districts. May I here and now register my heartfelt 
     <lb/>
     disgust in the use of this chamber and the radio 
     <lb/>
     as a medium for this post-Convention propagan<lb break="no"/>da. It has been said by acertain speaker in support 
     <lb/>
     of the motion, that this Convention has not been 
     <lb/>
     able to give the full truth concerning confedera<lb break="no"/>tion to the people. If this be so, then the pilot of 
     <lb/>
     this report should be ashamed, and consider him<lb break="no"/>self incapable, that during the past weeks of 
     <lb/>
     debate, he has been unable to ice the cake of 
     <lb/>
     confederation sufficiently attractively to hide the 
     <lb/>
     sour dough that lies beneath it. Nothing that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood or any other pro-confederate may 
     <lb/>
     concoct or serve to the people can alter the fact 
     <lb/>
     that the terms as sent to us from Canada are final. 
     <lb/>
     No amount of surmising or imagination can give 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood or anyone else the power to 
     <lb/>
     improve the offer from the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment, of a sprat to catch the Newfoundland mack<lb break="no"/>erel. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As far as I am concerned I am interested in no 
     <lb/>
     figures or estimates of our country supplied by 
     <lb/>
     Canadians, or outsiders who have never set foot 
     <lb/>
     in this country to see how the ordinary New<lb break="no"/>foundlander lives or wishes to live. I will accept 
     <lb/>
     only the concrete figures given to me by New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders for the use of Newfoundlanders. 
     <lb/>
     Today in Newfoundland, her native sons have no 
     <lb/>
     freedom to employ these figures, and until such 
     <lb/>
     time as we have any negotiation with any 
     <lb/>
     country, it is bound to be one—sided and that side 
     <lb/>
     is not likely to be ours. I have no intention of 
     <lb/>
     asserting that the majority or minority of mem<lb break="no"/>bers in this Convention represent the greater or 
     <lb/>
     lesser proportion of the people. This has just been 
     <lb/>
     another example of naive conjecture on the part 
     <lb/>
     of certain members, but I wish to put on record 
     <lb/>
     that hundreds of men from the district that I 
     <lb/>
     represent have worked and fished with men from 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion of Canada, and as a majority or 
     <lb/>
     minority, they are more adverse to union with 
     <lb/>
     Canada than they ever were. I maintain that no 
     <lb/>
     member in this house has the right to speak for 
     <lb/>
     every individual Newfoundlander who will cast 
     <lb/>
     his vote, regardless of the beliefs of Mr. Starkes 
     <lb/>
     or myself. We have been given no proof that new 
     <lb/>
     taxes will not be enforced on us and I, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, cannot conceive that the three types of 
     <lb/>
     government that union will bring us will be run 
     <lb/>
     at a lower cost than the one that responsible 
     <lb/>
     entails, if it ever comes into force.

<p>
     I was not sent here to preach against any class 
     <lb/>
     of society — I leave this to a few of my decidedly 
     <lb/>
     pink fellow members —. nor to blame any par<lb break="no"/>ticular set for the mistakes that have been made 
     <lb/>
     by our predecessors. If there have been gains by 
     <lb/>
     individuals during the past 100 years there have 
     <lb/>
     also been losses, as may be verified by the change 
     <lb/>
     of large concerns over this period. As far as 
     <lb/>
     squandering is concerned, roughly $30 million 
     <lb/>
     has gone from Newfoundland to Canada during 
     <lb/>
     the last year with negligible relative trade returns. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
    Mr. Chairman, it is all too plain to see that we 
     <lb/>
     are not now living in 1865. This year of 1948 
     <lb/>
     finds the following circumstances that were not 
     <lb/>
     evident at that time. The largest revenue that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland has ever possessed against the 
     <lb/>
     meager pittances of those days. Highways and 
     <lb/>
     transport have progressed. Labrador has been 
     <lb/>
     legalised as Newfoundland territory. We have 
     <lb/>
     been termed the crossroads of the world so far as 
     <lb/>
     air traffic is concerned. We have leased bases 
     <lb/>
     without credit of any kind, for 99 years, which 
     <lb/>
     employ our labour at lower rates of pay than 
     <lb/>
     outsiders. Fish marketing has been revolu<lb break="no"/>tionised and a market exists at our back door. 
     <lb/>
     Hospitals and general public health organisations 
     <lb/>
     have become increasingly evident. Bell Island 
     <lb/>
     and Buchans, not to mention other mining 
     <lb/>
     prospects have been inaugurated. Paper and pulp 
     <lb/>
     manufacture has become a fact. Lastly in this 
     <lb/>
     very vague comparison is the fact that we have 
     <lb/>
     been informed on the highest authority that we 
     <lb/>
     are a self-supporting country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, we are not in the late nineties. 
     <lb/>
     Then we had admittedly little to offer toward an 
     <lb/>
     equitable basis for union. Now we are in a posi<lb break="no"/>tion that is coveted by many. We should need no 
     <lb/>
     outside housekeeper to run a family concern 
     <lb/>
     whose income is sufficient to feed each and every 
     <lb/>
     one of us. Mr. Chairman, it is my firm conviction 
     <lb/>
     that two and only two types of government 
     <lb/>
     should be inserted on the ballot paper in the 
     <lb/>
     forthcoming referendum. Should any negotia<lb break="no"/>tions later take place between Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     any other country, let Newfoundland enter into 
     <lb/>
     those negotiations as free to barter as are her 
     <lb/>
     neighbours, for the best results, and may God 
     <lb/>
     guide our ship of state into kind waters, not in tow 
     <lb/>
     or with tugs, but under her own proud power. 
            </p>

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> Mr. Chairman, "The time has come 
 

            <cb/>
         

     the Walrus said to talk of many things, Of ships 
     <lb/>
     and shoes and sealing wax, Like wise Mackenzie 
     <lb/>
     King." Once before in this chamber the walls 
     <lb/>
     rang with the word "union", and if we had acute 
     <lb/>
     hearing today, we might still hear that word 
     <lb/>
     "union" echoing from these walls. All you heard 
     <lb/>
     25 years ago was the "union", the "union". At that 
     <lb/>
     time, it was the Fishermen's Union, which 
     <lb/>
     developed into one of the biggest and strongest 
     <lb/>
     political parties we ever had in this country. That 
     <lb/>
     Union party was founded in 1908. Its founder 
     <lb/>
     used the slogan, "Down with the merchants; and 
     <lb/>
     up with the underdogs." Needless to say, it was a 
     <lb/>
     very popular slogan. The union grew by leaps and 
     <lb/>
     bounds. Tall tales were told of what it would do 
     <lb/>
     for the fishermen and to its support, I am told, 
     <lb/>
     nearly half a million dollars was subscribed by 
     <lb/>
     the fishermen. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The present chief advocate for union with 
     <lb/>
     Canada, the member for Bonavista Centre and 
     <lb/>
     the proposer of this motion was, I am told, one of 
     <lb/>
     the most rabid promoters of that union, and by his 
     <lb/>
     tongue and his pen, did then, as he is doing now, 
     <lb/>
     much to spread that gospel over this country. And 
     <lb/>
     just as Mr. Smallwood is an enthusiastic and 
     <lb/>
     fanatic delegate to this Convention, so he was just 
     <lb/>
     as enthusiastic and fanatic a delegate to the old 
     <lb/>
     FPU convention. So enthusiastic a supporter was 
     <lb/>
     our Mr. Smallwood to that fishermen's union, 
     <lb/>
     that he wrote a book on the life of the founder of 
     <lb/>
     that union.<ref target="#fn_04">[1]</ref> And if you have read it, you will find 
     <lb/>
     that he says, in effect, that the founder of that 
     <lb/>
     union was only a little less than God. Talk about 
     <lb/>
     idolatry! You haven't seen anything if you 
     <lb/>
     haven't read that book. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Well Mr. Chairman, as they say, time marches 
     <lb/>
     on. And what happened to <hi rendition="simple:italic">that</hi> union that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood talked and wrote and raved about, 
     <lb/>
     and wrung his hands over a few short years ago? 
     <lb/>
     Well, to make a long story short, the fishermen 
     <lb/>
     who put their life savings into <hi rendition="simple:italic">that</hi> union got little 
     <lb/>
     or none of it back, and many died paupers as a 
     <lb/>
     result; all the older people know the story. And 
     <lb/>
     the founder of that union, who started out a poor 
     <lb/>
     man wearing a pair of three-quarter boots and 
     <lb/>
     blue guemsey, and preaching "down with the 
     <lb/>
     merchants", accumulated himself an estate, I am 
     <lb/>
     told, worth little less than half a million dollars 
     <lb/>
     and resided on his estate in Jamaica, which I am 
     <lb/>
     told by a man who visited there was worth not

     less than $50,000. And now we have the Man 
     <lb/>
     Friday of that fishermen's union promoting 
     <lb/>
     another union. The only difference is that the 
     <lb/>
     desired placed of residence in his case is not 
     <lb/>
     Jamaica but Ottawa — and the switch he hopes 
     <lb/>
     to make is not from the blue guernsey to 
     <lb/>
     broadcloth, but from his nice little delegate's 
     <lb/>
     everyday suit to senatorial toga. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Yes, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Smallwood is using 
     <lb/>
     the same words and the same tactics today to lead 
     <lb/>
     us into this new union, just as he did to lead the 
     <lb/>
     people into that other union. He believes in the 
     <lb/>
     old slogan that people have short memories, and 
     <lb/>
     many of them are dead anyhow, and if for no 
     <lb/>
     other reason I would ask the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland at this time to heed the more practical 
     <lb/>
     slogan to stop, look and listen, for it is being 
     <lb/>
     promoted by a man who has shown himself one 
     <lb/>
     of the smartest talkers in Newfoundland, and we 
     <lb/>
     all know that all is not gold that glitters. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
    Mr. Chairman, a few days ago the member for 
     <lb/>
     Bonavista Centre said that a campaign of exag<lb break="no"/>geration and misrepresentation was being spread 
     <lb/>
     over this country by his opponents; and yet, al<lb break="no"/>most in the next breath, this same gentleman 
     <lb/>
     shouts through the microphone that 99% of the 
     <lb/>
     people in Newfoundland want confederation". 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smailwood I have already denied that that 
     <lb/>
     was what I said. What I said was, and I repeat, 
     <lb/>
     "99 Newfoundlanders out of every 100 want 
     <lb/>
     confederation to be placed on the ballot paper." 
            </p>

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is my understanding. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I ask Mr. Reddy to take that 
     <lb/>
     back. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You are not quoting Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood correctly. It is not too much to expect 
     <lb/>
     you to take it back. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> If I have not got it right, it is OK. But 
     <lb/>
     I know that is a falsehood, and Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     knows it is a falsehood. And you, yourself, sir, 
     <lb/>
     know it is a falsehood. And if that is not exag<lb break="no"/>geration and misrepresentation, I don't know 
     <lb/>
     what is. Another example of his attempt at mis<lb break="no"/>representation is his story told here twice in 
     <lb/>
     recent days — he must think it is good because 
     <lb/>
     he told it twice —— that 110 local firms made a 
     <lb/>
     profit of $15 million last year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> 105 firms. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:REDD1">Mr. Reddy</persName> If anything is more calculated to 
     <lb/>
     deceive than that, I don't know what is. We all 
     <lb/>
     know that in Newfoundland there are some large 


            <cb/>


     corporations with tremendous investments of 
     <lb/>
     money. Bowaters, for instance, have about $75 
     <lb/>
     million invested in Newfoundland. The AND 
     <lb/>
     Company has about $60 million invested. 
     <lb/>
     Buchans Mining Company has about $15 million 
     <lb/>
     invested. The Dominion Iron and Steel Co. has, 
     <lb/>
     I suppose, another $20 million. And if these 
     <lb/>
     companies between them average 6% profit on 
     <lb/>
     their invested capital, it will amount to $10 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. I am not including in this the various 
     <lb/>
     Canadian corporations doing business in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, such as the eight or nine in<lb break="no"/>surance companies, the Canadian trust com<lb break="no"/>panies and the Canadian banks — all of whom 
     <lb/>
     together, I imagine, made a few millions and 
     <lb/>
     must be included in those corporations to which 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood referred. Mr. Smallwood's 
     <lb/>
     words conveyed to the people that the corpora<lb break="no"/>tions making that profit were the big bad wolves, 
     <lb/>
     the local merchants, which is a falsehood. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, confederation is not the solu<lb break="no"/>tion — least of all, Mr. Smallwood's brand. Up 
     <lb/>
     to now, and for centuries past, the Union Jack has 
     <lb/>
     been our national flag. I am not of English de<lb break="no"/>scent but of Irish descent, but I want to say that it 
     <lb/>
     is a good flag and I would like to see it continue 
     <lb/>
     to fly and to be our national flag in the days ahead. 
     <lb/>
     In Quebec they have, just a week ago, pulled 
     <lb/>
     down the old flag and put up their own. In the rest 
     <lb/>
     of Canada they have torn down the Union Jack 
     <lb/>
     and for the past 12 months they have been argu<lb break="no"/>ing as to what the new flag is going to be. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are other things in life that are important 
     <lb/>
     as well as all this talk about three meals a day. 
     <lb/>
     And as for the economic problem over which 
     <lb/>
     they cry their crocodile tears, let us berealists and 
     <lb/>
     not a bunch of fools following a jack-o-lantern, 
     <lb/>
     and let us do exactly as Canada herself did a 
     <lb/>
     month ago when she was in financial difficulties 
     <lb/>
     and had to borrow $300 million. Let us go to the 
     <lb/>
     USA with <hi rendition="simple:italic">our</hi> economic problems, let us sell the 
     <lb/>
     USA all our fish, paper, ore and other things we 
     <lb/>
     produce. And right there is the solution, and only 
     <lb/>
     solution to our economic problems. And anyone 
     <lb/>
     who says otherwise is only fooling himself and 
     <lb/>
     trying to fool the people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     So in conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I ask that, 
     <lb/>
     politically, let us keep the close ties we have 
     <lb/>
     always had with the mother country. Let us keep 
     <lb/>
     the Union Jack flying. And economically, let us 
     <lb/>
     turn our faces towards the richest nation in the

     world — the USA. That is our hope and our 
     <lb/>
     destiny. Any other course would be political and 
     <lb/>
     economic madness. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> Mr. Chairman, I would like first 
     <lb/>
     to refer to Mr. Smallwood's opening speech on 
     <lb/>
     Friday afternoon when he introduced the motion 
     <lb/>
     now before this Convention. Mr. Smallwood has 
     <lb/>
     referred here before to politics being present in 
     <lb/>
     this National Convention, but I think, sir, that he 
     <lb/>
     topped it all with his speech to which I have just 
     <lb/>
     referred. In my opinion he did not clearly outline 
     <lb/>
     just what those terms that have been offered by 
     <lb/>
     Canada would mean to the people of this country, 
     <lb/>
    and not only the benefit to them, but also the cost.  
     <lb/>The address, to my mind, was the start of a 
     <lb/>political campaign. He endeavoured to divide the 
     <lb/>country and set class against class. This is old- 
     <lb break="yes"/>time political practice, and endeavours to set the 
     <lb/>poor against the rich and the middle class against 
     <lb/>which ever side is most beneficial to the political 
     <lb/>future of the proponent. It befogs the real issue, 
     <lb/>and if carried far enough, engenders class hatred 
     <lb/>to the exclusion of the common sense and prac<lb break="no"/>ticability that is needed to make a sensible 
     <lb/>decision on the question that is to be put to the 
     <lb/>people. The whole speech, sir, sounded familiar 
     <lb/>to me, and only after listening to it for a while did 
     <lb/>it remind me of the tirades that I have heard from 
     <lb/>soapbox orators in Hyde Park in London and in 
     <lb/>New York. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood states that if the majority of 
     <lb/>
     this Convention had their way, the country would 
     <lb/>
     vote for nothing else but responsible government, 
     <lb/>
     but I think that the people will realise that by the 
     <lb/>
     unanimous passing of Mr. Higgins' motion to put 
     <lb/>
     before the people both responsible and Commis<lb break="no"/>sion of Government, Mr. Smallwood's conten<lb break="no"/>tion is completely wrong. He also stated that it 
     <lb/>
     was abattle to get the Convention to debate these 
     <lb/>
     terms. Here again I cannot agree in any way with 
     <lb/>
     his statements, as I know of no time when mem<lb break="no"/>bers did not wish to have these debated and I, for 
     <lb/>
     one, was very much desirous of having these 
     <lb/>
     terms of confederation debated here, if for noth<lb break="no"/>ing else to show how insufficient and how 
     <lb/>
     dangerous they were to the future economy of the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country. If I had been the only one, 
     <lb/>
     I still would have voted to have these terms 
     <lb/>
    debated as we have done. Mr. Smallwood also 
     <lb/>states, and this has already been referred to by Mr. 
     <lb/>Reddy, that 99 out of 100 Newfoundlanders

     wanted the choice of confederation to be sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to them, but I do not believe that 99 out of 
     <lb/>
     100 or any portion of the people would want 
     <lb/>
     confederation submitted to them on what I might 
     <lb/>
     term such crucifying terms. He states that we are 
     <lb/>
     fighting a battle for economic security, but I fail 
     <lb/>
     to find any economic security for the people in 
     <lb/>
     the terms which have been submitted to us. I 
     <lb/>
     would like to say right here, sir, that I am not 
     <lb/>
     against and do not hate confederation just for the 
     <lb/>
     sake of hating it, as Mr. Smallwood would have 
     <lb/>
     you believe. If I thought that these terms would 
     <lb/>
     really benefit the country as a whole, raise the 
     <lb/>
     standard of living of the people, and relieve them 
     <lb/>
     of burdensome taxes, I would be very glad indeed 
     <lb/>
     to recommend it; but on these so-called terms 
     <lb/>
     which we have been offered, I fail to find the 
     <lb/>
     security for which the people of this country are 
     <lb/>
     looking. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
    Mr. Smallwood states that those people who 
     <lb/>
     are against confederation on the terms outlined 
     <lb/>
     from Canada, have been harping on the property 
     <lb/>
     taxes that the people will have to pay. The proper<lb break="no"/>ty taxes, while they mean something to those who 
     <lb/>
     have to pay, yet are only a part of what the people 
     <lb/>
     will pay in taxes. The federal tax that will go to 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian government and the provincial 
     <lb/>
     taxes necessary to maintain administration of this 
     <lb/>
     provincial government will be a large source of 
     <lb/>
     worry, as well as taxes on property or school tax. 
     <lb/>
     Nobody here has intimated yet that the federal 
     <lb/>
     government will collect any property taxes. That 
     <lb/>
     has not been stated. Mr. Smallwood says that the 
     <lb/>
     provincial government never will collect proper<lb break="no"/>ty taxes because they would be thrown out of 
     <lb/>
     office if they attempted to do this; and he went on 
     <lb/>
     to say that the town councils — if you wish to 
     <lb/>
     have a town council — would perhaps collect 
     <lb/>
     these property taxes if they so desired. But let me 
     <lb/>
     point out, sir, that if there is no town council in a 
     <lb/>
     settlement, then the roads and public works or 
     <lb/>
     other services in that community have to be main<lb break="no"/>tained by the provincial government, and they in 
     <lb/>
     turn must tax to collect the money which they will 
     <lb/>
     spend. If those communities that have town coun<lb break="no"/>cils are to progress and maintain their townsites, 
     <lb/>
     then they must collect taxes to do so, and whether 
     <lb/>
     you pay a property tax to the federal government, 
     <lb/>
     provincial government or town council, it does 
     <lb/>
     not matter. You will be taxed just the same, and 
     <lb/>
     whoever collects it will not help to ease the

     question either in your mind or your pockets. 
            </p>

<p>
     The cost of living here in Newfoundland has 
     <lb/>
     been referred to not only by Mr. Smallwood but 
     <lb/>
     by other speakers, and one would think to listen 
     <lb/>
     to them that with the stroke of a pen the cost of 
     <lb/>
     living will come down considerably. This is 
     <lb/>
     another false idea which people may get into their 
     <lb/>
     minds. If you will refer to the report made by the 
     <lb/>
     Federation of Labour on the cost of living today 
     <lb/>
     and the amount required by a man with a family 
     <lb/>
     to live, you will see (and here Mr. Fogwill can 
     <lb/>
     support me, as he was one of the members of the 
     <lb/>
     committee that drew up the report) that the duties 
     <lb/>
     paid on foodstuffs consumed amounted to not 
     <lb/>
     more than approximately 5% of the earnings 
     <lb/>
     spent in this direction, and if you further take into 
     <lb/>
     consideration the local products which such a 
     <lb/>
     family would buy here in a year, like potatoes, 
     <lb/>
     turnips, fish, etc., the total duty on that family's 
     <lb/>
     outlay would amount to not more than about 
     <lb/>
     4.5%. Union with Canada will not bring us 
     <lb/>
     geographically any closer to the mainland and we 
     <lb/>
     will still have to freight our imports to this 
     <lb/>
     country and distribute them as before, and union 
     <lb/>
     with Canada or any other country cannot get 
     <lb/>
     away from this factor in the cost of goods to the 
     <lb/>
     consumer. Mr. Smallwood has referred to special 
     <lb/>
     freight rates operating east of Quebec which 
     <lb/>
     should reduce the rates, so that it would in turn 
     <lb/>
     bring down the cost on the goods. I might say, 
     <lb/>
     firstly, that freight rates are not a large percentage 
     <lb/>
     of the cost of the goods, but in any event this 
     <lb/>
     reduction of rates would apply only to those 
     <lb/>
     shipments through the Canadian National Rail<lb break="no"/>way... 
     <lb/>
      </p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> And the CPR. 
     <lb/>
            </p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> And the larger percentage of our 
     <lb/>goods coming into this country do so by steamers, 
     <lb/>operated by lines and companies other than those 
     <lb/>of the Canadian National Railway and the CPR 
     <lb/>or the Newfoundland Railway. From the time of 
     <lb/>opening of navigation in Montreal in May, to the 
     <lb/>close around the end of November, the larger 
     <lb/>portion of our goods are moved direct by steamer 
     <lb/>from that port to the west coast through Corner 
     <lb/>Brook and to the east coast through St. John's; 
     <lb/>and these boats, as well as those from Halifax and 
     <lb/>New York, are operated by the Furness Red 
     <lb/>Cross Line, Shaw Steamship Co. Ltd., New<lb break="no"/>foundland Canada Steamships Ltd, Clarke 
     <lb/>Steamships Ltd, and other corporations in the 


            <cb/>
   

     shipping business. Therefore there will be no 
     <lb/>
     resulting benefit to any great extent in the move<lb break="no"/>ment of goods by freight from Canada to here by 
     <lb/>
     the CNR or CPR. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On this cost of living being cheaper, I wonder 
     <lb/>
     do people realise that at present there is no duty 
     <lb/>
     on flour, salt beef and pork, cooked corned beef 
     <lb/>
     in tins, butterine and tinned milk, which are all 
     <lb/>
     staple products in the people's diet? In addition 
     <lb/>
     to this, we have items coming in duty free such 
     <lb/>
     as fresh fruit, prunes, currants, raisins, feeds, long 
     <lb/>
     rubber boots, fruit juices and vegetable juices. All 
     <lb/>
     I have mentioned are duty free, and will not be 
     <lb/>
     affected by union with Canada. There are addi<lb break="no"/>tional items which have a very low duty basis 
     <lb/>
     such as peas, beans, rice and barley at 1 cent per 
     <lb/>
     1b., oatmeal and rolled oats at 1/2 cent per 1b., 
     <lb/>
     cornmeal at 1/8 cent per lb. The elimination of 
     <lb/>
     duty on these and a lot of other items will have 
     <lb/>
     no obvious effect on the cost of living, because 
     <lb/>
     the duty is so low that the removal of it will not 
     <lb/>
     easily be seen. But, however, union with Canada, 
     <lb/>
     while it may remove some of these very low 
     <lb/>
     duties, will place an 8% sales tax and excise duty 
     <lb/>
     on some of these items, and indeed on some of 
     <lb/>
     the more staple ones; the sales tax in many cases 
     <lb/>
     will more than offset the reduction of duty. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, Mr. Smallwood did not point 
     <lb/>
     out to the people that fishermen could buy their 
     <lb/>
     salt for approximately $2 per hogshead cheaper 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland; that oiled clothing per suit is 
     <lb/>
     not any higher in Newfoundland than it is in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, although we pay 20% duty on it; that 
     <lb/>
     herring nets in this country are slightly cheaper 
     <lb/>
     than in Canada; that rubber boots are cheaper 
     <lb/>
     here today than they are in Canada. To get this 
     <lb/>
     comparison of figures, I have used the ones sub<lb break="no"/>mitted in the Black Book against local prices 
     <lb/>
     here, and I have written to Halifax and compared 
     <lb/>
     the prices existing in Canada only a month ago, 
     <lb/>
     because those in the Black Book were probably 
     <lb/>
     compiled six months ago. There may be some 
     <lb/>
     reductions in some items, but one must remember 
     <lb/>
     that this will be offset to a great extent by federal 
     <lb/>
     sales taxes, import duties and excise duties. In 
     <lb/>
     referring to the price for salt to the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     fishermen, which is $2 cheaper here, I might say 
     <lb/>
     that I cut down the Canadian hogshead to the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland hogshead... If Canada, as 
     <lb/>
     claimed by some, can do so much better for us 
     <lb/>
     (and with which I cannot agree), then why should 



            <pb n="1413"

     we throw away an opportunity of some union 
     <lb/>
     with the USA, which country could, in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, do so much better for us? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Smallwood reached the height of his class 
     <lb/>
     versus class propaganda when he took upon him<lb break="no"/>self to tell you of monopolies and monies made 
     <lb/>
     here. I am afraid, from what Mr. Smallwood has 
     <lb/>
     said, that he does not know very much about 
     <lb/>
     business and I refer to the general channels 
     <lb/>
     through which trade is done. Business is done 
     <lb/>
     exactly the same as it is done in Canada, the 
     <lb/>
     United States, Great Britain or any other country. 
     <lb/>
     With regard to his reference to agencies that have 
     <lb/>
     sole monopolies, he is away over his head when 
     <lb/>
     he goes into the fundamentals of business and 
     <lb/>
     distribution. Canadian firms do not distribute or 
     <lb/>
     sell their goods to every Tom, Dick and Harry in 
     <lb/>
     this country or any other country. They themsel<lb break="no"/>ves are the ones that use the principle of one agent 
     <lb/>
     or distributor, so that their goods may be better 
     <lb/>
     handled with more concentration of sales through 
     <lb/>
     one individual, and so that they may, through 
     <lb/>
     their distributorship methods, keep down the ul<lb break="no"/>timate cost of their product to the countries to 
     <lb/>
     which they sell. You will find that where there 
     <lb/>
     are agents or distributors or representatives of 
     <lb/>
     any Canadian or American firm, it is by the policy 
     <lb/>
     of these firms that there are sole agents, and that 
     <lb/>
     it is to further Canadian export business and at 
     <lb/>
     the same time keep down the cost of their 
     <lb/>
     products that they adhere to these methods that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood has taken so much trouble to call 
     <lb/>
     "monopolies". He has referred to the large 
     <lb/>
     volume of money made here in the last several 
     <lb/>
     years, but he omitted to say that a tremendous 
     <lb/>
     volume of the sales were made to American and 
     <lb/>
     Canadian firms who were contracting and build<lb break="no"/>ing bases, and that the sales to them took not one 
     <lb/>
     cent out of the pockets of the people. In fact, it 
     <lb/>
     was the construction of these bases that first gave 
     <lb/>
     the people an opportunity to earn this money, and 
     <lb/>
     they were fed by these firms through the goods 
     <lb/>
     that were purchased in this country. He refers you 
     <lb/>
     to 105 firms that made a profit of $15 million or 
     <lb/>
     an average of about $150,000 each. He did not 
     <lb/>
     tell you, however, that this included Bowaters 
     <lb/>
     and the AND Co., and the Buchans Mining Co., 
     <lb/>
     which would account for the larger part of this 
     <lb/>
     profit and would probably bring the average of 
     <lb/>
     the 100-odd Newfoundland firms down to around 
     <lb/>
     $80,000. He did not tell you that only 29 firms in 
  

            <cb/>
         

     Canada made something like $250 million to 
     <lb/>
     $300 million — an average of over $10 million 
     <lb/>
     each. Compare this to what he has given you for 
     <lb/>
     the 105 firms in Newfoundland, including the 
     <lb/>
     paper companies. If there is any profit that can be 
     <lb/>
     seen, it is in Canada and not here. The profits and 
     <lb/>
     mark-ups allowed by the Canadian government, 
     <lb/>
     even under the price control system, are away in 
     <lb/>
     excess of those here in Newfoundland, and in a 
     <lb/>
     lot of cases they are double. Yet this is the 
     <lb/>
     country, which to quote Mr. Cashin, "is the land 
     <lb/>
     of milk and honey". This again is only further 
     <lb/>
     propaganda to set class against class, and divide 
     <lb/>
     the people of this country to their own detriment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Banfield, in seconding the motion, said 
     <lb/>
     that with confederation, the bulk of the taxes 
     <lb/>
     would fall on broader shoulders and not on the 
     <lb/>
     poor as today. Let me correct that right now. The 
     <lb/>
     sales taxes and excise duties in Canada will fall 
     <lb/>
     on those here in proportion to their purchases, but 
     <lb/>
     when you come to one of the real federal taxes, 
     <lb/>
     you will find that in Canada the income tax 
     <lb/>
     collected by the Canadian government is what 
     <lb/>
     will really hit our people here. In 1945 people 
     <lb/>
     earning less than $1,000 — which is not taxable 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland — paid to the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government $19 million in income tax; the 
     <lb/>
     people earning between $1,000 and $2,000 a year 
     <lb/>
     paid $146 million, and those earning between 
     <lb/>
     $2,000 and $3,000 paid $137 million. For these 
     <lb/>
     last three income group brackets, that is $3,000 
     <lb/>
     and below, they paid a total of $300 million out 
     <lb/>
     of a total collected by the federal government of 
     <lb/>
     $680 million. In other words, the income tax paid 
     <lb/>
     by the lower-income group paid practically half 
     <lb/>
     of the $680 million collected, and then Mr. Ban<lb break="yes"/>field tries to tell you that it will fall on broader 
     <lb/>
     shoulders than it does today. The federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment on today's basis estimates taking about $3.2 
     <lb/>
     million in personal income tax out of this country, 
     <lb/>
     but I feel sure that this will be closer to $5 million 
     <lb/>
     because there are so many today not paying in<lb break="no"/>come tax in this country, who will have to do so 
     <lb/>
     if we become part of Canada. While I am on this 
     <lb/>
     question of taxes, I might say I have heard a lot 
     <lb/>
     of talk here about the vicious system of indirect 
     <lb/>
     taxation in this country, and that our union with 
     <lb/>
     Canada would get us clear of this system. Perhaps 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood does not know that the revenue 
     <lb/>
     of the Canadian government for the fiscal year 
     <lb/>
     ending 1947 was largely derived from indirect 
 

            <pb n="1414"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-27-28_Page_1414.jpg"/>

     taxes. Out of $3 billion taken in this respect, over 
     <lb/>
     $1 billion was from indirect taxes, such as cus<lb break="no"/>toms duties, excise duties, etc., and $1.5 billion 
     <lb/>
     from direct taxes. One-third of their total receipts 
     <lb/>
     in this respect was from indirect taxes, and yet we 
     <lb/>
     are told that union with Canada will banish this 
     <lb/>
     vicious system. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have also heard the oft-made remark about 
     <lb/>
     the bottom falling out of fish prices, etc, and the 
     <lb/>
     price going down to $5 per quintal, but surely the 
     <lb/>
     members who make these statements do not ex<lb break="no"/>pect that union with Canada is going to prevent 
     <lb/>
     fish or any other commodity from dropping in 
     <lb/>
     price? That will be the result of world conditions, 
     <lb/>
     and Canada or any other country cannot stabilise 
     <lb/>
     or prevent the drop in prices of fish or any other 
     <lb/>
     product. In fact in my opinion, union with Canada 
     <lb/>
     will have a destructive effect on our fishing in<lb break="no"/>dustry, inasmuch as we will be unable to make 
     <lb/>
     the marketing arrangements that we have today 
     <lb/>
     with European markets, particularly Portugal and 
     <lb/>
     Spain and perhaps Italy, and also I can see noth<lb break="no"/>ing in the terms of the Black Book, nothing 
     <lb/>
     official, that will show me that the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     Fisheries Board will be able to continue its 
     <lb/>
     present work which is resulting in the better 
     <lb/>
     marketing and selling of our products. It can only, 
     <lb/>
     as far as I can see, be the agent of the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Prices Support Board, and this has nothing 
     <lb/>
     whatever to do with markets or export, and to lose 
     <lb/>
     the Fisheries Board in its present capacity would, 
     <lb/>
     in my opinion, not only be destructive, but also 
     <lb/>
     have a very far-reaching and bad effect on our 
     <lb/>
     whole industry. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It has also been said by some of our most 
     <lb/>
     ardent confederates that it is very difficult to 
     <lb/>
     provide full social services in this country be<lb break="no"/>cause the population is so scattered over such an 
     <lb/>
     area. Do they mean to tell me that union with 
     <lb/>
     Canada would make our population less scattered 
     <lb/>
     and Newfoundland any smaller? We will have 
     <lb/>
     exactly the same problems under confederation, 
     <lb/>
     and to my mind this is just one more of the red 
     <lb/>
     herrings that are drawn across our trail, and if Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Crosbie had thought of it in advance, he could 
     <lb/>
     have put his herring factory here in the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion because there are more red herring here than 
     <lb/>
     in Bay of Islands. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The people will want to consider what effects 
     <lb/>
     confederation may have on our industries. I have 
     <lb/>
     already told you briefly the detrimental effect it 
 

            <cb/>
          

     will have on our fisheries; but here is also the 
     <lb/>
     effect it will have on our paper mills and paper 
     <lb/>
     industries. Newfoundland has one of the most 
     <lb/>
     economically operated paper industries in the 
     <lb/>
     world today, and while the demand for the next 
     <lb/>
     few years will be such that total outputs or 
     <lb/>
     production may be sold out, yet it may be that in 
     <lb/>
     the near future paper mills under union will have 
     <lb/>
     to restrict their output — to go on the quota basis 
     <lb/>
     as they did in Canada. If this happens, New<lb break="no"/>foundland, under its own government, being 
     <lb/>
     operated so economically, the industry could still 
     <lb/>
     work at capacity without restriction; but as 
     <lb/>
     operated in Canada, our paper mills would be 
     <lb/>
     placed under production restrictions, with the 
     <lb/>
     result that perhaps 1,000 of our people would be 
     <lb/>
     put out of work in the mills and in the woods. The 
     <lb/>
     effect on our industries, as I have mentioned, 
     <lb/>
     must have consideration by the people, because 
     <lb/>
     it affects them directly in the amount of employ<lb break="no"/>ment available, which might be reduced in this 
     <lb/>
     respect through confederation with Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Our agricultural industry today is producing 
     <lb/>
     around $12-15 million and if we should become 
     <lb/>
     part of Canada, I hesitate to say what effect it 
     <lb/>
     would have on our agricultural products and on 
     <lb/>
     our farmers generally, particularly in view of the 
     <lb/>
     increased land production that we are endeavour<lb break="no"/>ing to obtain. This is one very good reason why  
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island would like to see us in 
     <lb/>
     confederation at the expense of our west coast 
     <lb/>
     farmers, as well as those on the east coast. It 
     <lb/>
     would provide the Canadian farmers with an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity to increase their profit at the expense 
     <lb/>
     of the Newfoundlanders. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Do the people of this country realise that we 
     <lb/>
     are now discussing the terms offered by the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government, which are based on a tax 
     <lb/>
     agreement that over 50% of the people in Canada 
     <lb/>
     have not subscribed to, and to which they do not 
     <lb/>
     agree? Both Quebec and Ontario have not ac<lb break="no"/>cepted this federal-provincial agreement, and it 
     <lb/>
     might be of interest to you to know that I under<lb break="no"/>stand that the Ontario government brought in 
     <lb/>
     some experts from the United States to go over 
     <lb/>
     the whole question and to advise the Ontario 
     <lb/>
     government as to whether it was wise or not to 
     <lb/>
     accept this tax agreement, and they have not done 
     <lb/>
     so. Yet we are trying to be pushed into an agree<lb break="no"/>ment that over half of the people in Canada have 
     <lb/>
     not accepted, and for the Canadian government 
  

            <pb n="1415"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-27-28_Page_1415.jpg"/>

     to offer us terms on which half the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     population cannot agree, I think would be a very 
     <lb/>
     strong factor against recommending it ourselves 
     <lb/>
     to the people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have been interested in listening to the 
     <lb/>
     reasons which several members have been offer<lb break="no"/>ing for acceptance of these terms of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, but there has been one very significant fact 
     <lb/>
     in these last weeks of discussion, and particularly 
     <lb/>
     in the debate just recently finished covering the 
     <lb/>
     finance end of it and the estimated provincial 
     <lb/>
     budget. This very significant fact, sir, which 
     <lb/>
     stands out as a weak link in the chain of the 
     <lb/>
     confederation-backers, is that they have not men<lb break="no"/>tioned anything about the provincial budget, or 
     <lb/>
     how we are going to fare operating New<lb break="no"/>foundland as a province, or how the people are 
     <lb/>
     going to pay for the benefits they might receive 
     <lb/>
     from confederation. I have heard eight or nine of 
     <lb/>
     these members speaking in favour of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion on generalities alone. They have not stated 
     <lb/>
     any solid basic facts to back up their recommen<lb break="no"/>dation to the people. They have glibly skipped 
     <lb/>
     over the most important part that the people 
     <lb/>
     should consider, and that is, sir, how can we 
     <lb/>
     operate a province and who is going to pay for it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I was most surprised indeed by the impression 
     <lb/>
     I received of what Mr. Burry said on January 13. 
     <lb/>
     He spoke very feelingly of the people on the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador, and quite rightly so, and pointed out 
     <lb/>
     the benefits to them; but my impression was that 
     <lb/>
     he spoke through the eyes of 5,000 people on 
     <lb/>
     Labrador as a basis for recommending to the 
     <lb/>
     other 300,000 people of Newfoundland that con<lb break="no"/>federation would be good for them. I realise that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Burry has the people of Labrador at heart, 
     <lb/>
     and I have every respect for this gentleman, but 
     <lb/>
     to me his sole argument was based on and around 
     <lb/>
     only that small percentage of the whole country 
     <lb/>
     and I cannot accept his argument as referring to 
     <lb/>
     the rest of Newfoundland.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Our number one senator, Mr. Ballam, describ<lb break="no"/>ed the wonderful country that Canada was and the 
     <lb/>
     sights they saw and which, no doubt, were seen 
     <lb/>
     from the back seat of a car or at garden parties 
     <lb/>
     which he attended while in Ottawa. Did he see 
     <lb/>
     the horrible conditions in the slums in Montreal 
     <lb/>
     and around other cities or walk down through the 
     <lb/>
     poorer sections? He apparently did not, or he 
     <lb/>
     would have seen conditions there that we have 
     <lb/>
     never known in Newfoundland. I am afraid I 
     

            <cb/>
        

     could not recommend confederation based on the 
     <lb/>
     arguments I have heard here which are pure 
     <lb/>
     generalities, without foundations or anything 
     <lb/>
     solid on which people can base their future hopes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I want to make it quite plain that I am <hi rendition="simple:italic">not</hi> an 
     <lb/>
     anticonfederate, I do not hate the thought of con<lb break="no"/>federation. I naturally prefer our own inde<lb break="no"/>pendence, but if we were offered terms that 
     <lb/>
     would really benefit this country, raise the stand<lb break="no"/>ard of living of our people, and secure or improve 
     <lb/>
     our national economy, I would be the first one to 
     <lb/>
     vote for it. But looking at it on the basis of the 
     <lb/>
     terms we have been offered, I cannot sincerely 
     <lb/>
     recommend it to the people of this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> said on January 16 that he 
     <lb/>
     could not see why we always want to remain 
     <lb/>
     independent. I can hardly believe Mr. Ashbourne 
     <lb/>
     seriously considered this remark, as surely it is 
     <lb/>
     the wish of everybody in this country to remain 
     <lb/>
     independent if they can do so without sacrificing 
     <lb/>
     too much. Mr. Ashbourne also mentions the fact 
     <lb/>
     that under confederation a man could leave here 
     <lb/>
     after the fishing season for winter work in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, but surely he realises that people in 
     <lb/>
     Canada are in similar industries as ourselves, and 
     <lb/>
     that they are in the identical position as us, and 
     <lb/>
     the volume of work to be obtained in Canada 
     <lb/>
     during the winter months would affect such a 
     <lb/>
     small part of our population, and would benefit 
     <lb/>
     us so little, that this is hardly a reason for his 
     <lb/>
     strong recommendation of confederation. If con<lb break="no"/>ditions become poor in this country and work is 
     <lb/>
     hard to get, it will also apply to Canada, and the 
     <lb/>
     jobs that are available in Canada are being filled 
     <lb/>
     by immigrants consisting of displaced persons 
     <lb/>
     from Europe who are coming to Canada on very 
     <lb/>
     low salary to start with, such a salary as 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders could not exist on, and which 
     <lb/>
     would not give them sufficient returns to pay 
     <lb/>
     their fare up and back again. He states that we are 
     <lb/>
     dependent on Canada to defend our shores... 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ASHB2">Mr. Ashbourne</persName> I maintain that I referred to 
     <lb/>Great Britain as well as Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> Surely we are more dependent on 
     <lb/>
     the United States who already has three bases 
     <lb/>
     established here and who is by far the strongest 
     <lb/>
     nation in the world today. It would be to them that 
     <lb/>
     we would have to look to defend our shores rather 
     <lb/>
     than Canada who would only be a part, with the 
     <lb/>
     USA, in a joint defence of the North American 
     <lb/>
     continent. He feels that Canada is at our back, 
   

            <pb n="1416"

     presumably to support us; but the people must 
     <lb/>
     realise that they will not get anything for which 
     <lb/>
     they do not pay, and that Canada is not Santa 
     <lb/>
     Claus. Mr. Ashbourne also stated that if New<lb break="no"/>foundland needed assistance after our surplus 
     <lb/>
     had been spent, we would know where to look for 
     <lb/>
     it. I can well see why he brought this question up 
     <lb/>
     because he, no doubt, anticipates that our surplus 
     <lb/>
     will soon be gone, and under those terms that 
     <lb/>
     Canada has to offer, I can well agree with him. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have a provincial budget based on those 
     <lb/>
     terms presented to us, and on which even Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, who compiled this budget, estimates 
     <lb/>
     a $1.25 million deficit each year. No doubt he 
     <lb/>
     shaved the figures as close as possible, but still 
     <lb/>
     could not show how we could operate under 
     <lb/>
     union with Canada with less than a $1.25 million 
     <lb/>
     deficit. However, he did not take into considera<lb break="no"/>tion that he cut the Public Health Department, 
     <lb/>
     with its yearly expenditure to $5.25 million, 
     <lb/>
     against our present general expenditure of $6.25 
     <lb/>
     million, and he did not take into consideration 
     <lb/>
     that with the completion of the General Hospital 
     <lb/>
     here at St. John's and the sanatorium at Corner 
     <lb/>
     Brook, with a 250-bed capacity, and the exten<lb break="no"/>sion of the Western Memorial Hospital at Corner 
     <lb/>
     Brook, that our maintenance of these public ser<lb break="no"/>vices under the department will require closer to 
     <lb/>
     $7 million a year, so that we would require ap<lb break="no"/>proximately another $2 million in addition to the 
     <lb/>
     deficit brought in by Mr. Smallwood. That makes 
     <lb/>
     approximately a $3 million deficit. The education 
     <lb/>
     grant has been left at just over $3 million, but here 
     <lb/>
     again the Department of Education will require 
     <lb/>
     about $4 million, although they may not be able 
     <lb/>
     to obtain this from the revenue of this country, 
     <lb/>
     but they will certainly need another $500,000 to 
     <lb/>
     maintain the educational services for the children 
     <lb/>
     in this country, and this further increases the 
     <lb/>
     deficit under union to somewhat just under $4 
     <lb/>
     million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There has been no provision made here at all 
     <lb/>
     for reconstruction, and the amount of money 
     <lb/>
     provided in Mr. Smallwood's budget is merely 
     <lb/>
     suffcient to cover the maintenance of existing 
     <lb/>
     roads. To build further, or to increase the remain<lb break="no"/>ing public works, as well as any other reconstruc<lb break="no"/>tion programme, would certainly require another 
     <lb/>
     $2 million, which gives us a yearly deficit of 
     <lb/>
     something near $5 million and which would 
     <lb/>
     bring the total expenditure of the provincial 
 

            <cb/>
     

     government up to something like $19 million per 
     <lb/>
     year. This deficit is to be collected from the 
     <lb/>
     people in additional taxes — whether these be 
     <lb/>
     sales taxes, property taxes, school taxes or some 
     <lb/>
     other kind of tax, the cost of government would 
     <lb/>
     have to be paid for, and those terms under which 
     <lb/>
     we have been offered confederation do not pro<lb break="no"/>vide us with sufficient revenue to balance our 
     <lb/>
     budget without resorting to increased taxation 
     <lb/>
     and you cannot get away from this fact. Under 
     <lb/>
     these terms I am sorry to say that as far as I can 
     <lb/>
     see, we will have built our last hospital, we will 
     <lb/>
     have put the last bed in it, and we will have laid 
     <lb/>
     our last mile of road...

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> In the interest of brevity and 
     <lb/>
     efficiency, members should distinguish between 
     <lb/>
     the motion before the Chair and the debate on the 
     <lb/>
     confederation terms. Our attention is directed to 
     <lb/>
     the fact that the Canadian terms or proposals were 
     <lb/>
     fully debated and spoken to by every member of 
     <lb/>
     the House who wished to speak to them. 
            </p>

<p>
    <persName ref="pers:HICK1">Mr. Hickman</persName> These are the facts that the people 
     <lb/>of Newfoundland should want to know. There are 
     <lb/>undoubtedly some benefits that me people will 
     <lb/>derive from the terms that have been put before 
     <lb/>us, but the whole picture cannot be seen until the 
     <lb/>benefits are accounted for by the cost to the 
     <lb/>people. The members who have spoken for con<lb break="no"/>federation seem to have missed this fact as they 
     <lb/>have avoided any reference to, nor did they sub<lb break="no"/>stantiate the facts as to how they can raise the 
     <lb/>revenue that will be necessary for this country as 
     <lb/>a province. They have skipped over the fun<lb break="no"/>damentals and have generalised. They have 
     <lb/>painted a very rosy picture and have put two coats 
     <lb/>of paint on the baby bonus to distract attention 
     <lb/>from the adverse or bad factors of the terms that 
     <lb/>have been offered us. They have referred to their 
     <lb/>dislike of responsible government, but what will 
     <lb/>we have under union with Canada but a respon<lb break="no"/>sible government? A provincial government is a 
     <lb/>responsible government, identically the same ex<lb break="no"/>cept that our control will only be over our provin<lb break="no"/>cial assets and the remainder of the country, 
     <lb/>including our resources and everything important 
     <lb/>to us, will be under the control of the Canadian 
     <lb/>government. These terms of confederation, sir, 
     <lb/>can be obtained at any time, These are the mini<lb break="no"/>mum that Canada could offer us and they are 
     <lb/>below the minimum that we should accept, or that 
     <lb/>I could recommend to the people myself. They

     are now being supported by propaganda to divide 
     <lb/>
     the classes in the country, as I have stated before 
     <lb/>
     — a "soak the rich" attitude. But however, the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Finance Minister, Mr. Douglas Abbott, 
     <lb/>
     has stated himself that this is an impossibility 
     <lb/>
     even in Canada, and has said that there are not 
     <lb/>
     enough rich in Canada to soak. If that applies in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, then so does it most certainly apply in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. It is all political propaganda to 
     <lb/>
     hide the real cold facts, and to stir the people up 
     <lb/>
     so that they cannot see what the future may hold 
     <lb/>
     for them. You cannot legislate a standard of 
     <lb/>
     living. People have to work to live, and there is 
     <lb/>
     nothing in the British North America Act that 
     <lb/>
     provides that all peoples in union shall have a 
     <lb/>
     high standard of living. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If I were the most ardent confederate, and yet 
     <lb/>
     sincere with the people of Newfoundland, I could 
     <lb/>
     not possibly recommend these terms to them. It 
     <lb/>
     is not a question of recommending confederation 
     <lb/>
     or not. It is a question of doing so on those terms 
     <lb/>
     submitted by the Government of Canada, and to 
     <lb/>
     recommend them to the people of this country is 
     <lb/>
     more than I would care to have on my conscience. 
     <lb/>
     If I thought sincerely they were good enough to 
     <lb/>
     benefit the people as a whole, raise the standard 
     <lb/>
     of living and give us economic security, then I 
     <lb/>
     would heartily support them and do all I could to 
     <lb/>
     have the people accept them But I have looked 
     <lb/>
     at these terms, sir, and have studied them to the 
     <lb/>
     best of my ability. I have used the experience I 
     <lb/>
     have gained in 20-odd years in this country in 
     <lb/>
     work, and I can only say it is a one—sided argu<lb break="no"/>ment —— one sided for Canada. I am willing to 
     <lb/>
     prophesy — which I hope will not come true — 
     <lb/>
     that if we have union with Canada, that anywhere 
     <lb/>
     from three to five years after we have entered into 
     <lb/>
     union, the people of this country will curse the 
     <lb/>
     day they ever voted for confederation on these 
     <lb/>
     terms. I hope that I am wrong, but that is my 
     <lb/>
     sincere belief, as well as that if the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland enter confederation on the terms 
     <lb/>
     submitted to us, it is nothing less than criminal. 
            </p>

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:HARR6">Mr. Harrington</persName> Mr. Chairman, I think you will 
     <lb/>
     agree, and every right—thinking Newfoundlander 
     <lb/>
     will agree, that it is most regrettable that the chief 
     <lb/>
     advocate of the cause of confederation should 
     <lb/>
     have introduced his resolution in the final stages 
     <lb/>
     of this Convention on such a note as he did, which 
     <lb/>
     several speakers have already suggested strongly 
     <lb/>
     resemble the tactics of class war and sectional 


            <cb/>
       

     agitation, that have been and are being employed 
     <lb/>
     by the vanguard of men who propose the Com<lb break="no"/>munist world order. I say it is most regrettable. 
     <lb/>
     Surely, confederation has more merit than that it 
     <lb/>
     has to be boosted in such a desperate manner. 
     <lb/>
     Surely the argument for putting confederation on 
     <lb/>
     the ballot on the basis submitted to the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion by the Prime Minister could have been 
     <lb/>
     presented in a fair and reasonable manner dealing 
     <lb/>
     with the proposed arrangements laid down in the 
     <lb/>
     Grey Book. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Instead, he said very little about the many 
     <lb/>
     aspects of confederation which are still seen 
     <lb/>
     "through a glass dimly" by our people, and the 
     <lb/>
     only real connection with the confederation ques<lb break="no"/>tion established by Mr. Smallwood that I could 
     <lb/>
     see, was his reference to the business of property 
     <lb/>
     tax, and of course his usual assertion that such a 
     <lb/>
     tax would scarcely apply to Newfoundland. He 
     <lb/>
     said that the federal government never collected 
     <lb/>
     a dollar in property tax, that the provincial 
     <lb/>
     government would not dare to collect a dollar; 
     <lb/>
     and that leaves only the municipal governments 
     <lb/>
     or town councils, and we have only ten or 15 of 
     <lb/>
     these councils, and so our people would not be 
     <lb/>
     taxed on their property, real or personal, I put it 
     <lb/>
     to you, Mr. Chairman, in the light of the deficits 
     <lb/>
     we would have in our provincial budgets, how 
     <lb/>
     long it would be before that provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ment would have to pass legislation to incor<lb break="no"/>porate every settlement in Newfoundland with a 
     <lb/>
     population of 500 and over into a local council, 
     <lb/>
     in order to raise the absolutely necessary 
     <lb/>
     revenues to keep the country going. And then see 
     <lb/>
     where we would stand on the matter of property 
     <lb/>
     taxes. And while I'm on taxes, Mr. Chairman, I'd 
     <lb/>
     like to refer to a couple of passages in one of those 
     <lb/>
     books and documents which we received from 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa — <hi rendition="simple:italic">Dominion and Provincial Submissions 
     <lb/>
     and Plenary Discussions at the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     Provincial Conference of 1945</hi>, page 142. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If that is the line of tactics that the confederates 
     <lb/>
     are going to employ from now to the referendum; 
     <lb/>
     if that is the way that they going to try and sell 
     <lb/>
     confederation to the people of this country, by 
     <lb/>
     raising the ugly and dangerous head of class 
     <lb/>
     warfare, then, sir, like Mr. Higgins and others, we 
     <lb/>
     are not going to have any part of it, 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Up to now the tactics, especially of the chief 
     <lb/>
     advocate of this cause, have been to try and prove, 
     <lb/>
     not that confederation is me best thing for New<lb break="no"/>

     foundland and her people, but that it is the <hi rendition="simple:italic">only</hi> 
     <lb/>
     thing. I could not accept that view. I never did 
     <lb/>
     accept it. If the confederates had attempted at the 
     <lb/>
     very beginning to prove in a reasonable and not 
     <lb/>
     too-eager way that confederation with Canada 
     <lb/>
     mightbe a good thing for even a fairly prosperous 
     <lb/>
     and well-fixed Newfoundland, I believe their 
     <lb/>
     cause might have had more success and a less 
     <lb/>
     thorny way than it did have. Instead, that cause 
     <lb/>
     was driven into the Convention's proceedings 
     <lb/>
     with as much diplomacy as a battering-ram, and 
     <lb/>
     kept swinging with all the power that fanaticism. 
     <lb/>
     over—eagerness and agitation could muster. Un<lb break="no"/>derlying the whole issue was the insistent effort 
     <lb/>
     at every turn to prove that Newfoundland was in 
     <lb/>
     a hopeless mess, that she would never get out of 
     <lb/>
     it, in fact that it would get worse, and the only 
     <lb/>
     hope for Newfoundlanders was to have sense 
     <lb/>
     enough to come in out of the wet —— under the big 
     <lb/>
     umbrella of confederation. The attempt to be<lb break="no"/>cloud the real issues at stake by this smoke-screen 
     <lb/>
     of emotionalism, and by an appeal to the under<lb break="no"/>dog, will not succeed, Mr. Chairman. I resent this 
     <lb/>
     line of argument by the delegate from Bonavista 
     <lb/>
     Centre. It is an insult to the intelligence and the 
     <lb/>
     integrity of myself and others who do not see eye 
     <lb/>
     to eye with him. Of course, he is not trying to 
     <lb/>
     convince us; he tells us that every time he speaks 
     <lb/>
     into the microphones it is to the people, his 
     <lb/>
     masters, he is speaking. I solemnly warn the 
     <lb/>
     people to beware, to "beware the Greeks, when 
     <lb/>
     they come bearing gifts." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I resent also his statement that he is getting 
     <lb/>
     ready to go out and tell them the truth, which they 
     <lb/>
     have never got in this Convention. I consider that 
     <lb/>
     a reflection on us all, including yourself, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, for we have honestly striven to give 
     <lb/>
     the people the truth, and that is why these so- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     called terms, this basis for confederation has been 
     <lb/>
     the storm—centre of such a prolonged discussion. 
     <lb/>
     What kind of truth is Mr. Smallwood going to 
     <lb/>
     bring to the people when he begins his crusade? 
     <lb/>
     Is it the same sort of inflammatory doctrine that 
     <lb/>
     he spewed forth on Friday last? If that is the kind 
     <lb/>
     of truth the people are to hear, then I say, God 
     <lb/>
     help them and God guard thee, Newfoundland! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But, proceeding from this point, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, there is one statement that Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     made in his remarks that I made special note of. 
     <lb/>
     After he had made it perfectly clear that he 
     <lb/>
     believed his motion was going to be defeated, 
    

            <cb/>
          

     which was a fair assumption I grant you, he 
     <lb/>
     nevertheless went on to state emphatically that he 
     <lb/>
     had no doubt that confederation would be on the 
     <lb/>
     ballot. Then what are we here for? What is the 
     <lb/>
     sense of this debate or the month—long debate on 
     <lb/>
     the so called terms? What does it matter then if 
     <lb/>
     this motion is defeated? Why is Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     appealing for support? Because he knows that the 
     <lb/>
     British government will take the recommenda<lb break="no"/>tions of this Convention; that it cannot afford to 
     <lb/>
     do otherwise. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     "Let the people decide" is the confederate 
     <lb/>
     slogan. Therefore they vote to put Commission 
     <lb/>
     government and responsible government on the 
     <lb/>
     referendum, but declare they themselves will 
     <lb/>
     vote for neither one nor the other. Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     as I see it, the line of least resistance in this 
     <lb/>
     Convention is taken by those who will vote to put 
     <lb/>
     everything in sight, every form of government on 
     <lb/>
     the referendum. They put the onus on the people. 
     <lb/>
     "Let the people decide", they say again and again. 
     <lb/>
     But I put it to you, Mr. Chairman, who will the 
     <lb/>
     people blame if they make the wrong choice? 
     <lb/>
     They will blame this Convention, and rightly so, 
     <lb/>
     if they make the irretrievable mistake, and I sub<lb break="no"/>mit that the only form of government put forward 
     <lb/>
     here that admits of the possibility of the people 
     <lb/>
     making an irretrievable mistake, is confederation 
     <lb/>
     with Canada on the basis submitted by the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Canada, In the other two cases, the 
     <lb/>
     other two forms, there is a second chance. But 
     <lb/>
     there is no second chance under confederation, 
     <lb/>
     no matter what specious arguments its 
     <lb/>
     proponents may offer in that regard. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Confederates argue we have no right not 
     <lb/>
     to recommend any particular form of government 
     <lb/>
     - put them all on the ballot, let the people 
     <lb/>
     decide. But they overlook the fact that this Con<lb break="no"/>vention months ago took to itself the right not to 
     <lb/>
     recommend a certain form of government which 
     <lb/>
     has far more supporters in this country than con<lb break="no"/>federation with Canada, that is union with the 
     <lb/>
     United States. It voted Mr. Jackman's resolution 
     <lb/>
     right out of the House without even making an 
     <lb/>
     attempt to investigate the whole matter or to even 
     <lb/>
     discuss it, despite the fact that the constitutional 
     <lb/>
     expert stated in answer to a question put by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Fogwill, that to send a delegation to discuss terms 
     <lb/>
     of union at Washington was within our famous 
     <lb/>
     terms of reference. And we have heard Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood, when his own resolution was being 
   

            <pb n="1419"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-27-28_Page_1419.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1419</fw>
         

     first debated, say that he would vote to send a 
     <lb/>
     delegation anywhere, to Timbuctoo if necessary. 
     <lb/>
     That was before his own resolution was carried. 
     <lb/>
     After that he sang a different tune. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In speaking to Mr. Higgins' motion, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Keough, a few days ago, went to great pains to 
     <lb/>
     rule out several forms of government which 
     <lb/>
     might be possible future forms of government for 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, on the grounds that, as far as l can 
     <lb/>
     see, they were unsuitable from his point of View. 
     <lb/>
     None of these forms had ever been discussed in 
     <lb/>
     this Convention, none of them had ever been 
     <lb/>
     given the slightest attention. One of them was 
     <lb/>
     union with the USA, and Mr. Keough' s argument 
     <lb/>
     for ruling out that form was that the issue raised 
     <lb/>
     "matters of conscience" that he was not prepared 
     <lb/>
     to raise among our people. I would like to know 
     <lb/>
     what matters of conscience union with the United 
     <lb/>
     States would raise that confederation will not 
     <lb/>
     raise. The educational and divorce problems are 
     <lb/>
     present in each case, and the only other matter of 
     <lb/>
     conscience is that of a change of flag and loyalty. 
     <lb/>
     And I would ask Mr. Keough, pursuing his own 
     <lb/>
     line of thought, how would that affect the fisher<lb break="no"/>man on the bill of Cape St. George as long as he 
     <lb/>
     gets his three square meals a day? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     No, Mr. Chairman, the argument here is that 
     <lb/>
     this Convention has discussed three forms of 
     <lb/>
     government, therefore it should recommend 
     <lb/>
     three forms, ignoring the fact that there are 
     <lb/>
     several others which can be dealt with under one 
     <lb/>
     or both of the forms discussed in Mr. Higgins' 
     <lb/>
     motion, which are forever discarded if this Con— 
     <lb/>
     vention should recommend and the people accept 
     <lb/>
     confederation on the so-called terms of Novem<lb break="no"/>ber 6, 1947. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As I said before, nowhere in the Black Books 
     <lb/>
     or the Grey Book does the Canadian government 
     <lb/>
     refer to them as "terms"; neither, I note, does Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood in his resolution, where he simply 
     <lb/>
     calls them a basis for confederation. And I submit 
     <lb/>
     that's what they are, a basis for a future sovereign 
     <lb/>
     government of Newfoundland to negotiate the 
     <lb/>
     final and satisfactory terms of union. We had a 
     <lb/>
     month's discussion on these arrangements for the 
     <lb/>
     entry of Newfoundland into confederation. 1 dis<lb break="no"/>agree most strongly with Mr. Smallwood's asser<lb break="no"/>tion that these are the only terms we could get, 
     <lb/>
     the best terms we could get. That is unmitigated 
  

            <cb/>
    

     nonsense, "trash and nonsense" to use his own 
     <lb/>
     words. I also strongly object to his statement that 
     <lb/>
     we could get out of confederation. How? Thir<lb break="no"/>teen of the United States of America tried it in 
     <lb/>
     1861 and they had a four-year civil war, and when 
     <lb/>
     it was over the 13 states were still a part of the 
     <lb/>
     federal union. We'd look nice declaring war on 
     <lb/>
     the rest of Canada if we found that confederation 
     <lb/>
     was a mistake, as it will be under the present 
     <lb/>
     circumstances. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Speaking of the United States reminds me that 
     <lb/>
     Mr, Banfield said, "Newfoundland is too small, 
     <lb/>
     too poor to stand alone. She must have somebody 
     <lb/>
     at her back." If Mr. Banfield believes that we 
     <lb/>
     should have a big country at our back, then I say 
     <lb/>
     let's have the United States at our back, either in 
     <lb/>
     economic or political union, whichever the 
     <lb/>
     people desire at the proper time under their own 
     <lb/>
     elected self-government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, I spoke for an hour and a half 
     <lb/>
     in committee of the whole during the debate on 
     <lb/>
     the proposed arrangements for the entry of New<lb break="no"/>foundland into confederation, and gave my 
     <lb/>
     reasons why I could not accept them. I do not 
     <lb/>
     intend to take up too much of the limited time 
     <lb/>
     allotted for this debate to rehash my arguments, 
     <lb/>
     or to go over the ground covered by other 
     <lb/>
     speakers, but there are a few points I wish to make 
     <lb/>
     at this time with respect to Canada and confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Confederation with Canada represents a com<lb break="no"/>plete change of the constitution of New<lb break="no"/>foundland; a complete alteration beyond 
     <lb/>
     recognition almost of the whole basic concept of 
     <lb/>
     the life and the living of our people — 450 years 
     <lb/>
     of history as a distinct unit with a separate life of 
     <lb/>
     its own. "Newfoundland... still remains <hi rendition="simple:italic">sui 
     <lb/>
     generis</hi> and an exception to the rule in the British 
     <lb/>

     is still going on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have said that confederation would mean a 
     <lb/>
     fundamental change in our national life. That 
     <lb/>
     need not be a bad thing necessarily. But it can be 
     <lb/>
     a bad thing, and will be if the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country are stampeded into such a union against 
     <lb/>
     what would be, under other circumstances, their 
     <lb/>
     better judgement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What seems to be overlooked in this whole 
     <lb/>
     affair is that to be a success and a good thing for 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, confederation must work, and 
     <lb/>
     work a whole lot more smoothly than it does in 
     <lb/>
     the Maritime Provinces, for example. For these 
     <lb/>
     provinces are part and parcel of confederation, 
     <lb/>
     they grew up with it and within it. We have 
     <lb/>
     remained aloof until now, and in the meantime 
     <lb/>
     we have labouriously built up a country, a cul<lb break="no"/>ture, traditions, faiths, hopes and, indeed, a cer<lb break="no"/>tain kind of charity and a hospitableness that is 
     <lb/>
     unique. We are as separate a race of people, with 
     <lb/>
     ideas and standards of our own, as different from 
     <lb/>
     the Canadians as the Canadians are from the 
     <lb/>
     Americans. The adjustment of our whole lives, 
     <lb/>
     and our outlook on life, government, religion, 
     <lb/>
     everything would be a tremendous and shaking 
     <lb/>
     process. We might easily never become emotion<lb break="no"/>ally, psychologically or mentally adjusted to 
     <lb/>
     living under confederation at this stage in our 
     <lb/>
     development as a separate people. and might end 
     <lb/>
     up as the last and most neurotic and hard-to-live- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     with member of the confederation family. For a 
     <lb/>
     period now of 14 years, over three ordinary par<lb break="no"/>liamentary government administrations, we have 
     <lb/>
     been without a vote or a voice in the control of 
     <lb/>
     our own affairs. To rush into confederation at this 
     <lb/>
     time would be to wake up tomorrow to find we 
  

            <cb/>
        

     had a vote and a voice —— but that the control of 
     <lb/>
     our affairs, at a time when that control could be 
     <lb/>
     used to immense advantage to ourselves, is gone 
     <lb/>
     forever to a capital 2,000 miles away where our 
     <lb/>
     faint protests would fail to reach; of if they did, 
     <lb/>
     would fall on deaf ears. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Therefore Mr. Chairman, I cannot support this 
     <lb/>
    motion, anymore than I could not support the 
     <lb/>resolution to send a delegation to Ottawa on the 
     <lb/>two occasions it was debated in this chamber. I 
     <lb/>again reassert my unshaken belief that the main 
     <lb/>decision that confronts our people is to say if they 
     <lb/>will let others govern them, as they have in the 
     <lb/>past 14 years, or if they will again govern them<lb break="no"/>selves; and that if they do decide to run their own 
     <lb/>country and control its internal and external af<lb break="no"/>fairs, then the way lies open to them at any time 
     <lb/>to enter union with any other nation to the west 
     <lb/>or east of us, on the best possible terms that can 
     <lb/>be obtained by a sovereign government with 
     <lb/>power to negotiate. </p>

<p>
   <persName ref="pers:CROS2">Mr. Crosbie</persName> Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, I 
     <lb/>wish to oppose the motion brought before the 
     <lb/>Chair, I am against this motion because, in my 
     <lb/>opinion, the terms have not been properly 
     <lb/>negotiated and have far too many loopholes for 
     <lb/>me conscientiously to support it. In fairness to the 
     <lb/>people of Newfoundland, I do not believe the 
     <lb/>motion should go on a ballot. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     We hear a great deal of talk about the size of 
     <lb/>
     our country, and about our being too small to 
     <lb/>
     stand on our own feet, I would like to call your 
     <lb/>
     attention for a few minutes to Iceland. Iceland is 
     <lb/>
     a very small country having a population of only 
     <lb/>
     120,000; yet this small country is standing on her 
     <lb/>
     own feet and since the war finished, they have 
     <lb/>
     had the British withdraw and also the Americans. 
     <lb/>
     If Iceland can stand on her own feet and make her 
     <lb/>
     own trade agreements, surely we in New<lb break="no"/>foundland can do the same, that is if we have the 
     <lb/>
     courage of our convictions and the guts to carry 
     <lb/>
     on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The greatest danger that I see to Newfound<lb break="no"/>land under the present suggested terms is to our 
     <lb/>
     fisheries —— and this, gentlemen, can be a very 
     <lb/>
     real danger. I pointed out before the exchange 
     <lb/>
     difficulties that we would run into. Mr. Ash<lb break="no"/>bourne in replying to my remarks led me to 
     <lb/>
     believe that this exchange could be available in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. Well, I see no guarantee in the terms 
     <lb/>
     before us that it would, and there certainly is not 
   

            <pb n="1421"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-27-28_Page_1421.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1421</fw>
          

     any guarantee in any remarks Mr. St. Laurent 
     <lb/>
     may have made. Mr. Ashbourne said that we got 
     <lb/>
     our exchange for our Spanish fish through Lon<lb break="no"/>don, and this is true: England purchased oranges 
     <lb/>
     through which we received our sterling ex<lb break="no"/>change. I would like to point out that it was 
     <lb/>
     England purchased the oranges, and not Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Last night I listened to Mr. Gushue's address 
     <lb/>
     and I listened very carefully and I am sure other 
     <lb/>
     members here must have done the same. If it is 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Gushue's opinion there is danger to our 
     <lb/>
     fisheries under confederation, well I, for one, 
     <lb/>
     believe what he had to say, and I will take his 
     <lb/>
     word before the word of anyone else, and certain<lb break="no"/>ly before any members of the fishery committee 
     <lb/>
     on the Ottawa delegation. There is a very great 
     <lb/>
     danger to our fisheries, there is danger that they 
     <lb/>
     might be in difficulties overnight, there is a 
     <lb/>
     danger that we will not be able to sell to the 
     <lb/>
     European markets and this, gentlemen, is a very 
     <lb/>
     serious matter for Newfoundland. In fact, gentle<lb break="no"/>men, it is so very serious that it leaves me no other 
     <lb/>
     course except to vote against confederation going 
     <lb/>
     on the ballot. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am not an anticonfederate, if the terms are 
     <lb/>
     properly negotiated and if sufficient guarantees 
     <lb/>
     are given Newfoundland to protect her against 
     <lb/>
     any upheaval that may take place. I am convinced 
     <lb/>
     that Newfoundland's necessity to export in order 
     <lb/>
     to live requires that she should have the right to 
     <lb/>
     make her own trade agreements without refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the over-riding authority and interests of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think in the first place that we should have 
     <lb/>
     an agreement with Canada to whom we export 
     <lb/>
     six times as much as she buys from us. I do 
     <lb/>
     believe that a means may be worked out for a 
     <lb/>
     closer relationship with Canada short of federal 
     <lb/>
     union, which would be good for both countries; 
     <lb/>
     but on the question of political union, I am from 
     <lb/>
     Missouri. Canada has not been too liberal with us 
     <lb/>
     in the past. I have yet to be convinced that she can 
     <lb/>
     do more for us that we can do for ourselves. I have 
     <lb/>
     the friendliest sentiments towards Canada and 
     <lb/>
     Canadians, but it would take a good deal to 
     <lb/>
     convince me from my study of the situation that 
     <lb/>
     a federal union would not be the worst decision 
     <lb/>
    that Newfoundland could make. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCO4">Mr. McCormack</persName> I do not propose to take up 
     <lb/>
     much of the short time at our disposal, but in 
     <lb/>
     rising to record my stand on this motion, I wish 
 

            <cb/>
      

     to say that in not supporting it, I am not anticon<lb break="no"/>federate, but rather one who has Newfoundland's 
     <lb/>
     best interests at heart. An issue of such impor<lb break="no"/>tance needs to be examined from every angle and 
     <lb/>
     in every aspect, so that we will know the disad<lb break="no"/>vantages as well as the advantages. I hold that 
     <lb/>
     even after 18 months and being free of the respon<lb break="no"/>sibilities of affairs of state, we still do not know 
     <lb/>
     all the answers. I am of the opinion that we can 
     <lb/>
     unite in many ways with Canada without sur<lb break="no"/>rendering our political sovereignty. We can form 
     <lb/>
     associations and share problems to our mutual 
     <lb/>
     advantage. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would remind you that social services and 
     <lb/>
     other benefits are not the basis of our country's 
     <lb/>
     prosperity; rather our productive economy and 
     <lb/>
     markets and at the present time, in particular, 
     <lb/>
     general world conditions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To those who vilify responsible government 
     <lb/>
     and talk of the graft and dirty politics we would 
     <lb/>
     have, I would say that under confederation we 
     <lb/>
     would have a federal responsible government and 
     <lb/>
     also a provincial responsible government with 
     <lb/>
     twice the opportunity for such dirty politics. If the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian confederation is such a happy family, 
     <lb/>
     why are so many of the provincial governments, 
     <lb/>
     particularly the Maritime Provinces, continually 
     <lb/>
     up against the federal government? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In any event the chief consideration in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, and one which has not been very clearly 
     <lb/>
     presented, is our position re trade, and we would 
     <lb/>
     do well to ask ourselves whether or not our inter<lb break="no"/>ests would be subordinated to those of central 
     <lb/>
     Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Gentlemen, most people will admit that the 
     <lb/>
     federal government must collect more from the 
     <lb/>
     provinces than it gives them, otherwise it could 
     <lb/>
     not continue its services. We are not naive 
     <lb/>
     enough to think that Canada is going to give us 
     <lb/>
     something for nothing, and we can be prepared 
     <lb/>
     to pay additional taxation if we are to receive 
     <lb/>
     additional benefits or services. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, having these ideas and feeling 
     <lb/>
     that the people do not know enough about the 
     <lb/>
     difficult aspects of confederation, I do not see that 
     <lb/>
     I could conscientiously put them in the position 
     <lb/>
     where they might unwittingly vote this country 
     <lb/>
     into a union which, despite Mr. Smallwood's 
     <lb/>
     statements, would be irrevocable. Some 
     <lb/>
     delegates claim we are failing in our duty to the 
     <lb/>
     people if we do not give them the opportunity to 
   

            <pb n="1422"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-27-28_Page_1422.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1422</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
         

     vote on confederation. In my opinion we are, by 
     <lb/>
     our terms of reference, and after our discussions, 
     <lb/>
     to make recommendations on suitable forms of 
     <lb/>
     government to be placed before the people at the 
     <lb/>
     referendum. How can we conscientiously recom<lb break="no"/>mend a form of government to go on the ballot 
     <lb/>
     paper when we are not fully informed as to how 
     <lb/>
     it will affect our people? I cannot but vote against 
     <lb/>
     the motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Chairman, before I resume my seat I wish 
     <lb/>
    to unite with other speakers in recording my 
     <lb/>sincere appreciation of the able and impartial 
     <lb/>manner in which you have conducted proceed<lb break="no"/>ings since you assumed your position as chair<lb break="no"/>man. I would also take this opportunity of 
     <lb/>thanking all delegates, particularly my friend Mr. 
     <lb/>Vardy, for the big hand you gave, during my 
     <lb/>absence, on the occasion of my recent marriage. 
     <lb/>I assure you that both Mrs. MacCormack and I 
     <lb/>are deeply appreciative of your good wishes. I 
     <lb/>thank you. 
     <lb/>
            </p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:WATT1">Mr. Watton</persName> Mr. Chairman, I wish to address 
     <lb/>myself very briefly to the resolution now before 
     <lb/>us, namely that confederation be submitted to the 
     <lb/>people in the forthcoming referendum. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     Within the next few days this Convention will 
     <lb/>
     come to an end, and in spite of its shortcomings, 
     <lb/>
     I feel that it has done a lot of good and has 
     <lb/>
     justified its existence, if for no other reason than 
     <lb/>
     that it has aroused the people out of a sleep that 
     <lb/>
     has lasted for 14 years. Throughout the life of this 
     <lb/>
     Convention I have tried to be as fair as I possible 
     <lb/>
     could. I have not tried to hide or deprive the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country from obtaining any infor<lb break="no"/>mation that this Convention has been able to give, 
     <lb/>
     in spite of the fact that it has been stated here that 
     <lb/>
     those who do not favour submitting confedera<lb break="no"/>tion to the people are trying to deprive the people 
     <lb/>
     of something that is rightfully theirs. I plead not 
     <lb/>
     guilty to that charge. I am not going to vote in 
     <lb/>
     favour of this motion under the present cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances. I shall try as best I can to give 
     <lb/>
     reasons why I make that statement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Our terms of reference provide that we shall 
     <lb/>
     examine and discuss among ourselves the chan<lb break="no"/>ges that have taken place in our economy and 
     <lb/>
     recommend forms of government as a result of 
     <lb/>
     our findings. It did not specify or even suggest 
     <lb/>
     that we should examine or discuss the economic 
     <lb/>
     or financial position of any other country. We 
     <lb/>
     were not empowered to do any such thing. Proof 
   

            <cb/>
         

     of that was supplied as a result of a conference 
     <lb/>
     held between the Commission of Government 
     <lb/>
     and a delegation of this Convention. It was 
     <lb/>
     pointed out that this Convention had no power to 
     <lb/>
     discuss or negotiate (I think that is the word used) 
     <lb/>
     with the USA or Canada on economic, financial 
     <lb/>
     or political questions. We were politely told that 
     <lb/>
     such negotiations were none of our business, and 
     <lb/>
     that it was a job to be dealt with strictly between 
     <lb/>
     governments. In spite of that, it was still main<lb break="no"/>tained that we should send a delegation to Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     to ascertain terms of federal union, with absolute<lb break="no"/>ly no power to dispute or question any proposals 
     <lb/>
     that might be put forward by the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government. Mr. Chairman, what a position for 
     <lb/>
     an independent and free people to be placed in! 
     <lb/>
     And we are expected by the advocates of con<lb break="no"/>federation to place before the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country a situation such as that! No matter what 
     <lb/>
     we find in those terms which we do not under<lb break="no"/>stand, or any points on which we are clear, we are 
     <lb/>
     still urged to recommend it as being a form of 
     <lb/>
     government, without being able to question or 
     <lb/>
     dispute any of these things. To my mind, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, the situation, to say the least, is 
     <lb/>
     ridiculous. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As a body of ordinary Newfoundlanders, I 
     <lb/>
     maintain that a pretty good job has been done as 
     <lb/>
     far as investigating our position as a country. I 
     <lb/>
     think that the reports tabled in this Convention 
     <lb/>
     point to that fact. We know probably as much 
     <lb/>
     about the country as a newly-elected government 
     <lb/>
     would know, with only 16 months of experience. 
     <lb/>
     We send a delegation to Ottawa to get the terms. 
     <lb/>
     What position are they in? The Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment gives them what? Precious little. They did 
     <lb/>
     not even give them the terms to bring back, in 
     <lb/>
     spite of all their knowledge of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     Even if they had been given the terms, what could 
     <lb/>
     they have done? Absolutely nothing. They could 
     <lb/>
     read them, that was all. Any clause in those terms 
     <lb/>
     which they thought could be improved upon, or 
     <lb/>
     which they thought could be made more fair or 
     <lb/>
     equitable, they could do nothing about it; and 
     <lb/>
     worst of all, this whole Convention could do 
     <lb/>
     nothing about it. But Mr. Chairman, if they had 
     <lb/>
     the power to do something about it, how different 
     <lb/>
     the situation would be. I would have had no 
     <lb/>
     hesitation in recommending it. Even if we had 
     <lb/>
     that power to negotiate or bargain, and had used 
     <lb/>
     it without being able to alter any of these terms, 


            <pb n="1423"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-27-28_Page_1423.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1423</fw>
         

     I would still support its recommendation and let 
     <lb/>
     the people decide. But because we do not know 
     <lb/>
     that, and because we have not been able to get 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory information on questions that have 
     <lb/>
     been asked, I cannot support it. I am convinced 
     <lb/>
     that it can be done by consultation between an 
     <lb/>
     elected government of Newfoundland and the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada. As Mr. Higgins pointed 
     <lb/>
     out, there are possibilities for good in these 
     <lb/>
     proposals and they are a good basis for negotia<lb break="no"/>tion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Another thing that the people need more en<lb break="no"/>lightenment on is how we are going to fare as a 
     <lb/>
     province. By that I mean, how is the provincial 
     <lb/>
     government going to raise sufficient revenue to 
     <lb/>
     take care of provincial matters such as public 
     <lb/>
     health and welfare, education and so on? We have 
     <lb/>
     had a so-called budget presented to us, a provin<lb break="no"/>cial budget that would apply to this country if and 
     <lb/>
     when we became a province; not a budget cover<lb break="no"/>ing one or two years, but for a period of eight long 
     <lb/>
     years, during which time anything may happen, 
     <lb/>
     from a war to a world depression. Incidentally, 
     <lb/>
     the author of this budget prophesied only a few 
     <lb/>
     days ago that we were going to have a depression 
     <lb/>
     and have it very soon. To my mind, it is a budget 
     <lb/>
     based on anything but sound, solid facts. In fact, 
     <lb/>
     it is based in some part, if not for the most part, 
     <lb/>
     on supposition. For instance on how our $28 
     <lb/>
     million surplus will be handled, $16 million of 
     <lb/>
     which is out of our reach and will remain so for 
     <lb/>
     some years to come. The supposition is that some 
     <lb/>
     means may be found to get that $16 million back 
     <lb/>
     in dollars, whereas now it is in sterling. Are we 
     <lb/>
     going to base our recommendations on supposi<lb break="no"/>tions such as that? Without knowing for sure 
     <lb/>
     whether it can be done or not? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Again, this budget says that we shall need $15 
     <lb/>
     million to cover ordinary expenditure as a 
     <lb/>
     province. Others in this Convention contend that 
     <lb/>
     it will take around $18 million, and these conten<lb break="no"/>tions have been based, to my mind, on sound 
     <lb/>
     reasoning. Who is correct? More than that, how 
     <lb/>
     are these monies to be raised, and in the raising 
     <lb/>
     of it, how is it going to affect the ordinary New<lb break="no"/>foundlander, the fisherman, the logger and the 
     <lb/>
     miner? These questions and many others have not 
     <lb/>
     been answered to the satisfaction of thousands of 
     <lb/>
     our people. Again, Mr. Chairman. how are our 
     <lb/>
     fishermen going to be affected by confederation? 
     <lb/>
     Are they going to be affected adversely or other<lb break="no"/>
       

            <cb/>
       
wise? What is going to happen to our very effi<lb break="no"/>cient Fisheries Board, our system of inspection 
     <lb/>
     which has done a tremendous amount of good, 
     <lb/>
     our system of marketing? And also, how will our 
     <lb/>
     markets be affected? Every fisherman in this 
     <lb/>
     country wants to know that. Do they know it? 
     <lb/>
     They most certainly do not, and until they do, I 
     <lb/>
     cannot see how we can justify ourselves in 
     <lb/>
     recommending confederation as a form of 
     <lb/>
     government. Some of these questions have been 
     <lb/>
     answered, after a fashion, by Mr. Smallwood; but 
     <lb/>
     I am not prepared — neither are thousands of 
     <lb/>
     people in this country prepared — to accept these 
     <lb/>
     answers at the last word. Our people deserve the 
     <lb/>
     best, and the best is none too good for them. 
     <lb/>
     Confederation may be the best, but do we know 
     <lb/>
     that it is the best? I am quite sure that the majority 
     <lb/>
     of them do not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am a young Newfoundlander, Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     and will in all probability spend the rest of my 
     <lb/>
     days here. I do not want to be a party to recom<lb break="no"/>mending something to the people of this country 
     <lb/>
     which they might regret for the rest of their days. 
     <lb/>
     In my opinion, government means a great deal to 
     <lb/>
     a people. It has been pointed out here that as long 
     <lb/>
     as people have three square meals a day, a decent 
     <lb/>
     suit and a tight roof. they do not worry who runs 
     <lb/>
     the government. Personally, I cannot subscribe to 
     <lb/>
     that. What about our educational system? Our 
     <lb/>
     social services? And many other things that are 
     <lb/>
     equally important as food, clothing and shelter. 
     <lb/>
     Would I, as a Newfoundlander, be satisfied, as 
     <lb/>
     long as I had enough to eat, enough to wear and 
     <lb/>
     good shelter, to see Adolph Hitler as the head of 
     <lb/>
     our affairs? I hardly think so. Again, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, I want to say that I do not want to deprive 
     <lb/>
     the people of anything that may affect them for 
     <lb/>
     good. But in view of all the circumstances, as I 
     <lb/>
     see them, I cannot in all sincerity support this 
     <lb/>
     motion of Mr. Smallwood's. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Our days in this Convention are numbered. 
     <lb/>
     We have learned a lot since we came here. I hope 
     <lb/>
     that what we have learned will stand as in good 
     <lb/>
     stead in the future and will be of some help to our 
     <lb/>
     people. Now, Mr. Chairman, like others before 
     <lb/>
     me, I wish to express a feeling of gratitude to you 
     <lb/>
     for the way in which you have helped us since 
     <lb/>
     you occupied the Chair. You have kept us in order 
     <lb/>
     very impartially and I am sure we shall be forever 
     <lb/>
     grateful to you for the way in which you have 
     <lb/>
     conducted the affairs of this Convention. 
     <lb/>
