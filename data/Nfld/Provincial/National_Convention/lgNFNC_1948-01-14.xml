            <p>I move that immediately before the order of

     <lb/>the motion, that the Convention resolve itself 
     <lb/>into a committee of the whole to further 
     <lb/>consider and discuss the proposals received 
     <lb/>on November 6 from the Right Honourable

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Higgins, while I am not 
     <lb/>rejecting the motion, my feeling is that, being a 
     <lb/>closure motion, it should be deferred; that is to 
     <lb/>say, that I should defer receiving and putting the 
     <lb/>motion at the present time. As you, Mr. Higgins, 
     <lb/>particularly, and perhaps members generally will 
     <lb/>be aware, there is not, nor has there ever been, 
     <lb/>strangely enough, any statute covering closure in 
     <lb/>Newfoundland. Now, standing order 54 reads as 
     <lb/>follows: "Whenever any matter arises in the 
     <lb/>course of the proceedings of the Convention ... 
     <lb/>which, in the opinion of the Chairman, is not 
     <lb/>covered by these Standing Orders, reference shall 
     <lb/>be made to the rules and orders of the House of 
     <lb/>Assembly in Newfoundland, and the matter 
     <lb/>decided in accordance with these rules, save that 
     <lb/>where the said rules are silent upon the matter the

     question shall be decided in accordance with the 
     <lb/>
     rules of British parliamentary practice." Our 
     <lb/>
     rules, as you are quite aware, Mr. Higgins, are 
     <lb/>
     silent on that point ... and an examination of the 
     <lb/>
     rules of the House of Assembly would reveal a 
     <lb/>
     like defect. There is nothing to be found in these 
     <lb/>
     rules covering closure motions, and therefore, 
     <lb/>
     under the concluding portion of standing order 54 
     <lb/>
     I am forced to decide the matter in the light of 
     <lb/>
     British parliamentary practice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On that point I would direct your attention to 
     <lb/>
     Sir Erskine May, pages 450-51, in which he 
     <lb/>
     points out that the Chair should intervene in a 
     <lb/>
     closure motion where it is felt that it is an abuse 
     <lb/>
     of the rules of the house or infringes on the rights 
     <lb/>
     of the minority, and in the discharge of this duty 
     <lb/>
     the discretion of the Chair is absolute, and is not 
     <lb/>
     open to dispute. There is no appeal to the House 
     <lb/>
     on that point. As you are fully aware, it is purely 
     <lb/>
     a guillotine or knifing-off procedure, which is 
     <lb/>
     calculated to knife off and shut off debate when 
     <lb/>
     put and carried. Now, I should direct your atten<lb break="no"/>tion to the fact that I got notice of this motion on 
     <lb/>
     Friday afternoon. Of course, Saturday and Sun<lb break="no"/>day we were not sitting, and it therefore meant 
     <lb/>
     that I received notion of it two clear days ago. In 
     <lb/>
     further view of the fact that my attention has been 
     <lb/>
     drawn to the desire of some members to speak, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins, on this business, who have been 
     <lb/>
     prevented by illness and transportation and other 
     <lb/>
     defects from attending, and who therefore have 
     <lb/>
     not had an opportunity of addressing themselves 
     <lb/>
     on the business in question, I feel that a closure 
     <lb/>
     motion ought not to be put at this time... There 
     <lb/>
     must come a time when the responsibility for 
     <lb/>
     accepting this motion will rest with the House ... 
     <lb/>
     my tentative opinion is that I will in all prob<lb break="no"/>ability put the motion at the beginning of Friday 
     <lb/>
     afternoon's session.<ref target="#fn_01">[1]</ref> That would leave members 
    

            <cb/>
        

     the opportunity of speaking this afternoon, this 
     <lb/>
     evening if we sit, tomorrow afternoon and tomor<lb break="no"/>row evening. Beyond that I am not prepared to 
     <lb/>
     go ... I want to inform members now that it is my 
     <lb/>
     intention at the moment to put this closure motion 
     <lb/>
     to the House at the resumption of business at 3 
     <lb/>
     o'clock on Friday, and I would ask members to 
     <lb/>
     take due notice and govern themselves accord<lb break="no"/>ingly. So if you don't mind, Mr. Higgins ... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I don't mind, sir. It is not my inten<lb break="no"/>tion to close off the debate today, but it would be 
     <lb/>
     fair to ask you if the members speaking after Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood would conclude before Friday, and 
     <lb/>
     then you would be prepared to put it at that time. 
     <lb/>
   </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Oh, quite definitely. You will 
     <lb/>recall that I assured Mr. Smallwood that he would 
     <lb/>be given the opportunity of replying once before 
     <lb/>the debate on the business terminated. Mr. 
     <lb/>Smallwood is now availing himself of that right. 
     <lb/>In addition to that there are other members who 
     <lb/>have not spoken, and I feel that a reasonable time 
     <lb/>should be given after the motion reaches me. As 
     <lb/>far as I know it is the desire of this Convention to 
     <lb/>complete its work by the 31st of this month ... and 
     <lb/>if we are to deal with the rest of the business on 
     <lb/>the order paper it follows that a decent interval 
     <lb/>between the debate now before the Chair and the 
     <lb/>3lst of the month must necessarily be preserved; 
     <lb/>therefore the proposal of a closure motion at this 
     <lb/>time is not improper, in fact it is quite proper. The 
     <lb/>only thing we have to make sure of is that it is not 
     <lb/>jumped on any members that may be absent. The 
     <lb/>motion is quite fair, and I think the house will 
     <lb/>agree that in deferring it until Friday members are 
     <lb/>quite well informed in this respect and it cannot 
     <lb/>be argued that they had no opportunity. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     Now, out of that total left to the provincial 
     <lb/>
     government it is very probable that between 40 
     <lb/>
     and 50 would no longer be needed, but they 
     <lb/>
     would have the first chance in the new federal 
     <lb/>
     offices that would have to open in New<lb break="no"/>foundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     While we are at it, it would be interesting to 
     <lb/>
     see just how many persons are employed by our 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland government today, both as civil 
     <lb/>
     servants and otherwise. In the civil service we 
     <lb/>
     have 4,615, in the Railway system we have 3,700, 
     <lb/>
     in civil aviation we have 1,300, and of teachers 
     <lb/>
     we have 2,200, giving us a grand total employed 
     <lb/>
     by the Newfoundland government today of 
     <lb/>
     11,815 persons, nearly 12,000 persons al<lb break="no"/>together. That is now. What would the position 
     <lb/>
     be under confederation? The federal government 
     <lb/>
     would take over 1,947 civil servants, 3,700 rail<lb break="no"/>roaders and coastal boat men, and 1,304 for civil 
     <lb/>
     aviation, a total of nearly 7,000, which would 
     <lb/>
     leave a total of 4,864 still to be paid by the 
     <lb/>
     provincial government The total number to be 
     <lb/>
     employed or paid by the provincial government 
     <lb/>
     will thus fall from nearly 12,000 down to just 
     <lb/>
     under 5,000, the rest of them, of course, becom<lb break="no"/>ing employees of the federal government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I noticed that Major Cashin came back again 
     <lb/>
     to this question of what constitutes revenue for a 
     <lb/>
     government. It was in connection with my es<lb break="no"/>timates of what the provincial government would 
     <lb/>
     spend and collect. I included in that estimate 
     <lb/>
     interest and repayment of principal on loans ad<lb break="no"/>vanced to the Housing Corporation as revenue for 
  

            <cb/>
         

     the provincial government. He says it is not 
     <lb/>
     revenue. I say that every cent and every dollar the 
     <lb/>
     government receives is revenue ... and every cent 
     <lb/>
     of it has to go into the Consolidated Revenue 
     <lb/>
     Fund, to be shown as revenue. Within the Fund 
     <lb/>
     it can be sub-divided into various groupings, but 
     <lb/>
     it has to appear in the Fund as revenue I will tell 
     <lb/>
     you how far the United States government goes 
     <lb/>
     in this matter. If they lend money to another 
     <lb/>
     country then that entire amount goes into that 
     <lb/>
     year's account as expenditure, and if they receive 
     <lb/>
     back any interest or any of the principal then that 
     <lb/>
     goes in there as revenue. It is not a matter of 
     <lb/>
     quoting what Webster says about the meaning of 
     <lb/>
     "revenue", it is a matter of knowing what is the 
     <lb/>
     actual practice of governments such as the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom, Canada and the United States. I have 
     <lb/>
     followed their practice and I have done right. The 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government did the same thing, 
     <lb/>
     and I for one would rather follow the practice of 
     <lb/>
     the Commission government in a matter like this 
     <lb/>
     than all the finance ministers we had put together 
     <lb/>
     in the days of responsible government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Major Cashin says that confederation would 
     <lb/>
     mean the end of the clause in the Labrador Min<lb break="no"/>ing Company agreement with Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     which requires the company to employ New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders. That clause will go, he says, and 
     <lb/>
     French Canadians will take the jobs from our 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders. There is not one word of truth 
     <lb/>
     in that statement. The agreement made with the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador Mining Company will stand, and every 
     <lb/>
     clause in it will stand. Confederation won't 
     <lb/>
     change it at all. It is true that under confederation 
     <lb/>
     French Canadians or any other Canadians may 
     <lb/>
     enter Labrador, but getting work with the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador Mining Company is a horse of another 
     <lb/>
     colour. There is nothing at all under confedera<lb break="no"/>tion to stop any provincial government from 
     <lb/>
     making such an agreement with a company, as 
     <lb/>
     our government has made with this Labrador 
     <lb/>
     Mining and Exploration Company. If the Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia government, for example, makes an agree<lb break="no"/>ment tomorrow with some company giving that 
     <lb/>
     company special concessions, or any conces<lb break="no"/>sions, the Nova Scotia government can insert a 
     <lb/>
     clause in the agreement stating that nobody but 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotians may be employed by that com<lb break="no"/>pany. They have a perfect right to do it. Any 
     <lb/>
     government or any province can do that if it cares 
     <lb/>
     to do it. This argument is nothing but a political

     dodge, a red herring, something put out to try and 
     <lb/>
     turn people from confederation. I think, sir, 
     <lb/>
     speaking to that point, a reply was received from 
     <lb/>
     our own government here by one of our own 
     <lb/>
     members who addressed a question as to what 
     <lb/>
     would happen to that clause, and our own govern<lb break="no"/>ment has replied that that clause would stand. I 
     <lb/>
     am right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Major Cashin referred to the government 
     <lb/>
    Savings Bank, who would own it under con<lb break="no"/>federation, what will the interest rate be and who 
     <lb/>will control it? Well, sir, who owns and controls 
     <lb/>it now? Who sets the interest rate now? The 
     <lb/>Government of Newfoundland. And they will go 
     <lb/>right on owning and controlling it, and setting the 
     <lb/>interest rates payable. Confederation will make 
     <lb/>no difference whatsoever to the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>Savings Bank, so the depositors don't need to pay 
     <lb/>any attention whatever to Major Cashin's advice 
     <lb/>to withdraw their money from it. Once before 
     <lb/>Major Cashin talked about the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>Savings Bank, and the governors of the bank had 
     <lb/>to come out with a denial to prevent a rush on it.

     <lb/>not need to fear confederation. It will not affect 
     <lb/>the Newfoundland Savings Bank whatsoever. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     Now Major Cashin, in referring to Canada's 
     <lb/>
     great old age pension scheme, and her pensions 
     <lb/>
     to the blind, says, in the first place, that the old 
     <lb/>
     age pensions are paid only to paupers, and second 
     <lb/>
     that before they can get the pension they must 
     <lb/>
     turn their property over to the government. Well, 
     <lb/>
     he is completely wrong on both points. The old 
     <lb/>
     age pension is not given only to paupers, but it is 
     <lb/>
     provided that a person may have his own private 
     <lb/>
     income of $240 a year, and still get the full 
     <lb/>
     pension of $30 a month, or $360 a year. A married 
     <lb/>
     couple can have a private income of $360 a year 
     <lb/>
     between them and still get the full pension of 
     <lb/>
     $720 a year between them, and even if a person 
     <lb/>
     has more than $240 a year of private income he 
     <lb/>
     can still get the pension. If he has $10 a year more 
     <lb/>
     than the $240 allowed, it only means taking the 
     <lb/>
     $10 off the amount of the pension. He is allowed 
     <lb/>
     a total of $600 a year altogether, putting the 
     <lb/>
     pension and his private income together.... As for 
     <lb/>
     having to turn their property over to the govern<lb break="no"/>ment before getting the old age pension, that 


            <cb/>
          

     simply is not true. Let me see if I can make this 
     <lb/>
     matter very simple, so that everyone in New<lb break="no"/>foundland will understand. Let us suppose some 
     <lb/>
     old age pensioner dies, leaving his widow behind 
     <lb/>
     (I mean under confederation), and he has a little 
     <lb/>
     property. The property falls to this widow, and 
     <lb/>
     she goes on getting her old age pension of $30 a 
     <lb/>
     month as long as she lives. Then she dies. What 
     <lb/>
     happens to the property then? It can be left to 
     <lb/>
     anyone in the family or out of the family, anyone 
     <lb/>
     the pensioner wishes to leave it to, if the property 
     <lb/>
     is worth $2,000 or less. And remember this: the 
     <lb/>
     value is not what that property would be worth in 
     <lb/>
     St. John's, or Grand Falls, or Corner Brook, but 
     <lb/>
     right in the settlement where it is. That means that 
     <lb/>
     nine properties out of ten would fetch less than 
     <lb/>
     $2,000 cash. Maybe one out of ten might fetch 
     <lb/>
     over $2,000 cash. If the property is worth over 
     <lb/>
     $2,000, what happens to it when the pensioner 
     <lb/>
     dies? Well, if some relative or anybody else has 
     <lb/>
     contributed regularly to the pensioner's support 
     <lb/>
     the property can fall to him or her, and he would 
     <lb/>
     have a good right to it, or she would. It may be a 
     <lb/>
     grandson, son or nephew, or anyone else, who 
     <lb/>
     had contributed to the support of the pensioner 
     <lb/>
     for the last three years of the pensioner's life. But 
     <lb/>
     suppose that nobody has helped out the older 
     <lb/>
     person for those three years, and suppose it is 
     <lb/>
     worth over $2,000 net in that settlement, what 
     <lb/>
     happens then? The government steps in and gets 
     <lb/>
     back what it had paid out in pension before the 
     <lb/>
     pensioner's death. So if a man has an old father 
     <lb/>
     and mother getting $30 a month each in old age 
     <lb/>
     pension, and if the old people have property 
     <lb/>
     which would fetch over $2,000 cash in that set<lb break="no"/>tlement if sold, and he wants to come in for the 
     <lb/>
     property he knows what to do. All he has to do is 
     <lb/>
     to contribute regularly and reasonably towards 
     <lb/>
     the support of his old father and mother, and then 
     <lb/>
     if the property is worth over $2,000 it will fall to 
     <lb/>
     him, and as I said, if the property is worth $2,000 
     <lb/>
     or less then the pensioner can leave it to anyone 
     <lb/>
     he likes, though of course under the law he must 
     <lb/>
     leave it to his widow if she is a pensioner as well, 
     <lb/>
     and as every member in this Convention knows 
     <lb/>
     just as well as I do, it's got to be a pretty good 
     <lb/>
     property in most parts of this country to be worth 
     <lb/>
     over $2,000 net. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Major Cashin does not think very much 
     <lb/>
     of experts. These Canadian government es<lb break="no"/>timates of what they would collect from us in 
  

            <pb n="1161" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-14_Page_1161.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw>  <fw type="num">1161</fw>
        

     taxes, and what they would spend in New<lb break="no"/>foundland, were made up by the financial and 
     <lb/>
     commercial experts of that government. Now I 
     <lb/>
     wonder if Major Cashin's contempt for experts is 
     <lb/>
     as real as he makes out? What is a doctor, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, but an expert in the diseases of the 
     <lb/>
     body and how to cure them? What is a lawyer but 
     <lb/>
     an expert in the law? Do we despise these legal 
     <lb/>
     experts, or do we go running to them when we 
     <lb/>
     get in trouble? We are very glad to take their 
     <lb/>
     advice, and to pay them for it too, as no doubt you 
     <lb/>
     have found out, sir, in the past few years. What is 
     <lb/>
     a musician but an expert in music, and a motor 
     <lb/>
     mechanic and an aeroplane pilot, experts in those 
     <lb/>
     fields of human endeavour; can't there be experts 
     <lb/>
     in the field of public finance and trade and com<lb break="no"/>merce? Major Cashin called Mr. Gordon Howell 
     <lb/>
     an expert in customs matters here in this country, 
     <lb/>
     and Mr. George Allan an expert in income tax 
     <lb/>
     matters. Is there anything strange in the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada having experts to assist them? 
     <lb/>
     Their Department of Finance is a great depart<lb break="no"/>ment of government, and as a matter of fact the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada is extremely lucky in the 
     <lb/>
     calibre of their experts, and it was those men who 
     <lb/>
     made these estimates of what the government 
     <lb/>
     would spend and collect should we become a 
     <lb/>
     province. These are the men who make up 
     <lb/>
     Canada's own budgets, and if we think that's a 
     <lb/>
     job that any slouch can do, then we had better 
     <lb/>
     think again. They have to know exactly what they 
     <lb/>
     are talking about, just as Mr. Walter Marshall in 
     <lb/>
     our own Finance Department has to know what 
     <lb/>
     he is talking about, and Mr. Herbert Russell has 
     <lb/>
     to know what he is talking about before he can 
     <lb/>
     run our Railway. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     ....What is the good of special training if there 
     <lb/>
     is no such thing as experts? There are experts, and 
     <lb/>
     it was experts who compiled these estimates. 
     <lb/>
     Some of them are experts in our Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     trade, because it's been their business to study it, 
     <lb/>
     and know it inside out. Hundreds of millions of 
     <lb/>
     dollars of our trade has passed through their 
     <lb/>
     hands in Ottawa in the past few years through 
     <lb/>
     allocations and quotas and the like, and on top of 
     <lb/>
     that Canada has stationed here a trade commis<lb break="no"/>sioner in the person of Mr. Britton to study our 
     <lb/>
     trade and see what we import, and how our trade 
     <lb/>
     is conducted. It is his job to do that, just as it is 
     <lb/>
     the jobs of dozens of other Canadian trade com<lb break="no"/>missioners scattered around the world. Do you 
   

            <cb/>
         

     know, Mr. Chairman, that these Canadian trade 
     <lb/>
     commissioners are obliged to visit the very fac<lb break="no"/>tories and plants in Canada where they produce 
     <lb/>
     the goods that are sold in the countries where 
     <lb/>
     these commissioners are stationed? They have to 
     <lb/>
     secure samples of the products of Canada's com<lb break="no"/>petitors sold in the countries they are stationed, 
     <lb/>
     together with prices and similar trade informa<lb break="no"/>tion, and keep sending that type of information 
     <lb/>
     regularly back to the Department of Trade and 
     <lb/>
     Commerce. I spent many hours in the Department 
     <lb/>
     of Trade and Commerce in Ottawa, and I happen 
     <lb/>
     to know that it is one of the finest organisations 
     <lb/>
     of its kind in this world today. They know our 
     <lb/>
     trade inside out, and they were at the elbows of 
     <lb/>
     the financial experts when those experts were 
     <lb/>
     making up the Canadian government's estimates 
     <lb/>
     of what revenue they would collect here in New<lb break="no"/>foundland should we become a province. There 
     <lb/>
     are about 6,000 men and women in that great 
     <lb/>
     department, and amongst them all you will find 
     <lb/>
     specialists and experts with very intimate 
     <lb/>
     knowledge of every country in the world with 
     <lb/>
     whom Canada trades; and you will find men 
     <lb/>
     whose specialty is the trade of our own New<lb break="no"/>foundland. I hope we will hear no more of this 
     <lb/>
     contemptuous talk of experts, this attempt to 
     <lb/>
     sneer at them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Major Cashin told us that the Bank of Canada 
     <lb/>
     had this very month withdrawn its support price 
     <lb/>
     for long-term bonds. I do not know just what we 
     <lb/>
     were supposed to infer from this simple fact, but 
     <lb/>
     I suppose it was intended to make us think that 
     <lb/>
     there was something wrong with the value of the 
     <lb/>
     bonds. What Major Cashin failed to tell us was 
     <lb/>
     that the Bank of Canada's action was taken ex<lb break="no"/>actly ten days after the United States Treasury 
     <lb/>
     had done exactly the same thing with regard to 
     <lb/>
     United States bonds. In both countries it was 
     <lb/>
     official government policy, and it was part of the 
     <lb/>
     mutual American-Canadian policy of anti-infla<lb break="no"/>tionary measures. And what Major Cashin did not 
     <lb/>
     tell us is that a few days afterwards the Bank of 
     <lb/>
     Canada resumed its support-price policy. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, a lot of statements can he made that 
     <lb/>
     sound bad, that sound as though there was some<lb break="no"/>thing wrong, but which are capable of a perfectly 
     <lb/>
     reasonable explanation. Truly, a little knowledge 
     <lb/>
     is a dangerous thing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I was greatly interested when Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     tried to make our blood run cold with his talk 


            <pb n="1162" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-14_Page_1162.jpg"/>

     about the terrible taxes they have in Canada ... 
     <lb/>
     federal taxes, provincial taxes and municipal 
     <lb/>
     taxes, income and corporation taxes, and estate, 
     <lb/>
     customs and excise taxes, amusement and liquor 
     <lb/>
     taxes, until he was almost out of breath reeling 
     <lb/>
     off the list. By the time he had finished he almost 
     <lb/>
     had us in tears for the poor, poverty-stricken 
     <lb/>
     Canadians, crushed beneath that awful burden. 
     <lb/>
     We wondered how the Canadians manage to 
     <lb/>
     breathe, let alone live. The one thing we simply 
     <lb/>
     could not understand is how Canada managed to 
     <lb/>
     exist at all during the five years of war, for if they 
     <lb/>
     have this awful burden of taxation today, what 
     <lb/>
     must they have had during the war, because since 
     <lb/>
     the war ended three different reductions have 
     <lb/>
     been made in Canada's taxes. The only trouble 
     <lb/>
     with Major Cashin's list is that by changing the 
     <lb/>
     names of some of them it is our own New<lb break="no"/>foundland we would have thought he was talking 
     <lb/>
     about, for here in Newfoundland we have income 
     <lb/>
     taxes, bank taxes, excise taxes, mining taxes, 
     <lb/>
     lumber taxes, stumpage taxes, motor taxes, 
     <lb/>
     drivers' taxes, restaurant taxes, hospital taxes, 
     <lb/>
     harbour taxes, radio taxes, death taxes, accident 
     <lb/>
     insurance taxes, game license taxes, waterpower 
     <lb/>
     taxes, insurance agents' taxes, dog taxes, mining 
     <lb/>
     prospectors' taxes, boiler inspection taxes. We 
     <lb/>
     have our beautiful, our artistic, our delightful 
     <lb/>
     customs taxes which grab more out of us than all 
     <lb/>
     those other taxes put together. Mr. Chairman, let 
     <lb/>
     us not allow our common sense to become 
     <lb/>
     paralysed just by the mere mention of the word 
     <lb/>
     taxes. Let us keep our feet on the ground. There 
     <lb/>
     are taxes that fall heavily on the poorest of the 
     <lb/>
     poor, and taxes that fall lightly on the richest of 
     <lb/>
     the rich. For example, if you will turn to page 73 
     <lb/>
     of vol. 1 of the Black Books, you will see some<lb break="no"/>thing that should make you think. It is a table 
     <lb/>
     supplied us officially by the Tax Assessor's of<lb break="no"/>fice and it shows us the profits cleaned up in the 
     <lb/>
     year 1945 by our companies and firms in New<lb break="no"/>foundland. You will find that 105 companies 
     <lb/>
     declared a combined profit between them that 
     <lb/>
     year of over $15 million.... And what tax did they 
     <lb/>
     pay the government on those $15.5 million? Just 
     <lb/>
     a third — $5.5 million in taxes. That is not how 
     <lb/>
     they do it in Canada. But it is how we do it in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. We allow 100-odd concerns to 
     <lb/>
     clean up $15 million in just one year, and the 
     <lb/>
     government takes only $5 million from them in 
     <lb/>
     taxes — but meanwhile our babies, our children, 
  

            <cb/>
  

     our old people, our fishermen, our labourers are 
     <lb/>
     taxed, the life is crushed out of them by the high 
     <lb/>
     cost of living, and the high taxes that help to drive 
     <lb/>
     up the cost of living. And then after all these huge 
     <lb/>
     and shameful profits have been gouged out of us, 
     <lb/>
     the government brings a man from England to 
     <lb/>
     hold an enquiry into the cost of living. After the 
     <lb/>
     horse is stolen the stable door is —is what? Is the 
     <lb/>
     stable door locked, even then? No! For all the 
     <lb/>
     enquiry tells us is that the high cost of living 
     <lb/>
     cannot be helped, we have to grin and bear it. Call 
     <lb/>
     me anything you like, but what I am saying is the 
     <lb/>
     stone, sober truth and the whole country knows 
     <lb/>
     it. Call me anything you like, but after you have 
     <lb/>
     done so, I will still come back and ask you to 
     <lb/>
     defend or explain how it is that in one short 12 
     <lb/>
     months, $15 million are squeezed out of this 
     <lb/>
     handful of Newfoundland people by 105 con<lb break="no"/>cerns; $5 million of it taken in taxes, and $10 
     <lb/>
     million distributed in dividends to a few 
     <lb/>
     shareholders. And then Major Cashin gets up and 
     <lb/>
     talks about taxes in Canada! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Major Cashin devoted himself also to the 
     <lb/>
     question of family allowances. He says they are 
     <lb/>
     held out as bait to Newfoundland. How can that 
     <lb/>
     be, when the fact of the matter is that family 
     <lb/>
     allowances came into force long before this con<lb break="no"/>federation talk started at all, long before this 
     <lb/>
     Convention was even thought of? Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     must think Canada wants us pretty badly if they 
     <lb/>
     are willing to pay out $250 million a year in 
     <lb/>
     family allowances to her own people just to pro<lb break="no"/>vide a bait to Newfoundland. Then he gets off the 
     <lb/>
     prize one of all — he will never live it down as 
     <lb/>
     long as he lives — when he calls family allowan<lb break="no"/>ces "immoral legislation". I think that is the most 
     <lb/>
     grotesque statement I have heard in this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion since it began — to call family allowances 
     <lb/>
     "immoral". The churches in Canada have sup<lb break="no"/>ported family allowances, the clergymen — and 
     <lb/>
     speaking of clergymen, it was Father Labelle 
     <lb/>
     who was the great pioneer advocate of family 
     <lb/>
     allowances in Canada — the trade unions, co<lb break="no"/>operative societies, social welfare agencies and 
     <lb/>
     organisations, and all political parties and leaders 
     <lb/>
     of Canada have supported family allowances, 
     <lb/>
     and do so today. All these and many, many others 
     <lb/>
     have hailed family allowances, and praised and 
     <lb/>
     supported them as the best piece of legislation so 
     <lb/>
     far introduced into the New World; but Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin calls them immoral — à 1a Hitler, he says. 
    

            <pb n="1163" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-14_Page_1163.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1163</fw>
          

     The sober truth is that never was there a more 
     <lb/>
     moral piece of legislation, for family allowances 
     <lb/>
     are a strong bulwark for the strengthening of 
     <lb/>
     family life. The family, sir, is the foundation of 
     <lb/>
     society and civilisation, and anything that fosters 
     <lb/>
     and strengthens the family is not immoral, but 
     <lb/>
     highly moral, and family allowances are the 
     <lb/>
     finest system so far developed by any govern<lb break="no"/>ment anywhere to strengthen and encourage the 
     <lb/>
     family. New Zealand has family allowances, 
     <lb/>
     Australia has family allowances, Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     herself has family allowances, but Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     says family allowances are immoral. But, after 
     <lb/>
     working himself up into a lather of moral indig<lb break="no"/>nation against these immoral family allowances, 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin cools down again and reassures us 
     <lb/>
     that we need not worry any more about these 
     <lb/>
     family allowances, and why? "Because", says he, 
     <lb/>
     "they are going to be done away with soon." 
     <lb/>
     What is his reason for believing this? He forgot 
     <lb/>
     to tell us. Why does he think they are going to 
     <lb/>
     end? He did not think we would need any more 
     <lb/>
     proof than his bare word. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, if I were to tell you that the 
     <lb/>
     Commission of Government were soon going to 
     <lb/>
     close down our entire railway system; that the 
     <lb/>
     United States government is soon going to do 
     <lb/>
     away with their army, navy and airforce; that the 
     <lb/>
     British government is soon going to invite Joe 
     <lb/>
     Stalin to come from Moscow to London and take 
     <lb/>
     over the governing of Great Britain; if I were to 
     <lb/>
     tell you that and ask you not to ask for proof, but 
     <lb/>
     to take my word for it, what would you say? But 
     <lb/>
     without any proof Major Cashin says that these 
     <lb/>
     family allowances are soon going to be done 
     <lb/>
     away with. Whether he meant minutes, days, 
     <lb/>
     weeks, months or years or decades, he did not 
     <lb/>
     say, but just "soon". Now, sir, people can talk till 
     <lb/>
     they are black in the faces against family al<lb break="no"/>lowances. They can call them immoral, and say 
     <lb/>
     they are à la Hitler, they can twist and distort 
     <lb/>
     them, and when it is all said the simple truth 
     <lb/>
     remains, that we have 120,000 children in New<lb break="no"/>foundland today, 120,000 children, sir, under the 
     <lb/>
     age of 16 — over one-third of our whole popula<lb break="no"/>tion. Every one of those children, under con<lb break="no"/>federation, would receive the family allowances 
     <lb/>
     — $5, $6, $7, or $8 a month, according to the 
     <lb/>
     child's age. The parents may be rich or poor, high 
     <lb/>
     or low, sick or well, working or unemployed, it 
     <lb/>
     makes no difference; all the children will get the 
 

            <cb/>
 

     family allowance every month of the year, rain or 
     <lb/>
     shine, winter or summer, good times or bad times. 
     <lb/>
     Into every nook and comer of this island and 
     <lb/>
     Labrador these family allowances will go every 
     <lb/>
     month, into 1,300 settlements to those 120,000 
     <lb/>
     children. With confederation our children under 
     <lb/>
     16 will get family allowances. Without con<lb break="no"/>federation what will they get? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, you will notice that up to the present time 
     <lb/>
     I am only replying to Major Cashin, that is be<lb break="no"/>cause being the good speaker he is, being the 
     <lb/>
     experienced public man he is, and the ardent and 
     <lb/>
     enthusiastic anticonfederate he is, Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     has for three days arrayed all the facts and argu<lb break="no"/>ments he could think of against confederation, 
     <lb/>
     and I, sir, one by one, am knocking these argu<lb break="no"/>ments on the head and throwing them under the 
     <lb/>
     table. That is why I am taking so long. It was 
     <lb/>
     worth a reply, it was a good speech. He is a fine 
     <lb/>
     fellow and I like him. Nevertheless, sir, he is an 
     <lb/>
     anticonfederate, God help him . 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Well, he had a fling at the income tax in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and was very careful to point out that 
     <lb/>
     here in Newfoundland a single person must earn 
     <lb/>
     at least $1,000 a year before any income tax has 
     <lb/>
     to be paid by him, whereas in Canada it is $750 
     <lb/>
     a year. Now before dealing in any detail with this 
     <lb/>
     question of income taxes there is one general 
     <lb/>
     observation I want to make. Before the late war, 
     <lb/>
     the income tax in Canada was not very different 
     <lb/>
     from ours here in Newfoundland, but during the 
     <lb/>
     war Canada put up a very mighty war effort. Her 
     <lb/>
     taxes rose higher and higher and higher. That was 
     <lb/>
     during the war. But since the war ended Canada 
     <lb/>
     has reduced her taxes, not once, or twice, but 
     <lb/>
     three times, and it is believed throughout Canada 
     <lb/>
     that Finance Minister Abbott is bringing in fur<lb break="no"/>ther reductions in taxation when he brings down 
     <lb/>
     his new budget next month or the month after. 
     <lb/>
     Members of the Ottawa delegation will remem<lb break="no"/>ber my joking attempt, at one of our plenary 
     <lb/>
     sessions, to draw Mr. Abbott out as to what 
     <lb/>
     reductions in taxation he is likely to bring down 
     <lb/>
     in his new budget this winter. He, being very well 
     <lb/>
     aware of the fact that a finance minister mustkeep 
     <lb/>
     that deadly secret till the last minute, refused to 
     <lb/>
     be drawn, but it is believed that there will be 
     <lb/>
     reductions again in the next budget a month or so 
     <lb/>
     from now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Well, sir, to get back to that single person, that 
     <lb/>
     that means a person with nobody in the world 


            <pb n="1164" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-14_Page_1164.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1164</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
         

     depending on him, what income tax does he pay? 
     <lb/>
     I mean now in Canada, and here if we become a 
     <lb/>
     province. If he makes $800 a year, $66 a month 
     <lb/>
     all the year round, he pays 42 cents a month 
     <lb/>
     income tax, and it is deducted from his pay ... but 
     <lb/>
     if his income is $900 a year, or $75 a month all 
     <lb/>
     the year round, he pays $1.33 a month income 
     <lb/>
     tax. If that single person makes $1,200 a year, 
     <lb/>
     $100 a month, he pays $5 a month income tax. Is 
     <lb/>
     that so terrible for a single person without a chick 
     <lb/>
     or a child to support? $5 a month out of his $100? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now take a married couple with no children 
     <lb/>
     or any other dependents, just themselves. A mar<lb break="no"/>ried man making $1,800 a year, if we go into 
     <lb/>
     confederation, $150 a month all the year round, 
     <lb/>
     will pay $15 a month income tax out of his $150. 
     <lb/>
     If he makes $3,000 a year, or $250 a month all 
     <lb/>
     the year round, he pays $35 a month income tax 
     <lb/>
     out of $250. That is, remember, a married couple 
     <lb/>
     with no dependents, only the two of them. Now 
     <lb/>
     take a married couple with three children under 
     <lb/>
     16. On any income that that man makes, anything 
     <lb/>
     up to $1,500 a year — $100, or $500 or $1,000 
     <lb/>
     or $1,500, anything up to $1,500 a year — that is 
     <lb/>
     $125 a month every month in the year, he pays 
     <lb/>
     no income tax; not only does he pay no income 
     <lb/>
     tax, but he is paid money, $216 a year by the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada in family allowances. 
     <lb/>
     Now if his income is $2,000 a year, this same man 
     <lb/>
     with three children, at $166 every month of the 
     <lb/>
     year, he still pays no income tax, but instead the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada pays him $194 a year in 
     <lb/>
     family allowances. Now if his income is $2,500 
     <lb/>
     a year, $208 a month every month, he still pays 
     <lb/>
     no income tax, but instead he receives $106 a year 
     <lb/>
     from the Government of Canada in family al<lb break="no"/>lowances, and of course the more children he has 
     <lb/>
     under 16 the more family allowance money that 
     <lb/>
     family receives. The simple truth is that at least 
     <lb/>
     80 persons out of every 100 in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     under confederation will pay not a cent of income 
     <lb/>
     tax. God help us, their income does not bring 
     <lb/>
     them into the income tax group! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Again, Major Cashin tried to curdle our blood 
     <lb/>
     by telling us of the almost incredible and un<lb break="no"/>believable number of taxes imposed on all kinds 
     <lb/>
     of products. For example, and this is one of the 
     <lb/>
     easiest ones, he says there are 52 taxes on a loaf 
     <lb/>
     of bread in Canada. There was one he mentioned 
     <lb/>
     that had 250 taxes on the one article. How do they 
     <lb/>
     live up there? Are they still alive, or are they all 
     

            <cb/>
  

     dead? Now about those 52 taxes on a loaf of 
     <lb/>
     bread. Supposing he is right, what does it matter 
     <lb/>
     to people if there are 52 taxes on a loaf of bread, 
     <lb/>
     and the loaf still sells for 13 cents? 13 cents a loaf 
     <lb/>
     for a 20 ounce loaf. In St. John's a loaf is what? 
     <lb/>
     18 cents. How many ounces? What is the size of 
     <lb/>
     our loaf in St. John's? 
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> It is a bigger loaf. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I think it is 24 ounces. My wife 
     <lb/>buys the bread, which she won't bake. We should 
     <lb/>go out in the real Newfoundland where they bake 
     <lb/>their bread. I am not going to deny that there are 
     <lb/>all these taxes actually imposed on all these 
     <lb/>things, for the simple truth of the matter is that 
     <lb/>that is how it is all around the world. It is the same 
     <lb/>here. These taxes, sir, are paid on all our imports 
     <lb/>before we import them, and then we pay them 
     <lb/>back in the price we pay for what we buy, and 
     <lb/>besides paying all those taxes that Major Cashin 
     <lb/>mentioned, besides paying those in the price of 
     <lb/>the article when we buy it, we also pay customs 
     <lb/>duty on top of them all, and on the customs duty 
     <lb/>we also pay a profit, in fact a double profit to the 
     <lb/>wholesalers. You can take almost any article you 
     <lb/>would like to mention, and if you can trace it back 
     <lb/>far enough, and trace back all the various articles 
     <lb/>that go into that one article, you will find dozens 
     <lb/>and sometimes hundreds of taxes have been col<lb break="no"/>lected on it at one point or another, from one 
     <lb/>country or another, and the consumer pays it all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Now, sir, I want to address myself for a mo<lb break="no"/>ment to this question of sales taxes. In my opinion 
     <lb/>a sales tax is not an ideal tax. It is not direct 
     <lb/>taxation, which I prefer, but indirect taxation, 
     <lb/>which I do not like. The sales tax is put on by the 
     <lb/>Government of Canada. How long it will be left 
     <lb/>on I don't know. It may be left on for two or three 
     <lb/>years yet. I don't know. The rate of the sales tax 
     <lb/>is 8%. How long it will remain at 8%, again I 
     <lb/>don't know. Before the Government of Canada 
     <lb/>abolishes the sales tax altogether they may reduce 
     <lb/>it to 4-5%. That is something I can't prophecy. 
     <lb/>Well, there it is — a sales tax of 8%. It is collected 
     <lb/>mainly from the manufacturer of the article. It is 
     <lb/>included in the retail selling price of the article. 
     <lb/>The consumer knows nothing about it, he simply 
     <lb/>buys the article in the shop and the price of that 
     <lb/>article includes the sales tax, if the article in<lb break="no"/>cludes that. It is like our customs duties, and 
     <lb/>that's another reason why I don't like the sales 
     <lb/>tax. But the sales tax is not put on everything, and 
   

            <pb n="1165" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-14_Page_1165.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1165</fw>
         

     when you take your total imports into New<lb break="no"/>foundland for a whole year, and take off from that 
     <lb/>
     total the things that do not pay the sales tax at all 
     <lb/>
     it comes to a very large figure. Last night, until 
     <lb/>
     late this morning, after I went back at 11 o'clock 
     <lb/>
     from this chamber, I took up the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     Customs blue book for March, 1946. That hap<lb break="no"/>pened to be the latest issue I had in the house, and 
     <lb/>
     I discovered that in the year 1945-46, ending 
     <lb/>
     roughly a year ago, Newfoundland imported 
     <lb/>
     nearly $66 million worth of goods. Out of that, 
     <lb/>
     here are the goods that would pay no sales tax, 
     <lb/>
     none at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Fresh foods, $1 million 
     <lb/>
    Flour, $2.5 million 
     <lb/>Animal and poultry feed, $600,000 
     <lb/>Hay, $ 170,000 
     <lb/>Fertilisers, over $100,000 
     <lb/>Meat, beef and poultry, over $1.5 million 
     <lb/>Butter, over $200,000 
     <lb/>Cheese, over $300,000 
     <lb/>Milk, around $1 million 
     <lb/>Sugar, around $1 million 
     <lb/>Vegetables, around $1 million 
     <lb/>Eggs, nearly $500,000 
     <lb/>Salt, over $500,000 
     <lb/>Building materials, well over $1.75 million 
     <lb/>Solid fuel, nearly $4 million 
     <lb/>Animals and livestock, over $1 million 
     <lb/>
            </p>

      <p>All that was imported last year, nearly $18 mil<lb break="no"/>lion in that list, and on top of that you can put 
     <lb/>another $3 million at least, because I could not 
     <lb/>get it all out of the book, and it shows a total of 
     <lb/>about $21 million worth of Newfoundland goods 
     <lb/>that would pay no sales tax at all — none. Now 
     <lb/>you take that $21 million from the total $66 
     <lb/>million we imported, and it leaves $45 million 
     <lb/>worth of goods that would pay the sales tax; $45 
     <lb/>million is subject to sales tax, but you can add to 
     <lb/>that another $5 million to cover locally produced 
     <lb/>articles that would also be subject to the sales tax, 
     <lb/>and it is a total of $50 million. Eight per cent sales 
     <lb/>tax on that $50 million would be $4 million 
     <lb/>altogether. Now, sir, turn to the Grey Book, and 
     <lb/>turn to the Canadian govemment's own estimate 
     <lb/>of what revenue they would collect from us under 
     <lb/>confederation, and what do you find? You find 
     <lb/>that their estimate of what the sales tax would 
     <lb/>bring them is $4 million. 
     <lb/>

     from sales tax; no guesswork, but highly scien<lb break="no"/>tific. accurate, knowledgeable facts. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Possibly I spoke too quickly there, sir. I have

     noticed that the members do like a recess for five

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, there is one 
     <lb/>
     statement by Major Cashin that needs to be 
     <lb/>
     cleared up, and that is his statement that the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland would be compelled to 
     <lb/>
     pay their proportionate share of running the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada. Just what did he mean 
     <lb/>
     by that? Take our own government here in New<lb break="no"/>foundland for example, our present government 
     <lb/>
     or any past government, Does Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     mean that the Newfoundland people were not 
     <lb/>
     compelled to pay their proportionate share of the 
     <lb/>
     cost of running our government? And what does 
     <lb/>
     he mean by proportionate? Take this very year. 
     <lb/>
     The present government are collecting $40 mil<lb break="no"/>lion from all of us in taxes, that is $120 a head, or 
     <lb/>
     say from a family of five, $600. That would be 
     <lb/>
     the proportionate share, $120 a head, or $600 per 
     <lb/>
     family. Now does every person pay his propor<lb break="no"/>tionate share? Does every family? Of course not, 
     <lb/>
     because those figures are only average. Some 
     <lb/>
     persons and families pay much more, some pay 
     <lb/>
     much less. The government does not send a bill 
     <lb/>
     to each person in each family each year for $120. 
     <lb/>
     Or look at it another way. Does it mean that every 
     <lb/>
     settlement in the country must pay its propor<lb break="no"/>tionate share? Does our government collect a 
     <lb/>
     certain fixed amount from every person or every 
     <lb/>
     family, or every settlement? Of course not, there 
     <lb/>
     just isn't any such thing as a proportionate share. 
     <lb/>
     That's just a word, and in this connection it means 
     <lb/>
     nothing. That simply is not the way the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada collects its taxes. It does not start 
     <lb/>
     off by saying, "Now, we will need so much for 
     <lb/>
     the next year to run the country; we will collect 
     <lb/>
     an equal or proportionate amount from every 
     <lb/>
     person and family in Canada." Do they do that? 
     <lb/>
     No, they don't. Do they say, "We have nine

     provinces and we will collect so much from each 
     <lb/>
     province?" They don't. What do they do? They 
     <lb/>
     simply put on a number of taxes. They have a 
     <lb/>
     number of taxes, but the bulk of the revenue 
     <lb/>
     comes from income tax and the corporation tax. 
     <lb/>
     The bulk of their revenue will naturally come 
     <lb/>
     from those parts of Canada where most of the 
     <lb/>
     very wealthy industries and corporations, and 
     <lb/>
     wealthy individuals are. Those places happen to 
     <lb/>
     be the provinces of Quebec, Ontario and British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia. They pay 89% of all the revenue the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government collects, and that leaves 
     <lb/>
     only 11% of the revenue to come from the six 
     <lb/>
     other provinces. This shows very clearly what 
     <lb/>
     truth there is in Major Cashin's statement, that 
     <lb/>
     we would have to pay our proportionate share of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian government's revenue. In three of 
     <lb/>
     the provinces of Canada, the three I mentioned, 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian government collects much more 
     <lb/>
     money than they pay out; in the other six provin<lb break="no"/>ces the Canadian government pays out much 
     <lb/>
     more money than they collect — the same as they 
     <lb/>
     will do in Newfoundland. I have explained all 
     <lb/>
     this before, and it is very tiring to have speakers 
     <lb/>
     telling us that we will have to pay our propor<lb break="no"/>tionate share of Canada's revenue, but I suppose 
     <lb/>
     the anticonfederates must have something to use 
     <lb/>
     against confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I come to a really important subject, a matter 
     <lb/>
     about which Major Cashin had a great deal to say. 
     <lb/>
     I refer to the present commotion with regard to 
     <lb/>
     the shortage of United States dollars in Canada. 
     <lb/>
     He summed it up with a sort of epigram when he 
     <lb/>
     told us that Canada had sent out an SOS to Uncle 
     <lb/>
     Sam for financial help. Now what is the truth in 
     <lb/>
     that matter? Last year the Government of Canada 
     <lb/>
     had a surplus of $352 million, nearly $1 million 
     <lb/>
     a day for every day of the year. That is, they met 
     <lb/>
     all their expenses as a government for the year 
     <lb/>
     and had $352 million left over. This present year 
     <lb/>
     does not end until the spring, yet already they 
     <lb/>
     have another surplus, but this time of over $500 
     <lb/>
     million and still climbing. Does that sound like 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian government being hard up, or any<lb break="no"/>thing like that? I would remind you that during 
     <lb/>
     the year the Government of Canada gave Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain free, <hi rendition="simple:italic">free</hi>, a gift, first of $800 million, then 
     <lb/>
     $1 million, and then $425 million. I would 
     <lb/>
     remind you that since the war ended Canada has 
     <lb/>
     loaned to Great Britain $700 million, and on top 
     <lb/>
     of that $125 billion. I would remind you that to 
 

            <cb/>
   

     other countries ... Canada has loaned another $3 
     <lb/>
     billion. These figures hardly sound like poverty, 
     <lb/>
     do they sir? That is the Government of Canada; 
     <lb/>
     but what about the people of Canada, her in<lb break="no"/>dustries, her general economy? Well, the answer 
     <lb/>
     is that never in history was Canada so well off, 
     <lb/>
     so prosperous, so booming as she is right now. 
     <lb/>
     Her industries this very year just past have set up 
     <lb/>
     new records for production. Her exports of goods 
     <lb/>
     around the world have established a new record, 
     <lb/>
     greater even than during the war. A record num<lb break="no"/>ber of people is employed in Canada now, new 
     <lb/>
     records have been established in the past year. 
     <lb/>
     They will be broken again this year, but in 1947 
     <lb/>
     new records were established in Canada for the 
     <lb/>
     number of brand new industries starting up. Do 
     <lb/>
     you know that there are in Canada today over 200 
     <lb/>
     entirely new products more being manufactured 
     <lb/>
     than there were three years ago? In many parts of 
     <lb/>
     Canada today things are booming so much that 
     <lb/>
     there is actually a shortage of manpower, and 
     <lb/>
     Canada is bringing immigrants and settlers in by 
     <lb/>
     the tens of thousands. They are even flying them 
     <lb/>
     in, and they have plans to bring in hundreds of 
     <lb/>
     thousands of settlers from Great Britain and other 
     <lb/>
     parts of Europe. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, this will interest you. In the first ten 
     <lb/>
     months of 1947, do you know how many people 
     <lb/>
     went into Canada from Newfoundland to settle 
     <lb/>
     down and become Canadians? Sir, I would ven<lb break="no"/>ture to say that you have probably not seen the 
     <lb/>
     figure, and you are probably not aware of the 
     <lb/>
     number of Newfoundlanders who went to 
     <lb/>
     Canada in the first ten months of 1947. I have not 
     <lb/>
     got the figures for the last two months, but in the 
     <lb/>
     first ten months of 1947 how many New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders moved into Canada to make it their 
     <lb/>
     home, from this little island of ours? 2,469 New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders. Two of them I am sorry to say are 
     <lb/>
     brothers of my own; two others are sisters of my 
     <lb/>
     own. I don't like to see Newfoundlanders moving 
     <lb/>
     out of Newfoundland, I like to see them stick it 
     <lb/>
     out here, and try to make it better than it is. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Canada is immensely prosperous right now. In 
     <lb/>
     fact, her very prosperity is one of the causes of 
     <lb/>
     this shortage of United States dollars. What has 
     <lb/>
     been happening is that they have been bringing 
     <lb/>
     in too many goods from the United States out of 
     <lb/>
     their tremendous prosperity, and to make it 
     <lb/>
     worse, prices on everything in the United States 
     <lb/>
     have gone stark, staring crazy, and are still going

     up. So Canada found that she was using up her 
     <lb/>
     supply of United States dollars at a rate that began 
     <lb/>
     to make them think, and scare them a bit, so what 
     <lb/>
     they have done is this: the government has 
     <lb/>
     selected a list of things that Canadians are not 
     <lb/>
     allowed to import from the United States, not 
     <lb/>
     things that you must have, but things that you can 
     <lb/>
     do without. For the next year or so Canadians will 
     <lb/>
     have to do without such things or make them 
     <lb/>
     themselves — vacuum cleaners, refrigerators, 
     <lb/>
     radios, motor cars, etc. In the second place, the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government has made up another small 
     <lb/>
     list of things, which they have not exactly 
     <lb/>
     prohibited from being imported from the United 
     <lb/>
     States, but they have put a higher excise tax on 
     <lb/>
     them to discourage people from buying them in 
     <lb/>
     the next year or so until the US dollar shortage 
     <lb/>
     comes to an end. In the meantime, having 
     <lb/>
     adopted these temporary ways of saving the 
     <lb/>
     United States dollar supply, Canada has em<lb break="no"/>barked upon what is perhaps the biggest program 
     <lb/>
     of home production and development in her 
     <lb/>
     whole history. C.D. Howe, the cabinet minister 
     <lb/>
     who did such a marvelous job during the war in 
     <lb/>
     controlling and stimulating all Canada's wartime 
     <lb/>
     production, has been given charge of that mighty 
     <lb/>
     program of increasing Canada's industries to 
     <lb/>
     enable her to produce for herself the things she 
     <lb/>
     has in the past imported from the United States. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The effect of the first World War was to turn 
     <lb/>
     Canada from an agricultural economy into an 
     <lb/>
     industrial country. The effect of World War II 
     <lb/>
     was to turn Canada into a very much greater 
     <lb/>
     industrial nation than she had been, and now this 
     <lb/>
     new programme under one of the greatest ad<lb break="no"/>ministrators in the world today, C.D. Howe, the 
     <lb/>
     man who built half the grain elevators of the 
     <lb/>
     United States and Canada, the man who built Port 
     <lb/>
     Churchill, one of the great engineers and ad<lb break="no"/>ministrators of the world, has been given tremen<lb break="no"/>dous power by the Government of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     almost like the wartime powers he had, to in<lb break="no"/>augurate and shape and mould and encourage the 
     <lb/>
     development of brand new industries in the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of Canada.... There is one big way that 
     <lb/>
     Canada could adopt, if she wanted, that would 
     <lb/>
     very quickly end, her shortage of American dol<lb break="no"/>lars, and that would be to sell to the United States 
     <lb/>
     and other dollar countries a much greater share 
     <lb/>
     of what Canada produces, all kinds of products 
     <lb/>
     for which Canada was famous. But if Canada did 


            <cb/>
     

     that ... the old mother country would have to go 
     <lb/>
     short; the British people would have to pull their 
     <lb/>
     belts tighter, and British children would feel the 
     <lb/>
     pinch more than they do today, and Canada, 
     <lb/>
     which stood at Britain's back during the darkest 
     <lb/>
     days of the war, is still standing by her in these 
     <lb/>
     very trying days of peace. Canada has deliberate<lb break="no"/>ly given up her chance to get $3.25 a bushel for 
     <lb/>
     wheat, for example, and is selling it to Britain this 
     <lb/>
     year for $2, and up to this year she only asked 
     <lb/>
     $1.55 for it. She could sell every bit of it for 
     <lb/>
     American dollars at $3.25 a bushel, and that 
     <lb/>
     would give her lots of American dollars. Instead 
     <lb/>
     of grabbing this opportunity to sell her vast 
     <lb/>
     products for American dollars, Canada prefers to 
     <lb/>
     continue her assistance to Great Britain, not only 
     <lb/>
     selling at lower prices than she could get else<lb break="no"/>where, but selling a very large portion of it on 
     <lb/>
     credit. It is not very helpful in this debate, not 
     <lb/>
     very helpful to try and paint this temporary 
     <lb/>
     shortage of United Stated dollars as a sign that 
     <lb/>
     Canada is poor, or that she is financially embar<lb break="no"/>rassed, weak, that is not very helpful to any of us. 
     <lb/>
     It is not helping our people to understand con<lb break="no"/>federation to put out such statements. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Canada today is one of the two or three 
     <lb/>
     countries in the whole world that has a stable and 
     <lb/>
     sound economy. Her banking system is the 
     <lb/>
     soundest in the world. Her insurance companies 
     <lb/>
     are, to say the least, as sound as any in the world. 
     <lb/>
     Her industries are booming, her trade is increas<lb break="no"/>ing every day, employment is growing every day. 
     <lb/>
     This temporary shortage of United States dollars 
     <lb/>
     is a mere drop in the bucket, a mere passing 
     <lb/>
     incident, a thing that sounds big today, but will 
     <lb/>
     be all forgotten about a year from now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, but for the fact that it is against our rules 
     <lb/>
     in this House, I would like very much to read you 
     <lb/>
     some of the things said about Canada and 
     <lb/>
     Canada's economy in a special section of 14 
     <lb/>
     pages devoted to Canada by the New York 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Herald Tribune</hi> a few days ago. That famous 
     <lb/>
     American newspaper paid a wonderful tribute to 
     <lb/>
     Canada's greatness. At one point that paper tells 
     <lb/>
     us... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Don't quote. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No, sir, I am only summarising. 
     <lb/>
     At one point the paper tells us ... that democratic 
     <lb/>
     Canada and the United States are the only two 
     <lb/>
     important nations with the vitality and resources 
     <lb/>
     necessary to restore the world to economic 
 

            <pb n="1168" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-14_Page_1168.jpg"/>

     health. They alone among the nations produce 
     <lb/>
     more than they can consume. Together they are 
     <lb/>
     gradually integrating their economies into a 
     <lb/>
     North American pattern unmatched in a world of 
     <lb/>
     poverty and aggressive nationalisation. Again we 
     <lb/>
     are told that in 1947 Canada easily maintained 
     <lb/>
     her position as the world's largest trading nation. 
     <lb/>
     No nation with so small a population ever oc<lb break="no"/>cupied so important a place in world trade. Like 
     <lb/>
     many other nations Canada has a United States 
     <lb/>
     dollar problem, but this did not result from any 
     <lb/>
     weakness in her own internal economic position. 
     <lb/>
     Again, if I were permitted to quote directly from 
     <lb/>
     a newspaper, which I am not, I would quote from 
     <lb/>
     a very recent issue of <hi rendition="simple:italic">News of Washington</hi>. 
     <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Let me anticipate you, Mr. 
     <lb/>Smallwood. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No sir, I will not quote it. This 
     <lb/>tells that to the world's end, in peace or war, 
     <lb/>Canada makes a great centribution, but she does 
     <lb/>it quietly and without fanfare, and it is a sturdy 
     <lb/>and noble people that they have to the north of 
     <lb/>them. Canadians are a bulwark of democracy and 
     <lb/>decency. They are fortunate in their neighbours. 
     <lb/>The whole world recognises Canada's greatness 
     <lb/>amongst the nations, but to listen to what you hear 
     <lb/>in this Convention, you would think not that our 
     <lb/>British cousin is a vast nation, but a poor, pover<lb break="no"/>ty-stricken nation, hungry to get Newfoundland 
     <lb/>in her claws to abuse us and save themselves from 
     <lb/>disaster. It is as grotesque a picture as was ever 
     <lb/>painted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><ref target="#fn_02">[1]</ref>Now sir, one thing that hurt me, the only 
     <lb/>thing that Major Cashin said that hurt me, was 
     <lb/>that in this budget ... these estimates I brought in 
     <lb/>of what I estimated the provincial government 
     <lb/>would spend and collect in Newfoundland, Major 
     <lb/>Cashin says that I've cutout this and I've cut out 
     <lb/>that. And when he did that, I turned to him and 
     <lb/>said, "Now be fair, be fair". He said, "All right, 
     <lb/>I'll be fair". And I thought that he meant to go 
     <lb/>ahead and say, "Yes, I know that these things 
     <lb/>which Smallwood has cut out of the provincial 
     <lb/>budget have been cut out because they've be<lb break="no"/>come federal expenditures" — that's what I 
     <lb/>thought he was going on to say. But he didn't. He 
     <lb/>went straight on to say that he supposed that what 
     <lb/>I had in mind was to put on special taxes, an 
     <lb/>education tax for example. A queer thing happens 
     <lb/>to a man very often when he stands up to speak. 


            <cb/>
           

     He says things that he's astonished afterwards 
     <lb/>
     when he reads them in the paper, or hears them 
     <lb/>
     on the recording. "Did I actually say that?" Now 
     <lb/>
     I dare say it's like that with Major Cashin, but I'm 
     <lb/>
     sure he couldn't have thought he was going to get 
     <lb/>
     away with that. He must have known that I was 
     <lb/>
     going to answer it.... The simple truth is that in 
     <lb/>
     my provincial budget I did cut out a whole lot of 
     <lb/>
     things, over half of it. I cut out the Railway 
     <lb/>
     system, because that system would come under 
     <lb/>
     the federal government of Canada. I cut out ligh<lb break="no"/>thouses and beacons and buoys and dredging, and 
     <lb/>
     public wharves and breakwaters and marine 
     <lb/>
     works generally — cut them all out, because 
     <lb/>
     they'd be federal. I cut down on the Department 
     <lb/>
     of Public Health and Welfare, because veterans' 
     <lb/>
     pensions and rehabilitation, which come under 
     <lb/>
     that department now, would not come under it in 
     <lb/>
     confederation. Those things would be federal. I 
     <lb/>
     cut out a lot of things from the provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ment for the simple reason that such things would 
     <lb/>
     not be handled or paid for by the provincial 
     <lb/>
     government at all. Would Major Cashin want 
     <lb/>
     such things to be done twice, once by the provin<lb break="no"/>cial government and once by the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment? After cutting out the things that would be 
     <lb/>
     called federal expenditures, I also cut down on a 
     <lb/>
     few items that would be saved through ordinary 
     <lb/>
     economy. One example of that is the cost of 
     <lb/>
     supplies going into the public institutions. These 
     <lb/>
     things would come into Newfoundland duty-free 
     <lb/>
     and the provincial government would save quite 
     <lb/>
     a bit on duty which it pays today. My suggested 
     <lb/>
     provincial budget shows only ordinary expenses. 
     <lb/>
     That's all it shows, expenditure on ordinary ac<lb break="no"/>counts. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Commission government this present 
     <lb/>
     year are spending nearly $40 million. But over 
     <lb/>
     $10 million of that is shown in their estimates as 
     <lb/>
     special or capital expenditures. Reconstruction is 
     <lb/>
     what they call it — over $10 million. Now, these 
     <lb/>
     items are capital expenditures and they are so 
     <lb/>
     shown. Under ordinary conditions the money to 
     <lb/>
     pay for those reconstruction expenditures would 
     <lb/>
     come out of capital account. The government 
     <lb/>
     itself expects that they'd have to pay for them this 
     <lb/>
     year — they expected to draw upon the accum<lb break="no"/>mulated cash surplus to pay for some of those 
     <lb/>
     capital expenditures. Because they didn't figure 
     <lb/>

     ordinary revenue, to pay these capital expendi<lb break="no"/>tures. So they figured they'd have to dip into the 
     <lb/>
     surplus to do it. But as it happened, they've been 
     <lb/>
     taking in enough ordinary revenue this year to 
     <lb/>
     meet those special costs or nearly enough. I'm 
     <lb/>
     told that they will have something of a deficit, I 
     <lb/>
     don't know. Now that fact does not change the 
     <lb/>
     situation. Those expenditures amounting to over 
     <lb/>
     $10 million are not ordinary expenditures, but 
     <lb/>
     capital account — reconstruction expenditures. 
     <lb/>
     One such item is $500,000 for building new 
     <lb/>
     schools, and repairing and equipping old ones. 
     <lb/>
     The government, you may remember, laid out a 
     <lb/>
     three-year plan to spend $500,000 each year on 
     <lb/>
     building new schools or helping to build them, 
     <lb/>
     and repairing old ones and equipping them or 
     <lb/>
     helping to do it.... And this present year is the 
     <lb/>
     second year of that particular three-year plan....<ref target="#fn_03">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now in my provincial budget of ordinary ex<lb break="no"/>penditures I have shown exactly why it says 
     <lb/>
     ordinary expenditures. All the rest would be spe<lb break="no"/>cial reconstruction, or capital expenditures. Now 
     <lb/>
     that is reasonable. Because I have dropped this 
     <lb/>
     $500,000 from my list of ordinary expenditures 
     <lb/>
     it does not mean that that $500,000 would not be 
     <lb/>
     spent. Of course it would be spent, but it would 
     <lb/>
     be shown as capital expenditures, not ordinary, 
     <lb/>
     and this comes out of capital account, as it would 
     <lb/>
     have come out of capital account this very year 
     <lb/>
     had not the ordinary revenue kept up so high. I 
     <lb/>
     explained all this in clear simple language when 
     <lb/>
     Iintroduced my so-called provincial budget, and 
     <lb/>
     it is just downright misrepresentation, I will take 
     <lb/>
     that back, it was too bad for Major Cashin to 
     <lb/>
     make out that I was trying to do our school system 
     <lb/>
     out of the $500,000 merely because I did not 
     <lb/>
     show it in ordinary expenditure. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am coming pretty close to an end of my reply 
     <lb/>
     to Major Cashin. He used up a large part of his 
     <lb/>
     speech dealing with the purely financial side of 
     <lb/>
     confederation. Now that's exactly what we 
     <lb/>
     would expect Major Cashin to do, he being the 
     <lb/>
     former Minister of Finance. He is interested in 
     <lb/>
     that more than anything else. I have detected in 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin from time to time a sort of im<lb break="no"/>patience at anything and everything that came 
     <lb/>
     into this Convention that was not financial. He 
     <lb/>
     took up a large part of his speech dealing with the 
     <lb/>
     purely financial side of confederation, but I don't 
     <lb/>
     think he did much to make the position clear to 
   

            <cb/>
           

     our people. On the contrary he was so hopelessly 
     <lb/>
     mixed up and muddled by his own figures, that I 
     <lb/>
     was at a loss to know which figures he meant us 
     <lb/>
     to accept. Let us see if we can rescue the simple 
     <lb/>
     truth from his conglomeration of figures. At one 
     <lb/>
     point he told us that the Government of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     the federal government, would take $75 million 
     <lb/>
     a year from us in taxes. Just remember that figure, 
     <lb/>
     please — $75 million, that is what the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada would take from us. But what 
     <lb/>
     does he do? A few minutes earlier, when he was 
     <lb/>
     examining the Canadian government's own es<lb break="no"/>timates of the taxes they would collect from us 
     <lb/>
     — their estimate you may remember is $20 mil<lb break="no"/>lion a year, but that figure does not satisfy Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin, so he ups it to $32 million. He says the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government sent down this Grey Book, 
     <lb/>
     and if you turn to Annex IV in the Grey Book you 
     <lb/>
     will find that the Government of Canada es<lb break="no"/>timates that all they will take from the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland in taxes is $20 million. Precisely. 
     <lb/>
     Foolishness, it will be more, it will be $32 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. Well, why doesn't he make up his mind? 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin should make up his mind. Is it the 
     <lb/>
     $32 million he tells us in one breath, or the $75 
     <lb/>
     million he tells us in the next breath? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Might I be allowed to interrupt? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Certainly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> In those estimates in the Grey Book 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian government did not take into con<lb break="no"/>sideration the interest on their own public debt. 
   
 </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> ....I will come to that, in fact I 
     <lb/>think it's the next note I have. If that's it, it's 
     <lb/>really comical. However, the difference between 
     <lb/>his estimates of $32 million and $75 million is 
     <lb/>$43 million a year, surely too big a difference in 
     <lb/>any man's figures. It is simply delightful how 
     <lb/>Major Cashin flings around those millions upon 
     <lb/>millions. Now, how much would the federal 
     <lb/>government actually collect in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>each year? The financial and commercial offi<lb break="no"/>cials of the Canadian government estimated it at 
     <lb/>$20 million a year made up in this way:

            <p>These estimates were made by the Canadian 
     <lb/>financial officials upon the basis of their intimate 
     <lb/>knowledge of Newfoundland's trade and also 
     <lb/>their estimate of what our trade would be under 
     <lb/>confederation... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     Major Cashin professed to scoff at them, but 
     <lb/>
     I tell you frankly that when it comes to choosing 
     <lb/>
     between the estimates of Major Cashin and the 
     <lb/>
     very able financial officials of the Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada I do not hesitate a moment. However, 
     <lb/>
     when Major Cashin first tried to throw doubt on 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian government's own estimates I ad<lb break="no"/>dressed a question to the Canadian government 
     <lb/>
     asking them to give us an idea of how they made 
     <lb/>
     their estimates, and what they based them upon. 
     <lb/>
     They came back with a detailed reply which 
     <lb/>
     satisfied every reasonable minded man in this 
     <lb/>
     Convention, everybody whose mind is not 
     <lb/>
     blinded against confederation and all its works. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now the next point is what the provincial 
     <lb/>
     government, our own government should we be<lb break="no"/>come a province, would collect from us. You will 
     <lb/>
     remember that I brought in my estimate of what 
     <lb/>
     that would be — $15 million a year from the first 
     <lb/>
     four years, and over $15.5 million a year for the 
     <lb/>
     second four years, and also you will remember 
     <lb/>
     that my estimate was for eight years, because 
     <lb/>
     within eight years there is to be a royal commis<lb break="no"/>sion to go into our financial position to see what 
     <lb/>
     additional subsidies, if any, we would need from 
     <lb/>
     the federal government. Mr. Hickman said my 
     <lb/>
     estimate is too low, it should be $17 million a 
     <lb/>
     year. Mr. Hollett said it should be $19 million a 
     <lb/>
     year. Almost like an auction, sir, and Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin goes them one better, and drives it up to 
     <lb/>
     $19.2 million a year. "In my view", says Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin, "this is the least possible." That is the 
     <lb/>
     lowest that the provincial government can get 
     <lb/>
     along on. I wonder, sir, if Major Cashin realised 
     <lb/>
     — I'm sorry he is not here just now, I would like 
     <lb/>
     him to hear this — what that did to his own 
     <lb/>
     proposed budget? You will remember under this 
     <lb/>
     budget, $25 million a year is what it would take, 
     <lb/>
     he estimated, for Newfoundland to carry on 
     <lb/>
     under Commission or responsible government— 
     <lb/>
     $25 million a year to pay all the ordinary costs of 
     <lb/>
     government, including interest on our public 
     <lb/>
     debt, sinking fund, operating losses on the Rail<lb break="no"/>way, the annual cost of lighthouses, fog alarms, 
   

            <cb/>
   

     beacons and buoys, public wharves, dredging, 
     <lb/>
     pensions and rehabilitation for all war veterans, 
     <lb/>
     both wars, the post office and telegraph system, 
     <lb/>
     the losses on Gander — and that reminds me, 
     <lb/>
     don't be surprised if you find that in the current 
     <lb/>
     year the losses on Gander will run to $1.25 mil<lb break="no"/>lion, not counting the capital expenditure of 
     <lb/>
     $500,000.... The Government of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     has to pay — what is it? — one-third of $1.25 
     <lb/>
     million, but Major Cashin's budget of $25 mil<lb break="no"/>lion included the losses on Gander, and the cost 
     <lb/>
     of the Fisheries Department, and a large number 
     <lb/>
     of other services and expenditures which would 
     <lb/>
     not appear at all in the provincial government 
     <lb/>
     budget under confederation. Remember, his $25 
     <lb/>
     million a year is supposed to cover all ordinary 
     <lb/>
     expenditures, including these items I have just 
     <lb/>
     mentioned. If his guess of $19.2 million a year 
     <lb/>
     for all ordinary expenses of the provincial 
     <lb/>
     government is correct, if that is what it would cost 
     <lb/>
     to operate Newfoundland's government under 
     <lb/>
     confederation, then without confederation the 
     <lb/>
     cost would be $11 million higher than the figure 
     <lb/>
     of $25 million he gives us in his budget. As the 
     <lb/>
     old saying goes, he is on the horns of a dilemma; 
     <lb/>
     either he has to agree with my estimate of $15 
     <lb/>
     million or $15.5 million for the province, or else 
     <lb/>
     he has to stick another $11 million on his own 
     <lb/>
     estimate, and raise it from $25 million to $36 
     <lb/>
     million a year. He can take his choice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I hope I have made myself clear on that, it is 
     <lb/>
     simple enough, really. The danger of trying to 
     <lb/>
     make a thing simple is trying too hard to make it 
     <lb/>
     simple, but here are two budgets, one that I bring 
     <lb/>
     in and one Major Cashin brings in. The one that 
     <lb/>
     I bring in shows what the provincial government 
     <lb/>
     would have to spend each year, and Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     shows what the Government of Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     if we do not have confederation, would have to 
     <lb/>
     spend each year. My estimate is $15.5 million a 
     <lb/>
     year, and his is $25 million a year. Now, if, <hi rendition="simple:italic">if</hi> he 
     <lb/>
     will not allow me to take off from his $25 million 
     <lb/>
     those expenses which we would not have to pay 
     <lb/>
     under confederation, if he won't allow me to take 
     <lb/>
     that off his $25 million and bring it down to $14 
     <lb/>
     million, then he has got to add $11 million on to 
     <lb/>
     his $25 million. He can take his choice, but 
     <lb/>
     whichever Major Cashin may choose, the result 
     <lb/>
     is clear and simple: under confederation the 
     <lb/>
     federal government of Canada will handle and 
     <lb/>
     pay for quite a number of costly public services 
 

            <pb n="1171" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-14_Page_1171.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1171</fw>
        

     which, without confederation, our own govern<lb break="no"/>ment will have to pay for, and these services run 
     <lb/>
     to $11 million a year. With the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment paying for these services it would be stupid 
     <lb/>
     and silly to include them in the provincial budget. 
     <lb/>
     I am not stupid or silly, so in my provincial budget 
     <lb/>
     I have taken those items of expense out, which 
     <lb/>
     brings the provincial budget down to $14-15 
     <lb/>
     million a year. Not the estimate of $17 million of 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hickman, or the $19 million of Mr. Hollett, 
     <lb/>
     or the $19.2 million of Major Cashin. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now let's take it again. The federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment will take in profit $20 million, and the 
     <lb/>
     provincial government $5 million or $6 million, 
     <lb/>
     a total for the two governments of $25 million or 
     <lb/>
     $26 million a year — call it $26 million a year 
     <lb/>
     taken from all of us in taxes, and don't forget the 
     <lb/>
     coming budget of the Canadian government, 
     <lb/>
     which everybody believes is going to reduce 
     <lb/>
     Canadian tax rates still more next month or the 
     <lb/>
     month after. If the Newfoundland people have to 
     <lb/>
     pay $26 million a year in taxes to the two govern<lb break="no"/>ments, what will they get in return? Let's look 
     <lb/>
     and see First, what will the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment spend each year in Newfoundland? Under 
     <lb/>
     the tax rental agreement, $6.82 million. Old age 
     <lb/>
     pensions and pensions to the blind, $2.6 million; 
     <lb/>
     family allowances, $8.35 million; other 
     <lb/>
     departmental expenditures, $9.4 million; transi<lb break="no"/>tional grant, taking the yearly average, 
     <lb/>
     $2,843,000; interest on our sterling debt, that they 
     <lb/>
     will take over, $2,156,000 a year; Railway 
     <lb/>
     operating losses, at least $2 million a year. It is 
     <lb/>
     costing us $1-2 million a year, but it will cost the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada much more than that, 
     <lb/>
     because they will have less revenue. They have 
     <lb/>
     to reduce the Railway force, taxpayers' rates and 
     <lb/>
     freight rates, to bring them down to Canadian 
     <lb/>
     rates, and in some cases they have to increase the 
     <lb/>
     wages to the Railway men, and then on top of 
     <lb/>
     that, railway and other capital expenditures by 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada, $2 million a year. 
     <lb/>
     Remember, they have to spend $17 million for 
     <lb/>
     the first ten years, or they estimate that is what 
     <lb/>
     they will have to spend on the railway alone, so 
     <lb/>
     that is $2 million a year for capital account. That 
     <lb/>
     is a total of $36.5 million a year which the federal 
     <lb/>
     government would spend in Newfoundland — 
     <lb/>
     $36.5 million a year. Some of it will come to the 
     <lb/>
     provincial government, some direct to the New<lb break="no"/>
         

            <cb/>
      
foundland people in social security payments, 
     <lb/>
     and some of it to pay for public services carried 
     <lb/>
     on here by the federal government. $36.5 million 
     <lb/>
     a year to be spent by the federal government, and 
     <lb/>
     $15.5 million a year to be spent by the provincial 
     <lb/>
     government, makes a total of $51 million a year 
     <lb/>
     to be spent in Newfoundland by the two govern<lb break="no"/>ments together. So we pay $26 million a year in 
     <lb/>
     taxes, and receive benefits amounting to $51 
     <lb/>
     million a year, clear gain for us as a people of $25 
     <lb/>
     million a year for the first eight years of union. 
     <lb/>
     On a purely cash basis confederation would mean 
     <lb/>
     a magnificent gain for the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. Confederation, during the first eight 
     <lb/>
     years of union, will cost the public chest of 
     <lb/>
     Canada over $16 million net each year: $16 mil<lb break="no"/>lion a year is what the entry of Newfoundland into 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian union will cost the Canadian public 
     <lb/>
     chest. That is, they will spend $16 million a year 
     <lb/>
     more than they will get from Newfoundland. It 
     <lb/>
     sounds like a lot of money in our ears, I admit 
     <lb/>
     that, for the Government of Canada to be out $16 
     <lb/>
     million a year by taking us into the family, but, 
     <lb/>
     as Mr. St. Laurent said when the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     reporters pointed this out, "That is only chicken<lb break="no"/>feed to the Canadian government, where we are 
     <lb/>
     handling thousands of millions each year in these 
     <lb/>
     times." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, that concludes a point. I have only one 
     <lb/>
     other point, I think, in connection with Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin's speech, and it is a little too long to do at 
     <lb/>
     this moment before 6 o'clock. I wonder, sir, if I 
     <lb/>
     could have your indulgence and rise until 8 
     <lb/>
     o'clock tonight? Would that be satisfactory?

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName><ref target="#fn_04">[1]</ref> As I said before the recess, I 
     <lb/>
     have only one point left in Major Cashin' s speech 
     <lb/>
     with which to deal. And that is the question of 
     <lb/>
     Canada's public debt. Major Cashin has made a 
     <lb/>
     great deal out of the fact that Canada has what 
     <lb/>
     sounds like a very large public debt. I say sounds 
     <lb/>
     like a large debt, though actually it is not large at 
     <lb/>
     all. There used to be nothing easier than to con<lb break="no"/>fuse people about this public debt question. An 
     <lb/>
     awful lot of nonsense is still talked about it, and

     there are many people who have very hazy and 
     <lb/>
     very often very strange ideas about it. Here in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland we look at public debt quite dif<lb break="no"/>ferently from other countries, because we have 
     <lb/>
     had a very sad experience with our public debt. 
     <lb/>
     Our public debt has everything wrong with it that 
     <lb/>
     it could have. It was too big to start with. It was 
     <lb/>
     a crippling burden on us, a millstone around our 
     <lb/>
     necks. In the second place, it was owed to people 
     <lb/>
     outside the country — practically all of it. Instead 
     <lb/>
     of borrowing it from ourselves, we borrowed it 
     <lb/>
     from people in other countries — no doubt be<lb break="no"/>cause we couldn't borrow it from ourselves be<lb break="no"/>cause we didn't have it amongst ourselves to 
     <lb/>
     borrow it from ourselves. In the third place, we 
     <lb/>
     paid too much interest on it. We paid out scores 
     <lb/>
     and scores of millions of dollars in interest on our 
     <lb/>
     debt, and we paid it out to people in other 
     <lb/>
     countries. It was a terrible drain to pay out all that 
     <lb/>
     interest. I think in the Finance Report there's a 
     <lb/>
     table showing the amount of money that this 
     <lb/>
     country paid out over a number of years in inter<lb break="no"/>est that it had to send out of the country. I don't 
     <lb/>
     remember that figure, but I do remember compil<lb break="no"/>ing it myself years and years ago, showing that 
     <lb/>
     up to that time we had paid out over $100 million 
     <lb/>
     of our hard-earned money in interest and we had 
     <lb/>
     had to ship that money out of the country al<lb break="no"/>together. In the fourth place, most of what we 
     <lb/>
     borrowed we spent for unproductive and often 
     <lb/>
     wasteful purposes. Yes, our public debt was the 
     <lb/>
     worst kind of debt a country could have. And it 
     <lb/>
     was very little credit to us that we had such a debt. 
     <lb/>
     Anyway, the day finally came when we found 
     <lb/>
     ourselves at the end of our rope. We couldn't find 
     <lb/>
     enough money even to pay the interest on our 
     <lb/>
     public debt. As a country we were bankrupt and 
     <lb/>
     insolvent. At that point Britain came to our res<lb break="no"/>cue. She took over practically all our debts, 
     <lb/>
     guaranteed the principle and interest to the 
     <lb/>
     people we owed it to, and cut the rate of interest 
     <lb/>
     down to 3% per year. However, we still ... are 
     <lb/>
     draining our country, draining ourselves of mil<lb break="no"/>lions of dollars just to pay the interest on our debt. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Major Cashin says that Canada's public 
     <lb/>
     debt is $17 billion. Actually, their debt is $12 
     <lb/>
     billion, because $5 billion is what's called self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     liquidating, or is otherwise an asset rather than a 
     <lb/>
     liability. But, $12 billion or $17 billion, it really 
     <lb/>
     doesn't matter very much at all because the big 
     <lb/>
     point is that practically all of it is owed right in 
   

            <cb/>
   

     Canada herself — owed by the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment to the Canadian people. The yearly interest 
     <lb/>
     on that debt is paid out to people living right in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. It hasn't got to be shipped out to people 
     <lb/>
     in some other country. The Canadian government 
     <lb/>
     has borrowed $12 billion net from the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     people. And back to the Canadian people that 
     <lb/>
     government pays around $400 million every year 
     <lb/>
     in interest. The money stays right in Canada 
     <lb/>
     where it can be used for capital to start industry, 
     <lb/>
     to employ people and produce still further wealth 
     <lb/>
     for Canada. Now that's one difference between 
     <lb/>
     Canada's public debt and our own, and a pretty 
     <lb/>
     big difference it is — the difference between a 
     <lb/>
     debt draining a country of its money and keeping 
     <lb/>
     it right in the country for further development. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There's another very important point. It's this. 
     <lb/>
     That a country's public debt is big or small ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the resources developed and un<lb break="no"/>developed of that country. That is, according to 
     <lb/>
     whether the total amount of wealth produced in 
     <lb/>
     the country is enough to pay the interest on the 
     <lb/>
     debt without feeling it. On this test, Canada's 
     <lb/>
     public debt is a small one, for to find around $400 
     <lb/>
     million a year to pay the interest on their debt is 
     <lb/>
     scarcely anything at all out of the vast yearly 
     <lb/>
     wealth produced in Canada. They're producing 
     <lb/>
     over $12 thousand million worth of wealth a year 
     <lb/>
     in Canada now — over $12 billion a year. We 
     <lb/>
     must not forget that Canada is the third largest 
     <lb/>
     trading nation in the whole world. And out of all 
     <lb/>
     that fabulous wealth, to find $400 million a year 
     <lb/>
     for interest is no burden at all worth mentioning, 
     <lb/>
     especially when we remember that the $400 mil<lb break="no"/>lion is paid right back to Canadian people living 
     <lb/>
     right in Canada... The national debt of Canada is 
     <lb/>
     owed to the Canadian people. It was borrowed 
     <lb/>
     from the Canadian people and corporations, and 
     <lb/>
     the interest on it is paid to the people and institu<lb break="no"/>tions of Canada. All the people owe all the money 
     <lb/>
     making up the national debt to some of the people 
     <lb/>
     of Canada. Interest on that national debt is paid 
     <lb/>
     to some of the people and collected from all the 
     <lb/>
     people generally.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     President Roosevelt once said, when he was 
     <lb/>
     defending his policy of increasing the national 
     <lb/>
     debt of the United States, that it made no dif<lb break="no"/>ference how high the national debt of a country 
     <lb/>
     is so long as it is owed to its own people. The 
     <lb/>
     Canadian people are well able to add a few more 
     <lb/>
     billion to their national debt before they'll have 


            <pb n="1173" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-14_Page_1173.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1173</fw>
         

     cause for worry. I remember myself very well, 
     <lb/>
     living as I did at that time in the United States, 
     <lb/>
     when the public debt of the USA was something 
     <lb/>
     of the order of $42 billion. They came out of 
     <lb/>
     World War I with a public debt of something over 
     <lb/>
     $20 billion, and it rose to something around $42 
     <lb/>
     billion. Franklin D. Roosevelt, started his New 
     <lb/>
     Deal. He spent fabulous amounts of money he 
     <lb/>
     borrowed, the government of the USA borrowed 
     <lb/>
     fabulous amounts of money, and there were 
     <lb/>
     economists who said that when the USA reaches 
     <lb/>
     $100 billion public debt, she's finished, that's the 
     <lb/>
     end of her. Well, sir, Congress passed a law that 
     <lb/>
     the public debt of the USA must not rise above I 
     <lb/>
     think it was $75 billion. They put a limit on it — 
     <lb/>
     $45 billion, Major Cashin says, anyway they put 
     <lb/>
     a limit on their public debt. Now, what happened? 
     <lb/>
     They borrowed and they borrowed and they bor<lb break="no"/>rowed and they borrowed. And today the USA 
     <lb/>
     has a public debt, I think, of a billion dollars for 
     <lb/>
     every day in the year. Somewhere around $350 
     <lb/>
     or $360 billion — a fabulous amount, we can't 
     <lb/>
     conceive that amount. But the USA doesn't mind 
     <lb/>
     that public debt at all. They take it in their stride. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, there's one final point that needs to be 
     <lb/>
     made on this question of a public debt. It's not the 
     <lb/>
     size of a country's public debt that matters, if it 
     <lb/>
     is owed to its own people. Not that, but the total 
     <lb/>
     amount of taxes a man pays. A government col<lb break="no"/>lects a certain total amount of taxes from its 
     <lb/>
     people. It spends that money. Some of that money 
     <lb/>
     it spends to pay the interest on the debt — but 
     <lb/>
     only some of it. What really matters, therefore, is 
     <lb/>
     the total amount of taxation that the people pay, 
     <lb/>
     or to boil it down still further, what matters to 
     <lb/>
     each individual is the total amount of taxes that 
     <lb/>
     he pays. A part is never as great as the whole: the 
     <lb/>
     interest on the public debt is only a part, whereas 
     <lb/>
     the total taxes a man pays is the whole.... You see, 
     <lb/>
     we mustn't imagine that if we go into confedera<lb break="no"/>tion the Government of Canada will then send 
     <lb/>
     each one of us a bill as our share of the public 
     <lb/>
     debt, or the interest on that debt. It's not done that 
     <lb/>
     way. We pay our taxes mostly according to our 
     <lb/>
     income or our earnings, and out of what they take 
     <lb/>
     from us in taxes, they use so much to pay the 
     <lb/>
     interest on the public debt. We don't need to 
     <lb/>
     worry about the public debt. If we need to worry 
     <lb/>
     about anything, it's about how much taxes we 
     <lb/>
     will pay, for those taxes will include something 
  

            <cb/>
     

     towards the public debt or the interest on the 
     <lb/>
     public debt. We'll pay our share of the total taxes, 
     <lb/>
     and when we do, we can forget about the public 
     <lb/>
     debt because our taxes will help to take care of 
     <lb/>
     the public debt. And one of the really big things 
     <lb/>
     about confederation in my view is that most of 
     <lb/>
     our people, the great bulk of them, will pay less 
     <lb/>
     in taxes than they are paying now. That's all I 
     <lb/>
     wanted to say about this public debt question just 
     <lb/>
     now. It's nothing to get worried about. The 
     <lb/>
     Canadian people are not worried about their 
     <lb/>
     public debt, and we won't need to be worried 
     <lb/>
     about it if we go into confederation. The people 
     <lb/>
     of Canada are living well in spite of their public 
     <lb/>
     debt. I can guarantee you, Mr. Chairman, that 
     <lb/>
     there's more talk here in Newfoundland about 
     <lb/>
     Canada's public debt in one day, one day, then 
     <lb/>
     there is in Canada in a year....<ref target="#fn_05">[1]</ref> 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now this afternoon Major Cashin explained 
     <lb/>
     what he meant when he said that Canada would 
     <lb/>
     take not the $32 million a year that he told us at 
     <lb/>
     one point, but $75 million. He explained that he 
     <lb/>
     was referring to our share of the public debt. 
     <lb/>
     Now, when a country owes a public debt, it's the 
     <lb/>
     interest on that debt that matters. And the interest 
     <lb/>
     on the public debt of Canada is around $400 
     <lb/>
     million a year. Three provinces of Canada — 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia — three 
     <lb/>
     provinces pay the Canadian government 89% of 
     <lb/>
     all the revenue that the Canadian government 
     <lb/>
     gets. That means that these same three provinces, 
     <lb/>
     if they pay 89% of all the revenue of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada, then they pay 89% of the interest 
     <lb/>
     on the debt. Because the interest on the debt is 
     <lb/>
     only $400 million a year, whereas the whole 
     <lb/>
     revenue is three, or four, or five times as much as 
     <lb/>
     that. So therefore these three provinces pay 89% 
     <lb/>
     of whatever it costs to service the public debt — 
     <lb/>
     89% of that $400 million.... That leaves only $40 
     <lb/>
     million to come from all the rest of Canada. What 
     <lb/>
     would our share of that $40 million be? Pretty 
     <lb/>
     small. But whatever it is, it'll come out of the total 
     <lb/>
     taxes that we pay to the Government of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     which would be $20 million a year. Now, where 
     <lb/>
     does Major Cashin get his figure of $75 million? 
     <lb/>
     We're still in the dark on that, at least I am — still 
     <lb/>
     in the dark. I don't know where he got that figure. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Well, sir, that's Major Cashin's speech — 
     <lb/>
     what's left of it. He spoke for part of four days. 
     <lb/>
     He spoke many thousands of words. He's getting 
 

            <pb n="1174" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-14_Page_1174.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1174</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
     

     almost as bad as I am. He made many hundreds 
     <lb/>
     of statements, but amongst them all there's really 
     <lb/>
     only one statement that deserves attention, for 
     <lb/>
     that one statement stands out above all the rest of 
     <lb/>
     his speech — I quote his exact words: "I like 
     <lb/>
     Canada, she's a great country." Now, sir, why 
     <lb/>
     shouldn't he like Canada? Why shouldn't he 
     <lb/>
     think she's a great country? He worked in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. He travelled right across Canada. He 
     <lb/>
     fought in the Canadian army. He's an ex-officer 
     <lb/>
     of the army of Canada, retired with the rank of 
     <lb/>
     major from the Canadian army. For the past eight 
     <lb/>
     or nine years he has made Canada his home, 
     <lb/>
     although within that period he has managed to 
     <lb/>
     visit us here in Newfoundland a few times. His 
     <lb/>
     home is in Canada now, in Montreal. When the 
     <lb/>
     Christmas recess came a year ago, and again this 
     <lb/>
     year, when we all trooped off to our homes, 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin did the same thing. He went to his 
     <lb/>
     home in Montreal. Evidently Major Cashin is not 
     <lb/>
     so scared of all those terrible Canadian taxes that 
     <lb/>
     he's been telling us about. He can't be so very 
     <lb/>
     scared of them when he has his very home in 
     <lb/>
     Montreal at this very minute. I sometimes 
     <lb/>
     wonder to myself, I sometimes wonder what 
     <lb/>
     would have happened if Major Cashin had been 
     <lb/>
     the first to think of advocating confederation 
     <lb/>
     instead of myself. I sometimes wonder if he isn't 
     <lb/>
     just a bit sorry that he didn't come out for con<lb break="no"/>federation in the first place. What a fine cham<lb break="no"/>pion he would have made for the great cause of 
     <lb/>
     confederation. In his heart he must know that 
     <lb/>
     confederation would be the best thing that could 
     <lb/>
     happen for the great mass of our Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     people. But he started by boosting responsible 
     <lb/>
     government and now he's stuck with it. He's 
     <lb/>
     stuck with it, and finds that he can't very well 
     <lb/>
     change before the referendum. But I wonder, I 
     <lb/>
     wonder if there will be a happier man in all 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland when the votes are counted in the 
     <lb/>
     referendum this spring and he finds that con<lb break="no"/>federation has won with a thundering great 
     <lb/>
     majority? Will there be a happier man in New<lb break="no"/>foundland? I leave Major Cashin for the time 
     <lb/>
     being. I leave him, sir, with an invitation to come 
     <lb/>
     over with us, an invitation to become a con<lb break="no"/>federate right out in the open — drop this non<lb break="no"/>sense about responsible government. The people 
     <lb/>
     are not going to vote for it anyway, so what's the 
     <lb/>
     use of wasting time over it? Let Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     join up, let him enlist, let him enrol right now in 
 

            <cb/>
    

     the great and growing army of confederation in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I turn, sir, to Mr. Higgins. There are really only 
     <lb/>
     three or four points in his speech that seem to call 
     <lb/>
     for attention. Mr. Higgins told us that a lawyer 
     <lb/>
     often takes on a case that he doesn't especially 
     <lb/>
     like and sometimes acts for a client that he isn't 
     <lb/>
     a bit fond of. But he takes it, he takes the case and 
     <lb/>
     he does his best. I know that's true, and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins has demonstrated that truth very well in 
     <lb/>
     this Convention. When Major Cashin made that 
     <lb/>
     early speech of his, a few days after the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion opened, Mr. Higgins got up and attacked 
     <lb/>
     what Major Cashin had said, and in very trench<lb break="no"/>ant language told Major Cashin that he disagreed 
     <lb/>
     absolutely and completely with him. We all 
     <lb/>
     remember Mr. Higgins' speech on that occasion. 
     <lb/>
     It was eloquent, logical and persuasive. Then two 
     <lb/>
     or three months later Mr. Higgins gotup and took 
     <lb/>
     it all back, apologised to Major Cashin and in 
     <lb/>
     effect said that he now agreed with him. We all 
     <lb/>
     remember another occasion when Mr. Higgins 
     <lb/>
     delivered a trenchant and eloquent speech, the 
     <lb/>
     best speech that he has delivered in this chamber, 
     <lb/>
     when Mr. Jackman introduced his motion to send 
     <lb/>
     a delegation to the United States to discuss 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland's pulling down the Union Jack 
     <lb/>
     and running up the Stars and Stripes to become a 
     <lb/>
     part of the USA. Mr. Higgins spared no words. 
     <lb/>
     He hit that motion and he hit it hard, and he told 
     <lb/>
     us we weren't going to be like rats deserting a 
     <lb/>
     sinking ship. His speech made an excellent im<lb break="no"/>pression at the time. But now he gets up and tells 
     <lb/>
     us he's changed his mind again. Now he thinks, 
     <lb/>
     after reading about the expanding American im<lb break="no"/>perialism that he told us about in his speech, that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Jackman's motion wasn't so bad after all.

     their public men, such as Major Cashin and 
     <lb/>
     myself, but they'll pay precious little attention 
     <lb/>
     to weather vanes that are blown every direction 
     <lb/>
     by every wind that blows. Mr. Higgins says in his 
     <lb/>
     speech, here's Newfoundland sitting with a pat 
     <lb/>
     hand. That's a term used amongst card players. It 
     <lb/>
     means holding all the cards you need in your 
     <lb/>
     hand, you don't have to draw.... Here's New<lb break="no"/>foundland, says Mr. Higgins, sitting with a pat 
     <lb/>
     hand. I wonder if Mr. Higgins is aware of the fact 
     <lb/>
     that we have nearly 1,200 veterans of the late war 
     <lb/>
     out of jobs and unable to get jobs right here in St. 
     <lb/>
     John's tonight. I wonder if he's aware of the fact 
     <lb/>
     that we have thousands on the dole. I wonder if 
     <lb/>
     he knows that the price of fish fell last year and 
     <lb/>
     that tens of thousands of fishermen are wonder<lb break="no"/>ing what's going to happen this year. Why, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, just let the price of fish take a serious 
     <lb/>
     fall and this country would be on the broad of her 
     <lb/>
     back. Would he call that situation one in which 
     <lb/>
     we hold a pat hand? He may, but I certainly don't. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I turn to my good friend Mr. Bailey. Now I 
     <lb/>
     won't take much time replying to Mr. Bailey. 
     <lb/>
     He's got it in his head that because most of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces of Canada go in heavily for municipal 
     <lb/>
     or town councils, therefore Newfoundland must 
     <lb/>
     if she becomes a province. He knows that towns 
     <lb/>
     or municipal councils have their own local taxes. 
     <lb/>
     So, from this he can't be persuaded that we won't 
     <lb/>
     have to have local taxes, whether we want to or 
     <lb/>
     not. It's no use my arguing with Mr. Bailey, 
     <lb/>
     because "A man convinced against his will/Is of 
     <lb/>
     the same opinion still." Mr. Bailey has his mind 
     <lb/>
     made up that whether we like it or not, we must 
     <lb/>
     have all our 1,300 little settlements governed by 
     <lb/>
     town councils or county councils. And why? 
     <lb/>
     Because that's the way they do it in most of the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces. Now, in a way Mr. Bailey is a 
     <lb/>
     shrewder opponent of confederation than all his 
     <lb/>
     friends in this House put together. I pay him that 
     <lb/>
     compliment. He's shrewd enough to realise that 
     <lb/>
     the only way, the only way to turn our people 
     <lb/>
     from confederation is to convince them that 
     <lb/>
     they'll all have to have these town or county 
     <lb/>
     councils, that they'll have to pay taxes on their 
     <lb/>
     little spots of land, on their homes, houses and so 
     <lb/>
     on, even their fishing gear. If he can convince 
     <lb/>
     them of that, they're not going to vote for con<lb break="no"/>federation; and he knows it, so that's why he 
     <lb/>
     always talks about that. But incidentally, sir, it's 
     <lb/>
     time for Mr. Bailey to make up his mind on one 


            <cb/>
        

     point. In the one breath he tells us that we'll be 
     <lb/>
     taxed to death if we go into confederation and in 
     <lb/>
     the next breath he tells us that we'll be wards of 
     <lb/>
     Canada living on the people of Canada. Which of 
     <lb/>
     these two statements does he want us to believe? 
     <lb/>
     Or does he want us to believe both? Perhaps he 
     <lb/>
     has one eye on the people in Newfoundland who 
     <lb/>
     are scared of all those terrible taxes. For them, he 
     <lb/>
     has a lot of talk about how we'll be taxed to death, 
     <lb/>
     and the other eye he keeps on the proud people 
     <lb/>
     amongst them; for them, he has a lot of talk about 
     <lb/>
     our being too proud to live on Canada. Now 
     <lb/>
     which does he mean? We'll be wards of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     living on Canada, or does he mean that we'll be 
     <lb/>
     taxed to death by Canada? He can't have it both 
     <lb/>
     ways. Both these statements can't be true and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bailey really should make up his mind. Oh, I'm 
     <lb/>
     sorry, I got Mr. Bailey mixed up with Mr. Hig<lb break="no"/>gins. I got my notes mixed. I'll come back to Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins. I'm sorry if he felt neglected. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, Mr. Higgins tells us that an elected 
     <lb/>
     government would get better terms for New<lb break="no"/>foundland, better terms then the Ottawa delega<lb break="no"/>tion got. Now, would the members of a 
     <lb/>
     delegation to Ottawa be better men merely be<lb break="no"/>cause they had been elected to a government 
     <lb/>
     before they went to Ottawa? Would they be 
     <lb/>
     smarter because they were members of a cabinet? 
     <lb/>
     Would the Government of Canada take them 
     <lb/>
     more seriously then they took the Ottawa delega<lb break="no"/>tion? The answer to all these questions is, "No". 
     <lb/>
     Let's look at this Ottawa delegation. Mr. Bradley 
     <lb/>
     is one of the greatest lawyers this country ever 
     <lb/>
     produced - an eminent King's Counsel, a 
     <lb/>
     former Solicitor General, a former member of the 
     <lb/>
     cabinet — would he have been a better man? 
     <lb/>
     Would he have been treated with greater respect 
     <lb/>
     if he had gone there as a cabinet minister? Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins himself is a practising barrister and 
     <lb/>
     solicitor, a King's Counsel, incidentally. Would 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins become automatically a better man, 
     <lb/>
     merely by becoming a member of an elected 
     <lb/>
     government? Mr. Ashbourne is one of the best 
     <lb/>
     known and most widely respected businessmen 
     <lb/>
     in this country. He's a former member of the 
     <lb/>
     House of Assembly, a university man, an ex- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     army officer of World War I. Would it make him 
     <lb/>
     a better man just to become a member of a 
     <lb/>
     government? About the Reverend Mr. Buny, I 
     <lb/>
     will say nothing more than the fact that he is a 
     <lb/>
     university graduate, and the man who is probably 
    

            <pb n="1176" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-14_Page_1176.jpg"/>

     better informed, certainly better informed, about 
     <lb/>
     one great part of Newfoundland, namely 
     <lb/>
     Labrador, than any man who ever sat in this 
     <lb/>
     chamber. Mr. Ballam is a veteran of World War 
     <lb/>
     I. He's a major of the CLB.<ref target="#fn_06">[1]</ref> He's a businessman. 
     <lb/>
     He has had a long and honourable record as a 
     <lb/>
     trade union leader. He was the second president 
     <lb/>
     of the Newfoundland Federation of Labour. He 
     <lb/>
     has represented Newfoundland at several inter<lb break="no"/>national trade union conventions in Canada and 
     <lb/>
     the United States. His own international union 
     <lb/>
     selected him to represent Newfoundland on a tour 
     <lb/>
     of the principal paper mills of Europe just before 
     <lb/>
     the late war broke out, and he travelled widely on 
     <lb/>
     that continent. Would it make Mr. Ballam a better 
     <lb/>
     man than he is just to make him a member of a 
     <lb/>
     cabinet? Mr. Crummey is a businessman, a 
     <lb/>
     former teacher and a former inspector of schools. 
     <lb/>
     He is just as good a man now as he would be 
     <lb/>
     merely by entering a government. Well, there you 
     <lb/>
     have the Ottawa delegation and in intelligence, 
     <lb/>
     ability, integrity, that Ottawa delegation would 
     <lb/>
     be the equal of any delegation that a government 
     <lb/>
     would send up there. They were absolutely as 
     <lb/>
     competent to ascertain the terms of union as any 
     <lb/>
     cabinet committee or delegation. There's nothing 
     <lb/>
     very special about a cabinet or a government. 
     <lb/>
     Men do not become smarter or abler or more 
     <lb/>
     intelligent just by entering a government. And 
     <lb/>
     what real difference would it have been made in 
     <lb/>
     our talks with the Canadian government if we had 
     <lb/>
     had some of the government officials along with 
     <lb/>
     us? We have some able men in our civil service. 
     <lb/>
     But all they would have been able to do, if they 
     <lb/>
     had gone with us, was to supply information to 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian government. Well, we supplied 
     <lb/>
     them with all they needed. Is it suggested that the 
     <lb/>
     permanent officials would have been better able 
     <lb/>
     to understand and assess these terms then we are? 
     <lb/>
     If the officials were not needed for the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of giving information to the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and if they are no better fitted to understand 
     <lb/>
     and explain these terms than we are ourselves, 
     <lb/>
     what purpose would there have been in taking 
     <lb/>
     them along, or what did we lose by not having 
     <lb/>
     them? There were seven of us on the Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     delegation. If we had an elected government, and 
     <lb/>
     that government sent a delegation to Ottawa, then 
     <lb/>
     that government delegation would not have num<lb break="no"/>bered more than seven. And I have never known 


            <cb/>
         

     a government in Newfoundland that could have 
     <lb/>
     produced a seven-man delegation possessing a 
     <lb/>
     higher average of intelligence, ability, integrity 
     <lb/>
     and knowledge of Newfoundland than our Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa delegation. Now, let Mr. Higgins write him<lb break="no"/>self down all he likes. Let him dismiss himself, if 
     <lb/>
     he desires, as being less intelligent or knowledge<lb break="no"/>able than a cabinet minister or a civil servant. But 
     <lb/>
     let him not underestimate the abilities of his 
     <lb/>
     colleagues on the Ottawa delegation, and I'm 
     <lb/>
     sure he doesn't. They not only did a good job, as 
     <lb/>
     he himself has told us, but they did as good a job 
     <lb/>
     as any cabinet or elected government could do 
     <lb/>
     any day. We got the very best terms that the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada can offer. No Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government could possibly offer Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     better terms, not even if an elected government 
     <lb/>
     fought for it. It may be smart tactics to say as Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Higgins has said, "Yes, the terms appear to be 
     <lb/>
     fair, but an elected government would get better 
     <lb/>
     terms." That may be smart tactics, it may even be 
     <lb/>
     smart politics, but it has this serious point against 
     <lb/>
     it. It just is not true. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And then I find that Mr. Higgins said that it's 
     <lb/>
     often used as an argument against responsible 
     <lb/>
     government, where do you get the men? Where 
     <lb/>
     do you get the men to run the country? But I think 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Higgins was merely putting up a man of 
     <lb/>
     straw to knock him down. Nobody that I ever met 
     <lb/>
     has used that argument. I know that we're told 
     <lb/>
     that the argument is used, but nobody ever tells 
     <lb/>
     us who uses it. Newfoundland has the men all 
     <lb/>
     right. She has the men to run Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     she has men who could run Canada herself. It's 
     <lb/>
     not any lack of men that's in the way. It's a lack 
     <lb/>
     of means. That's what Newfoundland lacks — 
     <lb/>
     not men, but the means to do the things that those 
     <lb/>
     men would like to do. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And now I turn to Mr. Harrington. I have 
     <lb/>
     already privately complimented Mr. Harrington 
     <lb/>
     on his speech. To me it was the best speech that 
     <lb/>
     he has delivered in this chamber.... I don't agree 
     <lb/>
     with all of it, I don't need to do that, but I can still 
     <lb/>
     think it was a fine speech. I don't know if Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Harrington was aware of the fact, but at one point 
     <lb/>
     in his remarks he put his finger right on the nub 
     <lb/>
     of this whole question.... He said this: the Grey 
     <lb/>
     Book only represents the application to New<lb break="no"/>foundland of the regular features of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. That's absolutely true. These proposals or 


<note xml:id="fn_06">[1] Church Lads' Brigade.</note>

     terms of confederation are the regular, the normal 
     <lb/>
     terms of confederation. These are what the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces get. These are the things which are laid 
     <lb/>
     down in the British North America Act, Canada's 
     <lb/>
     constitution. Sir, what else could they be? Canada 
     <lb/>
     has only one constitution and so far as financial 
     <lb/>
     terms are concerned, that is what binds all parties 
     <lb/>
     to confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We hear a lot in this debate about going up to 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa and negotiating better terms. The man 
     <lb/>
     who put forth that argument about negotiating 
     <lb/>
     showed plainly that he just doesn't understand. 
     <lb/>
     He doesn't even begin to understand confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. Such a man probably has in his mind a 
     <lb/>
     picture of confederation something like this— of 
     <lb/>
     a couple of shrewd bargainers meeting and hag<lb break="no"/>gling and dickering and bargaining, each trying 
     <lb/>
     to get the best of the bargain — each trying to get 
     <lb/>
     the better of the other. And somehow, for such a 
     <lb/>
     man it seems likely that an elected government 
     <lb/>
     would get better terms. But nothing, nothing 
     <lb/>
     could be further from the truth. Whoever the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government are, and whoever it is that 
     <lb/>
     they may be dealing with, the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment is tied hand and foot in this matter. They 
     <lb/>
     cannot go outside the British North America Act 
     <lb/>
     or outside of any special regional financial arran<lb break="no"/>gement made with a group of provinces. And 
     <lb/>
     even any such regional arrangement must have 
     <lb/>
     its basis in the BNA Act. That's the hard fact that 
     <lb/>
     knocks on the head the idea of an elected govern<lb break="no"/>ment going up there and negotiating better terms. 
     <lb/>
     To start with, it's not a matter of negotiating at 
     <lb/>
     all. It's a simple matter of going up there and 
     <lb/>
     ascertaining, learning, finding out what the terms 
     <lb/>
     are. In the second place, the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada are bound by the constitution of Canada 
     <lb/>
     known as the British North America Act. So, 
     <lb/>
     when Mr. Harrington complains about our not 
     <lb/>
     having been offered special terms, he put his 
     <lb/>
     finger right on it. We had not been offered special 
     <lb/>
     terms because no Government of Canada can 
     <lb/>
     offer special terms. And drat's why all this talk 
     <lb/>
     about an elected government going up there and 
     <lb/>
     getting better terms is completely beside the 
     <lb/>
     mark. It's off the track altogether. Here are the 
     <lb/>
     terms, and on the financial side, as the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister tells us in his letter, they go as far as 
     <lb/>
     Canada can go under the circumstances. What 
     <lb/>
     circumstances? The circumstances that I have 
     <lb/>
     just mentioned. They are bound by precedent, 
    

            <cb/>
         

     bound by what is done for other provinces. 
     <lb/>
     They'd soon hear from the other provinces if 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland were offered special financial 
     <lb/>
     terms that they hadn't been offered themselves. 
     <lb/>
     In 1864 we were not offered special terms; in 
     <lb/>
     1895 we were not offered special terms; although 
     <lb/>
     on both occasions an elected government went up 
     <lb/>
     there seeking better terms, or special terms, terms 
     <lb/>
     better then any other provinces had been given. 
     <lb/>
     We've already had two elected governments that 
     <lb/>
     went to Ottawa looking for terms. And what did 
     <lb/>
     they get? The same terms as the other provinces. 
     <lb/>
     And now we're told if we'll send an elected 
     <lb/>
     government up there, that elected government 
     <lb/>
     will get better terms. That's the final, the un<lb break="no"/>answerable answer to those who tell us that an 
     <lb/>
     elected government would get better terms: the 
     <lb/>
     fact that already two elected Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     governments have gone to Ottawa and neither 
     <lb/>
     government got them. If, instead of the Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     delegation that went from this Convention, mem<lb break="no"/>bers of a government had gone up to Ottawa, the 
     <lb/>
     terms they'd have brought back to Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     would be what? They would be exactly these 
     <lb/>
     terms that we have before us today. I thank Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Harrington for bringing this matter to our atten<lb break="no"/>tion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now Mr. Harrington told us that old age pen<lb break="no"/>sions were introduced into Canada in 1927, 
     <lb/>
     which he says was years after old age pensions 
     <lb/>
     were introduced here in Newfoundland. I'm 
     <lb/>
     sorry, but Mr. Harrington is all astray there, all 
     <lb/>
     astray. Old age pensions were introduced into 
     <lb/>
     Canada 20 or 25 years before 1927. What hap<lb break="no"/>pened in 1927 was merely this, that the federal 
     <lb/>
     government began to pay part of the costs of old 
     <lb/>
     age pensions. Up to 1927 each provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ment paid its own old age pensions. The federal 
     <lb/>
     government paid nothing towards the costs. The 
     <lb/>
     trouble with that arrangement was that the richer 
     <lb/>
     provinces could and did pay bigger old age pen<lb break="no"/>sions than the other provinces could afford to pay. 
     <lb/>
     So in 1927 the federal government stepped in 
     <lb/>
     with a plan to pay part of the amount. What they 
     <lb/>
     did was to pay half the cost of old age pensions, 
     <lb/>
     leaving it to the provincial governments to pay 
     <lb/>
     the other half. Then around 1934 the federal 
     <lb/>
     government stepped up its contribution and 
     <lb/>
     began to pay three-quarters of the full amount. 
     <lb/>
     The full amount was then $25 a month. Last 
     <lb/>
     summer the Canadian government raised the pen<lb break="no"/>
       

            <pb n="1178" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-14_Page_1178.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1178</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
        

     sion to $30 a month, and of this amount they paid 
     <lb/>
     $22.50 and the provincial government pays 
     <lb/>
     $7.50. In a year or two, as Ihave said, the federal 
     <lb/>
     government is going to pay all of it, the full $30 
     <lb/>
     and make it universal to all persons reaching the 
     <lb/>
     age of 70 without any means test at all — univer<lb break="no"/>sal, an old age pension of $30 a month to all 
     <lb/>
     persons of 70 and over without regard to their 
     <lb/>
     means or lack of it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, touching on the matter of the old age 
     <lb/>
     pension, Mr. Harrington quoted a statement 
     <lb/>
     made in the House of Commons by Mr. John 
     <lb/>
     Bracken, leader of the opposition, in which he 
     <lb/>
     referred to the Canadian government's plan to 
     <lb/>
     wipe out the means test in giving old age pen<lb break="no"/>sions. I'm very glad that Mr. Harrington men<lb break="no"/>tioned this. What Mr. Bracken was talking about 
     <lb/>
     was something else altogether. The Government 
     <lb/>
     of Canada has a plan to take over the old age 
     <lb/>
     pension completely for all persons of 70 or 
     <lb/>
     over.... And then on top of that there would be a 
     <lb/>
     pension for all those who needed it between the 
     <lb/>
     ages of 65 and 70. In other words, there'd be a 
     <lb/>
     means test for those between 65 and 70 and the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada would not pay all of it but 
     <lb/>
     only half, the government in each province 
     <lb/>
     paying the other half. That's for persons between 
     <lb/>
     65 and 70 who needed it. But all who reached the 
     <lb/>
     age of 70 would receive it without any means test 
     <lb/>
     and the Government of Canada would pay the full 
     <lb/>
     amount. That's the plan to which Mr. Bracken 
     <lb/>
     referred in his speech and that plan has not yet 
     <lb/>
     come into force. It's expected to be put in force 
     <lb/>
     within the next year or two. Mr. Chairman, as we 
     <lb/>
     have only one stenographer, perhaps we might 
     <lb/>
     have a short recess. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I'll leave the chair for ten

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Harrington, in discussing 
     <lb/>
     the confederation election of 1869, tells us we did 
     <lb/>
     not have the secret ballot in 1869 when our 
     <lb/>
     people voted on confederation. But then, neither 
     <lb/>
     did the people anywhere else on this side of the 
     <lb/>
     Atlantic at that time. But what's that got to do 
     <lb/>
     with it? The fact is that there was no secret ballot 
     <lb/>
     80 years ago when our people voted on con<lb break="no"/>federation. Every voter had to walk into a booth 
     <lb/>
     and in a loud voice declare whom he was voting 
     <lb/>
     for. There was nothing secret about it. The local 
     <lb/>
     merchant or his agent was right there in the booth. 
    <lb/>

            <cb/>
          

     He was the agent for Charles Fox Bennett, the 
     <lb/>
     biggest merchant in Newfoundland, who was the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the anticonfederates. And it took a 
     <lb/>
     pretty brave fisherman in those days long ago, to 
     <lb/>
     go against the local merchant. Now, what actual<lb break="no"/>ly happened in that confederation election 80 
     <lb/>
     years ago, what did happen? Thirty members 
     <lb/>
     were elected to the House of Assembly. Ten of 
     <lb/>
     them were confederates, 20 of them were an<lb break="no"/>ticonfederates. But that does not tell the story at 
     <lb/>
     all. One thousand votes more for confederation 
     <lb/>
     in that election, just another 1,000 votes, and it 
     <lb/>
     would have been 20 confederates and 10 anticon<lb break="no"/>federates elected. If only 1,000 of those who 
     <lb/>
     voted in that election had voted the other way, we 
     <lb/>
     would have become a province in 1869. Just a 
     <lb/>
     few hundred votes more in Bonavista Bay and 
     <lb/>
     three confederates would have been elected 
     <lb/>
     there. Just another couple of hundred votes or so, 
     <lb/>
     and three confederates would have been elected 
     <lb/>
     in Trinity Bay instead of the two confederates 
     <lb/>
     who were elected.... And so it was in most dis<lb break="no"/>tricts. A mere thousand votes more for confedera<lb break="no"/>tion in the whole country and confederation 
     <lb/>
     would have won. You see, Mr. Chairman, I too 
     <lb/>
     have read the whole story of that famous election. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And while we are at it, I noticed that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Harrington did not tell us anything about the 
     <lb/>
     famous and patriotic Newfoundlanders — as a 
     <lb/>
     matter of fact Lady Squires was kind enough, a 
     <lb/>
     few months ago, to tell me of the last interview 
     <lb/>
     Sir Richard Squires gave before he died. It was 
     <lb/>
     given to the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Winnipeg Free Press</hi> in 1938. In that 
     <lb/>
     interview Sir Richard Squires declared — it was 
     <lb/>
     the last thing he ever said to the public — that 
     <lb/>
     confederation was the only hope for New<lb break="no"/>foundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, Mr. Harrington touched on the question of 
     <lb/>
     education and referred to the clause about educa<lb break="no"/>tion in the terms of union. There's really only one 
     <lb/>
     point in his remarks on this subject that calls for 
     <lb/>
     any cement. He will not, I think, deny that the 
     <lb/>
     education clause protects all our rights as they are 
     <lb/>
     now. Every denomination with its own schools at 
     <lb/>
     the time of union will go right on with its own 
     <lb/>
     schools just so long as it wishes to. That right is 
     <lb/>
     guaranteed in the terms. Not only that, but each 
     <lb/>
     denomination is guaranteed its rights, to its share 
     <lb/>
     of the public money spent on education. Then 
     <lb/>
     again, if any two or more denominations should 
     <lb/>
     ever wish to unite or amalgamate their schools, 
  

            <pb n="1179" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-14_Page_1179.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1179</fw>
         

     that right is guaranteed also together with their 
     <lb/>
     right to their share of the public funds spent on 
     <lb/>
     education. In other words, sir, all rights are 
     <lb/>
     guaranteed. We have in Newfoundland what is 
     <lb/>
     known as denominational education. Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion does not change that one bit, not one bit.... 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Harrington does not deny this. But what he 
     <lb/>
     does suggest is that under confederation this 
     <lb/>
     guarantee might be upset or cast aside. And what 
     <lb/>
     reason does he suggest? The Manitoba school 
     <lb/>
     case, which was one of the most famous cases of 
     <lb/>
     its kind in North American history, about as 
     <lb/>
     famous as the Oregon school case. The Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     school case brought the Government of Canada 
     <lb/>
     toppling down when it happened And that case 
     <lb/>
     taught all the governments of Canada a lesson 
     <lb/>
     they'll never forget. It taught them this lesson — 
     <lb/>
     not, not to meddle in educational matters in the 
     <lb/>
     provinces. Why, you couldn't dynamite the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada today into getting itself 
     <lb/>
     mixed up in educational matters. They won't 
     <lb/>
     touch it... In our clause on education all 
     <lb/>
     denominational rights are guaranteed and our 
     <lb/>
     provincial government is not allowed to make 
     <lb/>
     any laws or changes that would prejudicially 
     <lb/>
     affect the rights of any denomination. But sup<lb break="no"/>pose some provincial government ever tried to do 
     <lb/>
     so. What then? Would the denomination con<lb break="no"/>cerned have to go to the Government of Canada 
     <lb/>
     seeking redress? No, they would not. The 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada wouldn't be in the picture 
     <lb/>
     at all. They would go to the Supreme Court of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, and there they would get justice. 
     <lb/>
     The Supreme Court would have to carry out this 
     <lb/>
     clause, which guarantees the rights of all the 
     <lb/>
     denominations. And if by any chance, if by any 
     <lb/>
     remote chance, our own Supreme Court failed to 
     <lb/>
     carry out this clause, that would not end it either. 
     <lb/>
     For then, the case could be appealed to the 
     <lb/>
     Supreme Court of Canada itself. That, sir, is a 
     <lb/>
     vast improvement over the Manitoba clause. It's 
     <lb/>
     not with governments or cabinets or parliaments 
     <lb/>
     we'd have to deal, but with the very seat of justice 
     <lb/>
     — the Supreme Court itself. Mr. Harrington can 
     <lb/>
     rest his mind in this matter. I can tell him this. I 
     <lb/>
     for one would not be so foolish, so short-sighted 
     <lb/>
     as to advocate confederation if this education 
     <lb/>
     matter had not been fixed up to the satisfaction of 
     <lb/>
     all concerned. Not for one split second would I 
     <lb/>
     waste my breath advocating confederation if this 
     <lb/>
     education matter had not been thoroughly and 
   

            <cb/>
        

     absolutely fixed up. I know my country, sir, 
     <lb/>
     believe me. I know the deep and unshakeable 
     <lb/>
     loyalty of our people — all our people — to their 
     <lb/>
     denominations. I know the loyalty of our people 
     <lb/>
     to their various school systems. We have a school 
     <lb/>
     system which is a Newfoundland system, that has 
     <lb/>
     grown up out of our Newfoundland ideals, our 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland outlook on life. It is a system that 
     <lb/>
     has grown up naturally, and I am the last person 
     <lb/>
     who would upset it or allow it to be upset. Believe 
     <lb/>
     me, I went to Ottawa with that thought uppermost 
     <lb/>
     in mind. I cared not what material advantages 
     <lb/>
     there might be for us in confederation. My mind 
     <lb/>
     was made up. I was detemiined not to advocate 
     <lb/>
     confederation unless and until all denominational 
     <lb/>
     rights were fully guaranteed. Sir, it's bad enough 
     <lb/>
     to have to fight prejudice, but the one thing I will 
     <lb/>
     not fight is the deepest loyalty of our people. 
     <lb/>
     Thank God I do not have to do it, for the school 
     <lb/>
     rights of all our denominations have been fully 
     <lb/>
     protected and guaranteed. All education matters 
     <lb/>
     under confederation have been left just where 
     <lb/>
     they belong — right here in Newfoundland. So 
     <lb/>
     that's one question that won't turn our people 
     <lb/>
     against confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I turn to Mr. Butt. I am frankly puzzled to 
     <lb/>
     understand what Mr. Butt was getting at when he 
     <lb/>
     mentioned the Sacco-Vanzetti case. He was 
     <lb/>
     speaking at the time about the Privy Council's 
     <lb/>
     Labrador boundary award, and the impression I 
     <lb/>
     gathered from his remarks was that he was trying 
     <lb/>
     to make out that maybe the Privy Council award 
     <lb/>
     is not binding and final seeing what happened in 
     <lb/>
     the Sacco-Vanzetti case... I agree with you, sir, 
     <lb/>
     it is a matter for smiling. What the Sacco-Vanzet<lb break="no"/>ti case in Boston has to do with the Privy Council 
     <lb/>
     of Great Britain, is frankly more than I can see. 
     <lb/>
     Sacco and Vanzetti were sentenced to death by a 
     <lb/>
     court in Massachusetts in the United States. It 
     <lb/>
     was admittedly a terrible miscarriage of justice 
     <lb/>
     But what has that got to do with the character or 
     <lb/>
     the nature of the Privy Council, or with a decision 
     <lb/>
     of the Privy Council of Great Britain? Instead of 
     <lb/>
     hinting, why doesn't Mr. Butt come right out and 
     <lb/>
     say definitely that he places no dependence on the 
     <lb/>
     decision of the Privy Council? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> says if you give away your control 
     <lb/>
     over your communications, if you give away your 
     <lb/>
     right to control your fishery, if you give away 
     <lb/>
     your right to set your own system of taxation, if 
     <lb/>
     you give away these rights you're in a bad way. 
 

            <pb n="1180" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-14_Page_1180.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1180</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
         

     Now, just what does that mean? What does it boil 
     <lb/>
     down to? Mr. Butt could possibly mean that the 
     <lb/>
     federal government will operate our postal 
     <lb/>
     telegraph system, that the federal government 
     <lb/>
     will spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on 
     <lb/>
     the protection and encouragement of our 
     <lb/>
     fisheries, and that in place of our present unfair, 
     <lb/>
     unjust, and oppressive system of taxation, which 
     <lb/>
     crushes the life out of our producers, we'd have 
     <lb/>
     the very much fairer taxation system of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     which places the greatest burden on the people 
     <lb/>
     best able to bear it. That is, in place of taxation 
     <lb/>
     which puts a terrible burden on our basic in<lb break="no"/>dustry, we'd get one in its place that would lift a 
     <lb/>
     great portion of that burden off our producers. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Butt is welcome to the belief that this would 
     <lb/>
     be bad for Newfoundland I believe that it would 
     <lb/>
     be the best thing that ever happened to our 
     <lb/>
     country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then Mr. Butt gave us a homily on the subject 
     <lb/>
     of morale — of faith in ourselves, pride in our 
     <lb/>
     country. I listened with a great deal of interest to 
     <lb/>
     this dissertation because he was expressing the 
     <lb/>
     view that I happen to share. Is it too much for me 
     <lb/>
     to say that more perhaps than any other man in 
     <lb/>
     this country, I have pointed to the desirability, 
     <lb/>
     indeed the need, for pride in one's country? I was 
     <lb/>
     on the air every weeknight for nearly seven years, 
     <lb/>
     and I don't think I ever tired of driving home the 
     <lb/>
     importance of taking legitimate pride in every<lb break="no"/>thing that's good about our country and about 
     <lb/>
     ourselves. I delved into our country's history to 
     <lb/>
     bring out examples of the fine things our people 
     <lb/>
     have done. I roamed all around the world in my 
     <lb/>
     mind to find examples of Newfoundlanders who 
     <lb/>
     had made good in other lands. As Florenz Zieg<lb break="no"/>feld was said to glorify the American girl in his 
     <lb/>
     famous follies, so I tried to glorify Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     and Newfoundlandcrs nearly every night for 
     <lb/>
     seven years. I take back none of that. I still think 
     <lb/>
     we are a fine people and we can hold our heads 
     <lb/>
     up with the best of them. I still think we have very 
     <lb/>
     real possibilites of greatness within us. But here 
     <lb/>
     in this Convention we are not theorists, we are 
     <lb/>
     not here to spin fine theories, however true and 
     <lb/>
     however beautiful. We are here as elected repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of the people. We are here for a par<lb break="no"/>ticular purpose....<ref target="#fn_07">[1]</ref> A practical purpose. We 
     <lb/>
     would be false to our people if we allowed our<lb break="no"/>selves to be carried away by fears, if we failed to 
    

            <cb/>
         

     keep our feet planted firmly on the ground. I like 
     <lb/>
     to think of the remark Major Cashin made to Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Neill, the Commissioner for Public Utilities, 
     <lb/>
     when, a committee interviewed Mr. Neill about 
     <lb/>
     Gander. When we tried to find out definitely who 
     <lb/>
     was going to pay the operating loss on the airport, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Neill made the remark, "I have faith, I have 
     <lb/>
     faith". "Yes," said Major Cashin, "we all have 
     <lb/>
     faith, but you can't balance a budget on faith." 
     <lb/>
     I've never forgotten that. Neither, sir, can you put 
     <lb/>
     food in your childrens' stomachs, or clothes on 
     <lb/>
     their backs, just by faith in a theory of national 
     <lb/>
     pride. What good would national pride have been 
     <lb/>
     to the 90,000 men, women, and children who 
     <lb/>
     suffered and starved on the dole in this country? 
     <lb/>
     When the icy blasts of world depression strike us 
     <lb/>
     again, when our fish is once more a drag on the 
     <lb/>
     market as it will be, when our income dwindles 
     <lb/>
     to a shadow of what it is today, our people will 
     <lb/>
     want something more substantial than pride of 
     <lb/>
     country. This very winter there are thousands of 
     <lb/>
     our men who can't find a day's work, many 
     <lb/>
     hundreds of them veterans of this late war, who 
     <lb/>
     risked their lives for the brave new world they 
     <lb/>
     were promised. They demonstrated their pride of 
     <lb/>
     country but they can't live on it this winter. They 
     <lb/>
     can't balance their family budgets on it. Let's be 
     <lb/>
     practical about this thing, Mr. Chairman. We all 
     <lb/>
     know our Newfoundland people are as fine a race 
     <lb/>
     of men as you'll find in Canada or the United 
     <lb/>
     States or any other country in this world. They 
     <lb/>
     have magnificent qualities of heart and mind. 
     <lb/>
     They have courage and endurance. They know 
     <lb/>
     how to work and they're not lazy. The thing that's 
     <lb/>
     wrong with this country is not our people; but 
     <lb/>
     there is something seriously wrong. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The thing that's most wrong about our country 
     <lb/>
     is that there just are not enough of us. We're only 
     <lb/>
     a handful of people, 327,000 souls scattered 
     <lb/>
     about the island living in 1,300 separate little 
     <lb/>
     towns, settled villages — the population of only 
     <lb/>
     one small city, if we were all put together. A 
     <lb/>
     mutual friend of Mr. Butt's and mine said that if 
     <lb/>
     he took a week off, and practised hard, he could 
     <lb/>
     learn off by heart the names of our entire popula<lb break="no"/>tion —— if not their Christian names, then certainly 
     <lb/>
     their surnames. It's a hard country to govern, for 
     <lb/>
     which to provide all the varied public services 
     <lb/>
     that are needed, because we're so small in num<lb break="no"/>ber and so scattered, scattered. And we have

     punished ourselves as a people, or we've been 
     <lb/>
     punished, with a system of taxation that makes 
     <lb/>
     decent living absolutely impossible except when 
     <lb/>
     there's a global war raging. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Above everything else, what's wrong with our 
     <lb/>
     country is the fact that we have persisted and 
     <lb/>
     insisted on acting as though we were a nation, or 
     <lb/>
     as though we thought we could be a nation. 
     <lb/>
     Whereas the fact is we're only a large family. 
     <lb/>
     Most of our trouble stems from that misguided 
     <lb/>
     policy. Sir, you could bring Winston Churchill 
     <lb/>
     and Ernest Bevin and Herbert Morrison to New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and along with them Mackenzie King 
     <lb/>
     and Franklin D. Roosevelt if he were alive, and 
     <lb/>
     Lloyd George too if he were alive, and you could 
     <lb/>
     put those men at the head of affairs in New<lb break="no"/>foundland, They could do their best, and their 
     <lb/>
     best would not be good enough. They would fail. 
     <lb/>
     They would be licked before they started, be<lb break="no"/>cause it's impossible to make things right for the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country so long as we hold out 
     <lb/>
     stubbornly against the one thing that can make a 
     <lb/>
     prosperous Newfoundland really possible. They 
     <lb/>
     would fail so long as they tried to run New<lb break="no"/>foundland as a separate independent country 
     <lb/>
     pretending that it was a nation. They would fail 
     <lb/>
     so long as they failed to link Newfoundland onto 
     <lb/>
     a much greater, at much larger, a much more 
     <lb/>
     stable unit. That's the first lesson we all need to 
     <lb/>
     learn when we come to figure what's wrong with 
     <lb/>
     our country and what the cure might be. To stay 
     <lb/>
     isolated from the great continent besides which 
     <lb/>
     God placed us, to persist in a mistaken and hope<lb break="no"/>less independence, to continue our vain hope of 
     <lb/>
     paddling our own canoe, that way has produced 
     <lb/>
     untold misery for our people and will produce 
     <lb/>
     more misery if we don't wake up to our mistake. 
     <lb/>
     And it is also needless, Mr. Chairman, so need<lb break="no"/>less. A great British nation is asked by us, asked 
     <lb/>
     by this Convention, to receive a delegation. They 
     <lb/>
     received the delegation, and they say, "We invite 
     <lb/>
     you to link up with us to make one great strong 
     <lb/>
     British nation stretching all the way from St. 
     <lb/>
     John's to Vancouver." And what do we do? What 
     <lb/>
     do we do? We look suspiciously at them. We 
     <lb/>
     thought it was a land full of Hitlers, Hitlers trying 
     <lb/>
     to gobble us up, trying to rob us of our little store 
     <lb/>
     of natural resources, trying to get rich out of us. 
     <lb/>
     We pick holes in the terms and conditions they 
     <lb/>
     offer us. The moment we receive their invitation 
     <lb/>
     to join up with them, we get suspicious and put 
 

            <cb/>
     

     up every trumpery excuse we can think of for not 
     <lb/>
     accepting. Yes, by all means let us have national 
     <lb/>
     pride, but let us also have national common 
     <lb/>
     sense. Now, sir, I turn to Mr. Northcott. Just two 
     <lb/>
     points. He tells us he wants out Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     people to know how the burden of taxes under 
     <lb/>
     confederation would compare with our burden of 
     <lb/>
     taxes today. He asks the question, "Would 
     <lb/>
     federal, provincial and town council taxes all put 
     <lb/>
     together he more or less than we're paying out 
     <lb/>
     now in taxes?" That's a very fair question — a 
     <lb/>
     very practical question and a very useful ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and I thank Mr. Northcott for asking it. 
     <lb/>
     Today our taxes amount to about $40 million a 
     <lb/>
     year, not counting municipal or town council 
     <lb/>
     taxes. That's what we're paying the Commission 
     <lb/>
     of Government, $40 million a year. Under con<lb break="no"/>federation we would pay taxes to both the federal 
     <lb/>
     government of Canada and the provincial 
     <lb/>
     government of Newfoundland. What would these 
     <lb/>
     amount to? That's what Mr. Northcott wants the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland to know. The Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada estimates that they would collect 
     <lb/>
     $20 million a year profits in federal taxes. That is 
     <lb/>
     if the present rates of taxation continue as they 
     <lb/>
     are in Canada, if they don't fall ... and if the 
     <lb/>
     present level of economic activity stays as it is 
     <lb/>
     now in Newfoundland. Very few of us expect it 
     <lb/>
     to do that, for already it has started to drop. $20 
     <lb/>
     million, the Government of Canada would take. 
     <lb/>
     The provincial government of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     would collect $5 million or $6 million a year from 
     <lb/>
     us in taxes. At least it would for the first eight 
     <lb/>
     years of union. Well, that's a total of say $26 
     <lb/>
     million a year between the two governments. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Northcott can add to that if he likes. He can add 
     <lb/>
     a couple of million to the provincial budget and 
     <lb/>
     he can add a couple of million to the federal 
     <lb/>
     budget and get a grand total of $30 million. Even 
     <lb/>
     then, our total taxation would fall $10 million 
     <lb/>
     short of what we're paying now. We're paying 
     <lb/>
     $120 a head to our government now. We'd pay 
     <lb/>
     at the most $91 a head under confederation, a 
     <lb/>
     saving of $29 a head. Mr. Northcott may or may 
     <lb/>
     not be willing to accept my figures. So I'll stretch 
     <lb/>
     the thing all out of shape to see how he'll like it 
     <lb/>
     then. Let's say the Government of Canada are as 
     <lb/>
     much as 50% out in their estimate — 50% out. 
     <lb/>
     They say they'll collect $20 million from us. Let 
     <lb/>
     us say they'll collect $30 million from us. I say 
     <lb/>
     the provincial government will collect $5-6 mil<lb break="no"/>
          

            <pb n="1182" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-14_Page_1182.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1182</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
        

     lion from us. Let's say that I'm out as much as 
     <lb/>
     50% in my estimate. Let's say it would be $9 
     <lb/>
     million a year that the provincial government 
     <lb/>
     would collect. In that case, stretching it like that, 
     <lb/>
     the two governments between them would take 
     <lb/>
     $39 million from us a year, or still $1 million less 
     <lb/>
     then we're paying now. Mr. Northcott may say 
     <lb/>
     that in that case, we'd only be $1 million dollars 
     <lb/>
     better off under confederation, just $1 million 
     <lb/>
     dollars a year better off. But that is not so. Besides 
     <lb/>
     that $1 million a year, 120,000 of our children 
     <lb/>
     under the age of 16 would be getting $8.5 million 
     <lb/>
     a year in family allowances, and 10,000 of our 
     <lb/>
     senior citizens would be getting $2.5 million a 
     <lb/>
     year in old age pensions. Our railroaders would 
     <lb/>
     be better off, our civil servants would be better 
     <lb/>
     off, our cost of living would be lower than it ever 
     <lb/>
     could be without confederation, and our people 
     <lb/>
     would have the satisfaction of knowing that their 
     <lb/>
     country was linked up with that great British 
     <lb/>
     nation we call Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> asks me to say something on the 
     <lb/>
     question of divorce...<ref target="#fn_08">[1]</ref> I am trying to fathom why 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Northcott is so interested in the question of 
     <lb/>
     divorce. I know Mr. Northcott is happily married, 
     <lb/>
     and that's why I've been trying to figure why he's 
     <lb/>
     been so interested in having me say something 
     <lb/>
     about divorce in case we go into confederation. 
     <lb/>
     I'm sure that he has no motive except a perfectly 
     <lb/>
     good one. And so for that reason I'm going to say 
     <lb/>
     something about divorce in case we become a 
     <lb/>
     province of Canada. Sir, we have no divorce laws 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland. We never did, and 1 hope we 
     <lb/>
     never will. Those provinces of Canada that are in 
     <lb/>
     the union now, some of them had divorce laws 
     <lb/>
     before confederation was started in 1867. They 
     <lb/>
     took their own laws into the union with them.... I 
     <lb/>
     don't think that any other province since then has 
     <lb/>
     passed any divorce law of its own. If New<lb break="no"/>foundland goes into confederation, I would give 
     <lb/>
     it as my opinion that it's very unlikely, highly 
     <lb/>
     unlikely, that we'll ever get a House of Assembly 
     <lb/>
     elected here that will pass a divorce law, I don't 
     <lb/>
     think that's likely to happen. If Mr. Northcott was 
     <lb/>
     a member of that provincial House of Assembly, 
     <lb/>
     I don't think he'll vote for any law to grant 
     <lb/>
     divorce in Newfoundland. I know I won't. I don't 
     <lb/>
     think Mr. Starkes or Mr. Vincent or Mr. Harmon 
     <lb/>
     or Mr. Jackman or Mr. Watton or any of us who 
     <lb/>
     should happen to be in the provincial legislature 


            <cb/>


     of Newfoundland, will ever vote to pass a divorce 
     <lb/>
     law. That's very unlikely. But even if we don't, 
     <lb/>
     we might still be able to get divorced, that is true. 
     <lb/>
     We could do as the people do in the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec. Quebec has no divorce law — never did 
     <lb/>
     have one and I don't suppose she ever will have 
     <lb/>
     one.... There are only two possible grounds for 
     <lb/>
     divorce — adultery and desertion. And if a per<lb break="no"/>son in Quebec wishes to get a divorce, what he's 
     <lb/>
     got to do, or she, is this: go to the Parliament of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, the Parliament mind you, and get the 
     <lb/>
     Parliament to pass an act for him or for her, one 
     <lb/>
     law for him or for her, not a law for everyone or 
     <lb/>
     for a lot of people, just for him or for her. First of 
     <lb/>
     all the application is put before the Senate of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. There's a committee of the Senate — 
     <lb/>
     they're poisoned with it, they hate it, it stinks, 
     <lb/>
     they don't like it, this committee — but it has to 
     <lb/>
     go before that committee. The committee passes 
     <lb/>
     on it, like a court. And if the committee agrees 
     <lb/>
     that the evidence that's produced is good enough, 
     <lb/>
     they will pass a law in the Senate, then from the 
     <lb/>
     Senate it goes to the House of Commons and if 
     <lb/>
     they agree with it, the Governor-General of 
     <lb/>
     Canada signs that bill, and that one person is 
     <lb/>
     divorced. Or rather, I should say those two per<lb break="no"/>sons are divorced. If we become a province we 
     <lb/>
     can do that. A person in Newfoundland wishing 
     <lb/>
     a divorce can hire a lawyer, and the lawyer can 
     <lb/>
     prepare his case. If he can prove to the Senate of 
     <lb/>
     Canada either adultery or desenion, the Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment may pass an act divorcing that one person 
     <lb/>
     from his spouse. That costs from $1,000 to 
     <lb/>
     $1,500. So while I am not prepared to guarantee 
     <lb/>
     that under confederation there would never be 
     <lb/>
     anyone divorced, I am firmly convinced that if 
     <lb/>
     you have one or two or three people getting 
     <lb/>
     divorced, it's as many as you'll have. If you take 
     <lb/>
     this country in the last number of years you'll find 
     <lb/>
     this, that although we have no divorce law there 
     <lb/>
     are still Newfoundlanders who get divorces. Oh 
     <lb/>
     yes, there are Newfoundlanders who get divor<lb break="no"/>ces, not in Newfoundland, and they marry again. 
     <lb/>
     We have people who have been divorced from 
     <lb/>
     their first wives and who are now married to a 
     <lb/>
     second wife although we have no divorce law. So 
     <lb/>
     under confederation there might be one or two or 
     <lb/>
     three cases. I don't think we need to worry about 
     <lb/>
     it. We needn't lose any sleep. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     I'm sorry that Mr. Hillier is not present

     tonight, because there is just one point in Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Hillier's very fair and honourable speech of 
     <lb/>
     yesterday, one point on which I wish to offer a 
     <lb/>
     word of comment. It was what he said about 
     <lb/>
     Canada's old age pension scheme. Now I happen 
     <lb/>
     to know that Mr. Hillier is deeply interested in the 
     <lb/>
     subject of our senior citizens, our old people. I 
     <lb/>
     agree with Mr. Hillier absolutely when he says 
     <lb/>
     that the pensions should start before a man or a 
     <lb/>
     women gets to be 70 years of age. I think he's 
     <lb/>
     perfectly right. And I'm sure that he'll agree with 
     <lb/>
     me when I say that 75 is a criminal and shameful 
     <lb/>
     age limit to place on our senior citizens before 
     <lb/>
     they are entitled to the old age pension. And that's 
     <lb/>
     the age, 75, an elderly person has to reach in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland today before we pay him the pen<lb break="no"/>sion. At least Canada is five years better off in 
     <lb/>
     that way than Newfoundland because she gives 
     <lb/>
     the pension at 70. And I agree with Mr. Hillier 
     <lb/>
     that $30 a month is not a cent too much to pay to 
     <lb/>
     our worn-out toilers, but surely he'll agree with 
     <lb/>
     me when I say that $30 a month for one is a lot 
     <lb/>
     better then $30 a quarter for two. That's what we 
     <lb/>
     pay here in Newfoundland for two elderly per<lb break="no"/>sons, $30 a quarter for the two of them, $10 a 
     <lb/>
     month. Just compare two elderly persons in the 
     <lb/>
     two countries. In Newfoundland they have to live 
     <lb/>
     to be 75 before they get the pension, in Canada 
     <lb/>
     70. In Newfoundland we pay two persons $30 a 
     <lb/>
     quarter between them, in Canada they pay $30 a 
     <lb/>
     month to each of them. What's the difference? 
     <lb/>
     The old people in Canada get $60 a month be<lb break="no"/>tween them, whereas two old people in New<lb break="no"/>foundland get $10 a month between them. The 
     <lb/>
     old couple in Canada are $50 a month better off 
     <lb/>
     than our old couple, and that's $600 a year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I won't go over the question of a pensioner's 
     <lb/>
     property again. I've already explained that 
     <lb/>
     several times. It's enough now to say this, that if 
     <lb/>
     that bit of property is worth $2,000 net or less, the 
     <lb/>
     pensioner is free to do whatever he likes with it, 
     <lb/>
     give it to whoever he likes. It covers the vast 
     <lb/>
     quota of the 10,000 old people who would receive 
     <lb/>
     the old age pension if we go into confederation. 
     <lb/>
     I would ask Mr. Hillier to cast his mind over his 
     <lb/>
     own native home, and the other settlements he 
     <lb/>
     knows in his district, and ask himself how many 
     <lb/>
     persons of 70 and over have property that would 
     <lb/>
     fetch over $2,000 cash if it had to be sold. For that 
     <lb/>
     matter, I would ask all our members, apart from 
     <lb/>
     those from the capital city and perhaps Grand 
   

            <cb/>
      

     Falls and Corner Brook and one or two other 
     <lb/>
     places, I'd ask all our members to cast their minds 
     <lb/>
     over their districts and ask themselves the same 
     <lb/>
     question. And don't forget, Mr. Chairman, that if 
     <lb/>
     an old age pensioner has property that would 
     <lb/>
     fetch over $2,000, the sons or other relatives still 
     <lb/>
     have a way to get that property when the old age 
     <lb/>
     pensioner passes away. They can contribute 
     <lb/>
     regularly and reasonably to the support of the old 
     <lb/>
     age pensioner for at least the last three years of 
     <lb/>
     his life. That's fair enough, isn't it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, I have only two more points. Ever since 
     <lb/>
     the confederation terms were laid before us, 
     <lb/>
     speaker after speaker amongst the anticon<lb break="no"/>federates has harped and harped and harped on 
     <lb/>
     the matter of taxes. It's been almost the second 
     <lb/>
     word in every speech. The impression aimed at 
     <lb/>
     is that our people would be smothered by taxes, 
     <lb/>
     that they'd be taxed to death if we enter con<lb break="no"/>federation. There may be a country somewhere 
     <lb/>
     in this world where they have no taxes. If there 
     <lb/>
     is, I've never heard of it, unless it's a country 
     <lb/>
     without a government. All countries have taxes, 
     <lb/>
     as we know so well here in Newfoundland. They 
     <lb/>
     say there are two sure things for all mankind — 
     <lb/>
     taxes and death. I certainly don't say that if we 
     <lb/>
     enter confederation there'll be no taxes. Now 
     <lb/>
     there are many principles of taxation, but the 
     <lb/>
     greatest principles are these two. First, that there 
     <lb/>
     should be equality of sacrifice in paying taxes. 
     <lb/>
     The second principle is that it's not so much how 
     <lb/>
     much taxes you pay, as what you have left after 
     <lb/>
     you have paid your taxes. These are the two 
     <lb/>
     greatest principles of taxation. I know of no 
     <lb/>
     country in the world that offends against those 
     <lb/>
     two principles as much as our own New<lb break="no"/>foundland does. Our chief way of raising taxes in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland is through the customs tariff, the 
     <lb/>
     customs duties on our imports. This is called 
     <lb/>
     indirect taxation. Of course there are other kinds 
     <lb/>
     of indirect taxation as well as customs duties, but 
     <lb/>
     what do we mean by indirect taxes? If a govern<lb break="no"/>ment sends a bill to a man for a certain amount of 
     <lb/>
     money as his share of paying the cost of running 
     <lb/>
     the country, and if the man knows exactly how 
     <lb/>
     much it is and puts his hand in his pocket and pays 
     <lb/>
     the government himself, then that is direct taxa<lb break="no"/>tion. It is paid directly by the person who is 
     <lb/>
     supposed to pay it. It goes direct from the tax<lb break="no"/>payer to the government, so to speak... But with 
     <lb/>
     indirect taxation you have something altogether 
   

            <pb n="1184" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-14_Page_1184.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">1184</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw>
            

     different. In this case, the taxpayer doesn't put his 
     <lb/>
     hand in his pocket and hand over the taxes to the 
     <lb/>
     government direct himself. With indirect taxa<lb break="no"/>tion somebody else puts his hand in his pocket, 
     <lb/>
     takes out the money and hands it over to the 
     <lb/>
     government, not the man who pays it at all. In 
     <lb/>
     fact, the man who really pays it doesn't know just 
     <lb/>
     what he is paying, because it was taken out of his 
     <lb/>
     pocket by somebody else. And that somebody 
     <lb/>
     else forgot to tell him how much he took out for 
     <lb/>
     taxes. If a fisherman goes into a shop and pays 
     <lb/>
     $50 for a bedstead, he pays $50 for it. Does the 
     <lb/>
     shopkeeper tell him how much of that $50 goes 
     <lb/>
     to the government in tax? No. And all the fisher<lb break="no"/>man knows is that he paid $50 for the bedstead. 
     <lb/>
     He knows that he probably paid some tax on it, 
     <lb/>
     that some part of that $50 went to the govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but how much? He doesn't know. If he had 
     <lb/>
     a copy of the customs tariff he could look it up 
     <lb/>
     and find out that the duty on that bedstead is 
     <lb/>
     50%.... But not only does some of that $50 go to 
     <lb/>
     the government in tax, but the shopkeeper has 
     <lb/>
     made a profit on that duty — I don't mean a profit 
     <lb/>
     on the bedstead itself now, but a profit on the duty 
     <lb/>
     that was paid on the bedstead. He doesn't tell the 
     <lb/>
     fisherman that and there's no reason why he 
     <lb/>
     should. The shopkeeper has already paid the 
     <lb/>
     duties to the government. He has paid out that 
     <lb/>
     money and he, the shopkeeper, is entitled to make 
     <lb/>
     a profit on the money he puts out, whether it's put 
     <lb/>
     out to buy the bedstead in Canada in the first 
     <lb/>
     place, or to pay the government the 50% duty on 
     <lb/>
     it. It's all the same to the shopkeeper. He's in<lb break="no"/>vested the money and he's expecting to make a 
     <lb/>
     profit on it. And that's how it goes, all the way 
     <lb/>
     through, wherever a customs duty is paid on an 
     <lb/>
     article. A profit is made on that duty as well as on 
     <lb/>
     the article itself. Two profits — and they both 
     <lb/>
     come out of the customers' pockets. Even when 
     <lb/>
     the customer has some idea of this, he usually 
     <lb/>
     doesn't know how much more the article cost him 
     <lb/>
     because of the duty and the profit on the duty. 
     <lb/>
     That's what we call indirect taxation. And that's 
     <lb/>
     how the bulk of our govemment's money is made 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Suppose the wholesale merchant here in St. 
     <lb/>
     John's imports $100 worth of goods from 
     <lb/>
     Canada. He pays $100 wholesale for the goods in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. The goods are all at the wharf, but can 
     <lb/>
     he go and take it off to his own store? No, not till 
     <lb/>
     he pays the government say $40 duty. So they 
  

            <cb/>
          

     cost him $140 landed in his store. So he puts his 
     <lb/>
     profit on the $140.... Say his profit rate is 20%, 
     <lb/>
     that's $28. So he sells the goods to a retail shop<lb break="no"/>keeper for $168.... The government has its $40 
     <lb/>
     tax, the wholesale merchant has his $100 back 
     <lb/>
     and his $40 back, together with his profit on $100 
     <lb/>
     and his profit on the $40 duty. Now the retail 
     <lb/>
     shopkeeper has the goods. They cost him $168. 
     <lb/>
     So he puts on his 20% profit, and that makes the 
     <lb/>
     goods worth $201. The retail shopkeeper sells 
     <lb/>
     them to the public, to the fishermen, and loggers, 
     <lb/>
     and miners, and everybody else, for $201. Now 
     <lb/>
     what's happened? The wholesaler pays the duty 
     <lb/>
     tax to the government and gets it back with a 
     <lb/>
     profit from the retailer. The retailer gets it all 
     <lb/>
     back, together with his own profit from the 
     <lb/>
     public. The customer, the consumer, the man 
     <lb/>
     who finally forks over his money across the 
     <lb/>
     counter, he pays it all — a tax to the government, 
     <lb/>
     a profit to the wholesaler on the tax, and the 
     <lb/>
     retailer's profit on the wholesaler's profit — 
     <lb/>
     profit piled on profit. And the customer pays it all 
     <lb/>
     and wonders why the cost of living is so high. 
     <lb/>
     Yes, and some of them shiver when they're told 
     <lb/>
     in this Convention about the awful taxes they'll 
     <lb/>
     have to pay if we go in with Canada. That system 
     <lb/>
     of taxation is one of the most unjust, yes, one of 
     <lb/>
     the most vicious in this world today. It's bad 
     <lb/>
     enough to have to pay taxes to the government, 
     <lb/>
     but a lot worse when private individuals, private 
     <lb/>
     businessmen, are able to make their own private 
     <lb/>
     profit on those very taxes. That's what we get 
     <lb/>
     when we raise the bulk of our taxes through 
     <lb/>
     customs duties. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Last year we paid the government, all of us 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders, around $20 million in cus<lb break="no"/>toms duties. That was bad enough, and it certain<lb break="no"/>ly drove the cost of living up high enough, but on 
     <lb/>
     top of that $20 million we paid at least another 
     <lb/>
     $5 million to the wholesale and retail merchants 
     <lb/>
     between them as profits on that $20 million duty. 
     <lb/>
     You see, sir, the merchants paid the duty to the 
     <lb/>
     government. They laid out their money to pay the 
     <lb/>
     duty and they were fully entitled to make a profit 
     <lb/>
     for themselves on that money. I'm not saying one 
     <lb/>
     word against the merchants on this point. We 
     <lb/>
     can't blame them a bit. They have got to do it if 
     <lb/>
     they're going to stay in business. But the fact 
     <lb/>
     remains that the general trade of the country last 
     <lb/>
     year took at least $5 million out of all of us, to 
     <lb/>
     compensate themselves for collecting the 


            <pb n="1185" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-14_Page_1185.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1185</fw>
         

     government's revenue for them. They're agents 
     <lb/>
     for the government, collecting the government's 
     <lb/>
     revenue... That's indirect taxation. That's cus<lb break="no"/>toms duties. That's how the system works, and 
     <lb/>
     that's one of the biggest reasons why the people 
     <lb/>
     of this country are suffering the way they are 
     <lb/>
     today from the high cost of living, and always did. 
     <lb/>
     You can take note of this fact, Mr. Chairman, the 
     <lb/>
     higher the prices go in the countries we buy the 
     <lb/>
     goods from, the worse this position becomes. I 
     <lb/>
     told you what happens when the article costs 
     <lb/>
     $100 abroad, and the profit is made on the duty, 
     <lb/>
     but if the price goes way up, say to $150 in the 
     <lb/>
     States or Canada, then the duty is no longer $20 
     <lb/>
     but $30, and the profits made on the duty are no 
     <lb/>
     longer what they were in the first case, but that 
     <lb/>
     much higher, half as high again. The higher the 
     <lb/>
     prices in the countries we import from, the more 
     <lb/>
     duties we pay, and the more profits we pay on the 
     <lb/>
     duties, and so it goes until the ordinary man can't 
     <lb/>
     live at all. His dollar shrinks and shrinks and 
     <lb/>
     shrinks. It'll buy less and less all the time. And 
     <lb/>
     who feels it worst of all? The poorest of the poor. 
     <lb/>
     Not the family that can afford two or three motor 
     <lb/>
     cars, or a couple of trips away every year, or life 
     <lb/>
     insurance policies running up to a $100,000, or 
     <lb/>
     even $2-300,000, not the family that can send its 
     <lb/>
     children to school in Canada, England or the 
     <lb/>
     States, certainly not the family that can afford to 
     <lb/>
     spend $4-5,000 a year just on ordinary household 
     <lb/>
     expenses, because to such a family another few 
     <lb/>
     hundreds or even another thousand a year won't 
     <lb/>
     make or break them. No, it's the family that has 
     <lb/>
     to watch every cent. The family that has to stretch 
     <lb/>
     the last penny, that has to go without and never 
     <lb/>
     knows anything year in and year out but penny- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     pinching economy. They're the people who feel 
     <lb/>
     the pinch where it hurts most — in their 
     <lb/>
     children's stomachs and on their children's 
     <lb/>
     backs. The great majority of our population, 
     <lb/>
     those tens of thousands of our people who ache 
     <lb/>
     and yearn for a square deal and don't know where 
     <lb/>
     to turn for it, those are the people who will be 
     <lb/>
     helped by confederation. Oh yes, confederation 
     <lb/>
     will tax them too. But not in the same way — not 
     <lb/>
     so heavily, not so harshly and above all not so 
     <lb/>
     unjustly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, this is the fifth week since this 
     <lb/>
     debate began, and for all of that time we've been 
     <lb/>
     discussing and debating the details of these con<lb break="no"/>federation terms. I am afraid that more than once 
  

            <cb/>
        

     we haven't been able to see the forest for trees. 
     <lb/>
     We've wrangled and disputed so much over the 
     <lb/>
     details that we've failed altogether to give the 
     <lb/>
     people an intelligent picture of the whole thing in 
     <lb/>
     the round. It would be useful therefore, if before 
     <lb/>
     this debate closes, I should try to give a general 
     <lb/>
     picture of confederation as these terms describe 
     <lb/>
     it. The first fact is that confederation means that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland would join the family of 
     <lb/>
     Canadian provinces. Where there are nine 
     <lb/>
     provinces now, there would be ten if we joined 
     <lb/>
     up. Newfoundland would have all the rights, 
     <lb/>
     powers, privileges and responsibilities of a 
     <lb/>
     province of Canada. We'd no longer be on our 
     <lb/>
     own — no longer would we be trying to paddle 
     <lb/>
     our own canoe, trying to get along by our own 
     <lb/>
     unaided efforts. We'd be part of the family of 
     <lb/>
     Canadian provinces. The second fact is that the 
     <lb/>
     Province of Newfoundland would consist of 
     <lb/>
     152,000 square miles, 42,000 square miles in the 
     <lb/>
     island of Newfoundland and 110,000 square 
     <lb/>
     miles in our territory of Labrador. Labrador as 
     <lb/>
     defined by the award of the Privy Council in 1927 
     <lb/>
     would be part and parcel of the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, and the boundaries separating 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland-Labrador from Quebec-Labrador 
     <lb/>
     could never be changed except with the full free 
     <lb/>
     consent of Newfoundland. The third fact is that 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada would take over our 
     <lb/>
     entire external public debt — the debt of $60-odd 
     <lb/>
     million we owe in Great Britain. Canada would 
     <lb/>
     relieve us of this debt and would pay the yearly 
     <lb/>
     interest on it, and would pay it off when it fell 
     <lb/>
     due. Newfoundland would be left with a public 
     <lb/>
     debt of around $6 million, which amount we 
     <lb/>
     really owe to ourselves. That is, it's an internal 
     <lb/>
     debt borrowed by our government from people 
     <lb/>
     here in Newfoundland. The interest on it would 
     <lb/>
     go to the people in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Government of Canada would take over 
     <lb/>
     and operate at their expense our railway and 
     <lb/>
     coastal boat system, the Newfoundland Hotel if 
     <lb/>
     we want them to take it over, the post and 
     <lb/>
     telegraph system, Gander airport, all lighthouses, 
     <lb/>
     fog alarms, beacons and buoys, public wharves 
     <lb/>
     and breakwaters, what we call marine works; the 
     <lb/>
     pensions and rehabilitation of all veterans of both 
     <lb/>
     wars, the protection and encouragement of the 
     <lb/>
     fisheries, the geological survey and the 
     <lb/>

     services would also be taken over by the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada. They would become federal 
     <lb/>
     civil servants and they would suffer no loss in 
     <lb/>
     wages, salaries or pension rights. The employees 
     <lb/>
     of the railway system would also be taken over 
     <lb/>
     without loss of salary, and they would be guaran<lb break="no"/>teed the same continuity of employment as other 
     <lb/>
     employees of the Canadian National Railways. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Government of Canada would provide 
     <lb/>
     family allowances to all children under 16, old 
     <lb/>
     age pensions and pensions to the blind, old age 
     <lb/>
     beginning at 70, blind persons at the age of 21. 
     <lb/>
     They would provide unemployment insurance 
     <lb/>
     benefits, sick mariners' and fishermen's benefits, 
     <lb/>
     and assistance to housing. The Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada would place a new ferry on the Cabot 
     <lb/>
     Strait. This boat would be specially fitted to carry 
     <lb/>
     motor cars, but it will not be put there until the 
     <lb/>
     road from Comer Brook to Port-aux-Basques is 
     <lb/>
     finished. The Government of Canada would also 
     <lb/>
     bring Newfoundland under the Maritime Freight 
     <lb/>
     Rates Act, which act provides a 20% reduction in 
     <lb/>
     freight rates on all goods moved by rail, moving 
     <lb/>
     within or going outside of the Maritime region — 
     <lb/>
     that is, the whole region this side of Point Lévis, 
     <lb/>
     near the city of Quebec. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the financial side the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada would pay to the government of the 
     <lb/>
     Province of Newfoundland the following amounts 
     <lb/>
     of cash: $180,000 each year, and 80 cents per 
     <lb/>
     head of our population each year, and $1.1 mil<lb break="no"/>lion cash each year as a special subsidy for all 
     <lb/>
     time, and $22.75 million in the first eight years 
     <lb/>
     of union — an average of over $2.5 million each 
     <lb/>
     year as a special transitional grant. These 
     <lb/>
     amounts, together with the amount which the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada would pay under the tax 
     <lb/>
     rental agreement, would average $9.5 million a 
     <lb/>
     year. Then in addition to that, the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada would pay back to us the amount which 
     <lb/>
     we will have paid them for the purchase of their 
     <lb/>
     rights in Gander — $666,000. And the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada will also pay back to New<lb break="no"/>foundland the cost of these two new boats that are 
     <lb/>
     still in Scotland to be delivered over here to us. 
     <lb/>
     The Government of Canada within eight years 
     <lb/>
     after we entered the union would appoint a royal 
     <lb/>
     commission to reassess our whole financial posi<lb break="no"/>tion as a province. That is, to see if we need any 
     <lb/>
     additional subsidies, and if so how much to 
     <lb/>
     enable our provincial government to carry on 
  

            <cb/>
      

     without imposing taxation too burdensome for us 
     <lb/>
     to pay, compared with taxation in the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, and having regard always to our 
     <lb/>
     capacity to pay tax. And within two years after 
     <lb/>
     we entered the union, if we wished to institute an 
     <lb/>
     economic survey of Newfoundland — which of 
     <lb/>
     course includes Labrador — the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada would provide the services of technical 
     <lb/>
     personnel and agencies to make this survey for 
     <lb/>
     the purpose of finding out what resources we 
     <lb/>
     have that may profitably be developed, and what 
     <lb/>
     new industries may be established, or what exist<lb break="no"/>ing industries may be expanded. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Our accumulated cash surplus will remain our 
     <lb/>
     own. The Government of Canada would be will<lb break="no"/>ing to receive it on deposit for us and to pay us 2 
     <lb/>
     5/8% interest on it each year. One-third of our 
     <lb/>
     whole cash surplus would have to be set aside to 
     <lb/>
     be spent, if we like, on the ordinary purposes of 
     <lb/>
     the provincial government. And the other two- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     thirds of the surplus would have to be set aside 
     <lb/>
     by us to be spent on the general development of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. The provincial government 
     <lb/>
     would have the right to lend money out of the 
     <lb/>
     surplus to industries or fishermen or other 
     <lb/>
     producers, but it would not have the right to 
     <lb/>
     subsidise industries which were in competition 
     <lb/>
     with similar industries in the rest of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Education is left entirely and absolutely with 
     <lb/>
     ourselves. The Government of Canada would not 
     <lb/>
     and could not interfere with our school system. 
     <lb/>
     All the denominational schools existing at the 
     <lb/>
     time of union would have their rights guaranteed. 
     <lb/>
     That is, they could keep right on as they are, and 
     <lb/>
     they would continue to be financed out of the 
     <lb/>
     public chest. Any two denominations that wanted 
     <lb/>
     to unite or amalgamate their schools would have 
     <lb/>
     the right to do so, and if they did so they would 
     <lb/>
     continue to receive their full share of public 
     <lb/>
     money spent on education. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Newfoundland would be entitled to have six 
     <lb/>
     members of her own in the Senate of Canada and 
     <lb/>
     would also be entitled to elect seven members of 
     <lb/>
     her own to the House of Commons. So far as our 
     <lb/>
     own House of Assembly or provincial legislature 
     <lb/>
     is concerned, we could elect any number we like, 
     <lb/>
     ten or 15, 20 or 30, or whatever number we 
     <lb/>
     decided on ourselves. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Government of Canada would collect 
     <lb/>
     about $20 million a year from us in taxes, these 
     <lb/>
     are income tax, corporation tax, excise tax, sales 
   

            <pb n="1187" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1948-01-14_Page_1187.jpg"/>
          
     <fw type="dateline">January 1948</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">1187</fw> 


     tax, liquor tax, customs tax and tobacco tax. They 
     <lb/>
     will collect $20 million a year from us and they 
     <lb/>
     would spend on an average about $36 million a 
     <lb/>
     year in Newfoundland, about $16 million more 
     <lb/>
     then they would take from us. In addition to the 
     <lb/>
     $20 million a year that the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada would take, the provincial government of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland would take another $5-6 million 
     <lb/>
     from us in taxes. The two governments between 
     <lb/>
     them would take perhaps as much as $26-27 
     <lb/>
     million a year from us, which is $12-13 million 
     <lb/>
     less then our own government is taking this 
     <lb/>
     present year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     These terms, Mr. Chairman, would make a 
     <lb/>
     new country of Newfoundland. They would 
     <lb/>
     make a new country for the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland — a new country where the poor man 
     <lb/>
     would have a chance. A country where the poor 
     <lb/>
     man would have a chance to live and breathe, a 
     <lb/>
     chance to bring up his family decently. These 
     <lb/>
     terms would give our people a chance, and that is 
     <lb/>
     something they have never had yet. And when I 
     <lb/>
     say our people, I mean the toiling masses of our 
     <lb/>
     people, our fishermen and loggers, our miners 
     <lb/>
    and millworkers, our railroaders and teachers,  
     <lb/>our clerks and labourers, all our people who toil 
     <lb/>by hand or brain to make a living in this country. 
     <lb/>I do not mean our great masters of trade and 
     <lb/>industry. I do not mean our millionaires, our 
     <lb/>half-millionaires, our quarter-millionaires—I do 
     <lb/>not mean the people with two or three motor cars. 
     <lb/>I do not mean the people with $1,300 rugs on their 
     <lb/>floors. I do not mean the people who can take 
     <lb/>their holidays in Canada and send their children 
     <lb/>to Canada to school. I do not mean the people 
     <lb/>who have done very well out of Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>I mean the great masses of our hardworking 
     

            <cb/>
          

     people, those tens of thousands of our workers 
     <lb/>
     and fishermen who never got a break, the vast 
     <lb/>
     bulk of our population who have been kept down 
     <lb/>
     all through the ages, the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. These terms would be a new charter 
     <lb/>
     of happiness for our children. Never as children 
     <lb/>
     would they know hunger or nakedness, never 
     <lb/>
     would they know the pinch of extreme poverty 
     <lb/>
     under confederation. Newfoundland would be a 
     <lb/>
     happier and a healthier land for our junior 
     <lb/>
     citizens. For our senior citizens, those men and 
     <lb/>
     women of 70 and more who have passed their 
     <lb/>
     toil, those worn-out toilers, whose earning days 
     <lb/>
     are over, for them these terms would bring a little 
     <lb/>
     sunshine in the evening of their years, a little 
     <lb/>
     holiday from the grinding poverty they have 
     <lb/>
     known most of their days — a last gentle stand 
     <lb/>
     of comparative ease and comfort. For the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland these confederation terms 
     <lb/>
     would mean a happier land, a land of hope and 
     <lb/>
     progress. The people would come at last into their 
     <lb/>
     own. For the country in general, these terms 
     <lb/>
     would mean hitching Newfoundland's wagon to 
     <lb/>
     the rising, shining star that we call the great 
     <lb/>
     British nation of Canada. It would mean linking 
     <lb/>
     our own dear Newfoundland to the third largest 
     <lb/>
     land in the world — a land where the common 
     <lb/>
     people get a break, where they get a decent 
     <lb/>
     chance to live and rear their families. For New<lb break="no"/>foundland these terms mean security and political 
     <lb/>
     freedom. I support them with all my heart. I 
     <lb/>
     commend them to my fellow Newfoundlanders 
     <lb/>
     for their serious and solemn consideration. God 
     <lb/>
     guard thee Newfoundland.
