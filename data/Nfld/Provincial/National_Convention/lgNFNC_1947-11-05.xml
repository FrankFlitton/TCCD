     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, before we proceed 
     <lb/>
     this afternoon there are a few remarks I want to 
     <lb/>
     make. One is that about 12 months ago Mr. K. M. 
     <lb/>
     Brown, a delegate to this Convention, was strick<lb break="no"/>en here in the discharge of his duty. Yesterday I 
     <lb/>
     received the following message from Mr. Brown, 
     <lb/>
     which I propose to read: 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>Mr. P.J. Cashin, St.John's. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I eagerly awaited your report and sat up 
     <lb/>
     until midnight and listened to every word. It 
     <lb/>
     was one of the finest ever delivered in that 
     <lb/>
     famous chamber. Congratulations. We must 
     <lb/>
     have responsible government and all the 
     <lb/>
     freedom that goes with it. You are fighting 
     <lb/>
     hard, keep it up. Warmest regards. KM. 
     <lb/>
     Brown. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     To which I sent the following reply: 
     <lb/>

     On behalf of the Finance Committee and 
     <lb/>
     myself wish to thank you for your kind

     remarks regarding Economic Report. I am 
     <lb/>
     sure that you will continue the fight for 
     <lb/>
     freedom until victory won. All delegates 
     <lb/>
     hope for early recovery your health and that 
     <lb/>
     you will be with us once again. Regards. P.J.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Chairman, I rise to make a few 
     <lb/>
     remarks with regard to this long awaited Report 
     <lb/>
     of the Finance Committee on the economic side. 
     <lb/>
     First and foremost I would like at this moment to 
     <lb/>
     offer to that Committee and to its chairman, 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin, my heartiest congratulations for 
     <lb/>
     the manner in which this report has been 
     <lb/>
     presented to us, and I feel that we owe them a debt 
     <lb/>
     of gratitude for the promptness with which they 
     <lb/>
     brought this report before us at such short notice. 
     <lb/>
     I am quite sure that we all agree, as we read 
     <lb/>
     through this, that these men have done an excel<lb break="no"/>lent job.... Each and every one of these men who 
     <lb/>
     has signed this report is in my opinion definitely 
     <lb/>
     an honest man. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Let there be no question about 
     <lb/>
     that, Mr. Hollett. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Referring to a remark which was 
     <lb/>
     made in yesterday's session, it was definitely said 
     <lb/>
     here that this report was not an honest report. 
     <lb/>
     What am I to infer from that statement? Can I 
     

            <cb/>
       

     infer any other than this, that the men who signed 
     <lb/>
     that report are not honest? If they are not honest, 
     <lb/>
     then they are dishonest. I cannot agree with the 
     <lb/>
     remark which was made by a certain speaker in 
     <lb/>
     yesterday's session. Now I would like to ask 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin one or two questions before I 
     <lb/>
     proceed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On page 1, Major Cashin, you referred to the 
     <lb/>
     Financial Report, and you say that the total 
     <lb/>
     revenue from 1897 to Sept. 30, 1947 amounted 
     <lb/>
     to, in round figures, $496 million, whilst the 
     <lb/>
     expenditures come to approximately $500 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. I would like to ask you, were these figures 
     <lb/>
     properly audited, properly copied from the 
     <lb/>
     records, or were they guesswork? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> They were properly copied from the 
     <lb/>
     records — Auditor Generals' reports and the 
     <lb/>
     budgets. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Thank you. If you will turn over to 
     <lb/>
     page 2, with regard to the reduction in the debt, I 
     <lb/>
     see you have the net debt as $35 million. How did 
     <lb/>
     you arrive at that? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Our gross debt, after deduction of 
     <lb/>
     sinking fund, etc., is approximately $70 million 
     <lb/>
     in round figures. We have $35 million in cash, 
     <lb/>
     $9.25 million of which is on loan to Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     free of interest, and the balance to the credit of 
     <lb/>
     the country here in Newfoundland, and some 
     <lb/>
     small amounts to the credit of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     with the Crown Agents in London, in all $35 
     <lb/>
     million, and if we deduct that $35 million it 
     <lb/>
     leaves us a net debt of $35 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> That would be sterling? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes, converted into dollar ex<lb break="no"/>change. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> There is another debt. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes, there's $6-7 million in dollar 
     <lb/>
     debt. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Has that been taken care of? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes, that's included. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Let us turn to page 3, a matter 
     <lb/>
     relative to insurance and savings. You will see 
     <lb/>
     there at the bottom of Page 2, "Therefore today 
     <lb/>
     we can definitely state that Newfoundland's capi<lb break="no"/>tal account shows a surplus in cash of $35 mil<lb break="no"/>lion; and in addition the people of the country

less than $80 million..." <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> That's right. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> "Also our people carry life in<lb break="no"/>surance with a cash value of at least $30 <lb/>
million..." <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Those figures regarding the
total <lb/>
amount of insurance which was carried were also <lb/>
obtained from an official source... <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Turn to page 7, in regard to
the <lb/>
matter of conversion. "When a delegation from <lb/>
this Convention met representatives of the <lb/>
British government in London several months <lb/>
ago, we were advised by the Dominions Office <lb/>
that, beginning January 1, 1948, the conversion <lb/>
of our 3% guaranteed stock, which amounts to <lb/>
£17,790,000, or in dollar currency approximately <lb/>
$72 million, which is at present bearing interest <lb/>
at 3%, would be made, and that new stock would <lb/>
be issued bearing interest at 2 1/2%." I know that <lb/>
is correct. Did your Committee make any in<lb break="no"/>quiries as to why that conversion will not be <lb/>
carried out? <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Hollett will know that
when <lb/>
Lord Addison made that statement he said that <lb/>
three months' notice had to be given, that is on <lb/>
October 1, but three or four days prior to that date <lb/>
an announcement was made here by the govern<lb break="no"/>ment that conditions would not permit this ster<lb break="no"/>ling debt to be converted at this time. In looking <lb/>
up the financial papers since that time, the Lon<lb break="no"/>don papers, and looking up the prices paid for <lb/>
bonds, I find that the Newfoundland 3% stock <lb/>
was selling on the London Stock Exchange at that <lb/>
time at 102 point something. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Did your Committee endeavour
to <lb/>
find out why conditions would not permit? <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> No, we did not, I will be
quite frank <lb/>
about that. It was done and that's all there is to it. <lb/>
We hold that it should have been done, and we <lb/>
feel it could have been done, but the point is this <lb/>
—I know why it was not done...
It was because <lb/>
it would mean an extra $500,000 saving to the <lb/>
country, and it would mean an extra $500,000 <lb/>
that Great Britain would not get, and which she <lb/>
is now anxious to get in dollar exchange.
That's <lb/>
my personal opinion. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> You did not enquire from any
offi<lb break="no"/>cial source? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> No, it was an official
announce<lb break="no"/>ment. <lb/>
            </p>

<cb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Will you turn to page 10? You
say <lb/>
there: "For purposes therefore of explanation we <lb/>
give herewith proposed expenditures under the <lb/>
various departmental headings..."
Could you tell <lb/>
me on what you based these figures? <lb/>
            </p>


            <p> <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I can, Mr. Hollett. We have first of <lb/>
all Consolidated Fund service, that means the <lb/>
servicing of our public debt. That means today <lb/>
the totals are $3,374,000, but the conversion on <lb/>
that sterling debt, and by the application of the <lb/>
interest-free loans we have given Great Britain, <lb/>
and by the application of the sinking fund, and, <lb/>
as I said the conversion of the balance of our <lb/>
sterling debt to 2 1/2%, we would save ap<lb break="no"/>proximately $1 million. Now if we take $1 mil<lb break="no"/>lion off $3,374,000, which is the Consolidated <lb/>
Fund service, we find that it would amount to <lb/>
$2,374,000, but for the purposes of more ac<lb break="no"/>curacy, and to create more discussion, I made it <lb/>
a round figure of $2.5 million...
<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Now with regard to Finance...
<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> I will explain them as you go
along, <lb/>
Mr. Hollett. With regard to Finance, if you take <lb/>
the estimate of expenditure for the present fiscal <lb/>
year, 1947 - 48, there is an amount of $2 million <lb/>
voted for the Railway, and there is a remark <lb/>
which says: "Provision is made there for a <lb/>
general subsidy of $100,000, which is included <lb/>
in the $1.2 million." That subsidy is paid annually <lb/>
anyhow, therefore the deficit is $2 million. Now <lb/>
the General Manager of the Railway stated that <lb/>
once those capital expenditures were finished, <lb/>
the deficit on the Railway would not be more than <lb/>
$750,000; and so we deducted this $750,000 <lb/>
from the $2 million, and it leaves us $1.25 million <lb/>
paid in this respect. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Thank you, and Customs? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> They are all present estimates
ex<lb break="no"/>cept with the Education Department when <lb/>
there is an increased vote under this proposed <lb/>
plan of $650,000 a year, which would be used no <lb/>
doubt for giving school teachers more money, or <lb/>
in a general way. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I have elicited from the
chairman of <lb/>
the Committee with regard to these figures of <lb/>
$500 million and $496 million, that these are <lb/>
definite facts taken from the Financial Report <lb/>
which was presented and passed...
An insinua<lb break="no"/>tion was made here yesterday that these figures <lb/>

     Finance Committee have been disputed, but I am 
     <lb/>
     glad to say that they have so far been disputed 
     <lb/>
     without any success.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In dealing with the period from 1920 to 1934, 
     <lb/>
     much ado about nothing was also made in the 
     <lb/>
     remarks of the member from Bonavista Centre. 
     <lb/>
     A long array of finance ministers was presented 
     <lb/>
     to us, and it was intimated that scarcely one of 
     <lb/>
     them ever made a correct budget. That, of course, 
     <lb/>
     we can all understand. I fail to see how any 
     <lb/>
     finance minister in any government, business, or 
     <lb/>
     household, can make a sure estimate of what the 
     <lb/>
     expenditures or deficits or surpluses will be from 
     <lb/>
     year to year. But the point I want to raise is this: 
     <lb/>
     much capital was meant to be dispersed to the 
     <lb/>
     other needs of this country, and many finance 
     <lb/>
     ministers not only failed to make an accurate 
     <lb/>
     estimate of the surplus or the deficit, but they 
     <lb/>
     made such errors and such estimates which in the 
     <lb/>
     end proved to be very wrong. In touching upon 
     <lb/>
     that point I would like for you to remember that 
     <lb/>
     period from 1920 to 1934, remember that the 
     <lb/>
     Great War had been fought and won. You will 
     <lb/>
     remember that for two or three years after peace 
     <lb/>
     was signed this little country enjoyed unwonted 
     <lb/>
     prosperity. Fish was selling in the markets of the 
     <lb/>
     world at higher prices than ever before, and con<lb break="no"/>sequently the people up to 1921 or 1922 were 
     <lb/>
     enjoying such prosperity as had been undreamed 
     <lb/>
     of before these days. Also you will remember that 
     <lb/>
     shortly after that time conditions were not so 
     <lb/>
     good. There were ups and downs and ins and outs, 
     <lb/>
     if you like. And that's the way it was, I suppose, 
     <lb/>
     with the finance ministers. But they were not 
     <lb/>
     getting the price for the fish, and unfortunately, 
     <lb/>
     at this time, they were not even getting the fish; 
     <lb/>
     but they certainly were not getting the price they 
     <lb/>
     had got some years before. Our merchants had 
     <lb/>
     been stocked up to the hilt. Our banking owners 
     <lb/>
     (I come from the southwest coast where they go 
     <lb/>
     to fish in deep waters) had up-to-date vessels; 
     <lb/>
     firms had from five to six bankers costing 
     <lb/>
     anywhere from $10-25,000 and more, new ves<lb break="no"/>sels too. They had been perhaps unwise in this era 
     <lb/>
     of prosperity to think that it was going to con<lb break="no"/>tinue, and they had gotten rid of the old vessels 
     <lb/>
     and gotten themselves new up-to-date vessels, 
     <lb/>
     built in Lunenburg, Shelburne and other places, 
     <lb/>
     at very high cost. That was the situation, and 
     <lb/>
     suddenly the price dropped and the bottom 
  

            <cb/>
         

     dropped out of the market, and the merchants 
     <lb/>
     who were overstocked, the fishing plants or ves<lb break="no"/>sels, or shore plants on Labrador, found themsel<lb break="no"/>ves with good expensive gear and they could not 
     <lb/>
     sell their fish. Under these circumstances I ask 
     <lb/>
     you who could you put in as finance minister to 
     <lb/>
     budget the surpluses or deficits from 1922 or 23 
     <lb/>
     onwards? 
     <lb/>
       </p>

            <p>I come down to 1931, but first I must remind 
     <lb/>you of that great depression which struck the 
     <lb/>world, not only Newfoundland, in 1929. 
     <lb/>Everybody was broke, and by 1931 it was coming 
     <lb/>in with a surge on this country, an absolute tidal 
     <lb/>wave, and my friend Major Cashin at that time 
     <lb/>was finance minister. Yesterday it was intimated 
     <lb/>that because he made the colossal mistake of 
     <lb/>budgeting for a small deficit and succeeded in 
     <lb/>getting a deficit of $4 million, then this, what we 
     <lb/>have here, was only tomfoolery. That was the 
     <lb/>idea which it was the endeavour of the member 
     <lb/>from Bonavista Centre to convey to you, and to 
     <lb/>the country at large. I am quite sure you see now 
     <lb/>how ridiculous that idea was. If my friend from 
     <lb/>Bonavista Centre had explained to you that at that 
     <lb/>time no finance minister in this world could 
     <lb/>definitely make a correct budget, then I would 
     <lb/>have no complaint whatsoever with the member 
     <lb/>from Bonavista Centre. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>New 1931 was a bad year. In order to prove 
     <lb/>how uncertain things then were and in order to 
     <lb/>prove how difficult it might have been for my 
     <lb/>friend from Bonavista Centre, if he had been 
     <lb/>finance minister, to make the correct estimate, I 
     <lb/>would like to quote from a sort of history, an 
     <lb/>economic history if you like, of this country, 
     <lb/>written by my friend from Bonavista Centre in 
     <lb/>the year 1930.<ref target="#fn_02">[1]</ref> 1931 was well in sight. If any of 
     <lb/>you have that book I would ask you to turn to page 
     <lb/>9. This is how my friend from Bonavista Centre 
     <lb/>saw things in Newfoundland in the future:

     I just draw that to your attention to show how 
     <lb/>
     difficult it was for the finance minister to make 
     <lb/>
     up a correct budget in 1931. I also draw your 
     <lb/>
     attention to the fact that there were bread lines in 
     <lb/>
     New York and in many cities in the United States 
     <lb/>
     and Canada in 1931. My mind goes back to 1934, 
     <lb/>
     and I remember this: there were 90,000 people on 
     <lb/>
     the dole here, and the government spent $1.5 
     <lb/>
     million, and I do know our people were in dire 
     <lb/>
     distress even in 1931. This book was not publish<lb break="no"/>ed for use in Newfoundland, but for New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders in Canada and the United States. I 
     <lb/>
     will refer later to another document which was 
     <lb/>
     prepared for export information and not for New<lb break="no"/>foundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now the Committee, on page 2, continues to 
     <lb/>
     try and assess the value of the fixed assets of this 
     <lb/>
     country, those things which are practically im<lb break="no"/>possible to remove, not like money in the bank. 
     <lb/>
     And they found out that we have a Railway which 
     <lb/>
     was valued at $72 million; some highroads here 
     <lb/>
     which they further valued at $20 million; some 
     <lb/>
     public buildings, lighthouses, public wharves, 
     <lb/>
     breakwaters, etc, valued at $10 million. And 
     <lb/>
     there was another $10 million for breakwaters 
     <lb/>
     and telegraphs, making a total in all of $112 
     <lb/>
     million fixed assets. Now fixed assets is some<lb break="no"/>thing which you have which remains. Sometimes 
     <lb/>
     you have to get repairs, but anything you have 
     <lb/>
     spent to get them, such as money which made up 
     <lb/>
     our national debt, you have these fixed assets to 
     <lb/>
     go against it. We have $112 million worth of 
     <lb/>
     fixed assets, but there is a point I want to make in 
     <lb/>
     connection with the Railway. In yesterday's dis<lb break="no"/>cussion the chairman of the Finance Committee 
     <lb/>
     was more or less ridiculed because he had valued 
     <lb/>
     the Railway at $72 million; we found that he had 
     <lb/>
     got that figure from the report of the Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     delegation, a figure which the delegation had 
     <lb/>
     presented to the Canadian government to show 
     <lb/>
     them how valuable we were. You will remember 
     <lb/>
     the remark which was made by the member from 
     <lb/>
     Bonavista Centre: "Of course we valued it at $72 
     <lb/>
     million. We were fooling them, but we don't 
     <lb/>
     want to fool you people at all."

            </p>

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> No.... I don't think it is proper

     glad I did not refer to the member from Bonavista

     <lb/>
     was definitely the opinion that it was all right to 
     <lb/>
     tell a Canadian that we had a Railway worth $72 
     <lb/>
     million, but you fellows know better than that. 
     <lb/>
     We would not try to fool you fellows, not at all! 
     <lb/>
     Are all the facts in that Black Book compiled in 
     <lb/>
     that spirit, and if so, are the answers given by the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian people in the same spirit? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Getting back to the various assets... The Com<lb break="no"/>mittee refers to the Savings Bank, and says there 
     <lb/>
     is $80 million belonging to the people there, and 
     <lb/>
     $100 million worth of life insurance, whose 
     <lb/>
     cash surrender value is $30 million. How much 
     <lb/>
     is that? $110 million. That in itself gives us some 
     <lb/>
     idea of the economy of our people. The mere fact 
     <lb/>
     that our people have $80 million in the Savings 
     <lb/>
     Bank and $30 million in life insurance would 
     <lb/>
     justify the Finance Committee coming to the 
     <lb/>
     decision which they did in their report... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Committee then takes a look at the Rail<lb break="no"/>way, ships and docks, and they advocate that the 
     <lb/>
     ships that are now in the mercantile marine class 
     <lb/>
     should be put over in some sort of a Crown 
     <lb/>
     agency, and they make it out in such a way that 
     <lb/>
     they can save $1.25 million thereby, and in other 
     <lb/>
     ways. Then they go on to the servicing of the 
     <lb/>
     national debt. Major Cashin explained if inter<lb break="no"/>est-free loans and sinking fund were applied to 
     <lb/>
     our debt, reducing itto $54 million, we could save 
   

            <cb/>
        

     $1 million in interest on the service of that debt. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Gander airport they also discussed and very 
     <lb/>
     fully. They say they can save $750,000. That is 
     <lb/>
     the only point upon which I must agree with my 
     <lb/>
     friend from Bonavista Centre, that I can't agree 
     <lb/>
     on the information which we received when we 
     <lb/>
     were in London. I believe, and it was intimated, 
     <lb/>
     that if the deficit was $750,000 we would have to 
     <lb/>
     pay $250,000 and Great Britain would have to 
     <lb/>
     pay the rest. I can see I think Major Cashin's 
     <lb/>
     point. How is Great Britain going to pay that? 
     <lb/>
     How can she send us over the dollars? Where is 
     <lb/>
     she going to get the dollars? Evidently we will 
     <lb/>
     have to supply the dollars for the time being 
     <lb/>
     anyway, and I suspect that is what he had in his 
     <lb/>
     mind. Anyway, they figure out that there will be 
     <lb/>
     a total saving of $3 million, and it looks to me 
     <lb/>
     quite sound. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then they come on to the proposed expenditure 
     <lb/>
       of $25 million... And then they logically go 
     <lb/>
     on and ask themselves, "Where are we going to 
     <lb/>
     get the money to pay for this?" And they quote 
     <lb/>
     the 1940-41 revenue - $16.25 million — and 
     <lb/>
     they tell us that in 1946-47 it amounts to $27.25 
     <lb/>
     million, and that the indications were that for this 
     <lb/>
     year, 1947-48, the revenues would come close to 
     <lb/>
     the staggering amount of $40 million. Then, 
     <lb/>
     having decided that, they take a very realistic 
     <lb/>
     view of the industries in this country. They refer 
     <lb/>
     to the value of the pulp and paper industry and 
     <lb/>
     refer to the proposed expansion in the Comer 
     <lb/>
     Brook area, and generally they say that the pulp 
     <lb/>
     and paper industry in Newfoundland is tops. 
     <lb/>
     They also refer, which I think does not concern 
     <lb/>
     this report, to the possibilities of the pulp and 
     <lb/>
     paper industry in the Labrador area; I think I must 
     <lb/>
     touch upon this matter although I cannot see that 
     <lb/>
     the revenues will derive any benefit therefrom in 
     <lb/>
     the three year period which they forecast.... When 
     <lb/>
     we think of the possibilities of a new paper or 
     <lb/>
     sulphite mill in Labrador, or a new paper mill in 
     <lb/>
     the Bay d'Espoir area, and the value to the 
     <lb/>
     workmen, the clergymen, doctors, businessmen 
     <lb/>
     and everybody, then I think we can take a pretty 
     <lb/>
     good view of the pulp and paper industry, espe<lb break="no"/>cially in view of the fact that they inform us that 
     <lb/>
     the Comer Brook and Grand Falls people have 
     <lb/>
     contracts for the next ten years. Is that correct? 
            </p>

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> That's right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> So there is nothing to worry about 
     <lb/>
     as far as the pulp and paper industry is concerned, 
   

            <pb n="656"

     so far as we can see at the moment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     They go on then to mining and refer to 
     <lb/>
     Wabana, with a payroll of $4 million or there<lb break="no"/>abouts. They also refer to the contract of ore for 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain of about 750,000 tons. We never 
     <lb/>
     did ship very much ore to Britain prior to the war, 
     <lb/>
     and we took that up over in London with the 
     <lb/>
     Dominions Office, and they assured us that they 
     <lb/>
     would do everything in their power to see that this 
     <lb/>
     would be continued in the future. Then we have 
     <lb/>
     Buchans. The lead and zinc and copper which 
     <lb/>
     they produce always finds a ready market, and 
     <lb/>
     they have a payroll of $1 million. La Manche, 
     <lb/>
     they tell us, is about to be opened up, at least they 
     <lb/>
     hope to open it up and find some lead there. Then 
     <lb/>
     they refer us to the story we have heard about the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland Labrador. All of us now have 
     <lb/>
     heard of the Labrador Mining and Exploration 
     <lb/>
     Co. The thing is so vast, and so huge, that one's 
     <lb/>
     mind fails to grasp it. It is anticipated by this 
     <lb/>
     company that they hope to find enough ore in a 
     <lb/>
     year or so to warrant them spending $150 million 
     <lb/>
     to open up the iron ore deposits down there. That 
     <lb/>
     again would not come within the three year 
     <lb/>
     period for which the Finance Committee has 
     <lb/>
     made a forecast. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am compelled at this time in 
     <lb/>
     fairness to our reporter to declare a 15 minute 
     <lb/>
     recess. Our alternative reporter is sick and is 
     <lb/>
     unable to be with us, and you will appreciate the

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Chairman, this new develop<lb break="no"/>ment on Bell Island, whereby they are shipping 
     <lb/>
     ore to Great Britain, is really a peace-time in<lb break="no"/>dustry, something that has grown out of peace, 
     <lb/>
     not out of war. There again you will see that the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Committee was justified in being op<lb break="no"/>timistic with regard to mining conditions. The 
     <lb/>
     same applied, of course, to the pulp and paper 
     <lb/>
     industry. They are continuing. The war has been 
     <lb/>
     over for two years and still they have all they can 
     <lb/>
     produce sold for the next ten years; so we see that 
     <lb/>
     when the Finance Committee took a glimpse at 
     <lb/>
     that industry they were justified in being optimis<lb break="no"/>tic. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> May I ask a question? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> A point of order? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> No, just a point of privilege. A ques<lb break="no"/>tion. The contracts that are made with the paper 
     <lb/>
     company, are they at a fixed price for the next ten 
 

            <cb/>
        

     years, or is it not a question of price? 
     <lb/>
     
  </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I don't know. In fairness to Mr. 
     <lb/>Hollett I understand he is simply commenting on 
     <lb/>the contents of the Economic Report. He was not 
     <lb/>a member of the Economic Committee, and he 
     <lb/>takes it just as is. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I could answer that, but I think Mr. 
     <lb/>Butt could look that up himself and find out. I fail 
     <lb/>to see how any company or individual would 
     <lb/>make a contract for ten years at any fixed price, 
     <lb/>but having due regard to conditions in the United 
     <lb/>States, and the lack of paper in the United States 
     <lb/>and Mexico and these places, I do think that the 
     <lb/>price of newsprint in the future will not go below 
     <lb/>$90 a ton, but will probably reach the amount of 
     <lb/>$100 a ton... Then they took up the matter of 
     <lb/>agriculture and referred to the new agricultural 
     <lb/>development on the west coast, and arrived at the 
     <lb/>conclusion that the value of agriculture was in the 
     <lb/>vicinity of $15 million. That in itself is quite an 
     <lb/>item, which the Finance Committee were right 
     <lb/>and proper in looking at with an optimistic view. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>And then they came to our basic industry — 
     <lb/>the fisheries. They gave an exhaustive survey of 
     <lb/>the fisheries... They pointed out that in the new 
     <lb/>methods of curing, freezing, putting up the fish 
     <lb/>in fillets and shipping it away, the enterprising 
     <lb/>firms here in St. John's and elsewhere have in<lb break="no"/>vested the amount of $6 million. Now I put it to 
     <lb/>you that these enterprising men are not going to 
     <lb/>invest $6 million unless they themselves have an 
     <lb/>optimistic View of the future, not only for three 
     <lb/>years but for a much longer period. I think the 
     <lb/>Finance Committee were right and proper in the 
     <lb/>conclusions they came to with regard to that. 
     <lb/>Take herring. I remember the days when herring 
     <lb/>was caught in a seine and brought in and dumped 
     <lb/>on an American vessel's deck and frozen, and it 
     <lb/>was only in the winter when you could sell them 
     <lb/>anywhere, and they were taken out of the country 
     <lb/>right away and shipped to foreign markets. Now 
     <lb/>they have created all sorts of industries. Not only 
     <lb/>do we Scotch-pack them, not only do we fillet 
     <lb/>herring and make herring oil, but we do almost 
     <lb/>everything with herring, and there again 
     <lb/>enterprising businessmen have put their money 
     <lb/>and brains into the development of the herring 
     <lb/>fishery along lines whereby it will not only assure 
     <lb/>a living to the people who catch herring and cure 
     <lb/>them, but also it will offer them something in 
     <lb/>return. Lobster. I just have to look down at my 
   

            <pb n="657"

     friend from Lewisporte, Mr. Northcott, and he 
     <lb/>
     could tell us more about lobster than we know. 
     <lb/>
     Lobsters today are not canned so much as they 
     <lb/>
     were in the old days, they are shipped away alive. 
     <lb/>
     I would like to pay a tribute to my friends in the 
     <lb/>
     co-operative business, for the manner in which 
     <lb/>
     they have cornered this lobster fishery in their 
     <lb/>
     area and arranged to ship them properly and 
     <lb/>
     co-operatively, and thereby assure to the people 
     <lb/>
     whom they are serving greater returns. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Salmon. Again, we have the same thing there 
     <lb/>
     as in the lobster fishery. Mr. Job would be able to 
     <lb/>
     tell us more about salmon, because I think he was 
     <lb/>
     shipping them to England in a frozen state for a 
     <lb/>
     good many years at any rate; but even today 
     <lb/>
     salmon are at a premium, and are being shipped 
     <lb/>
     away in the frozen condition. And then, as you 
     <lb/>
     know, our seal fishery for many years has been 
     <lb/>
     more or less a dud. Most of us remember when 
     <lb/>
     we had eight or ten huge ships prosecuting the 
     <lb/>
     seal fishery, and for some reason or other the 
     <lb/>
     seals got scarce, or the market collapsed or the 
     <lb/>
     strips were sold. For a good many years the seal 
     <lb/>
     fishery just more or less faded out of existence 
     <lb/>
     and gave no returns whatsoever to our people. 
     <lb/>
     Now in the last couple of years you have seen 
     <lb/>
     what has happened. That is not a wartime boom 
     <lb/>
     — it is peace. We have starving people all over 
     <lb/>
     the world, and we have unlimited fish, and there<lb break="no"/>fore it is our job to have brains and money 
     <lb/>
     enough, government or otherwise, to catch and 
     <lb/>
     ship it so that we can get something in return, and 
     <lb/>
     our people can pay the necessary revenues into 
     <lb/>
     our own exchequer to carry on our own govern<lb break="no"/>ment expenditures. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> ....As a matter of general prin<lb break="no"/>ciple I think I should now lay down that all

     when a member has the floor it is quite customary 
     <lb/>
     for another who wishes to have the member 
     <lb/>
     speaking, who has just made a point, to elucidate 
     <lb/>
     a bit, to ask him to do so, if the member speaking 
     <lb/>
     is willing.... In the House of Commons and all 
     <lb/>
     parliamentary bodies, and in our House of As<lb break="no"/>sembly, when a man had the floor if another 
     <lb/>
     member wished to interject a question it was 
     <lb/>
     regarded as proper to do so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> My ruling is according to the 


            <cb/>
         

     rules of the Convention, and it is my duty to say 
     <lb/>
     that a member occupying the floor shall not be 
     <lb/>
     interrupted unless some member is arising to a 
     <lb/>
     point of order, and if he does not like my ruling 
     <lb/>
     he can appeal to the House.... We are in commit<lb break="no"/>tee of the whole and the chairman of the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Committee is responsible for the introduction of 
     <lb/>
     this report... It is his responsibility, and in fair 
     <lb/>
     ness to all the members here I think the question 
     <lb/>
     should be properly addressed to him.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Again on that point. If a mem<lb break="no"/>ber on the floor expresses an opinion, or a con<lb break="no"/>clusion, may not a member seated, with the

     usurp his place, but in the manner: "Excuse me,

     would you mind and he says, "Yes", and the 
     <lb/>
     member speaking, if he wishes, can deal with it. 
     <lb/>
     If not he can say, "You can have the floor later". 
     <lb/>
     That's so customary in every parliamentary

     body, and if we are going by parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     rules....

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> We are a glorified debating society, 
     <lb/>
     according to a judge of the Supreme Court.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> This is really a glorified com<lb break="no"/>mission, and rules have been laid down by the 
     <lb/>
     Rules Committee, which I am bound to enforce 
     <lb/>
     without any reference to established British par<lb break="no"/>liamentary practice... Are you ready to continue 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hollett? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.... The 
     <lb/>
     whaling business is in a very flourishing condi<lb break="no"/>tion, and the industry does give considerable 
     <lb/>
     labour. All in all then, our fisheries last year were 
     <lb/>
     valued by me, or at least that was the finding of 
     <lb/>
     the Finance Committee, at $34.5 million. That in 
     <lb/>
     itself is a huge amount of money. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then there are our local industries which as 
     <lb/>
     you know, are more extensive than they were.... 
     <lb/>
     These altogether employ about 2,378 men and 
     <lb/>
     women, and the volume of business in local in<lb break="no"/>dustries last year was practically $15 million, and 
     <lb/>
     we did not have that after the last war, I remem<lb break="no"/>ber. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is one other thing that is neither fish nor 
     <lb/>
     local industries, but which is very close to us at 
     <lb/>
     this time. That is that American citizens are here 
     <lb/>
     in their hundreds at the American bases, but by 
     <lb/>
     reason of the fact that they are here we have some 
     <lb/>
     3,500 men and women employed in these bases. 
     <lb/>
     Now that is not a wartime industry either. These 
    

            <pb n="658"
                facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-11-05_Page_0658.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">658</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">November 1947</fw>
         

     bases are here for 99 years. At the present time at 
     <lb/>
     Harmon Field they are expending some $20 mil<lb break="no"/>lion, if my memory serves me right, which means 
     <lb/>
     that eventually more than 3,500 men and women 
     <lb/>
     of this country will find employment at Harmon 
     <lb/>
     Field and Argentia and here in St. John's. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think, having looked at all these things, I 
     <lb/>
     cannot conceive how any man in this assembly 
     <lb/>
     could possibly come to the conclusion which they 
     <lb/>
     did when they said that they could put our 
     <lb/>
     revenue safely in the years to come at $30 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. They took account of a possible depression. 
     <lb/>
     On top of that they tell you we have new 
     <lb/>
     peacetime industries which are not going to leave 
     <lb/>
     and that is what we want. They have told us this 
     <lb/>
     and I would almost be optimistic enough to put 
     <lb/>
     the figure at a much higher price than $30 million. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore I have to come to the conclusion that 
     <lb/>
     they were very conservative in their estimate.... 
     <lb/>
     Of course if the whole world goes, we will not 
     <lb/>
     need it then at all. They also pointed out the 
     <lb/>
     possibilities of the Marshall Plan if it goes into 
     <lb/>
     effect. We know the trouble we have had in 
     <lb/>
     finding the price of our salt cod for the year. The 
     <lb/>
     Marshall Plan would, I hope, cure all that. So as 
     <lb/>
     we were on the top of the pig's back after the last 
     <lb/>
     war I think we will be on the top of the elephant's 
     <lb/>
     back in this peace, which I hope will last for a 
     <lb/>
     long time. I commend very strongly the action of 
     <lb/>
     the Finance Committee in coming to the con<lb break="no"/>clusions which they did. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I want you to look at the table on page 33. 
     <lb/>
     There you will find when making up the estimate 
     <lb/>
     for $30 million revenue, they tell us where they 
     <lb/>
     are going to get it.... Now just look at that table, 
     <lb/>
     andI want to show you — mind you, this is a very 
     <lb/>
     handy book, Mr. Smallwood... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> What connection is there be<lb break="no"/>tween Mr. Smallwood's book and the debate? 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> If you wish to adjourn the debate, I 
     <lb/>shall have to ask to have the comparative state<lb break="no"/>ment of imports and exports by revenue for the

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Before you go on, am I expected

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I was going to prove it from figures 
     <lb/>
     in the book of the member from Bonavista 
     <lb/>
     Centre, that went back to 1929. I did not have the 
     <lb/>
     estimates in my office last night when I was 
     <lb/>
     trying to think of this, and I turned to the back of 
     <lb/>
     that book and it was there. In any book which our

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Unless it is accepted by the

     book which Mr. Smallwood has written as being 
     <lb/>
     merely his expressions of opinion on certain sub<lb break="no"/>jects at the time the book was written. We are not

     discussing Mr. Smallwood's books, we are dis<lb break="no"/>cussing the Economic Report.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Thank you very much. I hope that 
     <lb/>
     will put you in your place. There is nothing 
     <lb/>
     official in them at all... The Finance Committee 
     <lb/>
     arrived at a point where they said: "Here we are 
     <lb/>
     going to have a revenue of $30 million, and an 
     <lb/>
     expenditure of $25 million, and that will leave us 
     <lb/>
     a surplus of $5 million. Now turn to page 37. We 
     <lb/>
     will see what they are going to do with that 
     <lb/>
     surplus. They say: "The surplus which would be 
     <lb/>
     shown on ordinary administration of government 
     <lb/>
     affairs we suggest should be expended as fol<lb break="no"/>lows: Additional Old Age Pensions ...$600,000," 
     <lb/>
     As you know, at the present time the government 
     <lb/>
     are expending $250,000 on old age pensions. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> $260,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Well, it is gone up then. $260,000, 
     <lb/>
     and this Committee proposes to add another 
     <lb/>
     $600,000 for our pensioners to endeavour to 
     <lb/>
     increase their pensions, which are not enough, 
     <lb/>
     albeit they only get $30 a month in Canada. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> We are not going to take a mortgage 
     <lb/>on his property when we give it to him. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I know that they do that, and they 
     <lb/>
     take his property if he dies, but that's another 
     <lb/>
     matter. You are not going to do that in your 
     <lb/>
     Finance Committee. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> No.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> I should think not. I think it is about 
     <lb/>
     time the old age pension was increased, and I 
     <lb/>
     hope it will be further increased. And while I am 
     <lb/>
     on that point I would like to indicate the condition 
     <lb/>
     of the poor in this town. I suppose it is much the 
     <lb/>
     same as the condition in the outports. The man 
     <lb/>
     who is out of work, or the women who is out of

     work, what does he get? $11 a month to live on. 
     <lb/>
     How would you live on $11 a month if you had 
     <lb/>
     to? Would you know what to buy? I think not. If 
     <lb/>
     there are two people needing relief what do they 
     <lb/>
     get? $20.80, and that's for 30 days.... I hope the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Committee will consider putting some of 
     <lb/>
     that surplus to help those people who, through no 
     <lb/>
     fault of their own, are unable to get work... Now 
     <lb/>
     Fishermen's and Mariners' Insurance, and other 
     <lb/>
     Social Services — $400,000. That is something 
     <lb/>
     that many of us have been advocating for a long 
     <lb/>
     time, and it is about time something was done 
     <lb/>
     about it.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now there was $1 million allotted for "En<lb break="no"/>couragement of Tourist Traffic by building 
     <lb/>
     Roads from Port-aux-Basques to Corner Brook 
     <lb/>
     — linking up Grand Falls and Gander, also 
     <lb/>
     Lewisporte with Gander." You do remember the 
     <lb/>
     remarks made about that paltry million dollars? 
     <lb/>
     How much would it take? Our friend from 
     <lb/>
     Bonavista said: "$1 million, you would want $10 
     <lb/>
     million", but don't you see he is in a hurry to get 
     <lb/>
     across the Cabot Strait. I say $1 million is not 
     <lb/>
     enough too, but you have got to cut your garment 
     <lb/>
     according to the cloth. This is only one/tenth of 
     <lb/>
     the schemes; when and if we ever do get a govern<lb break="no"/>ment, their expenditure may be along different 
     <lb/>
     lines. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then "Further encouragement and develop<lb break="no"/>ment of Fisheries, particularly Fresh Fish — 
     <lb/>
     $1,000,000." I am partly in accord with that be<lb break="no"/>cause our saltfish products go to people who are 
     <lb/>
     low wage earners in Europe and the West Indies 
     <lb/>
     and other places. They are not able to pay high 
     <lb/>
     prices for saltfish. Saltfish is not worth a high 
     <lb/>
     price, consequently if we are to raise the standard 
     <lb/>
     of living of our fishermen we must enable them 
     <lb/>
     to be paid more for their fish.... Mind you I am 
     <lb/>
     not damning the saltfish trade, that's what I grew 
     <lb/>
     up on. I dare say I cut my eye tooth on a piece of 
     <lb/>
     salt cod. Our people here lived on salt cod, don't 
     <lb/>
     forget that. There were no woods industries, or 
     <lb/>
     mining industries, or anything, just salt cod, and 
     <lb/>
     still they did not want to go across the Cabot 
     <lb/>
     Strait. Now we have those new industries and I 
     <lb/>
     am quite sure there is an unlimited future ahead 
     <lb/>
     of us. Mind you, it is not going to be easy going 
     <lb/>
     for everybody.... Our efforts for mankind are to 
     <lb/>
     raise the number of people who can so get to that 
     <lb/>
     standard of living where they will be able to live 
     <lb/>
     in comfort, and I hope in peace. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <cb/>

            <p>
     Local Public Works — $500,000. I have noth<lb break="no"/>ing to say about that because I know very little 
     <lb/>
     about public works. Now the next one, Mercan<lb break="no"/>tile Marine — $500,000. That man yesterday 
     <lb/>
     said, "$500,000, what are you going to do with 
     <lb/>
     $500,000? You might just as well put it down 
     <lb/>
     some pool or tank". That was the opinion of the 
     <lb/>
     member from Bonavista Centre. "It is absolutely 
     <lb/>
     useless to buy them now and sell them for half 
     <lb/>
     price in two years", that's what he said. We are a 
     <lb/>
     maritime people — wholly surrounded by ocean. 
     <lb/>
     We are catching fish and cutting trees and making 
     <lb/>
     newsprint, and digging out the ore, and we have 
     <lb/>
     not got a ship — we may have one or two, but we 
     <lb/>
     have no mercantile marine, and yet when the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Committee suggests that they should 
     <lb/>
     spend some money in order to build up a mercan<lb break="no"/>tile marine the man from Bonavista Centre says, 
     <lb/>
     "No, you are only wasting money." I put it to you, 
     <lb/>
     is that sensible? $500,000 is not enough at all. 
     <lb/>
     That will only build you a couple of small ships, 
     <lb/>
     won't it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> You can get a ship, a nice ship for 
     <lb/>
     $300,000. The Clarenville ships cost $300,000 
     <lb/>
     each, and they can only carry 300 tons. 
     <lb/>
     
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Then there's the Railway capital 
     <lb/>expenditure too. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Well, it would need all that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> That is with regard to what you are 
     <lb/>going to do with your surplus. Now turn to page 
     <lb/>41. The honesty of that Committee, as I said 
     <lb/>before, was brought into question, and in order 
     <lb/>finally to prove that I think that any man who 
     <lb/>insinuates anything against the honesty of these 
     <lb/>men, or says they did not make an honest report, 
     <lb/>once you read that paragraph on page 41 you will 
     <lb/>see that these men were absolutely sincere:

            <p>
     Now I ask you, do you think that this Commit<lb break="no"/>tee were not candid when they presented this 
     <lb/>
     report for our consideration? Anybody who 
     <lb/>
     thinks so should be examined. Then we go a little 
     <lb/>
     further down in the next paragraph. "We are 
     <lb/>
     conscious of the fact that there may be some 
     <lb/>
     delegates who will be satisfied with nothing less 
     <lb/>
     than an absolute gilt-edged guarantee of our sol<lb break="no"/>vency for the next 20 years, before they will 
     <lb/>
     accept the fact that Newfoundland is self-sup<lb break="no"/>porting." So they were under no illusions. Now 
     <lb/>
     about this matter of self-support. Luckily, under 
     <lb/>
     the Convention Act, Major Cashin, you did not 
     <lb/>
     have to decide whether we were self-supporting. 
     <lb/>
     That was the people away back in 1933 in the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland Act. They said, "You can have 
     <lb/>
     your government back when you are self-sup<lb break="no"/>porting", but not the Convention Act. They say, 
     <lb/>
     "No, you have to consider the financial condi<lb break="no"/>tions of this country due to wartime conditions 
     <lb/>
     etc., and satisfy yourselves, and make some 
     <lb/>
     recommendations." You did not have to find out 
     <lb/>
     whether we are self-supporting. No country in 
     <lb/>
     this world is ever self-supporting, no man or 
     <lb/>
     woman is ever self-supporting over any predes<lb break="no"/>tined period. This country, Canada, Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     — the mother of a good many countries, the 
     <lb/>
     country which we thought in our young days 
     <lb/>
     would be always self-supporting. She is not, and 
     <lb/>
     never was, and never can be. Don't let us forget 
     <lb/>
     that we ourselves can never be self-supporting for 
     <lb/>
     any particular period. We can only hope and pray 
     <lb/>
     to Almighty God that prosperity will continue to 
     <lb/>
     keep us self-supporting as long as possible. So 
     <lb/>
     you did not have to decide, although you said we 
     <lb/>
     are self-supporting. There were some remarks 
     <lb/>
     made yesterday aboutoptimism, realism and pes<lb break="no"/>simism. The gentleman from Bonavista Centre 
     <lb/>
     says you are too optimistic. I don't want it op<lb break="no"/>timistic, or pessimistic, but realistic. I ask you, 
     <lb/>
     who is a pessimist in this House? Is it not the man 
     <lb/>
     who said these words yesterday? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am afraid I have taken up a lot of your time. 
     <lb/>
     I did not intend to speak nearly as long, but as I

     went along I thought I might just as well finish 
   

            <cb/>
         

     my review of this report, which I think is an 
     <lb/>
     excellent report, and I have no fear whatsoever in 
     <lb/>
     recommending that when the time comes to vote 
     <lb/>
     upon it, it is your bounden duty to say, "Yes, we 
     <lb/>
     are self-supporting. The report is all right as far 
     <lb/>
     we can see." Never mind the experts and statis<lb break="no"/>ticians you are going to bring in. We are suppos<lb break="no"/>edly commonsense men, and sometimes I think 
     <lb/>
     statisticians are not. They are ordinary men, they 
     <lb/>
     will bring you in a set of figures which you can't 
     <lb/>
     possibly grasp or understand...; but you are hard<lb break="no"/>headed businessmen, every one of you 44 men, 
     <lb/>
     and there is that report, and I ask you to read it 
     <lb/>
     and ask yourselves, "Is that a fair report?" Think 
     <lb/>
     of the new industries. Think of the fisheries and 
     <lb/>
     mining and forestry, and all the others. Think of 
     <lb/>
     the $25 million that's in the Bank ofNova Scotia. 
     <lb/>
     Think of all these things, and you will have to 
     <lb/>
     come to the conclusion that they have brought in 
     <lb/>
     a fair and honest report, and that we are self-sup<lb break="no"/>porting as far as it is at all possible for us to be.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> Mr. Chairman, after making a very 
     <lb/>
     careful analysis of the figures and statements 
     <lb/>
     made in this report, my wonder is how any person 
     <lb/>
     continuously accused of being crammed full of 
     <lb/>
     politics could bring in such a comprehensive, 
     <lb/>
     informative, and conservative estimate of the true 
     <lb/>
     economic position of Newfoundland. There are 
     <lb/>
     no wild, exaggerated statements.... Treating the 
     <lb/>
     overall picture as we should, and as we would a 
     <lb/>
     private business, our liquid position is most en<lb break="no"/>couraging. If we were attached today and sold 
     <lb/>
     lock, stock and barrel, we are solvent and would 
     <lb/>
     have a surplus after all creditors were paid. The 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa delegation has done a splendid job by 
     <lb/>
     confirming in substance and in fact the essence 
     <lb/>
     of everything contained in this Economic Report 
     <lb/>
     and for this they deserve our congratulations. I 
     <lb/>
     would say to these gentlemen, stick to your guns, 
     <lb/>
     you have built a good case and some day you may 
     <lb/>
     have a chance to see your dreams come true; but 
     <lb/>
     do not come back and before the ink is dry on the 
     <lb/>
     paper tell the world you painted a false picture 
     <lb/>
     and were just trying to get money from Canada 
     <lb/>
     under false pretences. This will react badly and 
     <lb/>
     will cast a reflection on the whole delegation. We 
     <lb/>
     have agreed the country is watching, other 
     <lb/>
     countries beside ours are watching also, and they 
     <lb/>
     will judge us on our merits by the permanent 
     <lb/>
     good and loyalty that is in us.... We all have a 
     <lb/>
     common duty to perform, regardless of the par<lb break="no"/>

     ticular form of government we favour. That duty 
     <lb/>
     is to restore and maintain lost confidence and 
     <lb/>
     pride in Newfoundland. We owe this to those 
     <lb/>
     who sent us here and to ourselves. This document 
     <lb/>
     is a contribution toward this end and let us adopt 
     <lb/>
     it without delay after the meat from it has been 
     <lb/>
     handed to the public through debate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     While we know there has been an enormous 
     <lb/>
     amount of waste, the same applies to every 
     <lb/>
     country on earth. Yet when we look at our vast 
     <lb/>
     coastline and consider the huge area over which 
     <lb/>
     we have to serve such a very small population, 
     <lb/>
     the amount spent even on capital account is neg<lb break="no"/>ligible and ample justification exists for this 
     <lb/>
     moderate amount, for which we have fair value 
     <lb/>
     on the credit side of the ledger. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are enough concrete facts in this report 
     <lb/>
     to convince the strongest critic that the charges 
     <lb/>
     so frequently laid against past statesmen in this 
     <lb/>
     country were, on the whole, unwarranted. A net 
     <lb/>
     debt of about $35 million after 450 years of 
     <lb/>
     inhabiting and opening up a wilderness is not a 
     <lb/>
     bad showing. The amount at credit to capital 
     <lb/>
     account of treasury and people of $150 million is, 
     <lb/>
     in my opinion, most conservative. I feel 
     <lb/>
     whichever government succeeds the present, 
     <lb/>
     steps should be taken to effect a saving on our 
     <lb/>
     interest, and if possible transfer our debt to the 
     <lb/>
     dollar area by floating in the United States or 
     <lb/>
     Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I feel the merchant navy branch of the service 
     <lb/>
     should have been segregated from the Railway 
     <lb/>
     many years ago; but now that we have acquired 
     <lb/>
     that magnificent property known as the naval 
     <lb/>
     dockyard the time is even more opportune to 
     <lb/>
     create a fleet manned wholly by New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders which would not only serve 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland in peace but the general allied 
     <lb/>
     cause in war, which is inevitable on our shores. I 
     <lb/>
     do not treat the suggested half-million dollars as 
     <lb/>
     a waste, neither would anyone who has a true 
     <lb/>
     sense of appreciation for the men who manned 
     <lb/>
     these ships in the dark days of 1939 to 1945. We 
     <lb/>
     are on an island, we are not self-sufficient, and 
     <lb/>
     we must of necessity have ships to bring food to 
     <lb/>
     our shores and our fish and other products to 
     <lb/>
     foreign markets. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With reference to Gander airport, it just does 
     <lb/>
     not make sense or reason for Newfoundland to be 
     <lb/>
     maintaining this terminal chiefly for foreign air<lb break="no"/>lines, and showing a deficit on the operation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     In an unsettled world no country can forecast 
     <lb/>
     exactly what may happen. The compilers of this 
     <lb/>
     report have, in every paragraph, kept within the 
     <lb/>
     bounds of reason. Our paper industry is making 
     <lb/>
     rapid strides, which can only be retarded by a 
     <lb/>
     general depression in our foreign markets. Our 
     <lb/>
     mining industry is only really being developed in 
     <lb/>
     a small way in comparison to what New<lb break="no"/>foundland offers in this field of employment to 
     <lb/>
     men of initiative and capital. Agriculture in a real 
     <lb/>
     way is only in its infancy, and despite our climate, 
     <lb/>
     vast and rapid improvements are being made in 
     <lb/>
     producing fruit and vegetables in a really big 
     <lb/>
     way. What we need now are proper storage 
     <lb/>
     facilities to save what we grow. Our fishery 
     <lb/>
     products will represent the most important part of 
     <lb/>
     our economy, and as we have only recently 
     <lb/>
     entered the machine age in this respect, we can 
     <lb/>
     from now on compete with the modern product 
     <lb/>
     and can hope for fair returns. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It has been generally agreed that it would not 
     <lb/>
     be a very wild guess to say that the gross earnings 
     <lb/>
     of our people at present exceed $100 million 
     <lb/>
     annually. If this is correct the Economic Commit<lb break="no"/>tee is justified in expecting a revenue for the 
     <lb/>
     foreseeable future of $30 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Social improvements will be made because 
     <lb/>
     we are in an age of social reform, and no govern<lb break="no"/>ment will try to impede progress in this direction. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore fishermen's insurance, improved old 
     <lb/>
     age pensions, increased widow's allowance and 
     <lb/>
     all the rest, will come as the evolution of the time 
     <lb/>
     and age we live in, and not as a result of any 
     <lb/>
     particular form of government. Therefore I sub<lb break="no"/>scribe my name to the belief that Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     is at present a self-supporting country based on 
     <lb/>
     sound economic factors; and that all the evidence 
     <lb/>
     available to us indicates that this position of 
     <lb/>
     self-support will continue in the foreseeable fu<lb break="no"/>ture. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Mr. Chairman, this Economic 
     <lb/>
     Report is the last report to be presented to this 
     <lb/>
     Convention, with the exception of the report of 
     <lb/>
     the Ottawa delegation. This report is beyond 
     <lb/>
     doubt the most important of them all. In respect 
     <lb/>
     to the financial side of the report, I do not intend 
     <lb/>
     to try and develop any long thesis in support of 
     <lb/>
     the idea that this country is, and can continue to 
     <lb/>
     be, self-supporting. I am not going to produce a 
     <lb/>
     maze of figures and percentages dating back to 
     <lb/>
     the days of responsible government. What we are

     trying to do is to find out if our island is self-sup<lb break="no"/>porting. How are we going to define the term 
     <lb/>
     "self-support" as it applies to Newfoundland? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To be self-supporting means the extent to 
     <lb/>
     which the people can produce the necessary 
     <lb/>
     goods and services in sufficient quantities to 
     <lb/>
     maintain its population in reasonable comfort, 
     <lb/>
     and that can only be done by the effort and ability 
     <lb/>
     of the people themselves, to provide these goods 
     <lb/>
     and services from the natural resources at their 
     <lb/>
     command. There is no standard by which we can 
     <lb/>
     measure self-support; as a country is developed 
     <lb/>
     its standard of living is measured accordingly. As 
     <lb/>
     an example, compare the standard of living in the 
     <lb/>
     United States and Canada, 100 years ago with 
     <lb/>
     that of today. Do likewise for Newfoundland, and 
     <lb/>
     judge for yourselves. I maintain that we in New<lb break="no"/>foundland have progressed in parallel with our 
     <lb/>
     western neighbours. I am not trying to convey the 
     <lb/>
     idea that our standard of living is equal with those 
     <lb/>
     countries, but rather, our program has been com<lb break="no"/>paratively even. I want you to consider our 
     <lb/>
     retarded development of the first two centuries 
     <lb/>
     after discovery, which, historians claim, was 
     <lb/>
     planned as a deliberate act, We were a very late 
     <lb/>
     starter in the race of progress. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As far as the revenue and expenditures are 
     <lb/>
     concerned, for the period which the Committee 
     <lb/>
     had under review, if we go back further than that, 
     <lb/>
     we find that for very near a century, since 1856 
     <lb/>
     to 1947, this country has accumulated a national 
     <lb/>
     debt of only $72 million. If we consider the late 
     <lb/>
     start of our national life, and if we consider the 
     <lb/>
     cost to Newfoundland for her participation in two 
     <lb/>
     world wars, then I maintain that our national debt 
     <lb/>
     is a paltry sum indeed. Perhaps if our national 
     <lb/>
     debt was ten times as great, we would have more 
     <lb/>
     friends. The Committee has shown quite clearly 
     <lb/>
     that as far as revenue and expenditure was con<lb break="no"/>cerned, the record is good, most definitely good. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In respect to the economic side, it is evident to 
     <lb/>
     me that in regard to the fishery, forest and mining 
     <lb/>
     industries, the Committee has reviewed all the 
     <lb/>
     evidence and factors pertaining to those in<lb break="no"/>dustries, and have made their forecast according<lb break="no"/>ly. To some members, the forecast may appear to 
   

            <cb/>
           

     be too optimistic.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is another section of the report on which 
     <lb/>
     I want to say something, and that is in regard to 
     <lb/>
     agriculture. The Committee has not been too 
     <lb/>
     optimistic in their forecast. Our agricultural in<lb break="no"/>dustry is capable of being expanded to at least 
     <lb/>
     twice its present value. I want to point out some 
     <lb/>
     very pertinent facts. During the 20 years imme<lb break="no"/>diately proceeding World War II, this country 
     <lb/>
     imported approximately $60 million worth of 
     <lb/>
     farm produce. This volume of imports was com<lb break="no"/>posed of only those articles of food which can be 
     <lb/>
     produced here in this country by our local 
     <lb/>
     farmers. I am going to quote three items of food 
     <lb/>
     imported during the 20 year period mentioned: 
     <lb/>
     imports of eggs — 3,361,300 dozen; milk — 
     <lb/>
     50,140,920 liquid lbs.; meats — over 
     <lb/>
     380,899,700 lbs. Or, if we take it another way, 
     <lb/>
     and include imports of vegetables we find a total 
     <lb/>
     of over 300,000 tons of food imported during 
     <lb/>
     those 20 years. Here we have one of the causes 
     <lb/>
     of our troubles, an undeveloped and unorganised 
     <lb/>
     agricultural industry. This condition can and 
     <lb/>
     should be corrected. I believe that with the proper 
     <lb/>
     farm marketing organisation, and with more en<lb break="no"/>couragement and determination on the part of our 
     <lb/>
     citizens to obtain their requirements from our 
     <lb/>
     local farmers, such a large volume of imports can 
     <lb/>
     be considerably reduced. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am declaring myself in support of the 
     <lb/>
     opinion that this country is self-supporting now, 
     <lb/>
     and we can continue to be self-supporting in the 
     <lb/>
     future. I for one am proud of our historic record, 
     <lb/>
     Lord Amulree to the contrary notwithstanding, 
     <lb/>
     and I feel that we would have made progress 
     <lb/>
     along regular and ordinary lines without the in<lb break="no"/>tervention even of World War II, with its so- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     called boom of non-productive prosperity. We 
     <lb/>
     are no different from other people of the world in 
     <lb/>
     matters of native ability, industry and vision. 
     <lb/>
     What the future hold for us is anybody's guess. 
     <lb/>
     That holds good for every country, and our future 
     <lb/>
     depends entirely upon our own efforts to make 
     <lb/>
     that future as bright as possible.
