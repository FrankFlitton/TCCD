<!--<p>
     difference in the figures. I can understand why 
     <lb/>
     the difference in expenditure may arise, but 
     <lb/>
     frankly the difference in the expenditure from the 
     <lb/>
     one we made up rather puzzles me. The first gave 
     <lb/>
     an accounting for expenditure of $13,920,000. 
     <lb/>
     When we got to Ottawa, after some consideration 
     <lb/>
     we increased that budget by $500,000. If I 
     <lb/>
     remember rightly the budget for expenditure 
     <lb/>
     that we finally presented was $14,420,000. That 
     <lb/>
     is as you have it in your Black Book. Now on the 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     revenue side we had a revenue of $3 million. That 
     <lb/>
     is apart altogether from this $1 million tax that 
     <lb/>
     we added on afterwards, a special tax...

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Mr. Chairman, when we ad<lb break="no"/>journed yesterday, I was referring to budgets that 
     <lb/>
     had been made by the delegation prior to their 
     <lb/>
     going to Ottawa in June... Now we made two 
     <lb/>
     "guesstimates" going to Ottawa, one was to do 
     <lb/>
     with expenditures and one with revenue. There 
     <lb/>
     has been a difference in both these budgets, from 
     <lb/>
     the ones we made up and the ones that are before 
     <lb/>
     you today, and it is in that connection that I would 
     <lb/>
     like some explanation... Now if you will begin 
     <lb/>
     on page 56 of the Black Book, part II, you will 
     <lb/>
     probably follow me a little more intelligently. It 
     <lb/>
     is "Probable Division of Existing Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     Public Expenditures".... 
     <lb/>
      </p>

            <p><hi rendition="simple:italic">[Mr. Higgins then went on to compare the es<lb break="no"/>timates of probable provincial expenditures and 
     <lb/>revenues prepared by the Ottawa delegation and

     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>....I merely draw your attention to these [chan<lb break="no"/>ges] because frankly the way it appears to me is 
     <lb/>this: that when these estimates were made up by 
     <lb/>the committee going away, they did the best they 
     <lb/>could with what they had. They had no clerical 
     <lb/>help from the department concerned, even 
     <lb/>though application was made, but we did the best 
     <lb/>we could. Now I submit to Mr. Smallwood that 
     <lb/>he was faced with increased expenditure, and he 
     <lb/>had to find increased revenue for it, and he has 
     <lb/>apparently stepped up the figures that the com<lb break="no"/>mittee prepared, and I would like an explanation 
     <lb/>as to why he did mat.

            <cb/>
       

     tawa delegation before we went to Ottawa, with 
     <lb/>
     the estimates of revenue and expenditure that I 
     <lb/>
     brought in here on Monday. Frankly I do not see 
     <lb/>
     the point. I do not see what point there is in 
     <lb/>
     comparing two things which are not comparable. 
     <lb/>
     Before we went to Ottawa we felt that we ought 
     <lb/>
     to have some idea of how much money the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Newfoundland would have to 
     <lb/>
     spend each year, if we became a province, and 
     <lb/>
     what would likely be the revenue to go towards 
     <lb/>
     that expense. We felt that we ought to do that. We 
     <lb/>
     did it according to the best of our knowledge at 
     <lb/>
     that time. We spent three months in Ottawa, and 
     <lb/>
     we learned a lot, and on the basis of what I learned 
     <lb/>
     I brought in here on Monday estimates of what 
     <lb/>
     the Province of Newfoundland would likely have 
     <lb/>
     to spend per year. and estimates of what the 
     <lb/>
     revenue from all sources would likely be.... What 
     <lb/>
     relation there is or can be between the two, apart 
     <lb/>
     from a purely academic relationship, I fail to see. 
     <lb/>
     As I have said several times in the last two or 
     <lb/>
     three weeks the estimates of expenditure and 
     <lb/>
     revenue that we made up before we went to 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa, that appear in the Black Book, are out of 
     <lb/>
     date... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     in introducing these estimates on Monday. I 
     <lb/>
     took, I believe, from 3.30 - 5.30 pm to read them, 
     <lb/>
     and to explain various items that differed 
     <lb/>
     materially from the government's own current 
     <lb/>
     estimates... The basis of comparison should be 
     <lb/>
     between the estimates that I brought in here Mon<lb break="no"/>day and those of the government as they exist in 
     <lb/>
     the current estimates. That is a fair basis of com<lb break="no"/>parison from the standpoint of expenditure. Now 
     <lb/>
     from the standpoint of revenue I grant you. the 


            <pb n="988" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-12-10_Page_0988.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">988</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">December 1947</fw>
        

     government's own current estimates for this year 
     <lb/>
     are only in part a fair basis of comparison ... 
     <lb/>
     because in my estimates the revenue is divided 
     <lb/>
     into two kinds — on the one hand revenue got by 
     <lb/>
     taxing the people of the province, and on the other 
     <lb/>
     revenue from non-taxation sources. From the 
     <lb/>
     standpoint of the taxation sources it is fair to 
     <lb/>
     compare my estimates with the estimates of the 
     <lb/>
     government. From the standpoint of non-tax 
     <lb/>
     revenue, the government's estimates do not fur<lb break="no"/>nish us any clue or any guidance whatsoever. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would point out that the estimates that I 
     <lb/>
     brought in estimate that in the first eight years of 
     <lb/>
     union the government of the province would 
     <lb/>
     spend $123 million; and I would point out further 
     <lb/>
     that $83 million of that ... I estimate would come 
     <lb/>
     to the government not from taxation sources at 
     <lb/>
     all, which leaves $39,960,000, call it $40 million 
     <lb/>
     to come to the government from taxation on the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland; and ... in respect of that 
     <lb/>
     item it is fair to compare it with the government's 
     <lb/>
     present current estimates in the Blue Book; but 
     <lb/>
     with respect to the $83 million from non-taxation 
     <lb/>
     sources there is no basis of comparison, because 
     <lb/>
     those are based upon the terms in the Grey Book. 
     <lb/>
     Now while I am on my feet, I want to reply to 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hollett. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Before you reply to Mr. Hollett, I 
     <lb/>
     wonder if you would mind answering those two 
     <lb/>
     specific questions I asked? Whatever we learned 
     <lb/>
     in Ottawa or did not learn in Ottawa, I would like 
     <lb/>
     to know how licenses for motor vehicles and 
     <lb/>
     drivers has been increased from $250,000 (some 
     <lb/>
     of us do not like that estimate) to $325,000? Can 
     <lb/>
     you tell me that? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I do not mind answering that 
     <lb/>
     specific question. When we were drafting our 
     <lb/>
     estimates of possible revenue for the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland before we went to Ottawa, there 
     <lb/>
     was, as Mr. Higgins has said, some difference of 
     <lb/>
     opinion as to how much we should estimate to be 
     <lb/>
     revenue from vehicular licenses on motor cars, 
     <lb/>
     trucks, buses, and from drivers' licenses. My 
     <lb/>
     contention, and the dispute, if there was a dispute, 
     <lb/>
     between some members of the delegation and 
     <lb/>
     myself, was that we should raise that amount. 
     <lb/>
     Now who was right and who was wrong? I was 
     <lb/>
     right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Why? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I will show you why I was right 
     <lb/>
     and the others wrong.... The government itself in 
   

            <cb/>
         

     the Blue Book estimates for the current year 
     <lb/>
     $220,000. The year before they raised $180,000, 
     <lb/>
     so this year they estimate $220,000, and to date 
     <lb/>
     they have taken in over $260,000. Now who was 
     <lb/>
     right and who was wrong? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> You were right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Of course I was right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> It is a long way from $225,000. 
     <lb/>
     
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> All right, this current year they 
     <lb/>have taken in already over $260,000. They only 
     <lb/>estimated for $220,000, and my estimate of 
     <lb/>$300,000-odd is not for this year, or next year, 
     <lb/>but an average for each year for the first four 
     <lb/>years of union; and during those years ... there 
     <lb/>will be more roads in Newfoundland ... there will 
     <lb/>be more miles of road in 1948 than in this current 
     <lb/>year, and each year there will be more mileage, 
     <lb/>there will be more motor cars, especially, sir, if 
     <lb/>we get confederation, because they will come in 
     <lb/>duty-free from Canada. There will be more motor 
     <lb/>cars, and more drivers, and it is a perfectly fair 
     <lb/>and conservative estimate to do what I have done, 
     <lb/>to estimate for the first four years of union 
     <lb/>$320,000 a year where the government this very 
     <lb/>year has taken in already over $260,000. I have 
     <lb/>already given that explanation. Mr. Higgins sat 
     <lb/>behind me here while I did it on Monday after<lb break="no"/>noon. It is true I was back on to him, and I can't 
     <lb/>guarantee that he was here every moment, but I 
     <lb/>explained all these points on Monday afternoon. 
     <lb/>Why go all over it again? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I don't think you explained that 
     <lb/>
     particular point. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I explained that point in con<lb break="no"/>siderable detail, exactly as I did it for the past four 
     <lb/>
     or five minutes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> As a matter of fact I recall dis<lb break="no"/>tinctly Mr. Smallwood stating: "Already this 
     <lb/>
     year the government has received $265,000". 
     <lb/>
     Then he went on to say, "I should not say 'already 
     <lb/>
     this year', because for all practical purposes we 
     <lb/>
     must assume that there will not be much addition<lb break="no"/>al revenue raised in this respect between now and 
     <lb/>
     the end of March next year". 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Where are the roads going to come 
     <lb/>
     from, Mr. Smallwood? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Now I pass on, Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     and reply to Mr. Hollett. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> If you don't mind, with all due 
     <lb/>
     respect, I don't like to be brushed off as easily as 
     <lb/>
     that.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, I do not like being 
     <lb/>
     brushed off, but I have an intense dislike to being 
     <lb/>
     insulted, strange maybe. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Just a moment, Mr. Small<lb break="no"/>wood, so that I can deal with the propriety or 
     <lb/>
     otherwise; why do you feel that you are being 
     <lb/>
     insulted because Mr. Higgins has asked you 
     <lb/>
     where the additional roads are coming from? 
     <lb/>
     
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I was not referring to that. I do 
     <lb/>not regard that question as an insult. I regard this 
     <lb/>as an insult: I spent from 2:30 to 5:30 pm explain<lb break="no"/>ing these points, then to be asked by a gentleman 
     <lb/>who sat here three or four feet from me right 
     <lb/>throughout that period ... all these same questions 
     <lb/>over again. It is insulting to me. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Smallwood, on that point I 
     <lb/>
     cannot sustain you. Whether or not Mr. Higgins 
     <lb/>
     was here, and if he is merely asking you to 
     <lb/>
     recapitulate or reiterate information you have 
     <lb/>
     already given the House, at the worst it can be 
     <lb/>
     merely construed as a waste of time; but I have 
     <lb/>
     no knowledge of Mr. Higgins being here at the 
     <lb/>
     time. I have to deal with the tenor or substance of 
     <lb/>
     his question... I find nothing insulting in the 
     <lb/>
     question itself. Whether or not Mr. Higgins was 
     <lb/>
     here and heard that and is now asking for infor<lb break="no"/>mation that you have already given the House on 
     <lb/>
     Monday is something I am not prepared to rule 
     <lb/>
     upon... If you don't mind, Mr. Smallwood, 
     <lb/>
     would you have any objection to answering 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins' question? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, in reply to 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Higgins I will now ask him a question. Will 
     <lb/>
     he please tell me what roads are being built in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, what are budgeted for, how many 
     <lb/>
     were built in 1947, how many are budgeted for in 
     <lb/>
     1948? And I have as much right to ask him as he 
     <lb/>
     has to ask me. He was a member of the Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     delegation, and l was a member of the delegation. 
     <lb/>
     Am I going to sit here, or stand here and be treated 
     <lb/>
     as though I was a stranger and he was a stranger? 
     <lb/>
     We were both up to Ottawa together. Now I will 
     <lb/>
     ask him the question. Please answer, Mr. Hig<lb break="no"/>gins. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Mr. Chairman, Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     made the budget, and there are no roads in the 
     <lb/>
     budget. Now Mr. Smallwood, will you tell me 
     <lb/>
     what roads were built here for the past 20 years, 
     <lb/>
     year by year, and name where they are, and what 
     <lb/>
     it will cost to maintain them, etc. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Smallwood, there is no 

            <cb/>
       

     item in the budget or estimate covering roads as 
     <lb/>
     such, but indirectly you did raise the position by 
     <lb/>
     virtue of the fact that you did predicate your 
     <lb/>
     estimate of increased revenue upon the position 
     <lb/>
     that more and more roads are to be built in the 
     <lb/>
     passage of time... Therefore I feel compelled to 
     <lb/>
     hold that while there is no direct reference to it, 
     <lb/>
     it is introduced into the picture by virtue of the 
     <lb/>
     fact that you predicate the higher figure upon the 
     <lb/>
     assumption that more and more roads will be 
     <lb/>
     built. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Now I will answer Mr. Hollett, 
     <lb/>
     if he is ready. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Are you going to answer my ques<lb break="no"/>tion? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No. I am not answering it, and 
     <lb/>
     I am not going to answer it. Let any man who was 
     <lb/>
     not on the delegation ask me an honest question, 
     <lb/>
     and I will give an honest answer. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> All right, Mr. Smallwood, then 
     <lb/>
     you... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> If Major Cashin asks, he is a 
     <lb/>
     man, and I will answer. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Now, now, Mr. Smallwood. 
     <lb/>
     
    </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I am not going to be insulted. I 
     <lb/>have stood it for three weeks from a fellow col<lb break="no"/>league on the Ottawa delegation; he can sit back 
     <lb/>and discuss that delegation, and treat me as if I 
     <lb/>were a member of it and he was not. The whole 
     <lb/>country is talking about it. Now let Major Cashin 
     <lb/>ask. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Well, I am going to put it this way: 
     <lb/>
     I take it that Mr. Smallwood means that when 
     <lb/>
     roads are built they are going to be built out of 
     <lb/>
     capital, not out ofcurrent revenue. Is that right? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That is under union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes, under confederation, they are 
     <lb/>
     built out of capital. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Yes. That's just the point. Now if 
     <lb/>
     we go into union, if we ever do, and I don't think 
     <lb/>
     we will, there is supposed to be $30 million 
     <lb/>
     roughly in cash in our accumulated surplus 
     <lb/>
     earned from monies owed by the Housing Cor<lb break="no"/>poration and individuals, therefore you take $10 
     <lb/>
     million of that money and you deposit it with the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government, which is to be spent on 
     <lb/>
     current account only. That leaves $20 million 
     <lb/>
     balance, which is supposed to be capital account, 
     <lb/>
     from which you would spend, 1 take it, to build 
     <lb/>
     these roads. Now there is over $9 million of that 


            <pb n="990" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-12-10_Page_0990.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">990</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">December 1947</fw>
        

     in England today. There's going to be another $5 
     <lb/>
     million or $6 million this year spent out of this 
     <lb/>
     surplus to pay for fish, that's $15 million, conse<lb break="no"/>quently you have $5 million left of your accumu<lb break="no"/>lated surplus in Newfoundland. Now the way 
     <lb/>
     road building is going these days, $5 million is 
     <lb/>
     not going to increase it very much, and unless and 
     <lb/>
     until you got your sterling converted into dollars, 
     <lb/>
     and we have not been told in any of these terms 
     <lb/>
     here whether or not the Canadian government is 
     <lb/>
     going to convert this sterling back to dollars for 
     <lb/>
     us, I can't see how you can do much road con<lb break="no"/>struction with $16 million in Great Britain and 
     <lb/>
     just $5 million here in capital account, a lot of 
     <lb/>
     which will have to be taken probably for various 
     <lb/>
     other matters of capital expenditure.... That's the 
     <lb/>
     point I want to know, if there is any arrangement 
     <lb/>
     between the Canadian government, New<lb break="no"/>foundland government, and the Ottawa dele<lb break="no"/>gation to the effect that all this money we have in 
     <lb/>
     sterling will be converted back to dollars, and 
     <lb/>
     when it will be converted; because if you have 
     <lb/>
     not got it converted you can't build many roads, 
     <lb/>
     because you have no surplus on your provincial 
     <lb/>
     budgeting, you have deficits. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I appreciate the point made by 
     <lb/>
     Major Cashin, and the gentlemanly way in which 
     <lb/>
     he has made his point. Major Cashin and I are 
     <lb/>
     becoming like... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> We will stop this commotion in 
     <lb/>
     the galleries right away. Members will please 
     <lb/>
     remember that this is an investigation of a very 
     <lb/>
     serious matter by the members of this Convention 
     <lb/>
     and no members, or anybody outside this Con<lb break="no"/>vention is entitled to participate in the debate at 
     <lb/>
     all, therefore we are not concerned with the ap<lb break="no"/>proval or disapproval of any person in the gallery, 
     <lb/>
     and I don't want to hear any further commotion 
     <lb/>
     there. Go ahead, Mr. Smallwood. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, as I said here on 
     <lb/>
     Monday, this where the note on page 2 says, 
     <lb/>
     "This assumes that the accumulated cash surplus 
     <lb/>
     of $28 million has been converted into dollars 
     <lb/>
     and placed on deposit at 2 5/8% with the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada, and that an average of $3 million 
     <lb/>
     a year is withdrawn during the first eight years of 
     <lb/>
     union for the purpose of development in New<lb break="no"/>foundland." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Excuse me, in order to get 2 5/8% 
     <lb/>
     from Canada, you have got to convert it into 
     

            <cb/>
        

     dollars. How is that going to be done? Is the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government going to do it, or is the 
     <lb/>
     British government going to find the dollars 
     <lb/>
     when we become a province? Because you can't 
     <lb/>
     find it unless you convert it first. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I agree that that is true. Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin will understand, and he will appreciate 
     <lb/>
     the position I take, when I say that in view of his 
     <lb/>
     very well-known stand that we will never get 
     <lb/>
     back our interest-free loans from Britain, and that 
     <lb/>
     it will never be converted into dollars, that I feel 
     <lb/>
     like saying as little as I can humanly say on that 
     <lb/>
     point, as to how the sterling will be converted into 
     <lb/>
     dollars and by whom. I will say this, that I have 
     <lb/>
     no doubt whatever that our sterling, that part of 
     <lb/>
     our accumulated surplus that now lies in sterling 
     <lb/>
     or will lie in sterling at the time of union, will be 
     <lb/>
     converted into dollars; because, as Major Cashin 
     <lb/>
     points out, the Government of Canada agrees to 
     <lb/>
     receive on deposit from Newfoundland at 2 5/8% 
     <lb/>
     interest, only the part of the surplus in dollars.... 
     <lb/>
     It is important therefore, that the sterling be con<lb break="no"/>verted to dollars. I have no doubt, none at all, that 
     <lb/>
     that will be done. I don't want to say more than 
     <lb/>
     that, and furthermore I am not going to be forced 
     <lb/>
     to say any more than that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> May I go on? If Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     will not answer me maybe someone else will. I 
     <lb/>
     am still on this road question, and I would point 
     <lb/>
     out to you that the gasoline tax has been increased 
     <lb/>
     from the amount we figured it at, $750,000, to $1 
     <lb/>
     million, that is $250,000 more, and there is 
     <lb/>
     $75,000 more on the items that I outlined a 
     <lb/>
     minute ago, and that $325,000. I still ask 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood where are the roads coming from 
     <lb/>
     in four years, or eight years, to make that in<lb break="no"/>crease. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, was Mr. Hig<lb break="no"/>gins not in the House when I said... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Before we go into that, as we have 
     <lb/>
     only one reporter, could we have a recess for a

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, I would just 
     <lb/>
     like to say a word or two in general about this

     question of roads. This year, on June 24, the 
     <lb/>
     Cabot Highway was opened.<ref target="#fn_01">[1]</ref> This year they 
     <lb/>
     began to complete the road from Gander to 
     <lb/>
     Lewisporte, and the road from Corner Brook to 
     <lb/>
     Port-aux-Basques, and they had planned to con<lb break="no"/><note xml:id="fn_01">[1] The Cabot Highway which ran from Clarenville to Bonavista was completed in June 1947.</note>

     tinue these roads next year. They also began the 
     <lb/>
     road on the Burin Peninsula. These are roads 
     <lb/>
     which almost certainly will be completed before 
     <lb/>
     we become a province at all, except the stretch 
     <lb/>
     from Stephenville Crossing to Port-aux-Basques. 
     <lb/>
     That would have to be one of the first roads to be 
     <lb/>
     completed after union, because until it is com<lb break="no"/>pleted to Port-aux-Basques, Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     would not get the new ferry on the Gulf, and our 
     <lb/>
     tourist trade depends to a very large extent on our 
     <lb/>
     getting that ferry. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think it is common knowledge that a lot of 
     <lb/>
     roads were commenced this year and will be 
     <lb/>
     finished next year; and that in the course of the 
     <lb/>
     next few years the mileage of motorable roads in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland is going to increase steadily and 
     <lb/>
     considerably, which, in view of the fact that last 
     <lb/>
     year the government took in $900,000 in gasoline 
     <lb/>
     taxes, and in this current year will touch the $1 
     <lb/>
     million mark, it is pretty conservative, for the first 
     <lb/>
     four years of union, to put gasoline revenue at 
     <lb/>
     only $1 million, and for the second four years to 
     <lb/>
     stick another quarter of a million on it and say 
     <lb/>
     that revenue from gasoline will increase in New<lb break="no"/>foundland between 1947 and 1955 only by 
     <lb/>
     $250,000. So I hold that it is a most cautious and 
     <lb/>
     conservative estimate, and it would not surprise 
     <lb/>
     me at all, not at all if, by 1955, revenue to the 
     <lb/>
     province from gasoline, for use by motorists, 
     <lb/>
     would be up to $1.5 million, rather than $1.25 
     <lb/>
     million. Now yesterday, Mr. Hollett drew my 
     <lb/>
     attention... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Can I go on for a minute before you 
     <lb/>
     answer that question? I would like to finish... 
     <lb/>
</p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I have said I am not going to 
     <lb/>answer a whole lot of questions by Mr. Higgins. 
     <lb/>I have made an exception in two cases, but I am 
     <lb/>not going to be made the victim of courtroom 
     <lb/>tactics, and be subjected to cross-examination by 
     <lb/>a fellow delegate. Anyone else, yes, but not by a 
     <lb/>fellow delegate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> It is a little awkward, but I would 
     <lb/>
     like to ask a couple of questions if it would be all 
     <lb/>
     right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I rule that Mr. Higgins is en<lb break="no"/>titled to ask his questions at this time.... I don't 
     <lb/>
     want that to be misconstrued to mean that I am 
     <lb/>
     ruling upon the propriety or impropriety of the 
     <lb/>
     questions. If Mr. Smallwood's answer to all or 
     <lb/>
     any of these questions is that the knowledge is 
     <lb/>
     already known to Mr. Higgins because he was a 
    

            <cb/>
         

     member of that delegation, well of course that is 
     <lb/>
     a matter for Mr. Smallwood to decide himself. I 
     <lb/>
     therefore hold, Mr. Higgins, bearing in mind 
     <lb/>
     what I have already said, that you have a right to 
     <lb/>
     put your questions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I said, sir, that I made a mistake. 
     <lb/>
     The budget that we have for revenue in the Black 
     <lb/>
     Book was not made before we left here. We made 
     <lb/>
     a budget before we left, but the budget that is in 
     <lb/>
     the Black Book was a budget made by the entire 
     <lb/>
     delegation while we were in Ottawa. Now I am 
     <lb/>
     dropping the roads, as it is a pretty hot bridge, and 
     <lb/>
     I would like to have an explanation of why the 
     <lb/>
     item Home Affairs has been increased from 
     <lb/>
     $50,000, as arrived at by the delegation in Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa, to $125,000? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, I answered that 
     <lb/>
     in great detail on Monday, and not only that, but 
     <lb/>
     the result of it was an exchange of questions 
     <lb/>
     between Major Cashin and myself which led me 
     <lb/>
     to deliver a talk on what it was proper to call 
     <lb/>
     revenue and what was not proper to be called 
     <lb/>
     revenue. So, having given a complete explana<lb break="no"/>tion on Monday, and again yesterday, I don't 
     <lb/>
     propose to do it again. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Why was the revenue increased 
     <lb/>
     from $50,000 to $120,000? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> As I have already explained 
     <lb/>
     that on two occasions this very week, yesterday 
     <lb/>
     and on Monday, I don't propose to answer it 
     <lb/>
     again today. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> The question was never asked. The 
     <lb/>
     question was merely asked should it go to capital 
     <lb/>
     or current account. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> On that point there was, if I 
     <lb/>
     remember correctly, an exchange between Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin and Mr. Smallwood as to the propriety of 
     <lb/>
     including expenditures of that sort in current 
     <lb/>
     account. I must say that my recollection is that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I only asked how did the increase 
     <lb/>
     arise. That's all. Nothing more. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Have you anything to say, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> No, I have nothing further to 
     <lb/>
     say. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Well, can I have one more question 
     <lb/>
     and then I will sit down? The item of Forestry was 
     <lb/>
     increased from $151,000 to $171,000. Now 
     <lb/>
     $20,000 is neither here nor there, but I would still 
     <lb/>
     like to know how that increase was arrived at. </p>

 <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Now, sir, I am ready to reply to 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Hollett if everyone else is ready. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I take it I am not going to have an 
     <lb/>
     answer to that? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I have already answered that 
     <lb/>
     question and I am not going to answer it again. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Yesterday Mr. Hollett drew to my attention 
     <lb/>
     the fact that in the government's estimate there 
     <lb/>
     appears an item which does not appear in this 
     <lb/>
     estimate of mine. It is in respect of the 3.5% 
     <lb/>
     loan, 1950, £569,796, and the 3.5% loan, 1952, 
     <lb/>
     £302,731, interest £30,539, or $123,378. I did not 
     <lb/>
     include that in my estimate of provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ment expenditure, and Mr. Hollett wanted to 
     <lb/>
     know why I had not done so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I said yesterday that it might turn out that I had 
     <lb/>
     been wrong in not including it, and if I was wrong 
     <lb/>
     I would confess so frankly, and I do now confess 
     <lb/>
     that I ought to have included that amount on the 
     <lb/>
     expenditure side, and I thank Mr. Hollett for 
     <lb/>
     drawing my attention to it. It is not an extremely 
     <lb/>
     important item. The interest on the one is 
     <lb/>
     £10,596, or $42,000 a year, and the interest on 
     <lb/>
     the other is £19,943, or $79,770 a year. Now one 
     <lb/>
     of them comes due in 1950 and the other in 1952, 
     <lb/>
     so therefore, if you have my estimate of provin<lb break="no"/>cial government expenditure by you, you might 
     <lb/>
     add in respect of the first two years of union 
     <lb/>
     $123,378 a year. And in respect of the next two 
     <lb/>
     years of union, $42,808. You see, after the first 
     <lb/>
     two years of union the first loan would have been 
     <lb/>
     paid off, and there would be no further interest to 
     <lb/>
     pay on it, and we would still have two years to go 
     <lb/>
     on the small loan, which is $42,000 a year inter<lb break="no"/>est, and in two years that would disappear; so that 
     <lb/>
     averaged over the eight years, that would, be 
     <lb/>
     $41,000 a year average, or averaged for the first 
     <lb/>
     four years it would be $83,000. So as I have done 
     <lb/>
     it by averages, you might add to the expenditure 
     <lb/>
     for the first four years of union $83,172 a year. 
     <lb/>
  </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Mr. Chairman, I want to ask 
     <lb/>Mr. Smallwood, a question in respect of the civil 
     <lb/>service pensions of those civil servants employed 
     <lb/>by the Government of Newfoundland today, who 
     <lb/>would be employed by the Government of 
     <lb/>Canada if and when we become a province, and 
     <lb/>in relation to their employment, to their years of 
     <lb/>service in the Government of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>Under clause 17, subsection 2: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

            <p>
     Canada will make all necessary payments in 
     <lb/>
     respect of such pension rights and may

     deduct from any subsidies payable to the

     Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     Will those deductions be made in the form of 
     <lb/>
     payments to the civil service pension fund of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, or will they be made in respect of the 
     <lb/>
     accumulated service in the Government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and would those civil servants be paid 
     <lb/>
     for part of their service under the Civil Service 
     <lb/>
     Act of Newfoundland, and part under the civil 
     <lb/>
     service pension fund of Canada? Would they be 
     <lb/>
     paid for as contributions into the civil service 
     <lb/>
     pension fund of Canada, that's what I want to 
     <lb/>
     know. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I have Mr. Fogwill's question 
     <lb/>
     very clear. I will sort of review the whole position 
     <lb/>
     so that everyone will know what we are talking 
     <lb/>
     about. Mr. Fogwill would not mind that, would 
     <lb/>
     he? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Don't make it too long. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I will make it as long as neces<lb break="no"/>sary to make it clear to everyone, and no longer. 
     <lb/>
     Let us assume that on the day of union the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada employs certain people. 
     <lb/>
     That is the first time they become civil servants 
     <lb/>
     employed by the Government of Canada in New<lb break="no"/>foundland. Say at the Railway they take on new 
     <lb/>
     men. Well, it is employees of the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, it does not say civil servants in the 
     <lb/>
     clause. You passed the words. "Employees in 
     <lb/>
     departments or activities taken over by the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> That is those persons who have 
     <lb/>
     acquired pension rights under Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     law, therefore I was confining my remarks to 
     <lb/>
     actual civil servants. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> All right, we will deal with that 
     <lb/>
     alone. In departments of the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland which the Government of Canada 
     <lb/>
     takes over, after they have taken over, they take 
     <lb/>
     on a new man we will say. So far as his pension 
     <lb/>
     is concerned, the Government of Canada is 
     <lb/>
     responsible for that as long as ever he works for 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada. But they will also be 
     <lb/>
     taking over men who are already in these depart<lb break="no"/>ments, who are now civil servants of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Newfoundland, and have acquired 
     <lb/>
     certain pension rights by working so long for the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Newfoundland. They go right on 
  

            <pb n="993" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-12-10_Page_0993.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">December 1947</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="num">993</fw>
         

     being civil servants of the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. Now what Mr. Fogwill wants to know is 
     <lb/>
     this: who pays the pension of such a man in 
     <lb/>
     respect of the period that he worked for the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland government?.... The answer is the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland government pays it. Now second, 
     <lb/>
     about this deduction. You will notice that the 
     <lb/>
     word is "may". If the Government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland fails to pay the proper pension to a civil 
     <lb/>
     service pensioner that is his due, his right, that he 
     <lb/>
     earned by working for the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     government, then in order that that civil servant 
     <lb/>
     will not lose his pension rights for the period that 
     <lb/>
     he worked for the Newfoundland government, if 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland government does not pay his 
     <lb/>
     pension, then the Canadian government will; but 
     <lb/>
     it will deduct the amount from the subsidies they 
     <lb/>
     are expected to pay the Newfoundland govern<lb break="no"/>ment. It is not deposited in the civil servants' 
     <lb/>
     pensions fund in Canada, because it is an actual 
     <lb/>
     pension. Have I made that clear? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> I look upon it from a different light, 
     <lb/>
     for this reason: there is no doubt that there would 
     <lb/>
     be civil servants in the Government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland today rather up in age, we will say, and 
     <lb/>
     if they were 56 or 57 years old, would not be able 
     <lb/>
     to come under the benefits of the Civil Service 
     <lb/>
     Pension Act of Canada, if they became civil 
     <lb/>
     servants of Canada... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, they would. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Because of the fact that they would 
     <lb/>
     not attain the ten years service which is required. 
     <lb/>
     It does not matter to me very much, but in sum<lb break="no"/>ming up the situation of those people in the civil 
     <lb/>
     service today who will be taken over by Canada 
     <lb/>
     in the event of union, that number amounts to 
     <lb/>
     1,168, and the total payroll is $1,744,000. If we 
     <lb/>
     compute that into the average rate it would be 
     <lb/>
     approximately $1,000 per person. Now then, if 
     <lb/>
     they were taken over by the civil service of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and paid contributions to the civil ser<lb break="no"/>vice fund at 5%, which is the lowest rate, that 
     <lb/>
     would amount to $87,208. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That's 5% on what? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> On the total year's salaries. It may 
     <lb/>
     be a little less, because the wages were not so high 
     <lb/>
     a few years ago; nevertheless I would assume that 
     <lb/>
     the total years of service on these employees 
     <lb/>
     would be approximately 12. I think that's conser<lb break="no"/>vative, because I know many people who have 30 
     <lb/>
     or 40 years service now with our civil service. As 
  

            <cb/>
          

     we compute that amount of $87,208 we got 
     <lb/>
     $1,046, therefore we have got to make provision 
     <lb/>
     in this provincial budget, where you have 
     <lb/>
     $202,000 laid down in respect of payment of 
     <lb/>
     pensions. I don't think we are going to have much 
     <lb/>
     relief on $202,000 in respect of paying pensions 
     <lb/>
     for those who are on pension at the present time, 
     <lb/>
     because that will continue for a period of years, 
     <lb/>
     and then they will be in the civil serivce of the 
     <lb/>
     province if we have it.... I think you have got to 
     <lb/>
     lay down in your budget, Mr. Smallwood, a sum 
     <lb/>
     of $1,046,000. You can lay it down yearly, or you 
     <lb/>
     can lay it down in one sum. If you lay it down for 
     <lb/>
     an eight year period you have to lay down 
     <lb/>
     $130,000 for each year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That's very interesting. We 
     <lb/>
     went into that at considerable length in one of our 
     <lb/>
     committees in Ottawa. It struck me at one time 
     <lb/>
     that it might pay the government of the province 
     <lb/>
     to do exactly what Mr. Fogwill has suggested 
     <lb/>
     might be done, lay out the capital sum from the 
     <lb/>
     surplus and in that way wipe out at one blow the 
     <lb/>
     province's liability for civil servants' service 
     <lb/>
     pensions. That would be one way to do it, but, as 
     <lb/>
     we have got an amount of $200,000 a year in 
     <lb/>
     those estimates of mine, and as civil service pen<lb break="no"/>sioners gradually die, we will finally reach a peak 
     <lb/>
     and then the peak will begin to fall, but it won't 
     <lb/>
     be half $200,000. It will gradually as he says, 
     <lb/>
     begin to fall, so that the $200,000 a year covers 
     <lb/>
     it.... If Mr. Fogwill would like sometime to have 
     <lb/>
     a debate on the superannuation and pension 
     <lb/>
     schemes of Canadian civil servants I would be 
     <lb/>
     highly pleased to have it. It is one of the very 
     <lb/>
     finest. When a civil servant in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     gets a pension, when he dies then his pension dies 
     <lb/>
     too; but not in Canada, it goes on to his wife and 
     <lb/>
     children.... The point to remember is this. John 
     <lb/>
     Jones is now working in any post office. We 
     <lb/>
     become a province, and Canada takes over the 
     <lb/>
     Department of Posts and Telegraphs, so Jones 
     <lb/>
     becomes an employee of the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, so then he gets pensioned. The Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada pays his pension out of the pen<lb break="no"/>sion fund, towards which, it is true, he has 
     <lb/>
     contributed for his 15 years service with them, 
     <lb/>
     and the Newfoundland government pays his pen<lb break="no"/>sion for the 15 years he worked for them; so he is 
     <lb/>
     getting a pension from both governments. The 
     <lb/>
     number of pensioners that the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     government will have to pay for will be going on 


            <pb n="994" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-12-10_Page_0994.jpg"/>

     for many years to come. As they gradually get 
     <lb/>
     pensioned they will come on to the New<lb break="no"/>foundland government for part of their pension 
     <lb/>
     ... and you have already your existing pensioners; 
     <lb/>
     and you have those civil servants who will still 
     <lb/>
     be provincial civil servants.... Now we have an 
     <lb/>
     amount of $200,000 a year. That will cover it.... 
     <lb/>
     It might go to $250,000 for a year or two in which 
     <lb/>
     case you would have to find another $50,000 a 
     <lb/>
     year.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> ....The $200,000 that we have laid 
     <lb/>
     out will only cover civil service pension rights for 
     <lb/>
     the employees of the Province of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     Also included are those who will get pension 
     <lb/>
     rights and be superannuated in a few years. That 
     <lb/>
     has not even reached its peak yet, not even in 
     <lb/>
     regard to the ones who will be left to us. That will 
     <lb/>
     be an amount of probably 1,800 to 2,000 people. 
     <lb/>
     Now then, 1,600 people will go into the employ 
     <lb/>
     of the Government of Canada. I take that out of 
     <lb/>
     the estimate, and we have got to provide now in 
     <lb/>
     our provincial estimate, for their prior service, 
     <lb/>
     and that prior service will amount to $870,000 at 
     <lb/>
     ten years' service. At 12 years, which is only a 
     <lb/>
     conservative estimate of the average years of 
     <lb/>
     service of all those people, it will amount to 
     <lb/>
     $1,046,000. We have got to provide for that. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Not a year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> That's the total each year. Now 
     <lb/>
     then, we have got to take 5% of that and multiply 
     <lb/>
     it by their service, and lay down $130,000 a year 
     <lb/>
     for the next eight years to provide for pensions of 
     <lb/>
     those who go into the federal employ of the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Let's put it this way... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Mr. Chairman, it's just as well to 
     <lb/>
     tell the people of this country the truth. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Now suppose we don't have 
     <lb/>
     confederation, and the present government is 
     <lb/>
     what we go on with; or if we have anything but 
     <lb/>
     confederation in the next ten years. At the present 
     <lb/>
     time civil service pensions are costing us 
     <lb/>
     $202,000 a year. What will be the bill ten years 
     <lb/>
     from now? Has Mr. Fogwill figured that out? Per 
     <lb/>
     year, ten years from now, what will be the civil 
     <lb/>
     service pensions bill that the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland will have to pay? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> It will be double. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> It will be double! Well, in that 
     <lb/>
     case I am completely stumped. Mr. Fogwill does 
     <lb/>
     not figure on anyone dying; all he figures is that 
   

            <cb/>
        

     the number of pensioners will keep piling up, and 
     <lb/>
     none of them will die. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Of course they will pile up, be<lb break="no"/>cause they are getting older all the time. Did you 
     <lb/>
     read the Civil Service Pension Act a little while 
     <lb/>
     ago? Did you read it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I can't say that I have. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Well, why don't you read it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> You must admit that I have 
     <lb/>
     been fairly busy this past few weeks, and can't

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Other people have been busy too. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> Yesterday it was stated that in 
     <lb/>the event of union with Canada some of the civil 
     <lb/>servants would probably be paid off; but on the 
     <lb/>other hand Mr. Smallwood said that under 
     <lb/>various departmental heads we would probably 
     <lb/>have an extra 1,000 engaged. That's right isn't 
     <lb/>it? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> Well, the question I want to ask 
     <lb/>
     is this: assuming they get $2,000 a head for an 
     <lb/>
     average salary, that's $200,000; who pays that, 
     <lb/>
     the provincial government? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Who pays who? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> The civil servants, the extra 
     <lb/>
     1,000 that you refer to. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I said that if we become a 
     <lb/>
     province our public service would be cut in two, 
     <lb/>
     one part would still be ours, and our provincial 
     <lb/>
     government would have to pay that. The other 
     <lb/>
     part of it would become federal government, and 
     <lb/>
     the Government of Canada would stand it. In the 
     <lb/>
     departments that the Canadian government 
     <lb/>
     would take over and handle, they would take the 
     <lb/>
     civil servants who are in each particular depart<lb break="no"/>ment at the time union takes place. But on top of 
     <lb/>
     that again there are government departments in 
     <lb/>
     Canada which we have not got here at all, which 
     <lb/>
     would be established. The Canadian government 
     <lb/>
     would open new offices here over and above the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland offices that they would take over, 
     <lb/>
     and in those new offices they would employ 
     <lb/>
     something up to 1,000 people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NORT2">Mr. Northcott</persName> Who would pay them? That's 
     <lb/>
     the point I want to get at. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>

     since we have nearly twice as much territory to 
     <lb/>
     service, is the Nova Scotia provincial budget 
     <lb/>
     $30,018,000? Now the municipal budget of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia I believe is $9,941,000. I think that works 
     <lb/>
     out at around $18 a head. That's just for roads and 
     <lb/>
     schools, and I can't seem to be reconciled to the 
     <lb/>
     fact that this provincial parliament we are going 
     <lb/>
     to have, to give the people what we are getting 
     <lb/>
     now, can be operated on $15 million. I think there 
     <lb/>
     was a strong plea put forward as to our backward<lb break="no"/>ness, and I know if we are going to have services 
     <lb/>
     in this country we have got to pay for them, and 
     <lb/>
     the only way I know that you can pay for them is 
     <lb/>
     by raising taxes, and when you raise taxes you get 
     <lb/>
     revenue, and can do the work. I think the strong 
     <lb/>
     plea to send a delegation to Ottawa was that we 
     <lb/>
     could get a better way of life if we went into 
     <lb/>
     confederation with Canada, or if we negotiated to 
     <lb/>
     see how much better that life is going to be. But 
     <lb/>
     I have been struck very forcibly, and I have done 
     <lb/>
     a little deliberating, that the estimates of 
     <lb/>
     municipal taxes and everything has been kept off 
     <lb/>
     our desks. I hold that one of the first things that 
     <lb/>
     the members of this National Convention should 
     <lb/>
     have had was all pertaining not only to the federal 
     <lb/>
     government of Canada, but if the people vote to 
     <lb/>
     demand confederation they should know the 
     <lb/>
     other side of the business. You have got nine 
     <lb/>
     different provincial governments in Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     since I have been in this Convention I have got to 
     <lb/>
     hear the first word yet as to how John Doe in a 
     <lb/>
     fishing village in Nova Scotia, or north New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, or the Magdalen Islands, or the 
     <lb/>
     Gaspé Coast, how he fares, and how he raised his 
     <lb/>
     taxes. The only way we can get that is by getting 
     <lb/>
     their estimates to see how they operate and work, 
     <lb/>
     and I find it is being kept away from us as far as 
     <lb/>
     possible. Nobody in this country, not only in the 
     <lb/>
     government, not even the Trade Commissioner, 
     <lb/>
     can give me any idea of where one book can be 
     <lb/>
     found of how the provincial governments of 
     <lb/>
     Canada are being governed. So I would like 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood to answer this question: how can 
     <lb/>
     he say that this country can be operated on $15 
     <lb/>
     million when we want new roads, we want 
     <lb/>
     schools, and the things that the Nova Scotians 
     <lb/>
     have got, and the New Brunswickers and the 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Islanders are supposed to have, 
     <lb/>
     and the other provinces throughout Canada? I 
     <lb/>
     know how they get them, by lifting themselves 
     <lb/>
     by the straps of their boots. I think we have to go 
  

            <cb/>
    

     down to this confederation business. I don't know 
     <lb/>
     how much the Canadian government is going to 
     <lb/>
     put into Newfoundland, and I am sure nobody 
     <lb/>
     under heaven knows how much they are going to 
     <lb/>
     take out. We have been paying quite a lot of their 
     <lb/>
     taxes in the last 100 years since they went into 
     <lb/>
     confederation. But now, I want the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland to know what John Doe is doing, 
     <lb/>
     how he is governed, how he is taxed, how he lives 
     <lb/>
     and the rest. I know it because I spent a lifetime 
     <lb/>
     among those people. I made six voyages to the 
     <lb/>
     Gaspé Coast, and I know just what it is; and I 
     <lb/>
     know north New Brunswick and how these 
     <lb/>
     people live; but I want the fishermen, before this 
     <lb/>
     is put to the vote of the people of Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     for them to know how the provinces are 
     <lb/>
     governed; and I would like Mr. Smallwood to tell 
     <lb/>
     me how Newfoundland and its dependency, 
     <lb/>
     Labrador, is going to be governed on $15 million 
     <lb/>
     when it has taken $30 million for the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia where they have good roads, well set 
     <lb/>
     up after nearly 100 years of municipal care, and 
     <lb/>
     we have nothing at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I take it we are going to have a royal commis<lb break="no"/>sion come down here in eight years time, and you 
     <lb/>
     know the promise. I am not going to read it, you 
     <lb/>
     have heard it, and I want to know what they are 
     <lb/>
     going to do when they put us on a par with 
     <lb/>
     themselves, what we are going to have to pay. I 
     <lb/>
     know by cities and towns and villages in Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia the amount, and I know by cities and towns 
     <lb/>
     in the other parts of Canada just what confedera<lb break="no"/>tion means.

     <lb/>in a minute or two. Mr. Bailey has addressed a

     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I don't know that there is any<lb break="no"/>thing particular I have to say in reply to Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bailey, who has been having very considerable 
     <lb/>
     enjoyment and interest I suppose in boning up, or 
     <lb/>
     studying the systems of taxation in some of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces of Canada. To me, all learning is never 
     <lb/>
     a burden, it is grand to know things, and a grand 
     <lb/>
     thing to study; but in relation to Newfoundland I 
     <lb/>
     don't see very much point in knowing what kinds 
     <lb/>
     of taxes they have in any particular provinces or 
     <lb/>
     municipalities in Canada. It has no bearing on us, 
     <lb/>
     sir. They have their system of taxation. and we

     will have our system of taxation. It is not because 
     <lb/>
     one province does it one way that all provinces 
     <lb/>
     must do it the same way, and I am prepared to 
     <lb/>
     argue it. There is a tremendous variation in some 
     <lb/>
     respects from one province to another. We would 
     <lb/>
     be still another variation. We have our ways of 
     <lb/>
     doing things. There is one limit laid on us, one 
     <lb/>
     condition laid down, and it is a good condition. 
     <lb/>
     No province is allowed to put any taxes on its 
     <lb/>
     people except direct taxes.... Indirect taxes are 
     <lb/>
     not allowed. Now with that one condition ... it is 
     <lb/>
     entirely our own business as a province how we 
     <lb/>
     levy our taxes, what kind of taxes they will be, 
     <lb/>
     and how much we will collect in each kind of 
     <lb/>
     tax....

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> could stand here for three hours 
     <lb/>
     listing the different kinds of taxes they have in 
     <lb/>
     the different provinces, and that would have just 
     <lb/>
     as much to do with Newfoundland as if he had 
     <lb/>
     spent the time talking about the different kinds of 
     <lb/>
     taxes they have in Timbuctoo, Somaliland, 
     <lb/>
     Tanganyika, Nyasaland or out in the Gobi desert 
     <lb/>
     of China. Let them have what kinds of taxes they 
     <lb/>
     want, we will have the kinds of taxes we want, so 
     <lb/>
     long as they are direct taxes. That's our business, 
     <lb/>
     and Mr. Bailey can save himself an awful lot of 
     <lb/>
     trouble if he will only remember that it is up to 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I just wish to deal with the financial 
     <lb/>
     side of it, Mr. Chairman. Coming back to this 
     <lb/>
     assessment of Newfoundland's financial posi<lb break="no"/>tion. When we accept this in this Convention, and 
     <lb/>
     the eight years have passed, and we give that 
     <lb/>
     royal commisssion the right to come here and to 
     <lb/>
     help us set up, it says here, "...having regard to 
     <lb/>
     capacity to pay, than that of the Maritime Provin<lb break="no"/>ces." Yet Mr. Smallwood turns around and says 
     <lb/>
     it's none of Canada's business how we get our 
     <lb/>
     taxes. We must get them directly. 
     <lb/>
     
      </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Under section 92 neither is it 
     <lb/>any of their business. 
     <lb/>
            </p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> And yet Mr. Smallwood can tell me. 
     <lb/>Supposing for instance that we have got to find 
     <lb/>say $30 million, how are we going to get it 
     <lb/>without putting in the same form of taxation that 
     <lb/>the other nine provinces of Canada put in? I will 
     <lb/>be happy to listen to him. This is the place I am 
     <lb/>in, and that is what I want the people to know. If 
     <lb/>we go on having extra social services, and extra 
     <lb/>responsibilities I want the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland to know, no beating around the bush 
     <lb/>or anything at all; I want you to come out clear, 
     <lb/>that when that royal commission comes down 
     <lb/>here and lays the case before us, does that mean 
     <lb/>we are going to have the same form of taxes as 
     <lb/>they have in the Maritime Provinces? I don't see 
     <lb/>any way out. If a delegate to this Convention can 
     <lb/>get up here and tell me how we, in this island, are 
     <lb/>going to be taxed after we lose the way we are 
     <lb/>collecting taxes today, i will be perfectly satisfied 
     <lb/>to listen, and I don't know but that I will go along 
     <lb/>and work for confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, that's a very 
     <lb/>good point raised by Mr. Bailey, and it's a point 
     <lb/>that deserves a straightforward and honest 
     <lb/>answer. He directed your attention to clause 14.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What does that mean? That is an extremely 
     <lb/>
     important clause in these terms. It is sometimes 
     <lb/>
     said that confederation for Newfoundland would 
     <lb/>
     be a leap in the dark. In certain respects it would 
     <lb/>
     be and in certain respects it would not. Certain 
     <lb/>
     things are laid down, and are as plain as the day. 
     <lb/>
     But in other respects it would be a leap in the dark, 
     <lb/>
     and one respect in which confederation would be 
     <lb/>
     a leap in the dark is this very matter, sir, that we 
     <lb/>
     are discussing here today, and ever since Mon<lb break="no"/>day. That is, could the government of the 
     <lb/>
     province pay its way?.... Any government can 
   

            <cb/>
        

     pay its way. There need never have been a year 
     <lb/>
     since 1920, when the bad times hit us, when the 
     <lb/>
     government needed to fail to balance its budget. 
     <lb/>
     A government can always pay its way. it has three 
     <lb/>
     ways to do it: 1. To stick on more taxes. 2. To cut 
     <lb/>
     down on the public services. 3. To do both, to put 
     <lb/>
     on more taxes and give the people less service. 
     <lb/>
     Now these are three ways, and either one of them 
     <lb/>
     will enable any government to pay its way, but 
     <lb/>
     that's not what we mean. As a province we have 
     <lb/>
     got to have our own government, and can that 
     <lb/>
     government pay its way without putting too 
     <lb/>
     heavy a burden of taxation on the people, and 
     <lb/>
     without cutting down on the public services? It is 
     <lb/>
     impossible to answer that with finality, and when 
     <lb/>
     I came in here on Monday 1 brought in what I 
     <lb/>
     called "estimates". I admit frankly that I am not 
     <lb/>
     a prophet, and that i cannot see through a stone 
     <lb/>
     wall further than any other man.... I have brought 
     <lb/>
     in what I honestly and sincerely consider to be 
     <lb/>
     conservative estimates or guesses, if you like, 
     <lb/>
     showing that we can do that, but we may not. I 
     <lb/>
     will be man enough to admit that if in any one of 
     <lb/>
     these eight years the government should spend 
     <lb/>
     more in that year or take in less revenue in that 
     <lb/>
     year than I show, then in that year we have to dip 
     <lb/>
     into our surplus to pay the debts. Why should i 
     <lb/>
     try to hide that or refuse to admit it?.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now in view of the difficulty of predicting just 
     <lb/>
     what will happen financially to this government 
     <lb/>
     if we become a province... the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada says, "We know what you are up against. 
     <lb/>
     You can't forecast it exactly. Tell you what we 
     <lb/>
     will do; we will set up a royal commisssion" - <lb/> as they have done before in other provinces. They 
     <lb/>
     set up the royal commisssion headed by Sir 
     <lb/>
     Andrew Ray Duncan in the three Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces in 1926. They set up another one 
     <lb/>
     headed by Mr. lustice White, and so you get the 
     <lb/>
     Duncan-White Award. These royal commissions 
     <lb/>
     admitted that the Maritime Provinces could not 
     <lb/>
     pay their way and give the people proper service, 
     <lb/>
     so the Duncan-White Award recommended that 
     <lb/>
     they pay more to the Maritime Provinces, and 
     <lb/>
     they did, and they are still doing it. So they said, 
     <lb/>
     "We will appoint a royal commission to look into 
     <lb/>
     your finances, and we will do that inside of eight 
     <lb/>
     years after you become a province". Now what 
     <lb/>
     do they do? When that royal commission lands in 
     <lb/>
     St. John's, what is their job? To look into our 
     <lb/>
     finances. What for? To see what? To see whether 
   

            <pb n="998" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-12-10_Page_0998.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">998</fw> <fw type="running">NATIONAL CONVENTION</fw> <fw type="dateline">December 1947</fw>
       

     they need to recommend more subsidies for the 
     <lb/>
     Province of Newfoundland. Not only whether 
     <lb/>
     they need to recommend more subsidies, but the 
     <lb/>
     form and scale of additional subsidies. Any 
     <lb/>
     government looks to get subsidies, and if they 
     <lb/>
     land here seven years after we become a province 
     <lb/>
     and look into it, what would the government of 
     <lb/>
     that day say?.... But there is a test. It is not enough 
     <lb/>
     for the government of that day to say, "We need 
     <lb/>
     more subsidy", there is a yardstick laid down,... 
     <lb/>
     The yardstick is this: how much more subsidy, if 
     <lb/>
     any, does the government require to enable it to 
     <lb/>
     continue the public services of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     not as they are now in 1947, but as they are in the 
     <lb/>
     year that the royal commisssion comes here 
     <lb/>
     without resorting to taxation on the New<lb break="no"/>foundland people more burdensome than in the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces. That's not all. Without 
     <lb/>
     having to put on more taxation more burdensome 
     <lb/>
     than in the Maritime Provinces, <hi rendition="simple:italic">having regard</hi> 
     <lb/>
     (and I direct Mr. Bailey's attention to this clause) 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">having regard to their capacity to pay</hi>.... That's 
     <lb/>
     the clause: "having regard to capacity to pay". 
     <lb/>
     Don't lose sight of that clause in all your con<lb break="no"/>sideration of this section 14 of the terms of union. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Bailey I still can't understand a royal com<lb break="no"/>mission coming down here, and if I were to refer 
     <lb/>
     back to your budget 1 am glad I am able to see 
     <lb/>
     that this country will be able to be run for $72, I 
     <lb/>
     believe that's the figure, $72 a head. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> $75. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> $75 instead of $122. Well it's only 
     <lb/>
     $3 out. Now then, we will take capacity to pay. I 
     <lb/>
     think if anybody here understands these two 
     <lb/>
     places I do. We will take Fortune and Shelburne. 
     <lb/>
     We will take the municipal taxes in the two 
     <lb/>
     places. I believe they have got a town council in 
     <lb/>
     Fortune and I believe the government is paying 
     <lb/>
     half of that town council for the current year, 
     <lb/>
     Then if we go over to Shelburne, a town with 
     <lb/>
     practically the same earning capacity as Fortune, 
     <lb/>
     we find they have got a population of 1,605, they 
     <lb/>
     have 50 sidewalks, 3.5 miles of asphalt, and no 
     <lb/>
     stone or gravel roads. And we find out they are 
     <lb/>
     spending $19,299 for municipal purposes, and 
     <lb/>
     $16,200 to educate their children. They have a 
     <lb/>
     total tax levied of 61%. The cost for each pupil is 
     <lb/>
     $61 per year. The total tax is $36,117. In the light 
     <lb/>
     of that, if a royal commission comes down here 
     <lb/>
     to Fortune, Grand Bank, Bonavista or Wes<lb break="no"/>leyville, or Heart's Content or anywhere else, 
   

            <cb/>
         

     because I believe in town councils, and I believe 
     <lb/>
     we should get them as soon as possible. those 
     <lb/>
     grants are going out. We are running the province 
     <lb/>
     and you said so, and I don't suppose you would 
     <lb/>
     get up here and deceive this National Convention 
     <lb/>
     that this country can be run for a mere $75 per 
     <lb/>
     capita, instead of the $122.36 they are drawing 
     <lb/>
     today, in the light of the fact that the Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     mean per capita tax today for all federal, provin<lb break="no"/>cial and municipal governments is $216 per head. 
     <lb/>
     Now they are coming down here and they are 
     <lb/>
     going to let us off. It is preposterous. the whole 
     <lb/>
     set—up. These are the things we have got to take 
     <lb/>
     into consideration and put before our people. 
     <lb/>
     Because I have heard it ever since I was knee- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     high to a grasshopper how much better those 
     <lb/>
     people live in Canada, in this place or that place. 
     <lb/>
     I fail to see it. If they live they sweat for it. Take 
     <lb/>
     our position down here. If they cut out the town 
     <lb/>
     councils. We don't expect a man coming down 
     <lb/>
     here in the middle of the summer and sitting in 
     <lb/>
     the house to understand. They don't see our Oc<lb break="no"/>tobers and Novembers and Decembers. when 
     <lb/>
     there is no way to get on the fishing grounds. in 
     <lb/>
     the southern part of Nova Scotia the vessels can 
     <lb/>
     go to the grounds seven days out of every ten in 
     <lb/>
     the winter, when our men have not been able to 
     <lb/>
     take to the grounds since October, not because 
     <lb/>
     there is no money to get there, or because they 
     <lb/>
     have not got the guts to go there, but simply 
     <lb/>
     because nature is against it. But it is no good to 
     <lb/>
     tell someone just coming down here, who don't 
     <lb/>
     know our climate, that those things exist, and 
     <lb/>
     then they turn around, and here's what they will 
     <lb/>
     throw up to you: "Look what our people pay!" 
     <lb/>
     And what can you say about it? So I don't hold 
     <lb/>
     with it at all myself. Let's admit today that we 
     <lb/>
     can't tun this province under $100 or $125, and 
     <lb/>
     give this province, if we come under confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, the things that our people are expecting if 
     <lb/>
     they vote for confederation. Remember that. We 
     <lb/>
     have got to be in a position to tax ourselves, we 
     <lb/>
     have to to be prepared to fork up $125 per capita 
     <lb/>
     at the very least. I fail to see the trend of the way 
     <lb/>
     things are going. We are masters in our own 
     <lb/>
     house, but when once somebody else gets over us 
     <lb/>
     it will be a different matter.... I know myself if 
     <lb/>
     we are ever going to lift our people to the stand<lb break="no"/>ards they expect to be lifted to, we have got to 
     <lb/>
     start lifting ourselves by our own bootstraps,

     point made by Mr. Bailey. He took a comparison 
     <lb/>
     between the town of Fortune in Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     and the town of Shelburne in Nova Scotia. I take 
     <lb/>
     it that they are both fishing towns. He made a 
     <lb/>
     most amazing statement. He said that he thought 
     <lb/>
     they had the same taxable capacity — Fortune 
     <lb/>
     and Shelburne. I wonder if Mr. Bailey really un<lb break="no"/>derstands what I am talking about when I am 
     <lb/>
     talking about taxable capacity. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Look, the highliner fishing boat on the south<lb break="no"/>west coast this year paid off her men at $2,200 a 
     <lb/>
     man, and for Newfoundland it was fine pay 
     <lb/>
     wasn't it? Certainly, compared with what the 
     <lb/>
     other men got, $2,200 was very good. Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man, Fortune Bay fishermen, Newfoundlanders 
     <lb/>
     from Fortune Bay were fishing the same time 
     <lb/>
     aboard Nova Scotia vessels on the same grounds, 
     <lb/>
     and they got the same quantity of fish as the 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Freda M.</hi>, or slightly below it, and they paid off 
     <lb/>
     at $3,000, and I am going to be told that the same 
     <lb/>
     taxable capacity lies in Fortune Bay as in Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia? What kind of nonsense is that? Taxable 
     <lb/>
     capacity is measured by the earning power of the 
     <lb/>
     people, and men who earn $2,200 on the high- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     liner have not got the earning power of men who 
     <lb/>
     earned $3,000 for roughly the same quantity of 
     <lb/>
     fish the same year. Everyone on the southwest 
     <lb/>
     coast knows that, and they will hear it tomorrow 
     <lb/>
     night when it is broadcast. I make that statement 
     <lb/>
     now. Ask any fisherman. Captain Bailey is a 
     <lb/>
     fisherman, at least he used to be, and probably as 
     <lb/>
     he says, he will be again I have not a word against 
     <lb/>
     it. He is going to be a good confederate some day, 
     <lb/>
     but anyway he is a good man, but he is not the 
     <lb/>
     only fisherman. We have men along the south<lb break="no"/>west coast, fishermen in hundreds, who for years 
     <lb/>
     and years and years have been fishing in Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, and every man of them knows that in 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia they earn more money for the same 
     <lb/>
     work. I am not going to try to explain the reason. 
     <lb/>
     Perhaps that is too big for me to explain, but you 
     <lb/>
     can't compare the taxable capacity of Fortune 
     <lb/>
     with the taxable capacity of Shelburne. You can't 
     <lb/>
     do it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> Mr. Chairman, I said the town of 
     <lb/>
     Fortune had the same taxable capacity as the 
     <lb/>
     town of Shelburne... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, I know you did. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> Now look here. We say we are in the 
     <lb/>
     saltfish business, and it is bad enough for the fresh 
     <lb/>
     fishermen up there. If we say Lake and Lake in 


            <cb/>
      

     Fortune are producing 10,000 quintals of fish this 
     <lb/>
     year, and say Frost in Shelbume produces 10,000 
     <lb/>
     quintals of fish, and the 10,000 from Fortune and 
     <lb/>
     the 10,000 from Shelburne go into the Puerto 
     <lb/>
     Rico market. Has Fortune got the same capacity 
     <lb/>
     to pay as Shelbume got? Was there as much 
     <lb/>
     money came back into Fortune as there was in 
     <lb/>
     Shelbume from the market? It is preposterous! If 
     <lb/>
     there was not a cent paid to the fishermen, wasn't 
     <lb/>
     that money brought into Fortune? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I think you are getting far from 
     <lb/>
     the track. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I am not getting far from the track. 
     <lb/>
  </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You are getting far from the 
     <lb/>track because of the fact that there are no com<lb break="no"/>parative figures as to the earning capacity of 
     <lb/>Fortune and Shelbume before us. and as far as I 
     <lb/>am concerned you simply select those two for the 
     <lb/>purpose of making a comparison. I don't want a 
     <lb/>prolonged debate upon a question upon which 
     <lb/>there has been no foundation laid before the 
     <lb/>Chair. We are discussing now the towns of For<lb break="no"/>tune and Shelbume, and none ofus is in a position 
     <lb/>to know whether any statement made by anybody 
     <lb/>on the question is correct or otherwise. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I have got to disagree with you there, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I am not going to have my ruling 
     <lb/>
     debated. Is that clear? If you choose to lay the 
     <lb/>
     foundation for your statement, then I will decide 
     <lb/>
     whether or not the debate as presently carried on 
     <lb/>
     by you and Mr. Smallwood is relevant or not, but 
     <lb/>
     as far as I am concerned you are both hopelessly 
     <lb/>
     afield. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask 
     <lb/>
     a question, sir, under provincial revenue, Depart<lb break="no"/>ment of Posts and Telegraphs. There is the sum 
     <lb/>
     of $87,000 listed as revenue, and I think it is 
     <lb/>
     wireless, cablegrams, etc. What I would like to 
     <lb/>
     know, if Mr. Smallwood would tell me, is the rate 
     <lb/>
     of tax and the number of cablegrams and wireless 
     <lb/>
     messages; and also if that tax, whatever it is, is 
     <lb/>
     imposed on internal telegraph messages. I ask 
     <lb/>
     that now because he may not have the figures 
     <lb/>
     with him, and he may have it tomorrow. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I have not the figures here. but 
     <lb/>
     I will try and get it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOGW1">Mr. Fogwill</persName> Thank you. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I think if members are going to 
     <lb/>
     draw conclusions or comparisons it is not too 
     <lb/>
     much to ask that the foundation first of all be laid,

     because how can I decide anything on pure 
     <lb/>
     hypothesis or conjecture, and the debate, as far as 
     <lb/>
     I am concerned for the last 15 minutes, has had

     anything but a factual foundation.

     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> Mr. Chairman, as regards to this dis<lb break="no"/>cussion we were in yesterday evening when the 
     <lb/>question probably went outside of the scope of 
     <lb/>the clause discussed, I assure you that I did not 
     <lb/>intentionally do it; I was just trying to make it 
     <lb/>clear for the Convention and the people to under<lb break="no"/>stand. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Iam sure we all appreciate that, 
     <lb/>
     Captain Bailey. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL3">Mr. Bailey</persName> I would like you to turn to page 4 of 
     <lb/>
     the Grey Book, where I intended to follow on 
     <lb/>
     when I left off yesterday evening when brought 
     <lb/>
     to order - Transitional Grants: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In order to facilitate the adjustment of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland to the status of a province and 
     <lb/>
     the development by Newfoundland of 
     <lb/>
     revenue-producing services, Canada will pay 
     <lb/>
     to Newfoundland each year during the first 
     <lb/>
     twelve years of union a diminishing Transi<lb break="no"/>tional Grant payable as follows... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now each and every one of us will note that 
     <lb/>
     after the first three years there has to be found a 
     <lb/>
     certain portion from taxation different from what 
     <lb/>
     we have got today. I want it made clear just what 
     <lb/>
     we have to expect, I believe in the quotation 
     <lb/>
     which was, I think, made in this House by some 
     <lb/>
     member, that the wrong way to tax a people is for 
     <lb/>
     one body to collect the taxes and another body to 
     <lb/>
     spend it. So I believe that When we get closer to 
     <lb/>
     the crux of the matter and find out what we are 
     <lb/>
     being taxed for, I believe we will have a better 
     <lb/>
     form of government. I think this clause we have 
     <lb/>
     before us points that out very strongly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I find, and I am worried about it, that there has 
     <lb/>
     been no effort made for any adjustment in what 
     <lb/>
     we have before us. We know what we are going 
     <lb/>
     to get, it has been pointed out very strongly, 
     <lb/>
     everything that is coming to us; but nobody has 
     <lb/>
     taken the trouble so far to point out what we are 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     going to pay and how it is going to be paid. I tried 
     <lb/>
     yesterday in my humble and probably illiterate 
     <lb/>
     manner to bring to your attention the difference 
     <lb/>
     in the direct taxation that must come upon us if 
     <lb/>
     and when we come into confederation. We must 
     <lb/>
     adjust ourselves, and l not only see that l2 years 
     <lb/>
     to the day we will have to find this amount that 
     <lb/>
     is brought before us, but also another $l.5 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. 1 cannot see for the life of me how this 
     <lb/>
     country can have the very least in services under 
     <lb/>
     $5 million taxation. Now that's the point I would 
     <lb/>
     like to make clear today. and l don't see, looking 
     <lb/>
     at it from every angle. after the federal and 
     <lb/>
     provincial governments take their cuts. where the 
     <lb/>
     cut is going to come from for municipal purposes 
     <lb/>
     and for our schools. You will find out that the 
     <lb/>
     578,062 people of Nova Scotia are collecting 
     <lb/>
     $9,941,058 for their schools. I say we have got 
     <lb/>
     twice the territory to service, because we can't go 
     <lb/>
     on leaving the Labrador in the place it is into; I 
     <lb/>
     am sure it is the greatest disgrace in the world, 
     <lb/>
     the way that Newfoundland has left the people of 
     <lb/>
     Labrador. If there is one body of people in our 
     <lb/>
     country that has raised themselves by the boot<lb break="no"/>straps, against odds that you can hardly under<lb break="no"/>stand, it's the people of Labrador. I believe that 
     <lb/>
     they should have the same as everybody else. 
     <lb/>
     There isn't any doubt that there's an immense 
     <lb/>
     amount of wealth in the country, and our people 
     <lb/>
     in Labrador should not be left like the natives. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I tried yesterday to explain in my simple way 
     <lb/>
     how these people are raising this money. I can't 
     <lb/>
     quote the districts in the Province ofNova Scotia, 
     <lb/>
     that's the municipal statistics, the clause here 
     <lb/>
     would be too deep to go into. l think we have got 
     <lb/>
     about 33 pounds of data on this Convention Act, 
     <lb/>
     and I slogged through most of it, and I believe if 
     <lb/>
     we were to make an impartial survey of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia we would have to have 30-odd pounds of 
     <lb/>
     that... lam not satisfied that this country is going 
     <lb/>
     to get all it needs for $75 per capita, It can't be 
     <lb/>
     done, and if we had $120 per capita, including 
     <lb/>
