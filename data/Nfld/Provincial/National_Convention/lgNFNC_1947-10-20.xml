<!-- GL, 2017-07-19, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 
<!--<p>
     an opportunity today to make any remarks about 
     <lb/>
     the report, and in case there is, sir, I was going to 
     <lb/>
     resume my seat and if no one else did speak to 
     <lb/>
     this report, I propose then to move the adjoum- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     merit of the debate, and let's try to clean it up on 
     <lb/>
     Monday, if it's humanly possible. But there are 
     <lb/>
     important points yet to be made about this report 
     <lb/>
     before the Economic Report comes before us. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Would you make clear, Mr. Small- 
     <lb break="yes"/>wood, the point that you hope to make tomorrow, 
     <lb/>which should take 20 minutes; could he make it 
     <lb/>clearer, indicate to us what that point is? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Mr. Smallwood... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Well, I wouldn't mind indicat<lb break="no"/>ing the general nature of it. What I proposed 
     <lb/>
     doing was this: to take the period from 1920 to 
     <lb/>
     1934 and deal only with the question of deficits 
     <lb/>
     and surpluses. But I wanted to make it clear, and 
     <lb/>
     if I'm not interrupted by Major Cashin on Mon<lb break="no"/>day, I would undertake to complete it in 15 or 20 
     <lb/>
     minutes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I would like to remind members 
     <lb/>
     that we're in committee and of course I'll bend 
     <lb/>
     over backwards, as I must, to relax the rules of 
     <lb/>
     debate. But I have to direct the attention of mem<lb break="no"/>bers to the purpose for which they were 
     <lb/>
     created... The language of the act is unmistaken- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ly clear... The statute lays upon members the 
     <lb/>
     obligation to inquire into the changes that have 
     <lb/>
     taken place in the financial and economic situa<lb break="no"/>tion of the island since 1934 â€” since 1934.... 
     <lb/>
     There is a definitely described period. And that 
     <lb/>
     is why, Mr. Smallwood, in reply to Mr. Hollett, 
     <lb/>
     in View of the fact that you proposed the dealing 
     <lb/>
     with the period ... 20-24? 34? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I apologise sir, if I said that, 
     <lb/>
     what I meant was, from 1920 to date, to now. 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Anything that you might have to 
     <lb/>say on the period from 1935 to 1947, has to be

            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     relevant and is clearly within the scope and ambit 
     <lb/>
     of the act. Any opinion expressed on the period 
     <lb/>
     anterior to 1935 is irrelevant save and except if it 
     <lb/>
     is calculated to enlighten us on any matters aris<lb break="no"/>ing from this period of 1935 up to 1947 which 
     <lb/>
     would otherwise remain ambiguous and in doubt. 
     <lb/>
     We can't sit in this chamber and discuss what 
     <lb/>
     happened in 1810 or 1762. There must be some 
     <lb/>
     limit beyond which we can go because if there is 
     <lb/>
     going to be undefined limits we're going to be 
     <lb/>
     here until judgement morning. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Would it be your ruling that 
     <lb/>
     what we are permitted to do is discuss such 
     <lb/>
     periods before 1934 as it may be necessary to 
     <lb/>
     throw light on the period since 1934, and only so 
     <lb/>
     far as it will do that? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> After serious consideration, not 
     <lb/>
     an opinion which is being expressed by the ex<lb break="no"/>igencies of the moment, it is my view that mem<lb break="no"/>bers should not concern themselves with the 
     <lb/>
     period of our financial and economic history 
     <lb/>
     prior to 1934. Now I'm going to give this section 
     <lb/>
     of the act the greatest possible latitude, save 
     <lb/>
     insofar as any discussion prior to that time is 
     <lb/>
     calculated to enlighten us on matters which have 
     <lb/>
     arisen since that time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Hickman I entirely concur with your ruling 
     <lb/>
     on that point.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Thank you Mr. Hickman, I

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, before I move this 
     <lb/>
     House into a committee of the whole to further 
     <lb/>
     consider this Finance Report,<ref target="#fn_01">[1]</ref> there is a matter

     which I would like to draw to your attention, and 
     <lb/>
     to the attention of the delegates; that is with 
     <lb/>
     reference to the remarks made in connection with 
     <lb/>
     the compilation of the Finance Report on Friday 
     <lb/>
     afternoon by the delegate from Bonavista Centre, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood. In commenting on this report, 


            <cb/>
       

     Mr. Smallwood, consciously or unconsciously, 
     <lb/>
     would lead one to believe that myself and those 
     <lb/>
     associated with me practically cooked up the 
     <lb/>
     figures and, whilst he might not have meant it, at 
     <lb/>
     the same time it was conveyed to the outside 
     <lb/>
     public that such was the case. Consequently, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, I asked you on Saturday, after hearing 
     <lb/>
     these things from outside, to call a special meet<lb break="no"/>ing of the Steering Committee this morning, and

     you know what happened at our meeting this 
     <lb/>
     morning in connection with these figures, that is 
     <lb/>
     in reference to the revenues and expenditures on 
     <lb/>
     pages 112-113, from 1897 up to Dec.31, 1946. I 
     <lb/>
     think that we produced sufficient evidence this 
     <lb/>
     morning to show that no such thing took place, 
     <lb/>
     and that the Finance Committee has been upheld. 
     <lb/>
     Under such circumstances Mr. Chairman, I 
     <lb/>
     would ask you to make an official ruling on this 
     <lb/>
     matter before we proceed to go into committee of 
     <lb/>
     the whole to discuss this report. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, as Major 
     <lb/>
     Cashin has raised this matter, and as it refers to 
     <lb/>
     my remarks on Friday past, I would like to say 
     <lb/>
     that at no time since the report was tabled have I 
     <lb/>
     had anything but admiration for the fine piece of 
     <lb/>
     work which that report shows.... It is one of the 
     <lb/>
     finest reports laid before this Convention, and 
     <lb/>
     one of the most important. At no time have I 
     <lb/>
     thought that the Finance Committee has mis<lb break="no"/>represented any figures or statistics, and second<lb break="no"/>ly, to the best of my knowledge and memory, on 
     <lb/>
     Friday I said nothing which would give any mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the public or of this Convention any... 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Mr. Chairman, I don't want to in<lb break="no"/>terrupt Mr. Smallwood, but I think Major Cashin 
     <lb/>asked for a ruling. I think we should have this 
     <lb/>ruling. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I would like to know what 
     <lb/>
     ruling Major Cashin desires. He has referred to 
     <lb/>
     me, and I am now making an explanation. Pos<lb break="no"/>sibly, sir, if you have a ruling you might defer it 
     <lb/>
     until I make my explanation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> The position, Mr. Smallwood, is 
     <lb/>
     that the matter was discussed by the Steering 
     <lb/>
     Committee this morning, of which body you are 
     <lb/>
     a member. At the instance and request of the 
     <lb/>
     Steering Committee I am obligated to make a 
     <lb/>
     ruling.... Major Cashin's motion, in effect, is that 
     <lb/>
     I should briefly recapitulate to members what 
     <lb/>
     took place, the reason for convening the meeting 
     <lb/>
     and the ruling I am expected to make. I therefore 
     <lb/>
     propose to make my ruling at this time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Before doing so I must direct the attention of 
     <lb/>
     members to the important distinction to be drawn 
     <lb/>
     between motive and effect. I am quite satisfied 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Smallwood, in the course of his remarks, 
     <lb/>
     was prompted by the best of motives... I must 
     <lb/>
     rule that, quite irrespective of his remarks, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood was prompted by the best of motives, 
     <lb/>
     and in particular to discharge his duties As I 


            <cb/>
          

     before said, however, the motive which prompts 
     <lb/>
     a remark, and the effect of that remark upon the 
     <lb/>
     mind of a third person are two entirely different 
     <lb/>
     things.... I am forced to remind members that, in 
     <lb/>
     my opinion, this is not a parliamentary body. This 
     <lb/>
     is simply a fact-finding body.... I will hold that 
     <lb/>
     members have not the rights and privileges 
     <lb/>
     belonging to members of Parliament. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It has been reported to the Steering Committee 
     <lb/>
     that some of the remarks made by the member for 
     <lb/>
     Bonavista Centre Friday afternoon last created in 
     <lb/>
     the minds of the public some opinions which 
     <lb/>
     unquestionably affected the integrity and honesty 
     <lb/>
     of the Finance Committee, who are responsible 
     <lb/>
     for that report.... The position briefly is this. 
     <lb/>
     Members will recall that approximately some six 
     <lb/>
     months ago a Finance Report was tabled, and on 
     <lb/>
     pages 112 and 113 certain figures had been com<lb break="no"/>piled and set forth. In the course of the debate 
     <lb/>
     which occurred on Friday last, Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>
     questioned the correctness of the figures I want 
     <lb/>
     to draw a distinction here. The question with 
     <lb/>
     which I have to concern myself is whether or not 
     <lb/>
     the figures had been independently corroborated 
     <lb/>
     to the satisfaction of the Steering Committee as 
     <lb/>
     being correct and unimpeachable.... In Steering 
     <lb/>
     Committee the figures for the years 1897-98 to 
     <lb/>
     1918-19, both inclusive, were accepted by both 
     <lb/>
     parties to the controversy as being correct. From 
     <lb/>
     the period 1919-20 to 1934-35 these were shown 
     <lb/>
     to be correctly copied from the Auditor General's 
     <lb/>
     reports.... I therefore rule that for the period 1919- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     20 to 1934-35 the independent corroboration to 
     <lb/>
     be found in the Auditor General's reports leaves 
     <lb/>
     me no alternative than to conclude that these 
     <lb/>
     figures were correctly copied and taken from the 
     <lb/>
     Auditor General's reports. With regard to the 
     <lb/>
     remaining period, that is to say from 1935-36 to 
     <lb/>
     Dec. 31, 1946, no evidence one way or the other 
     <lb/>
     was submitted to us this morning, perhaps for the 
     <lb/>
     excellent reason that it is not available; but I am 
     <lb/>
     forced to the conclusion that these figures are 
     <lb/>
     correct for two reasons: in the first place all 
     <lb/>
     figures prior to the year 1935-36 were found 
     <lb/>
     correct.... If, therefore, it is found that two-thirds 
     <lb/>
     of a report is correct, then I am driven to the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion that the remaining one-third must be 
     <lb/>
     likewise correct, unless there has been evidence 
     <lb/>
     adduced to warrant my reaching a contrary con<lb break="no"/>clusion.... It becomes my duty to hold that the 
     <lb/>
     figures were correctly copied, and they should 


            <pb n="615" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-10-20_Page_0615.jpg"/>

     not be misconstrued by any person as being 
     <lb/>
     cooked, or in any way reflecting upon the in<lb break="no"/>tegrity and honesty or character of the individuals 
     <lb/>
     responsible for this report. On the contrary, I 
     <lb/>
     think it was a job extremely well done.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now one further word. It may well be that 
     <lb/>
     members may feel that the manner in which the 
     <lb/>
     debit side and the credit side of balance sheets 
     <lb/>
     have been prepared by present administrations 
     <lb/>
     may have been incorrectly or improperly done. 
     <lb/>
     Upon that I make no continent. My only duty is, 
     <lb/>
     or was, to make sure that these figures were listed 
     <lb/>
     as taken from such government figures or statis<lb break="no"/>tics as may be available to members. On that 
     <lb/>
     point I have satisfied myself, and I therefore rule 
     <lb/>
     at this time that I find that the figures are correctly 
     <lb/>
     represented.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, I think I am 
     <lb/>
     entitled in reply to Major Cashin's request to you 
     <lb/>
     to make a ruling, and in continent upon your 
     <lb/>
     ruling to say... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Just a minute, Mr. Smallwood, 
     <lb/>
     please. If it is your intention to appeal my ruling 
     <lb/>
     to the House that is your right but I remind you 
     <lb/>
     that you are not permitted to debate and appeal 
     <lb/>
     from my ruling to the house. I want to make it 
     <lb/>
     clear that when I met the Steering Committee 
     <lb/>
     after I had been sworn in there was handed over 
     <lb/>
     to me rules of procedure.... I have sworn that I 
     <lb/>
     will impartially and fairly preside over the 
     <lb/>
     deliberations of this room while I am here.... 
     <lb/>
     Unless and until any of the rules of procedure 
     <lb/>
     handed to me by the Steering Committee are 
     <lb/>
     repealed, varied, altered or amended by two- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     thirds of this House, it becomes my sworn duty 
     <lb/>
     to enforce your rules. I did not make these rules, 
     <lb/>
     they were made for me. I shall preside here to 
     <lb/>
     insure that the rules of debate shall be conducted 
     <lb/>
     with propriety, and in accordance with the rules 
     <lb/>
     of procedure.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Any ruling that I make I shall expect to be 
     <lb/>
     respected and observed. Unless and until my 
     <lb/>
     ruling is appealed to and reversed by the House 
     <lb/>
     as a whole, I propose to act on my rulings as if 
     <lb/>
     they were judgements of this House. It is the 
     <lb/>
     constitutional right of any member to appeal my 
     <lb/>
     ruling, but he must do one of two things: he must 
     <lb/>
     either abide by my ruling, or else he must appeal 
     <lb/>
     from it to the House.... I will promptly put any 
     <lb/>
     appeal from any decisions I may make to this 
     <lb/>
     House, and of course I must naturally abide by 
   

            <cb/>
    

     any decision reached by the House as a whole. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore I must say two things: one, while a 
     <lb/>
     member is addressing the Chair he has no right 
     <lb/>
     to come between the speaker and the Chair. It is 
     <lb/>
     in the interest of all you gentlemen that I should 
     <lb/>
     reserve to you the dignity and respect to which 
     <lb/>
     you are fairly entitled. That I can only do if by 
     <lb/>
     and with your sympathy I am permitted to en<lb break="no"/>force the rules, that no member shall rise or 
     <lb/>
     interrupt a speaker who is addressing the Chair, 
     <lb/>
     unless and until he rises to a point of order, at 
     <lb/>
     which time he will be asked to state his point of 
     <lb/>
     order. A ruling will, if possible, be immediately 
     <lb/>
     given on that point of order, and then, if he is 
     <lb/>
     dissatisfied with the decision his remedy is to 
     <lb/>
     appeal to the House as a whole. With that in mind, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Smallwood, I want to reserve to you the right 
     <lb/>
     to correct, by way of appeal to the House if you 
     <lb/>
     like, any misapprehensions I was unfortunate 
     <lb/>
     enough to convey, or any decisions thatI wrong<lb break="no"/>fully arrived at.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Mr. Chairman, there was noth<lb break="no"/>ing further from my mind than to appeal against 
     <lb/>
     your ruling.... It was my intention merely to say 
     <lb/>
     that not for a moment had I any thought that in 
     <lb/>
     the writing and compilation of this Finance 
     <lb/>
     Report did the Finance Committee or any mem<lb break="no"/>ber of it have any desire to change or twist or 
     <lb/>
     distort or falsify any figures whatsoever.... At no 
     <lb/>
     time did I have in my mind, nor have I now, any 
     <lb/>
     doubt about the integrity of that Committee or 
     <lb/>
     their honesty. I have no doubt that, in copying 
     <lb/>
     those figures, they copied them correctly and 
     <lb/>
     accurately, with the exception of one item which 
     <lb/>
     I will refer to at some other time; that they just 
     <lb/>
     took the figures from the Auditor General's 
     <lb/>
     report and copied them, and that is what they put 
     <lb/>
     in this table. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> You do accept that? That their 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">bona fides</hi> in honesty in copying the figures is not 
     <lb/>
     in question at all? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I never doubted it at all, except 
     <lb/>
     for one short period on one side of the ledger, and 
     <lb/>
     that is purely a technical matter which I hope to 
     <lb/>
     have the pleasure to explain. My entire point is 
     <lb/>
     that the very reports which the Finance Commit<lb break="no"/>tee took their figures from are themselves 
     <lb/>
     wrong.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I rise to a point of order. You have 
     <lb/>
     ruled these figures correct, and I don't think Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood is at all within his rights in discussing 


            <pb n="616" facs="final/images/NFLD_National_Convention_1947-10-20_Page_0616.jpg"/>

     these matters. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I was about to say that you either 
     <lb/>
     appeal against my ruling or subscribe to it, and I 
     <lb/>
     don't think that you should say any more at this 
     <lb/>
     time because the order paper requires us to 
     <lb/>
     resolve the House into a committee of the whole 
     <lb/>
     at this time. If you want to again address yourself 
     <lb/>
     on the Financial Report it will be your right to do so. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I intended to do that when the

     <lb/>moment I am concerned only with exercising my 
     <lb/>rights as a member of this Convention to put 
     <lb/>myself correctly before the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I must allow you that right.

            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That is what I am trying to do, 
     <lb/>
     and I will do it in these words: at no time have I 
     <lb/>
     doubted the <hi rendition="simple:italic">bona fides</hi>, the integrity and the 
     <lb/>
     honesty of the Finance Committee in copying 
     <lb/>
     these figures into the report. Now I want further 
     <lb/>
     by way of explanation to say this, that the quarrel 
     <lb/>
     I have is not at all with the Finance Committee, 
     <lb/>
     but with the source from which they got their 
     <lb/>
     figures and in committee of the whole I propose 
     <lb/>
     to show why I quarrel with the source.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is very fair and very

     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> My understanding is that in dealing

     <lb/>
     questions to put to the chairman of the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Committee but since this Convention began, ... it 
     <lb/>
     has been the practice when the House goes into 
     <lb/>
     committee of the whole, to do two things in 
     <lb/>
     connection with reports which were before us: to 
     <lb/>
     direct questions to the chairman of the committee 
     <lb/>
     whose report was being debated, and to have 
     <lb/>
     members make their interpretations and deduc<lb break="no"/>tions from the facts stated. I do not want to direct 
     <lb/>
     any questions at the chairman of the committee 
     <lb/>
     but I do wish to make one or two interpretations 
     <lb/>
     on the facts that are contained in that report.... Sir, 
     <lb/>
     the Finance Committee was perfectly right in 
     <lb/>
     beginning their survey of the country's finances, 
     <lb/>
     not at 1934 but rather back early in the century, 
     <lb/>
     because it is quite impossible to understand the 
     <lb/>
     story of Newfoundland since 1934 unless we 
     <lb/>
     understand her story for some years before 
     <lb/>
     1934.... I propose to take the period 1920 down 
     <lb/>
     to the present time, because that period is within 
     <lb/>
     the conscious recollection of most people in this 
     <lb/>
     Convention this afternoon. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> In fairness to you and to myself, 
 

            <cb/>
           

     your position is that the prescribed period is 
     <lb/>
     incapable of being properly understood unless 
     <lb/>
     and until you take the period anterior to that 
     <lb/>
     period which is necessary to the understanding of 
     <lb/>
     this prescribed period? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> That is exactly the position I 
     <lb/>
     take. We have been doing that in all the reports.... 
     <lb/>
     The practice of the government in its accounting 
     <lb/>
     since 1934 has been this: on the one side, under 
     <lb/>
     the heading of "Revenue" they place everything 
     <lb/>
     they received, and on the other side under the 
     <lb/>
     heading of "Expenditures" they place everything 
     <lb/>
     they spent. Whether public money is spent on 
     <lb/>
     ordinary account or current account, capital or 
     <lb/>
     reconstruction or special account, it is all ex<lb break="no"/>pended.... There is no more point in the practice 
     <lb/>
     of showing the total expenditures as capital or 
     <lb/>
     ordinary than there is to call what was spent in 
     <lb/>
     October different from what was spent in 
     <lb/>
     November.... The table showing the expenditures 
     <lb/>
     of the government for that year should show 
     <lb/>
     every dollar and every cent they spent. Similarly, 
     <lb/>
     on the revenue side every dollar that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment receives goes into what is called the Con<lb break="no"/>solidated Revenue Fund â€” abbreviated CRF.... 
     <lb/>
     So when a table is compiled showing what money 
     <lb/>
     the government has received in a year, every cent 
     <lb/>
     they received should be in that table, and every 
     <lb/>
     cent which they have spent. The Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government has done exactly that since 1934.... 
     <lb/>
     Unfortunately, in taking the reports of the 
     <lb/>
     Auditor General from 1920 to 1934 that cannot 
     <lb/>
     be done, because it was the practice up to 1934

     ... to split it up into all kinds of headings, and not 
     <lb/>
     to give one figure showing the grand total 
     <lb/>
     received and the grand total amount spent in the 
     <lb/>
     one table. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Between 1920 and 1934 the practice of all 
     <lb/>
     governments, as I so well know, having sat in 
     <lb/>
     here from before 1920 as a newspaper reporter 
     <lb/>
     right down to when the last speech was made, day 
     <lb/>
     after day, ... the practice in Newfoundland on the 
     <lb/>
     part of all governments was that they took in 
     <lb/>
     so much in revenue from the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, but it was not enough money. They 
     <lb/>had to cover their expenses and what did they do? 
     <lb/>They went out and they borrowed money; every 
     <lb/>year they borrowed.... In all, $60 million. That is 
     <lb/>what the various governments borrowed from 
     <lb/>1920 to 1933. Now, it may be held that the reason 
     <lb/>they borrowed was because they were not taking 
     <lb/>in enough revenue to pay their expenses. They 
     <lb/>took so much from the people in taxes, the rest 
     <lb/>they borrowed. It may be said that $60 million 
     <lb/>was well spent. It was spent on capital account to 
     <lb/>put the country in a better condition, to provide 
     <lb/>facilities and conveniences for the people; it was 
     <lb/>well spent, it may be argued. Let us take a look 
     <lb/>at it. 1921 â€” $6 million, what was it spent on? 
     <lb/>First of all, half a million was spent to pay off 
     <lb/>temporary loans for the railway; $1 million was 
     <lb/>spent on other railway purposes; half a million on 
     <lb/>public works â€” spent on a per capita basis 
     <lb/>throughout the country; half a million on special 
     <lb/>public works, guaranteeing fishery supply, half a 
     <lb/>million on railway operating deficit. $5.5 million 
     <lb/>out of $6 million. You could not say it was spent 
     <lb/>on capital account; it was spent on account of the 
     <lb/>ordinary purposes of the government, to carry on 
     <lb/>the government. In 1922 they borrowed another 
     <lb/>$6 million. Did they spend that on capital ac<lb break="no"/>count? They spent $1.75 million on the railway; 
     <lb/>Hall's Bay road (special district grant), $665,000; 
     <lb/>relief for unemployed, $128,500; roads and 
     <lb/>bridges, $1.5 million; relief work, $1 million; 
     <lb/>able-bodied pauper relief, $60,000. $5.5 out of $6 
     <lb/>million for ordinary purposes of the country. No 
     <lb/>capital account. Next year they borrowed $3.5 
     <lb/>million. $800,000 was spent to pay the deficit on 
     <lb/>1921 and 1922; $300,000 was spent on railway 
     <lb/>operating purposes; $170,000 on roads and 
     <lb/>bridges and special relief work; $1 million on pit 
     <lb/>props. So it goes on.... In 20 years they borrowed 
     <lb/>$60 million, an average of $3 million a year, and 
     <lb/>
     
            <cb/>
           

     most of it was spent not on capital account at all, 
     <lb/>
     but to carry on the ordinary purposes of govern<lb break="no"/>ment.... And who can say that $60 million was 
     <lb/>
     used in a capital sense to put the country in a 
     <lb/>
     better and sounder condition? It was the conten<lb break="no"/>tion of many a man who stood in this chamber in 
     <lb/>
     the days of responsible government, whenever 
     <lb/>
     the estimates were brought down, ... that they 
     <lb/>
     were cooked; that the figures were falsified, a 
     <lb/>
     bluff, a camouflage, and did not tell the true story 
     <lb/>
     of this country's financial condition. Then when 
     <lb/>
     the other side got the floor, it was their turn to say 
     <lb/>
     the same thing. They said the Railway was a 
     <lb/>
     government department and they ran it at a loss 
     <lb/>
     every year. What do we know about operating 
     <lb/>
     losses on the Railway under the heading 'Ordi<lb break="no"/>nary Expenditure'? That was the burden of their 
     <lb/>
     song.... Major Cashin always contended the Rail<lb break="no"/>way deficits ought to be shown in the ordinary 
     <lb/>
     expenditure. They were not shown... We all 
     <lb/>
     know it was wrong on the part of the various 
     <lb/>
     governments and Auditors General â€” it was 
     <lb/>
     wrong not to show all the expenditure on ordinary 
     <lb/>
     account. The Committee just took the figures 
     <lb/>
     straight out of the Auditor General's reports; but 
     <lb/>
     at least one member of that Committee must have 
     <lb/>
     known; in fact I say he knew when he copied the 
     <lb/>
     figures very correctly... 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> ...Do I understand you are citing

     the Auditor General's reports from 1920-34 
     <lb/>
     showing the ordinary expenditure each year, 
     <lb/>
     knew the figures were incomplete; they did not 
     <lb/>

     thing. When we were compiling the figures we 
     <lb/>
     kept the Railway revenues clear of this. We 
     <lb/>
     brought the Railway out as a separate entity. We 
     <lb/>
     showed the Railway had a total deficit of $4 
     <lb/>
     million and that it had to be paid from some 
     <lb/>
     source. All the deficits from 1923-33 are also 
     <lb/>
     shown. What are we talking about, then? We said 
     <lb/>
     that deficits were paid for out of loans. We did 
     <lb/>
     not try to cover them up in any way. I object to 
     <lb/>
     this trying to convey that we left out something... 
     <lb/>
    </p>

            <p>There is another point that I want to clear up 
     <lb/>in connection with these revenues referred to by 
     <lb/>Mr. Smallwood, that the revenues collected are 
     <lb/>not revenues brought in by taxation. True, during 
     <lb/>these periods amounts of money were brought in 
     <lb/>and piled into the same accounts. Now what used 
     <lb/>to happen in die old days, was when we raised a 
     <lb/>loan, that loan was borrowed for specific pur<lb break="no"/>poses, and no Executive Council could change it 
     <lb/>without it being referred to the House. We estab<lb break="no"/>lished a new account in the bank for the 1928 
     <lb/>loan. The Auditor General had charge of that 
     <lb/>loan, and he knew what specific purposes that 
     <lb/>loan was to be used for... Today what happens is 
     <lb/>that it is all piled in together and it makes it most 
     <lb/>difficult to follow. We consider that the budgets 
     <lb/>compiled by the present Commissioner for 
     <lb/>Finance are not clear. They do not show what the 
     <lb/>actual cost to the country is.... If I were making 
     <lb/>that budget speech I would point out that here is 
     <lb/>what it takes to operate the country, and here is 
     <lb/>how we spent it.... And the capital expenditure 
     <lb/>has to be explained; when the budget is explained 
     <lb/>95% of the people don't realise that the cost of 
     <lb/>operating the country is much less than is actually 
     <lb/>shown in the budget. Mr. Chairman, in comment 
     <lb/>about how much the people know about this, 
     <lb/>when I started to go into these figures I had to buy 
     <lb/>one of these Auditor General's reports, and the 
     <lb/>bookstore told me they only sold seven Auditor 
     <lb/>General's reports in 12 months, which shows 
     <lb/>how much people could know about it. I realise 
     <lb/>that the government accounts in every country 
     <lb/>are tangled up, but there is nothing in this report 
     <lb/>that is left out as far as I know; if there is anything 
     <lb/>left out, and if we did not pile in all the expendi<lb break="no"/>ture we should have, we have accounted for it by 
     <lb/>capital expenditure... 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> ....It would be a decidedly 
     <lb/>dangerous thing for any member to take any 
     <lb/>excerpt from this report and comment on it 


            <cb/>
           

     without reference to the report as a whole. You 
     <lb/>
     are not justified in considering any part of this 
     <lb/>
     report without reference to the rest... 
     <lb/>
     
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I accept the point made by Mr. 
     <lb/>Cashin. I know that the point I am making is 
     <lb/>covered at one place and another throughout the 
     <lb/>report... But the point I am making, and I am sure 
     <lb/>Major Cashin will agree with me, is this: that the 
     <lb/>figures from 1920 to 1934, on the expenditure 
     <lb/>side, the figures that are in the Auditor General's 
     <lb/>reports, are not complete because they do not 
     <lb/>include all ordinary expenditure. They include 
     <lb/>some of it, but not all of it. But nevertheless the 
     <lb/>Committee took the figures as they were, and 
     <lb/>here they are. There is another point. Since Com<lb break="no"/>mission came here in l934 what we find is this: 
     <lb/>that the government, in the Auditor General's 
     <lb/>report for every year, has given a figure showing 
     <lb/>every dollar and cent they spent.... That's OK, but 
     <lb/>now turn over to 1934 up to now in revenue, and 
     <lb/>what do you find? You find left out money which 
     <lb/>the government had received and which they 
     <lb/>spent, and which is shown in the expenditure... I 
     <lb/>am referring to the advances made from year to 
     <lb/>year by the Colonial Development Fund. True 
     <lb/>that most of these were paid as loans from year 
     <lb/>to year, but when it got around 1940, or 1941 I 
     <lb/>think it was, the British government said, "Since 
     <lb/>your Commission has been out there we have 
     <lb/>advanced you every year so much money from 
     <lb/>the Colonial Development Fund. It now runs up 
     <lb/>to $8-10 million. We are going to give you that. 
     <lb/>It is an outright gift." That Colonial Development 
     <lb/>Fund money is included in the expenditure side 
     <lb/>here. My point is that these receipts of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment from the Colonial Development Fund ought 
     <lb/>to be included on the revenue side. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> No. That's where the quarrel started 
     <lb/>before. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Yes, and it's a matter of inter<lb break="no"/>pretation, or opinion. The facts are clear, and we 
     <lb/>have given our opinions on it. We differ in our 
     <lb/>opinions on it.... My opinion is that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Newfoundland should show on the 
     <lb/>revenue side every dollar, every cent, that they 
     <lb/>have received, and on the expenditure side every 
     <lb/>dollar and every cent they spent. How else are we 
     <lb/>going to know where we stand as a country? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I am about to take my seat, but

     ancestors in Newfoundland run back to the year 
     <lb/>
     1707. That's a long time ago, and I am a New<lb break="no"/>foundlander, yet I find on the part of some people, 
     <lb/>
     in and out of the Convention, this tendency: that 
     <lb/>
     if I am not prepared to stand up in this Convention 
     <lb/>
     and out of it, in speaking and writing, to paint the 
     <lb/>
     rosy picture, if I am not prepared to say that 
     <lb/>
     everything is rosy...

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> Mr. Chairman, I rise to a point of 
     <lb/>
     order. We are supposed to be discussing the 
     <lb/>
     Financial Report. I think Mr. Smallwood should 
     <lb/>
     be asked to confine his remarks to the Financial 
     <lb/>
     Report. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> I think the point is well taken... 
     <lb/>
     The discussion must be confined to the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Report... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> What I want to say is that I am... 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:PENN2">Mr. Penney</persName> Mr. Chairman, may I rise to a point 
     <lb/>of order also? I understand that Mr. Smallwood 
     <lb/>asked for 15 or 20 minutes this afternoon. Well, 
     <lb/>he is long past that time, and to me it seems awful 
     <lb/>funny to have to sit back here and have your ear 
     <lb/>drums almost blown out by the same person 
     <lb/>occupying the better part of the time of each 
     <lb/>session of the Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> On that point I am entirely 
     <lb/>
     powerless. There is nothing in the rules which 
     <lb/>
     would justify my imposing a time limit on any 
     <lb/>
     member. One of the reasons for resolving into a 
     <lb/>
     committee of the whole is to relax the rules of 
     <lb/>
     debate... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> I feel it my duty as a member 
     <lb/>
     of this Convention and as a Newfoundlander, to 
     <lb/>
     face the facts of the country's financial position 
     <lb/>
     fairly and squarely. Not to be optimistic or pes<lb break="no"/>simistic, but to be realistic; to face the hard, brutal 
     <lb/>
     facts. One of the facts we must face is this: that 
     <lb/>
     between 1920 and 1940, the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland ... failed to take in enough 
     <lb/>
     revenue to meet their expenses. They failed by 
     <lb/>
     $60 million to do it for 20 years.... There is a fact, 
     <lb/>
     and it is a fact I suggest to you in trying to 
     <lb/>
     anticipate to what extent the next 20 years will 
     <lb/>
     duplicate the 20 years from 1920 to 1940. We 
     <lb/>
     have got to face these facts.... Whatever form of 
     <lb/>
     government we have in the future we know that 
     <lb/>
     from 1920 to 1940 this country went broke $60 
     <lb/>
     million in its expenses and had to go out and 
     <lb/>
     borrow the $60 million to make good.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Mr. Chairman, I wonder if Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood would be good enough to tell this 
 

            <cb/>
         

     House the amount of money for instance loaned 
     <lb/>
     by the federal government of Canada to Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan during these years? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> What is the point of your ques<lb break="no"/>tion, Mr. Hollett? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> The point is this: that there are a 
     <lb/>
     good many countries in this world. We all know 
     <lb/>
     that scarcely a country in this world during these 
     <lb/>
     years could pay its debts. They had to borrow 
     <lb/>
     money, and I refer chiefly to the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan simply because my friend Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Smallwood is an ardent confederate. He is trying 
     <lb/>
     to convince the people, through these 
     <lb/>
     microphones, that because we had to borrow $60 
     <lb/>
     million during these years that we have no chance 
     <lb/>
     whatsoever for a future existence I want him to 
     <lb/>
     tell this country the exact position of certain 
     <lb/>
     provinces in Canada during these particular 
     <lb/>
     years, and particularly Saskatchewan.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The answer is this: at the very 
     <lb/>
     time that Newfoundland went on the rocks the 
     <lb/>
     Province of Saskatchewan also went broke, just 
     <lb/>
     about as badly as this country did. New<lb break="no"/>foundland, as we all know, lost self-government 
     <lb/>
     because we went broke. Great Britain stepped in 
     <lb/>
     and took our government from us. In Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan the Government of Canada loaned the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Saskatchewan I think $90 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. That was in the depression days of 1929-31. 
     <lb/>
     This year, in 1947, the federal government made 
     <lb/>
     a deal with Saskatchewan.... They signed a deal 
     <lb/>
     giving them some 20-odd years to pay half of it, 
     <lb/>
     and the other half the federal government has 
     <lb/>
     forgiven altogether.... Saskatchewan came out of 
     <lb/>
     it very well, and they did not lose their govern<lb break="no"/>ment as we did. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is not the point. The point 
     <lb/>
     is that Saskatchewan did have to obtain $90 mil<lb break="no"/>lion from the federal government in order to carry 
     <lb/>
     on the provincial government at the same time 
     <lb/>
     that Newfoundland had to borrow outside, in 
     <lb/>
     order to carry on the cost of government.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> Mr. Chairman, our friend is trying 
     <lb/>
     to make a wonderful point. We borrowed $60 
     <lb/>
     million to pay our debts since 1920-21. Absolute<lb break="no"/>ly incorrect. Let us look at the whole story.... The 
     <lb/>
     object of this report was to get an overall picture 
     <lb/>
     of the country from 1934 down to now, but we

     went back a number of years, and here is the

     situation. Before we go any further, my friend

     correct. I contend that loans of money or advan<lb break="no"/>ces are not revenues, but they are covered be<lb break="no"/>cause on the other side of the fence we showed 
     <lb/>
     the expenditures out of that money, but we take 
     <lb/>
     good care to point out that in the text. If we take 
     <lb/>
     into account the fact that over $20 million has 
     <lb/>
     been spent on the capital or long account, which 
     <lb/>
     ordinarily should be deducted from our own ex<lb break="no"/>penditure, the final result for a period of half a 
     <lb/>
     century should show approximately $15 million. 
     <lb/>
     That shows that we did not try to cook this 
     <lb/>
     thing... Now if we took that $20 million from 
     <lb/>
     $469 million that leaves $449 million, conse<lb break="no"/>quently our revenue should be $469 million, 
     <lb/>
     which would leave us a surplus of $15 million. 
     <lb/>
     Now let's go a little further. We are not like 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan at all, we are away ahead of them. 
     <lb/>
     Why? Up to September 30 1947, we collected in 
     <lb/>
     revenues $499 million. That leaves us a deficit 
     <lb/>
     mind you, including these capital expenditures, a 
     <lb/>
     deficit of $3.4 million-odd. Now today our na<lb break="no"/>tional debt is approximately $70 million. Against 
     <lb/>
     this we have $35 million in cash. That means if 
     <lb/>
     we paid it off tomorrow we would have a debt of 
     <lb/>
     $35 million. Now what have we got for that debt? 
     <lb/>
     To begin with we are lending money today free 
     <lb/>
     of interest, probably the only country in the world 
     <lb/>
     that is doing it, but what have we got for the $35 
     <lb/>
     million? Take that report brought back by the 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa delegation, which shows we have a rail<lb break="no"/>way which is valuable to someone. I don't think 
     <lb/>
     the Railway is worth $72 million, but that's down 
     <lb/>
     in black and white. in addition we have all our 
     <lb/>
     public buildings today in the country, say $10 
     <lb/>
     million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> Can you? I doubt it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> That statement is approximately 
     <lb/>
     correct.... Therefore our total assets are ap<lb break="no"/>proximately, and I say approximately, $107 mil<lb break="no"/>lion. Now if we deduct that $35 million which we 
     <lb/>
     owe, we have a definite surplus left (on paper, 
     <lb/>
     mind you) of $70 million in round figures. That 
     <lb/>
     is the position as far as the Government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland is concerned today. Now if we take, 
     <lb/>
     on top of that, the other hundred-odd million 
     <lb/>
     dollars in the bank, and we add our life insurance, 
     <lb/>
     our securities and all else, I hold today that this 
  

            <cb/>
         

     country is in an outstanding financial position â€” 
     <lb/>
     unequalled by any country in the world. True we 
     <lb/>
     have gloomy days coming before us. So has 
     <lb/>
     every other country. Why, the mother country 
     <lb/>
     that is supposed to be backing our note, so to say, 
     <lb/>
     what financial position is Great Britain in? What 
     <lb/>
     financial position is Canada in? Today in Canada 
     <lb/>
     they are having great difficulty in making some 
     <lb/>
     arrangement to offset the dollar trade with the 
     <lb/>
     United States of America. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When we say $60 million, we have to say, 
     <lb/>
     "What have we got left on our shelves?" We have 
     <lb/>
     to take stock at the end of the year like any firm 
     <lb/>
     on Water Street. A businessman may not have 
     <lb/>
     any money in the bank; he sometimes has to pay 
     <lb/>
     profits tax and he has to go to the bank to borrow 
     <lb/>
     it. He has a big stock on hand. That stock repre<lb break="no"/>sents his surplus. That is the position as I see it 
     <lb/>
     with Newfoundland. We were in financial dif<lb break="no"/>ficulties, we have gone through hard times, but 
     <lb/>
     today no one will deny that this country is in as 
     <lb/>
     sound a financial position as any other country in 
     <lb/>
     the world. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> Mr. Chairman, we have come to the 
     <lb/>
     report so long awaited with bated breath, for it is 
     <lb/>
     from our findings and our interpretation of what 
     <lb/>
     the Finance Committee has prepared that we base 
     <lb/>
     our conclusions for our final recommendations to 
     <lb/>
     the people of Newfoundland. In view of the very 
     <lb/>
     unsettled conditions as the result of a long and 
     <lb/>
     bloody conflict, we cannot hope to escape the 
     <lb/>
     inevitable share of a general world depression. In 
     <lb/>
     some respects we will suffer more than our 
     <lb/>
     proportionate share, and in others we will ex<lb break="no"/>perience less... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> That is where you start to 
     <lb/>
     prophesy and it is absolutely irrelevant and out of 
     <lb/>
     order. I would ask the members to confine their 
     <lb/>
     remarks to the Finance Report.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> I have based my remarks solely on 
     <lb/>
     the result of the findings of the various commit<lb break="no"/>tees, particularly the Financial Report. If I 
     <lb/>
     wander, I apologise. It must be generally ad<lb break="no"/>mitted that for the past seven years New<lb break="no"/>foundland has been on the favourable side of the 
     <lb/>
     balance sheet. This was more artificial than real 
     <lb/>
     in the sense that it was wartime prosperity 
     <lb/>
     brought about through our strategic position as 
     <lb/>
     the Gibraltar of the West Atlantic, and what 
     <lb/>
     might prove our doom and disaster in 1960 was 
     <lb/>
     our blessing in 1940, for just as sure as we reaped

     a measure of financial benefits from our 
     <lb/>
     geographical position in the last war, we will 
     <lb/>
     suffer being the front line battleground of the 
     <lb/>
     next, and we will pay both in manpower and cash. 
     <lb/>
     All this we are only too conscious of, and it would 
     <lb/>
     be folly on our part to ignore these unpleasant 
     <lb/>
     facts. I presume this Convention will, in due 
     <lb/>
     course, bring in an Economic Report based on the 
     <lb/>
     substance of the findings of the various commit<lb break="no"/>tees.... Regardless of how critical we may be over 
     <lb/>
     the construction or interpretation of certain ac<lb break="no"/>tions by the powers ruling us, we do agree on the 
     <lb/>
     main basic principles. As far as the cost of 
     <lb/>
     government goes, this has increased in every 
     <lb/>
     country out of all proportion to what the people 
     <lb/>
     should be called upon to pay. Newfoundland is 
     <lb/>
     not the exception and the public are only too 
     <lb/>
     conscious of this unpleasant fact; but it is the duty 
     <lb/>
     of the next government to cut not only the number 
     <lb/>
     but the cost to a minimum, more in harmony with 
     <lb/>
     the requirements and earnings of our people. We 
     <lb/>
     have studied the figures for over a year, and 
     <lb/>
     believe it or not our people are interested in 
     <lb/>
     hearing our conclusions and have expected this 
     <lb/>
     whole business to wind up long ago. Nine out of 
     <lb/>
     every ten of our listening public are well in<lb break="no"/>formed on the cost of all governments and none 
     <lb/>
     of the whole 100% would do much better if they 
     <lb/>
     were there. Newfoundlanders generally are 
     <lb/>
     wondering, "Where do we go from here?" If I 
     <lb/>
     were given the privilege of moulding a plan for 
     <lb/>
     this country, I would first restore to New<lb break="no"/>foundland full dominion status.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> We are not discussing forms of 
     <lb/>
     government at this time.... Let me again please 
     <lb/>
     remind members that the primary duty of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention, and you are now engaged upon it, is 
     <lb/>
     to consider the financial and economic position 
     <lb/>
     of the island as and from 1934. Then after that 
     <lb/>
     you will go on to consider the question of future 
     <lb/>
     forms of political institutions. I must ask mem<lb break="no"/>bers at this time if they would confine themselves 
     <lb/>
     strictly to the Financial Report.... 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> I respect your ruling and I will drop 
     <lb/>
     a paragraph. I have heard other members discuss 
     <lb/>
     forms of government and you did not interfere. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> If the inference is that I have 
     <lb/>discriminated in favour of certain men, I can only 
     <lb/>apologise, I am merely attending for the fourth 
     <lb/>time. It will take time to get a working grasp of 
     <lb/>what goes on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> I understand that. You will agree 
     <lb/>
     with me it is also difficult for us; after all, we are 
     <lb/>
     only laymen. It is difficult in discussing the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Report to avoid touching on the political 
     <lb/>
     side. However, I will drop out a paragraph. Now 
     <lb/>
     it would be monotonous to the public for every 
     <lb/>
     member to get up to repeat these figures we have 
     <lb/>
     heard the past few days, and I propose to give a 
     <lb/>
     brief resume of the present position as I see it after 
     <lb/>
     giving the whole matter exhaustive study and 
     <lb/>
     consideration. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, if our cash balances were ap<lb break="no"/>plied to our liabilities, our per capita debt would 
     <lb/>
     be in the vicinity of something like $115 per head 
     <lb/>
     â€” a very healthy position indeed. Two of our 
     <lb/>
     staple industries, paper and mining, never were 
     <lb/>
     in a healthier condition. Our fishing industry has 
     <lb/>
     received an unexpected setback, as it was 
     <lb/>
     generally felt the past spring that prices would be 
     <lb/>
     as good as last year, but in reality, apart from the 
     <lb/>
     matter of exchange, the average price received by 
     <lb/>
     the fishermen is really about $2 less, $1 directly 
     <lb/>
     on the price and at least $1 on the cull. I fear the 
     <lb/>
     price of fish will gradually come down; but I am 
     <lb/>
     optimistic enough to believe that great strides 
     <lb/>
     will be made in the matter of modern curing, 
     <lb/>
     handling and marketing, and the millions from 
     <lb/>
     the fish-eating countries who have migrated to 
     <lb/>
     the central and western states will be reached 
     <lb/>
     with our fish products packed and cured under the 
     <lb/>
     most modern and sanitary conditions. The Mar<lb break="no"/>shall Plan will, if accepted, leave many millions 
     <lb/>
     of American dollars in Newfoundland for herring 
     <lb/>
     and other sea products to be shipped to Europe in 
     <lb/>
     a similar manner to the UNRRA pack, and replac<lb break="no"/>ing it in perhaps a bigger way. Our lumber in<lb break="no"/>dustry has taken a temporary slump, but we have 
     <lb/>
     no surplus of lumber to cause any real anxiety in 
     <lb/>
     this respect. New industries are cropping up in 
     <lb/>
     many of the larger outports as well as St. John's. 
     <lb/>
     absorbing many of the men who have been left 
     <lb/>
     idle through most of the base works being 
     <lb/>
     finished. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The general overall picture is as bright for us 
     <lb/>
     as for any other country we know. Yet I would 
     <lb/>
     not say that Newfoundland will always run as a 
     <lb/>
     separate entity in the British Commonwealth â€” 
     <lb/>
     it may even in the very near future unite with her 
     <lb/>
     neighbours on the continent â€” but looking back 
     <lb/>
     at the manner in which our counuy's pride, wealth 
     <lb/>
     and territory have been needlessly sacrificed

     during the past 14 years, we cannot afford to risk 
     <lb/>
     the handling of such a serious and delicate matter 
     <lb/>
     as confederation to a group of irresponsible trus<lb break="no"/>tees who have proved beyond a shadow of doubt 
     <lb/>
     they are incapable of protecting the best...

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName> Please, Mr. Vardy, I want you 
     <lb/>
     to understand there is no attempt on my part to 
     <lb/>
     discriminate against you in any shape or form. 
     <lb/>
     Prognostications as to our economic poten<lb break="no"/>tialities or future forms of political institutions

     are, I rule, entirely irrelevant. I must ask members

     now to confine themselves to a direct discussion 
     <lb/>
     of the Financial Report. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:VARD1">Mr. Vardy</persName> I have never been brought to order 
     <lb/>
     by the Chair. I shall never stoop to personal abuse 
     <lb/>
     of any member here. If the Chairman finds in the 
     <lb/>
     heat of debate he must call me to order, if he is 
     <lb/>
     right I shall bow to his better judgement, if he is 
     <lb/>
     wrong, I shall defend myself in a manner ap<lb break="no"/>propriate to the occasion. Sir, your task is a 
     <lb/>
     difficult one I do not envy you. When our feel<lb break="no"/>ings run deep, so will our language. I feel, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, after most carefully examining the 
     <lb/>
     balance sheet we can assume full responsibility 
     <lb/>
     for our future destiny unafraid. With hard work, 
     <lb/>
     determination and endurance, the pride of New<lb break="no"/>foundland will again be restored to her proper

     place in the new world order.

     <persName ref="pers:HIGG1">Mr. Higgins</persName> I should like to move that we

     decide now to terminate the debate and that we

     adopt the report without further discussion. I do 
     <lb/>
     not know if I can move it at this time.

            </p>

            <p>

     report will get lots of attention when we come to 
     <lb/>
     the discussion of the economic side. It is merely 
     <lb/>
     a short postponement of further discussion; and 
     <lb/>
     as a matter of fact people have been speaking to 
     <lb/>
     the economic section. I do not think we have been

     but we did not get to any final decision as to what

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> Not quite. I have been giving some 
     <lb/>
     thought to this report. We have to decide whether 
     <lb/>
     or not this country is self-supporting, which I 
     <lb/>
     think is a very silly thing to have to do, because 
     <lb/>
     I don't think any individual, country, or town or 
     <lb/>
     anything else is self-supporting; but we have to 
     <lb/>
     decide this, and consequently we have to have

     this Economic Report, but the reason I raised the 
     <lb/>
     point is that I am doubtful as to whether or not the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Committee is the correct committee to 
     <lb/>
     make this report, or if they are, should not they 
     <lb/>
     be aided by at least the chairmen of the various 
     <lb/>
     natural resource reports which we have had, such 
     <lb/>
     as Fisheries, Mining, and the others. I think it 
     <lb/>
     would be wise if some men from these other 
     <lb/>
     committees were added to the Finance Commit<lb break="no"/>tee. I think they should be assisted by some 
     <lb/>
     members of the other committees that worked on 
     <lb/>
     the real natural resources of this country. 
    </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:CASH2">Mr. Cashin</persName> When we meet tomorrow in the 
     <lb/>Finance Committee we will discuss that point and 
     <lb/>will be able to give a report as to what we feel 
     <lb/>should happen, or think should happen in the 
     <lb/>future in connection with this Economic

            <p>But in view of the fact that this would be the only 
     <lb/>business tomorrow in the event of its being 
     <lb/>passed, I would like the indulgence of the House

     useless to come back, if this motion is brought up
