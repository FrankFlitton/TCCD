     ly that when I see Major Cashin's questions and 
     <lb/>
     others already asked, and I imagine many yet to 
     <lb/>
     be asked, I feel profoundly my inability to ana<lb break="no"/>lyse and assess the importance of the data. It so 
     <lb/>
     happens that I am not very good at arithmetic. I 
     <lb/>
     feel that if the government were to give us a 
     <lb/>
     statistician-economist of at least equal academic 
     <lb/>
     and professional standing of Professor Wheare, 
     <lb/>
     the constitutional authority, whether he be ob<lb break="no"/>tained in the United States or any other English- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     speaking country, if he be a thoroughly 
     <lb/>
     competent man, he can be of enormous value in 
     <lb/>
     what is a monumental job. I think we are over<lb break="no"/>

     <lb/>
     the world, but by the realisation of the tremen<lb break="no"/>dous task of setting out to assess the real state of 
     <lb/>
     this country. If we can get help from a profes<lb break="no"/>sional man, one who has no axe to grind and who 
     <lb/>
     does not care what kind of government we may 
     <lb/>
     have; if we can get such a man as that it will be 
     <lb/>
     of tremendous help to the members of the Con<lb break="no"/>vention in discharging the duty they have had laid 
     <lb/>
     upon them.

                  then consider whether any of the <lb/> questions are repetitious, and that being
                  decided, <lb/> would have them sent at once to the appropriate <lb/> departments
                  concerned, and see that the informa<lb break="no"/>tion comes back with all
                  possible speed; the idea <lb/> being that basic information is essential and <lb/>
                  should be obtained with all despatch and in the <lb/> simplest way possible.

                  taking the places <lb/> of Newfoundlanders, who are not as competent <lb/> as our
                  own. Therefore I oppose such a resolution. <lb/>
               </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BUTT1">Mr. Butt</persName> I think Major Cashin misunderstood <lb/>the resolution.
                  The motion is for a 'statistician' <lb/>economist, not a 'political' economist. I
                  doubt if <lb/>there is a competent statistician-economist in this <lb/>country.

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:JOB1">Mr. Job</persName> I would like to ask if it is someone in <lb/> the

                  <persName ref="pers:SMAL1">Mr. Smallwood</persName> The idea is not that of getting a <lb/>
                  political economist. We have one in Professor <lb/> Wheare. The idea is to get a
                  man accustomed to <lb/> examining and analysing figures, drawing <lb/> graphs,
                  percentages and doing work for the <lb/> delegates to help us to see the trends
                  indicated <lb/> and the meanings of the statistics to be produced. <lb/> I do not
                  know of one Newfoundlander now in the <lb/> country â there may be Newfoundlanders

                  Major Cashin directed a question of <lb/> the utmost importance, perhaps the most
                     fun<lb break="no"/>damental that has been tabled to date, the figures <lb/>
                  showing the gross national production of New<lb break="no"/>foundland.... ' <lb/>

                  without which government and the Con<lb break="no"/>vention are groping about in
                  the dark. It is a vital <lb/> question. Mr. Chairman, a man such as this mo<lb break="no"/>tion has in mind, brought to this country can <lb/> inside of
                  perhaps two months or ten weeks arrive <lb/> for the first time in the country's
                  history at <lb/> precisely that result. We have been guessing all <lb/> our lives
                  about what the country is worth. I spent <lb/> three months compiling one table
                  that occupied <lb/> half a page of a book I wrote. I went to every <lb/>
                  manufacturer in the country and by cajolery got <lb/> out of him the figures as to
                  the production of his <lb/> plant for the preceding year. I did it by promising
                  <lb/> each that I would not let anyone else know. I am <lb/> not saying this

                  what we <lb/> call our local industries are merely one element <lb/> going to make
                  up the gross national production <lb/> of Newfoundland. Mr. Chairman, if such a
                  man <lb/> were brought here, not only would he be useful <lb/> to Major Cashin,

                  man, <lb/> but he would be a great help to all of us. Major <lb/> Cashin could say
                  to him, "Here are a mass of <lb/> figures, will you get to work on these and work
                  <lb/> out graphs, percentages, etc?" In addition he can <lb/> be set loose at the
                  much bigger and more fun<lb break="no"/>damental job of finding out for the first
                  time in <lb/> 450 years just what is the national income of <lb/> Newfoundland,
                  and to what extent is the govern<lb break="no"/>ment imposing upon the people a
                  burden they <lb/> ought not to be called upon to bear. What will the <lb/> people
                  have left to live on when the taxation is <lb/> taken from them? Who knows? No
                  one. We <lb/> know what is taken from them roughly, but we <lb/> don't know what
                  they are left with. I am thinking <lb/> of a man who made exactly a study of this
                  kind <lb/> of thing in New Zealand and Australia, and who <lb/> is at this moment
                  making it for the city of New <lb/> York, and I don't think the best is any too
                  good. <lb/> With no ulterior motives this is purely a matter of <lb/> getting
                  help. If there is no Newfoundlander or no <lb/> outsider to be obtained I will
                  have the Devil if he <lb/> will give us that kind of help <lb/>
               </p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL2">Mr. Hollett</persName> After my friend Mr. Smallwood, I <lb/>hesitate to
                  speak on this matter. We have had <lb/>experts dealing with the economics and
                  finances <lb/>of this country over the past 12 years, and probab<lb break="no"/>ly
                  for many years before, and many of these <lb/>experts have made up graphs,
                  tabulated figures, <lb/>and based opinions on the figures and graphs <lb/>which
                  are there for any man to read. We should <lb/>all like to know the actual national
                  income of this <lb/>country. That is a job definitely for a statistician, <lb/>but
                  one which is going to take a much longer <lb/>period than the life of this
                  Convention. At least I <lb/>hope so. If the people of this country desired the <lb/>
                  <cb/> importation of an expert or statistician to find out <lb/> and explain to
                  them the economic and financial <lb/> condition of this country they probably
                  would <lb/> have been able to dispense with electing 45 men <lb/> to get it in
                  their own way. But we shall get the <lb/> information so that we at least shall be
                  able to <lb/> interpret it to the people who sent us here. I feel <lb/> that we
                  have no authority to engage a statistician, <lb/> and I am not quite sure that the
                  Commission of <lb/> Government are going to fall for the importation <lb/> of
                  another expert. Most of us know, generally, the <lb/> economic condition of this
                  country, and the fact <lb/> of putting it down in bold figures is not going to
                  <lb/> help us tremendously, or make up our minds. The <lb/> various committees you
                  are going to appoint to <lb/> go into the different aspects of the life of this
                  <lb/> country will be able to bring forward enough <lb/> facts and figures to
                  enable us to go into the matter, <lb/> and I oppose the motion. <lb/>
               </p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:BALL2">Mr. Ballam</persName> Mr. Chairman, I agree with Mr. <lb/>Hollett. Although
                  there may be a necessity of <lb/>bringing in an expert, I think that is exactly
                  why <lb/>we were elected â to make a study, in our own <lb/>way, of the economic
                  position of this country. As <lb/>our previous speaker mentioned, we have already
                  <lb/>had too many experts, and I think we are quite <lb/>capable of doing the job.

     Newfoundland people, the first to meet in this 
     <lb/>
     historic chamber since the suspension of respon<lb break="no"/>sible government in December, 1933. It is nearly

     13 years since the surrender of our democratic

     We delegates have been appointed by the men 
     <lb/>
     and women of Newfoundland to meet here to 
     <lb/>
     review our past, study our present and, as far as 
     <lb/>
     humanly possible, to plan for our future. It is a 
     <lb/>
     great task, a great responsibility, but at the same 
     <lb/>
     time, let us ever remember, it is also a great 
     <lb/>
     privilege. To us has been given the sacred and 
     <lb/>
     solemn duty of performing a truly patriotic ser<lb break="no"/>vice â helping to shape the destinies of our 
     <lb/>
     country for possibly 100 years. It should then be 
     <lb/>
     unnecessary for me to stress the importance of 
     <lb/>
     our approaching the task in a proper spirit - <lb/> prepared to face all the facts, however disagree<lb break="no"/>able, and to get these facts, no matter how deep 
     <lb/>
     we may have to dig. We must not hesitate to stand 
     <lb/>
     solidly behind what is just and right, and be 
     <lb/>
     equally ready to condemn whatever is wrong, 
     <lb/>
     regardless of the source from which that wrong 
     <lb/>
     emanates, and no matter whom the wrong-doers 
     <lb/>
     may be. Newfoundlanders have always been 
     <lb/>
     noted for their courage and love of justice. Let us 
     <lb/>
     then show to the country and to the outside world 
     <lb/>
     that we, in this time of crisis, are not lacking these 
     <lb/>
     same qualities. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As regards this Convention itself, I should like 
     <lb/>
     to repeat what I have so often said in the past, that 
     <lb/>
     I am not and have never been a supporter of this 
     <lb/>
     whole set-up which is absolutely contrary to the 
     <lb/>
     pledge made to this country by the British 
     <lb/>
     government in December, 1933. Everyone 
     <lb/>
     present knows that under the terms of that agree<lb break="no"/>ment we were specifically and categorically 
     <lb/>
     promised the return of responsible government 
     <lb/>
     upon our becoming self-supporting, which state 
     <lb/>
     we reached, according to the Dominions 
     <lb/>
     Secretary himself, in the year 1941. No one has 
     <lb/>
     yet come forward to give us the reason why this 
     <lb/>
     pledge was ignored, and why we were offered 
     <lb/>
     this Convention as a substitute. We know that in 
     <lb/>
     that international pact, there is no mention of 
     <lb/>
     conventions or plebiscites and the introduction of 
     <lb/>
     these foreign issues is wholly contrary to the 
     <lb/>
     spirit and letter of that agreement. How can I, how 
     <lb/>
     can any thinking Newfoundlander, honestly and 
     <lb/>
     conscientiously give his moral support and en<lb break="no"/>dorsement to a thing which is not alone illegal, 
     <lb/>
     but even ethically improper? Therefore, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, if we are to view this Convention 
     <lb/>
     in its right perspective, we must accept the fact 
     <lb/>
     of its fundamental illegality. And in reference to 
     <lb/>
     this point, permit me to give you some extracts 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
           
     from a speech delivered by Prime Minister Attlee 
     <lb/>
     in the British House of Commons on December 
     <lb/>
     11, 1945. Replying to questions asked by the late 
     <lb/>
     James Maxton, Independent Labour Party, and 
     <lb/>
     Sir Alan Herbert, Independent, Mr. Attlee says, 
     <lb/>
     "It is important that a series of reconstruction 
     <lb/>
     measures which the Commission government al<lb break="no"/>ready have in hand or are planning to introduce 
     <lb/>
     should proceed without interruption and these 
     <lb/>
     will be pushed forward as rapidly as possible. The 
     <lb/>
     Commission have a full programme to meet very 
     <lb/>
     pressing requirements on the island during the 
     <lb/>
     next two or three years." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Chairman, is not this a most extraor<lb break="no"/>dinary statement for Mr. Attlee to make. On the 
     <lb/>
     one hand, he talks about letting Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     hold a Convention to decide what form of 
     <lb/>
     government the people want, and in the next 
     <lb/>
     breath coolly telling the world that regardless of 
     <lb/>
     what the people of Newfoundland may want, 
     <lb/>
     regardless of any political aspirations they may 
     <lb/>
     have or what the findings of this Convention may 
     <lb/>
     be, he intends to enforce Commission rule on 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland for another three years and during 
     <lb/>
     that time to carry out his own special plans with 
     <lb/>
     regard to our country. If this is so, what is the 
     <lb/>
     sense of our being here at all, going through these 
     <lb/>
     legislative gestures? Why not save ourselves and 
     <lb/>
     the country all this trouble and expense and wait 
     <lb/>
     until Mr. Attlee has completed whatever 
     <lb/>
     schemes he has in mind for our country, in the 
     <lb/>
     working out of which, apparently, no New<lb break="no"/>foundlander shall have part? Does it not simply 
     <lb/>
     bear out what I have said time and time again, that 
     <lb/>
     this whole convention and plebiscite scheme 
     <lb/>
     dressed up in the trappings of democracy is noth<lb break="no"/>ing more or less than a glorified stall. I have no 
     <lb/>
     doubt that in drawing up his three-year 
     <lb/>
     programme Mr. Attlee has been influenced and 
     <lb/>
     enthusiastically abetted by the local commis<lb break="no"/>sioners, who must have stressed the necessity of 
     <lb/>
     retaining their indispensible services. I should 
     <lb/>
     like to make it clear I am not speaking with any 
     <lb/>
     idea of making political capital, or placing un<lb break="no"/>necessary obstacles in the pathway of this as<lb break="no"/>sembly. I am prepared and eager to assist in 
     <lb/>
     anything which has for its object the genuine 
     <lb/>
     welfare of our country or our people. But even at 
     <lb/>
     the risk of creating a discordant note in this 
     <lb/>
     Convention, 1 am not prepared to deny the truth 
     <lb/>
     of things as I see them. If I did, I would be false

     I say that this Convention should not be kept 
     <lb/>
     here dilly-dallying in an atmosphere of ques<lb break="no"/>tionable motives on the part of the Dominions 
     <lb/>
     Office. Nor should delegates be under any mis<lb break="no"/>conception as to our actual status. We must 
     <lb/>
     realise that we are not in any sense a legislative 
     <lb/>
     assembly and that we have no power to make 
     <lb/>
     binding decisions. There has been much mis<lb break="no"/>guided talk about our far-reaching responsibility, 
     <lb/>
     but the fact of the matter is we have no legal 
     <lb/>
     responsibility whatever, for the simple reason 
     <lb/>
     that the Dominions Office will not permit us to 
     <lb/>
     exercise any responsibility. As for the opinions 
     <lb/>
     or representations we may present to the 
     <lb/>
     Secretary of State for the Dominions, if such do 
     <lb/>
     not suit he can and probably will throw them in 
     <lb/>
     the waste-paper basket. Our status is simply that 
     <lb/>
     of a mock parliament, a discussion group, a study 
     <lb/>
     club, and that's where our power and respon<lb break="no"/>sibility begins and ends. Under present circum<lb break="no"/>stances the responsibility for Newfoundland's 
     <lb/>
     future rests firstly in the hands of the British 
     <lb/>
     government, and secondly in the hands of our 
     <lb/>
     people themselves, provided they are permitted 
     <lb/>
     to vote in a plebiscite authorised by Mr. Attlee. 
     <lb/>
     For ourselves, we are simply third parties to the 
     <lb/>
     whole transaction. Some people who are as not 
     <lb/>
     yet aware of the true nature of this Convention 
     <lb/>
     may be surprised to hear me speak of it in what 
     <lb/>
     they may regard as a disrespectful manner, but 
     <lb/>
     mark my word, and note, that as time goes on, 
     <lb/>
     and the true nature of this whole thing emerges 
     <lb/>
     from the impressive stage-settings with which it 
     <lb/>
     is dressed up, they will fully endorse the semi- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     merits I have expressed today. They will realise 
     <lb/>
     that in their dealings with Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Attlee, the Dominions Office, and the local 
     <lb/>
     Commission, have stolen the vocabulary of 
     <lb/>
     democracy, but they have deliberately sidetrack<lb break="no"/>ed its spirit and substance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In view of these opinions, it may be fairly 
     <lb/>
     asked why I am prepared to sit in a Convention 
     <lb/>
     which I condemn. I am here not in the role of a 
     <lb/>
     subservient delegate to a Commission-inspired 
     <lb/>
     assembly, but as a free and independent repre<lb break="no"/>sentative of the people whose interests I repre<lb break="no"/>sent. Anyone who has heard my radio talks, 
     <lb/>
     listened to my pre-election speeches can have no 
     <lb/>
     
            <cb/>
        
     misunderstanding as to my unchanging attitude 
     <lb/>
     in this matter. I did not wait until I was elected to 
     <lb/>
     condemn this Convention idea. From its first 
     <lb/>
     announcement, I have consistently denounced it 
     <lb/>
     as being conceived with the deliberate idea of 
     <lb/>
     indefinitely prolonging the rule of Commission 
     <lb/>
     government in this country. I told the people of 
     <lb/>
     my district in St. John's West, that I came before 
     <lb/>
     them as a 100% advocate of responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment; that if they elected me, I would use every 
     <lb/>
     effort to see that the Dominions Office and the 
     <lb/>
     British government carried out the pledge made 
     <lb/>
     to this country in 1933. It is for these things that 
     <lb/>
     the people have sent me to this assembly, and I 
     <lb/>
     do not intend to fail them. Again, I emphatically 
     <lb/>
     condemn the motives which inspired this Con<lb break="no"/>vention, and I equally condemn the purposes for 
     <lb/>
     which the Dominions Office would use this as<lb break="no"/>sembly of Newfoundland representatives. But we 
     <lb/>
     have to be realists, we have to make the best of 
     <lb/>
     the situation thrust upon us; and, as good some<lb break="no"/>times comes out of evil, I at least hope to see in 
     <lb/>
     this assembly an opportunity for a long silenced, 
     <lb/>
     long subjugated country to recover its voice. I see 
     <lb/>
     in it the first opportunity given our people in 14 
     <lb/>
     years to lawfully come together and consider the 
     <lb/>
     fate of their common country, and by the personal 
     <lb/>
     contacts thereby created to strengthen the bonds 
     <lb/>
     of their blood and soil. I see in it an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     for giving birth and outlining plans for the freeing 
     <lb/>
     of our country from her present state of national 
     <lb/>
     dishonour, of laying the cornerstone of a new 
     <lb/>
     freedom and making the first advances towards 
     <lb/>
     that new and brighter future so long denied and 
     <lb/>
     desired by us. And it is with the desire of assisting 
     <lb/>
     that I am here today. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As I mentioned in my opening remarks, I have 
     <lb/>
     been asked to present for your acceptance and 
     <lb/>
     consideration a report on the financial and 
     <lb/>
     economic position of Newfoundland. In doing so 
     <lb/>
     I am not to be regarded as its Sponsor. I am 
     <lb/>
     performing this service simply as a part of my 
     <lb/>
     duty as delegate to this Convention and because 
     <lb/>
     I have been requested to do so, with the hope of 
     <lb/>
     expediting the work 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This report on Newfoundland has, as usual, 
     <lb/>
     neither been compiled nor authored by New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders. For the past 12 years, our people 
     <lb/>
     have been subjected to consistent propaganda by 
     <lb/>
     apologists of the Commission and the Dominions 
     <lb/>
     Office, and during that same period the only 
     <lb/>

     reports they have seen were those issued at the 
     <lb/>
     instance of the Dominions Office: the Amulree 
     <lb/>
     Report,<ref target="#fn_02">[1]</ref> the Goodwill Mission report,<ref target="#fn_03">[2]</ref> the Gor<lb break="no"/>vin report<ref target="#fn_04">[3]</ref> and the one which we are now asked 
     <lb/>
     to receive. It is both significant and deplorable 
     <lb/>
     that no official report has been issued from any 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland source and that no Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     mentality has had any part in the preparation of 
     <lb/>
     those submitted to us. Is it any wonder that the 
     <lb/>
     only side of the case which Newfoundlanders 
     <lb/>
     have had placed before them is the case for Com<lb break="no"/>mission of Government? Is it not high time that 
     <lb/>
     we Newfoundlanders did something about this, 
     <lb/>
     and prepared our own report â a Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     report for the benefit of our people? Surely we 
     <lb/>
     are just as competent to discuss and analyse the 
     <lb/>
     affairs of our own country as some Englishmen 
     <lb/>
     thousands of miles away? Must we continue to 
     <lb/>
     meekly accept these biased and self-motivated 
     <lb/>
     publications of outsiders? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In my estimation the famous Amulree Report 
     <lb/>
     is a publication whose sole and single aim was to 
     <lb/>
     pave the way and justify in advance an inex<lb break="no"/>cusable act of political sabotage which had al<lb break="no"/>ready been decided on. The Goodwill report and 
     <lb/>
     the Gorvin report were simply the usual valueless 
     <lb/>
     impressions of fly-by-night transients, whose 
     <lb/>
     authors wrote their reports under the admonish<lb break="no"/>ing finger of their masters in Downing Street. The 
     <lb/>
     latest of these reports, that of June past, I have 
     <lb/>
     before me. It was obviously written for the en<lb break="no"/>lightenment and guidance of the delegates of this 
     <lb/>
     Convention, no doubt with the object of influenc<lb break="no"/>ing their thoughts and decisions. As usual, the 
     <lb/>
     authors are graduates of the Dominions Office in 
     <lb/>
     London, their names being Messrs. Chadwick 
     <lb/>
     and Jones and as usual the report bears the im<lb break="no"/>primatur of that office. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is one characteristic all these reports 
     <lb/>
     seem to have in common, and that is the complete 
     <lb/>
     absence of any criticism of the actions of the 
     <lb/>
     British government, the Dominions Office or 
     <lb/>
     Commission government. Calumnies there are in 
     <lb/>
     galore of Newfoundland and Newfoundlanders 
     <lb/>
     âour ignorance, our backwardness, our political 
     <lb/>
     corruption. Libels are plentifully interspersed 
     <lb/>
          
     
            <cb/>
            
     throughout their pages on our religious institu<lb break="no"/>tions, our living and our dead. But never one 
     <lb/>
     single criticism or one word of censure against 
     <lb/>
     those people or bodies at whose instigation they 
     <lb/>
     were making these reports. This is perhaps only 
     <lb/>
     to be expected and may be regarded as good 
     <lb/>
     politics, but it is certainly not honest politics. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>For the purpose of further illustrating what I 
     <lb/>have said about these reports in general, I propose 
     <lb/>to quote a few extracts from this latest piece of 
     <lb/>Commission propaganda. The opening lines read 
     <lb/>as follows: "In 1933 financial difficulties com<lb break="no"/>bined with the economic effects of a world-wide 
     <lb/>depression led the Newfoundland Government to 
     <lb/>approach the United Kingdom for assistance." 
     <lb/>These are just the first four lines of this report, 
     <lb/>but let us see how true a picture they represent. 1 
     <lb/>call your attention to the words, "financial dif~ 
     <lb/>ficulties compelled us to ask for assistance." It 
     <lb/>fails to explain that the real assistance we asked 
     <lb/>for was bluntly refused. That a gun was put to our 
     <lb/>heads, the demand that we first commit political 
     <lb/>suicide before any assistance would be forthcom<lb break="no"/>ing. The report also conveniently fails to state the 
     <lb/>simple facts: that we would never have been in 
     <lb/>financial difficulties at all, but for the extraordi<lb break="no"/>nary sacrifices made by our, what they term back<lb break="no"/>ward people and corrupt politicians, when they 
     <lb/>voluntarily sacrificed our national credit to the 
     <lb/>tune of $40 million as our contribution towards 
     <lb/>the winning of World War I. It would therefore 
     <lb/>follow that, in 1933, our normal debt would have 
     <lb/>only been $60 million and this after 78 years of 
     <lb/>strenuous national existence. Would this indicate 
     <lb/>our inefficiency in handling our affairs? Does this 
     <lb/>show incapacity on the part of our public men as 
     <lb/>the Amulree Report recklessly states? This report 
     <lb/>does not even hint that, in 1933, the obvious and 
     <lb/>proper course for Newfoundland to follow under 
     <lb/>the circumstances was some form of default. In 
     <lb/>support of this I quote briefly from an authorita<lb break="no"/>tive statement made by A.F.W. Plumptre, of the 
     <lb/>University of Toronto, and published in the 
     <lb/><hi rendition="simple:italic">Canadian Journal of Economics and Political 
     <lb/>Science.</hi><ref target="#fn_05">[4]</ref> Mr. Plumptre states that on June 15 
     <lb/>1933, the British government actually paid $10

     million to the United States instead of 
     <lb/>
     $75,950,000 which her bond called for, and this 
     <lb/>
     therefore amounted to default on the part of Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain herself. Commenting on} the New<lb break="no"/>foundland situation Mr. Plumptre says, "It ap<lb break="no"/>pears on the evidence of the Report (meaning the 
     <lb/>
     Amulree Report) that Newfoundland had an 
     <lb/>
     incontrovertible case for honourable default â a 
     <lb/>
     case which was even stronger in its economic 
     <lb/>
     aspect than that of Great Britain a few months 
     <lb/>
     earlier." But Newfoundland was not allowed to 
     <lb/>
     take advantage of such a course because of the 
     <lb/>
     efforts of a combine consisting of the British 
     <lb/>
     government, the Canadian bankers and our own 
     <lb/>
     prime minister at that time. The report says that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland was led to ask for assistance from 
     <lb/>
     the United Kingdom. I contend the word "led" is 
     <lb/>
     not accurate. It should rather read we were mer<lb break="no"/>cilessly dragged and driven into the pit prepared 
     <lb/>
     for us. And above all in its significance, this 
     <lb/>
     report completely ignores the fact that the Alder<lb break="no"/>dice government with whom they were dealing 
     <lb/>
     was acting in callous violation of its election 
     <lb/>
     pledges; that the whole thing was dripping with 
     <lb/>
     treachery and broken faith, and that the British 
     <lb/>
     government was fully aware that it was dealing 
     <lb/>
     with leaders who had been traitors to their 
     <lb/>
     country and who were agents acting without any 
     <lb/>
     legal authority. And it is from reports of this kind 
     <lb/>
     that they apparently expect us to base the discus<lb break="no"/>sions of this Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let me give you just one more example. The 
     <lb/>
     second paragraph of the report begins in this 
     <lb/>
     fashion: "The Commission has now been in of<lb break="no"/>fice for twelve years. During the first half of that 
     <lb/>
     period the Island was in financial difficulties." In 
     <lb/>
     these few words the report condemns itself. We 
     <lb/>
     were supposed to surrender our political freedom 
     <lb/>
     on the clear understanding that our financial dif<lb break="no"/>ficulties would be removed. That was both the 
     <lb/>
     word and the spirit of the negotiations between 
     <lb/>
     our government and the British government, and 
     <lb/>
     what happens. This report coolly admits that after 
     <lb/>
     faithfully performing our part of the agreement 
     <lb/>
     and sacrificing our national honour we were 
     <lb/>
     simply left to bow deeper under worse financial 
     <lb/>
     difficulties for six whole years. That instead of 
     <lb/>
     keeping their agreement, they led us into a valley 
     <lb/>
     of poverty and misery, which condemned 70,000 
     <lb/>
     of our people to the whiplash of dole, and caused 
     <lb/>
     us to experience a period of national suffering 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
          
     never equalled in the entire life of our country. 
     <lb/>
     These two instances are not simply isolated ex<lb break="no"/>amples showing the misleading and unreliable 
     <lb/>
     nature of these reports, they are representative of 
     <lb/>
     their entire content. The examples I have given, 
     <lb/>
     show that in our deliberations we must not allow 
     <lb/>
     ourselves to be influenced by writings which are 
     <lb/>
     neither accurate, impartial nor comprehensive. 
     <lb/>
     Nor can we wisely accept the opinions of those 
     <lb/>
     whose first duty is to protect the interests and 
     <lb/>
     carry out the set policies of their masters in the 
     <lb/>
     Dominions Office. No man can serve two 
     <lb/>
     masters, and no reports made by the agents of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominions Office can be expected to give us the 
     <lb/>
     information or the guidance we require to enable 
     <lb/>
     us to solve the problems before us. It is my belief 
     <lb/>
     that the first duty of this assembly is the removal 
     <lb/>
     of that veil of secrecy which has for over 12 years 
     <lb/>
     enshrouded the political history of our country - <lb/> to bring in to the light of day, the things which 
     <lb/>
     have so long been hidden in darkness. To give the 
     <lb/>
     people of the entire country a full, clear, honest 
     <lb/>
     picture of things as they really are.

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Chairman</persName>, I shall have some further <lb/> remarks to make
                  in connection with the subject <lb/> matter of this report when it is received by
                  the <lb/> Convention and upon the furnishing of the infor<lb break="no"/>mation
                  which I have requested from the various <lb/> departments of government. What I
                  have said so <lb/> far represents the spirit in which I formally move <lb/> that
                  this report be received. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:FUDG1">Mr. Fudge</persName> I second that motion. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:NEWE1">Mr. Newell</persName> Mr. Chairman, some of us junior <lb/> members of
                  this Convention have hitherto re<lb break="no"/>frained from imparting our
                  accumulated wisdom <lb/> whilst matters apparently of great moment were <lb/>
                  being discussed. We have felt, at least I have, that <lb/> such things as
                  procedure and rules could best be <lb/> dealt with by older and more experienced
                  hands. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     I should like to quote from our terms of refer<lb break="no"/>ence. "It shall be the duty and function of the 
     <lb/>
     Convention to consider and discuss among them<lb break="no"/>selves as elected representatives of the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland the changes that have taken place 
     <lb/>
     in the financial and economic situation of the 
     <lb/>
     island since 1934." That is a clear enough man<lb break="no"/>date, and indicates what should be the starting 
     <lb/>
     point of our deliberations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For my part, I am much more concerned about 
     <lb/>
     how the people of this country are going to eat 
     <lb/>
     during the next 50 years than with how they are 
     <lb/>

     going to vote; and I believe, furthermore, that that 
     <lb/>
     was the thought of the people who sent me here. 
     <lb/>
     I have hesitated to mention such a mundane affair 
     <lb/>
     as eating hitherto, because our discussions have 
     <lb/>
     been of a somewhat exalted nature, concerned 
     <lb/>
     with such things as rights and wrongs; but I don't 
     <lb/>
     think the question can belong avoided. I hold it 
     <lb/>
     true that political independence is based on 
     <lb/>
     economic independence. We had a form of politi<lb break="no"/>cal independence in this country for many years. 
     <lb/>
     When we lost our economic independence our 
     <lb/>
     political independence went too. Should we not 
     <lb/>
     learn something from our own history, and make 
     <lb/>
     sure that we are not to be faced with a similar 
     <lb/>
     situation? The economic independence of our 
     <lb/>
     country is in turn dependent on the economic 
     <lb/>
     independence of the people who compose it. If a 
     <lb/>
     man is not economically independent, what 
     <lb/>
     freedom has he? He may vote in a free election 
     <lb/>
     for the candidate of his choice every two weeks 
     <lb/>
     or every two years; but if he isn't free to eat three 
     <lb/>
     times a day, I repeat, what freedom has he? What 
     <lb/>
     do I mean by economic independence, you ask? 
     <lb/>
     Just this. In a parody of the famous words of 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Micawber, annual income $1,000, annual 
     <lb/>
     expenditure $900 â result freedom. Annual in 
     <lb/>
     come $1,000, annual expenditure $1,100 - <lb/> result economic servitude. The man in this 
     <lb/>
     country who can look his neighbour in the face 
     <lb/>
     and tell him what's what is economically free, 
     <lb/>
     and if he hasn't got political freedom he'll soon 
     <lb/>
     start getting it. People who have money to spend 
     <lb/>
     are not afraid to assume their own respon<lb break="no"/>sibilities. Let us set our economic house in shape, 
     <lb/>
     let us have independent-minded men, and you 
     <lb/>
     and I can go home tomorrow. Let us fall short of 
     <lb/>
     that attainment and we may wrangle on here till 
     <lb/>
     doomsday. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are those who claim this country is 
     <lb/>
     self-supporting, and maybe it is. But I wonder 
     <lb/>
     whether they also assert that our economic sys<lb break="no"/>tem is fundamentally sound. When things are 
     <lb/>
     going well most of us fail to see the inherent 
     <lb/>
     weakness of the very system that is providing the 
     <lb/>
     monetary prosperity. Perhaps it is because we are 
     <lb/>
     too conservative in our thinking. We are extreme<lb break="no"/>ly careful how we handle a new idea. Get too 
     <lb/>
     many new ideas and someone might call you a 
     <lb/>
     radical, or even a socialist, or perhaps something 
     <lb/>
     even more wicked and staggering. Better to leave 
     <lb/>
          
   
         
     
  
           
            <cb/>
          
     things as they are than risk that. I suppose that is 
     <lb/>
     why we are still cranking the old Model T 
     <lb/>
     economic system that Cabot left us when he went 
     <lb/>
     back to claim his ten pounds. It's archaic. It's an 
     <lb/>
     anachronism. It's almost medieval. Certainly our 
     <lb/>
     economic setup has all the earmarks of the old 
     <lb/>
     feudal system, with its lords and villeins. Perhaps 
     <lb/>
     in our case the villains are the lords. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The war, which uprooted so many things, has 
     <lb/>
     failed to dislodge it. True, it increased the booty 
     <lb/>
     as far as we are concerned, but it did nothing to 
     <lb/>
     change the rules. Our economic system has not 
     <lb/>
     changed its fundamental character, except in 
     <lb/>
     spots, over the past 14 years. It hasn't changed in 
     <lb/>
     400 years. And bearing in mind always the extent 
     <lb/>
     to which we are dependent on changing condi<lb break="no"/>tions in the outside world, the fact remains that 
     <lb/>
     our economic setup is not conducive to individual 
     <lb/>
     freedom. And I hope, Mr. Chairman, that in put<lb break="no"/>ting it so mildly I have not obscured the fact. If 
     <lb/>
     you want something specific to argue about take 
     <lb/>
     our credit system, our barter trade, our individual 
     <lb/>
     control of credit, with all their attendant evils and 
     <lb/>
     inconvenience both to business and the in<lb break="no"/>dividuals. Sentiment is a grand thing, particularly 
     <lb/>
     on holidays and Sundays. But in our workaday 
     <lb/>
     world we must be guided by hard practical con<lb break="no"/>siderations and for us at the moment that means 
     <lb/>
     economic considerations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I come from a district that is a bit remote from 
     <lb/>
     the centre of things, far removed from the politi<lb break="no"/>cal arena. But we are concerned about the future 
     <lb/>
     of this country, and desperately anxious to do the 
     <lb/>
     right thing. I have received letters from con<lb break="no"/>stituents expressing the hope that this Convention 
     <lb/>
     would produce the information necessary, and 
     <lb/>
     not presently available to them, to enable them to 
     <lb/>
     make a wise decision. We want all the facts, 
     <lb/>
     economic and otherwise. And we want the widest 
     <lb/>
     possible freedom of choice. We would resent any 
     <lb/>
     attempt to limit the choice of this freely elected 
     <lb/>
     assembly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To return to the importance of economic con<lb break="no"/>siderations, and taking one case in point. Yester<lb break="no"/>day I gave notice of a question about public 
     <lb/>
     health. I am particularly interested in the subject 
     <lb/>
     because I work with an outfit<ref target="#fn_06">[1]</ref> that is up to its neck 
     <lb/>
     in a fight against such things as TB and beri-beri. 
     <lb/>
     Beri-beri, is a by-product of malnutrition, a 
     <lb/>
     prevalent disease in certain parts of this country 
     <lb/>

     (as also in China, I believe), and in many cases it 
     <lb/>
     is recurrent. It is a product of a wretched 
     <lb/>
     economic environment. We patch up the wrecked 
     <lb/>
     body as best we may and send it back to that 
     <lb/>
     environment. Is our work particularly construc<lb break="no"/>tive, would you say? Wouldn't it be more con<lb break="no"/>structive to go after that economic environment 
     <lb/>
     and change it too? Meanwhile, whilst we are 
     <lb/>
     treating the patient there is one less producer at 
     <lb/>
     work; and the economy of the country suffers 
     <lb/>
     thereby â two ways. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Our government is spending considerable 
     <lb/>
     money on public health. It needs to spend much 
     <lb/>
     more. But where are we going to get it? We need 
     <lb/>
     more hospitals, more nursing services, more doc<lb break="no"/>tors in public health work. How are they going to 
     <lb/>
     be paid for in normal times? I don't know. But 
     <lb/>
     before I start shouting for any particular form or 
     <lb/>
     forms of government, I want to know. If the 
     <lb/>
     Convention can find an answer to questions like 
     <lb/>
     that, it will have achieved something of per<lb break="no"/>manent value. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is an open question how far any government 
     <lb/>
     can be held accountable for economic prosperity. 
     <lb/>
     Personally, I think the matter goes deeper than a 
     <lb/>
     question of constitutions. It goes to the very roots 
     <lb/>
     of such organised society as we have. But you 
     <lb/>
     cannot have political democracy, as far as I am 
     <lb/>
     concerned, without individual economic 
     <lb/>
     freedom. Meanwhile, we are here to discuss 
     <lb/>
     among ourselves what changes have taken place 
     <lb/>
     in the financial and economic situation since 
     <lb/>
     1934. Let us drop the oratory and get on with it. 
     <lb/></p>

<p>
                  <persName ref="pers:KEOU1">Mr. Keough</persName> Mr. Chairman, we are gathered <lb/> here at a most
                  solemn moment for Newfound<lb break="no"/>land. It is a moment every bit as solemn
                  as the <lb/> first moment of discovery. It is a moment every <lb/> bit as solemn
                  as that when Newfoundlanders first <lb/> congregated in responsible government.
                  For this <lb/> is the time of decision as to whether this land we <lb/> live in
                  can support a community of civilised men <lb/> in such fashion as civilised men
                  expect to be <lb/> supported in this mid-20th century. We must <lb/> make as
                  accurate an estimate as may be possible <lb/> of our capacity to be sufficient
                  unto ourselves, <lb/> and having done so, say whether or not we think <lb/> we can
                  fuse the economics that we must live by, <lb/> and such genius for the political
                  as may be ours, <lb/> into a satisfactory social and political order. It is <lb/>
                  of utmost importance that we should not err in <lb/> our estimate of what the
                  national economy will <lb/>
                  <cb/> support. For if we err in that. then shall we defeat <lb/> our whole
                  purpose. It was that thought which has <lb/> led me to wonder if the holding of
                  this Conven<lb break="no"/>tion at this time is not a bit premature. I am not at
                  <lb/> all so certain that this is such a happy moment to <lb/> have to decide what
                  we must now decide. In some <lb/> future year the world would have had time to
                  stop <lb/> vibrating and the post-war pattern of life would <lb/> have become
                  distinct. We could then better judge <lb/> to what extent we could be sufficient
                  unto oursel<lb break="no"/>ves. Five years from now would be a much better <lb/>
                  time to determine whether we will still be able to <lb/> balance our national
                  budget, and what is still <lb/> more important, whether that last forgotten <lb/>
                  fisherman out on the bill of Cape St. George, or <lb/> down on the bill of Cape
                  Norman will still be able <lb/> to balance his budget five years from now. That
                  <lb/> for me is the ultimate test. The Commissioner for <lb/> Finance or the
                  Minister for Finance, whichever it <lb/> might be, might well go on balancing the
                  national <lb/> budget from now till doomsday but the same <lb/> would be no real
                  indication of a satisfactory <lb/> national economy if there were still those who
                  did <lb/> not eat. For me what matters is not so much <lb/> budget surpluses, as
                  that none should have to <lb/> tighten his belt. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     However, that which we must decide must be 
     <lb/>
     decided not later than in the days of the forthcom<lb break="no"/>ing national referendum. It is going to be most 
     <lb/>
     unfortunate for Newfoundland if too many 
     <lb/>
     people get delusions of grandeur about what we 
     <lb/>
     are ready for in governments, and insist upon our 
     <lb/>
     biting off more than we can chew. A year or so 
     <lb/>
     ago I would have said that there was great danger 
     <lb/>
     of that very thing happening, for quite a number 
     <lb/>
     of people seemed to think that we were ready for 
     <lb/>
     almost anything in government. In the meantime 
     <lb/>
     many have retreated from that position and are 
     <lb/>
     now quite content, indeed are now quite insistent, 
     <lb/>
     that this Convention should give precedence of 
     <lb/>
     consideration to the economic over the consti<lb break="no"/>tutional. This is, of course, as it should be. Once 
     <lb/>
     this Convention can come to see somewhat clear<lb break="no"/>ly the probable shape of economic things to 
     <lb/>
     come, once we can determine wherein there has 
     <lb/>
     been permanent change in the economic and 
     <lb/>
     financial stmcture of this island, then will our 
     <lb/>
     task be greatly simplified. However, how to see 
     <lb/>
     through the still effective economic distortions of 
     <lb/>
     war to permanent change without the benefit of 
     <lb/>
     a certain minimum of relevant statistics will not 
     <lb/>

     be easy. This difficulty was specifically admitted 
     <lb/>
     in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Report on the Financial and Economic 
     <lb/>
     Condition of Newfoundland</hi> prepared for the 
     <lb/>
     members of this Convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was most encouraging to see that the Con<lb break="no"/>vention did apply itself in the first instance to 
     <lb/>
     consideration of the economic. I must confess to 
     <lb/>
     some misgivings at the beginning as to whether 
     <lb/>
     there would be some young men or some elder 
     <lb/>
     statesmen in a constitutional hurry, who would 
     <lb/>
     want to get over the economic hurdle in a hurry 
     <lb/>
     by ignoring it. I was happy to see matters did not 
     <lb/>
     go so. There is much talk today, much question<lb break="no"/>ing of whether or not we are self-supporting. A 
     <lb/>
     year of so ago I would have said that there was 
     <lb/>
     much surety of that. There seemed to be much 
     <lb/>
     surety, too, that the war had brought to us a great 
     <lb/>
     prosperity. All that wild talk of the great 
     <lb/>
     prosperity the war brought us was, as far as I am 
     <lb/>
     concerned, just so much unmitigated rot. It was 
     <lb/>
     not prosperity, if by prosperity you mean full and 
     <lb/>
     plenty, and some left over that could be put aside. 
     <lb/>
     In most cases where there was anything to spare 
     <lb/>
     it had to go to take up the slack, to replace and to 
     <lb/>
     restore what had rusted and rotted away in the 
     <lb/>
     years the locusts ate. All that came of the war jobs 
     <lb/>
     and dollars was that a few more Newfound<lb break="no"/>landers than ever before came a little closer than 
     <lb/>
     ever before to achieving a decent standard of 
     <lb/>
     living. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is encouraging to see today this great con<lb break="no"/>cern with the question of self-support; and, that, 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, is a question upon which we must be 
     <lb/>
     as absolutely certain, one way or the other, as it 
     <lb/>
     is humanly possible to be before we go on to the 
     <lb/>
     constitutional issue. On making answer we shall 
     <lb/>
     have this in our favour that, I feel sure, no man 
     <lb/>
     here present thinks that the mere balancing of the 
     <lb/>
     national budget is indicative of a condition of 
     <lb/>
     self-support. To my mind, a surer measure of the 
     <lb/>
     extent to which we are self-supporting is the 
     <lb/>
     individuals' ability to balance his budget and 
     <lb/>
     have something to spare. This is the acid test, is 
     <lb/>
     every man who makes an honest effort to make a 
     <lb/>
     living able to make a decent living, and will he 
     <lb/>
     still be able to do so when conditions are no 
     <lb/>
     longer abnormal? And if you say to me that is 
     <lb/>
     taking an extreme view, I shall have to ask you 
     <lb/>
     just what men you are going to require to be 
     <lb/>
     satisfied with just how much less? I am quite 
     <lb/>
     prepared to admit that we live in a sparse and an 
     <lb/>
     
            <cb/>
           
     austere land. It yields a meagre, grey, ascetic 
     <lb/>
     existence, and that but unwillingly. I am prepared 
     <lb/>
     to agree that perhaps we cannot expect for our 
     <lb/>
     people the largesse and elaborate standards en<lb break="no"/>joyed by people richer in natural resources and 
     <lb/>
     accumulated capital. But there is a certain mini<lb break="no"/>mum standard of living consistent with human 
     <lb/>
     dignity. There is a little matter of three square 
     <lb/>
     meals a day, and a decent suit of clothes on the 
     <lb/>
     back, and a roof that doesn't leak over the head 
     <lb/>
     We cannot be satisfied in conscience with less 
     <lb/>
     than that minimum. And if you say that any 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlander should have to be so satisfied, 
     <lb/>
     then again I shall have to ask just what men you 
     <lb/>
     are going to require to be satisfied with just how 
     <lb/>
     much less. I know you are not going to tell me 
     <lb/>
     that we must be so satisfied. And I feel that you 
     <lb/>
     will be much concerned that matters shall be so 
     <lb/>
     resolved that in this island that latter question will 
     <lb/>
     never have to be asked. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is not for me to seek to forecast what will 
     <lb/>
     come of our efforts and after our efforts, but I 
     <lb/>
     have high hopes that when our work is finished 
     <lb/>
     and the ultimate decision taken, we in this island 
     <lb/>
     shall come to know more spacious days than we 
     <lb/>
     have ever known, and that to our children after 
     <lb/>
     us, and to their children after them, it will be 
     <lb/>
     given to walk the ways of a more prosperous land 
     <lb/>
     in happiness, peace, and dignity. 
     <lb/>

                  <fw type="dateline">September 1946</fw> around. That is the voice that is going to
                  be heard <lb/> in this Convention. They are not alone in that <lb/> viewpoint,
                  they will be joined by a few here in <lb/> this Convention. I have no doubt
                  whatever that <lb/> efforts will be made, honest and sincere, even if <lb/>
                  mistaken, to keep the discussion on political and <lb/> constitutional lines, and
                  it is not going to be done. <lb/> There are bigger things than politics and
                     constitu<lb break="no"/>tions to be decided in this Convention, before <lb/>
                  ever we come around to the type or form of <lb/> government. I should imagine that
                  for the next <lb/> three months that will be the matter with which <lb/> the
                  Convention will be fully occupied, and before <lb/> we come to a discussion of
                  constitutionality and <lb/> the rest, I would like to put myself on record on
                  <lb/> a matter with which Major Cashin has dealt at <lb/> least briefly here this
                  afternoon. Major Cashin <lb/> has said that he condemns the motives that in<lb break="no"/>spired the creation of this Convention I want to <lb/> say, Mr.
                  Chairman, that in my view the whole <lb/> idea, the whole conception of the recent
                  National <lb/> Convention election, of this Convention, of the <lb/> national
                  referendum to follow, constitute in the <lb/> aggregate the most thorough
                  democratic proce<lb break="no"/>dure in the entire political history of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. I see in it nothing sinister. I see in it <lb/> no
                  attempt whatever to railroad this people or this <lb/> Convention. I see nothing
                  suspicious in his <lb/> presence and appointment of Professor Wheare, <lb/> though
                  I heard it suggested on the air, that he, or <lb/> the person appointed in his
                  place, was to be a <lb/> Dominions Office dictator to come to New<lb break="no"/>foundland and dominate the Convention so that <lb/> the delegates elected would
                  be merely puppets in <lb/> his hand. I see no evidence of it, and I do not <lb/>
                  believe for a moment that was the intention. Let <lb/> us look at it for a moment.
                  There are five docu<lb break="no"/>ments relative to the whole political situation
                  - <lb/> the Amulree Report, the British government <lb/> white paper, the joint
                  address of the legislature of <lb/> Newfoundland, the act of Parliament, and the
                  <lb/> letters patent. If I am not mistaken, there is a <lb/> phrase in identical
                  language in all five documents <lb/> to the effect that responsible government
                  would <lb/> be restored to Newfoundland when New<lb break="no"/>foundland became
                  self-supporting again, and <lb/> upon request of the people. It is therefore very
                  <lb/> clear that a contract was indeed set up between <lb/> the Parliament of
                  Britain and the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and the contract laid it
                  down that <lb/> when two conditions were met responsible <lb/>
                  <cb/> government would be restored to this country: the <lb/> first, that
                  Newfoundland should be self-support<lb break="no"/>ing again, the second that the
                  Newfoundland <lb/> people should request it. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     At most, and then taking merely a very super<lb break="no"/>ficial view, we can say today that Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     is self-supporting and that the first of the two 
     <lb/>
     conditions has been met. The Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     people have never requested the return of respon<lb break="no"/>sible government to this moment. It is true that 
     <lb/>
     here and there an association, a businessmen's 
     <lb/>
     organisation, a public meeting, a group isolated, 
     <lb/>
     scattered, constituting in the aggregate only a tiny 
     <lb/>
     fraction of the Newfoundland people, have 
     <lb/>
     passed resolutions that they would like respon<lb break="no"/>sible government restored. But the people have 
     <lb/>
     not requested the return of responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Up to this moment where has the 
     <lb/>
     Dominions Office, the Parliament of Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain, or the government of Great Britain vio<lb break="no"/>lated a contract established? Have they been 
     <lb/>
     asked that they do it? They have not. If, tomorrow 
     <lb/>
     morning or afternoon, any member of this Con<lb break="no"/>vention stood in his place and moved that we 
     <lb/>
     recommend to the government of the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom, or to the Secretary of State for the 
     <lb/>
     Dominions, the restoration of responsible 
     <lb/>
     government, and the motion is seconded and 
     <lb/>
     voted on and carried ... we have not an iota of 
     <lb/>
     evidence to lead us to assume that that request 
     <lb/>
     would be refused. Despite accusations of malig<lb break="no"/>nancy, despite suggestions of nefarious purpose, 
     <lb/>
     we have not the slightest evidence that a request 
     <lb/>
     of this Convention to the government of the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom for the restoration of respon~ 
     <lb/>
     sible government would be refused by them in 
     <lb/>
     the sense that they would refuse to submit it to 
     <lb/>
     the people of Newfoundland. Remember we are 
     <lb/>
     not the people of Newfoundland, and even our 
     <lb/>
     unanimous asking for the restoration of respon<lb break="no"/>sible government does not make it the request of 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland people. Mr. Chairman, that 
     <lb/>
     right of the people to request the restoration of 
     <lb/>
     responsible government has not been removed, it 
     <lb/>
     is still here in the national referendum, the par<lb break="no"/>ticular machinery which has been set up through 
     <lb/>
     which the people can express any wish.... Now, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, if the right of the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     people to request a return of responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment stands and is still here, where is the lack of 
     <lb/>
     democracy in the whole situation? Not only do 
     <lb/>

     we retain as a people the right to request respon<lb break="no"/>sible government, we have gone further, our right 
     <lb/>
     to request anything has been specifically recog<lb break="no"/>nised. In other words today this Convention can 
     <lb/>
     recommend through the British government to 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland people anything it likes.... 
     <lb/>
     Now where is there anything undemocratic? I am 
     <lb/>
     rather intimately familiar with government in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland from the year 1919 to the last day 
     <lb/>
     we had it, by reading and by studying, familiar 
     <lb/>
     with every govemment and every type of govern<lb break="no"/>ment since the first in its history.... I resent this as 
     <lb/>
     a Newfoundlander, I resent the suggestion that 
     <lb/>
     this Convention is rigged, that it is a bluff and a 
     <lb/>
     camouflage, which involves all of us in the pos<lb break="no"/>sibility of being a pack of fools. It is an insult to 
     <lb/>
     the intelligence of every Newfoundland man and 
     <lb/>
     woman who cast a vote on June 21, an insult to 
     <lb/>
     every man who stood as a candidate....

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:HILL2">Mr. Hillier</persName> Mr. Chairman, I have not spoken <lb/> since the
                  opening of the Convention, but I would <lb/> not be satisfied were I to leave this
                  room this <lb/> evening without endorsing the remarks of my <lb/> friends from
                  White Bay and St. George's. They <lb/> voice completely my sentiments and the
                     senti<lb break="no"/>ments of the district from which I come, and I feel <lb/>
                  they are voicing the feelings of the New<lb break="no"/>foundland people. The
                  great thing that worries <lb/> many of our people is not so much the form of <lb/>
                  government we set up, it is the fact of being able <lb/> to maintain their
                  families and give them decent <lb/> meals and clothing. We are very largely
                     fisher<lb break="no"/>men. I know all about the life and business and <lb/>
                  profits of fishermen. I have lived in many places <lb/> in this country and have
                  seen the hardships they <lb/> undergo I lived through the dole period, and I <lb/>
                  hope we shall never again return to that state. I <lb/> don't think there is
                  anybody who knows better <lb/> than I do the fight they have from day to day to
                  <lb/> maintain their families.... They said to me before <lb/> going out, "Play
                  your part to the best of your <lb/> ability and in the best interests of the whole
                  of <lb/> Newfoundland." I am not partial, my interest <lb/> extends very far
                  beyond my own district, to New<lb break="no"/>foundland as a whole. As my friends
                  remarked, <lb/> the economic standard of the individual is very <lb/> important;
                  how can the country be economically <lb/> sound if the individual is the other way
                  about? <lb/>
               </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BURR2">Mr. Burry</persName> Mr. Chairman, I stand this afternoon <lb/>very shaky,
                  being one of the junior members of <lb/>this Convention, but I wish to express
                  myself in <lb/>
                  <cb/> a few words. I come from the most northerly <lb/> district of this
                  Convention, one that has gone <lb/> through years of great strain and stress.
                  <lb/> Labradorians as a people are hard-working in the <lb/> great majority of
                  cases, and they deserve a good <lb/> living, a living they have not had. They have
                  sent <lb/> me in to see that they get a government that gives <lb/> them a decent
                  living. They are not concerned with <lb/> constitutional government, but with a
                     govern<lb break="no"/>ment that will give them a decent living for the <lb/>
                  labour they put into their work I want to put <lb/> myself on record that I am
                  very heartily in favour <lb/> of the last three or four men who spoke so forcib<lb break="no"/>ly. I must congratulate them on their very fine <lb/> orations, and
                  hope that out of this Convention <lb/> will come some kind of government that will
                  give <lb/> our people in Newfoundland and Labrador a <lb/> decent living. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:BROW7">Mr. Brown</persName> Mr. Chairman, I have listened to so <lb/> much
                  oratory here this afternoon that I don't <lb/> know if it is wise to speak at this
                  time or not.... I <lb/> have no prepared speech, Mr. Chairman, but I <lb/> have
                  listened quite attentively to all that has been <lb/> said. I have for many years
                  in this house listened <lb/> to oratory, as you have yourself, sir, both as <lb/>
                  member and Speaker. Some of that oratory was <lb/> wise words, some was dam
                  foolishness. I have <lb/> heard more about government and Commission <lb/> of
                  Government in the city of St. John's than I <lb/> have heard in the north of the
                  country for two <lb/> years. I wish it distinctly understood that as one <lb/> who
                  voted out responsible government (and I am <lb/> the only one in this house, and I
                  am not ashamed <lb/> of it) I have yet to find the man who could tell me <lb/>
                  what better thing could have been done at that <lb/> time when the country was on
                  its uppers. What <lb/> happened in 1930? One afternoon I had in my <lb/>
                  possession $35,000 to the credit of my district. <lb/> The next morning there was
                  not a cent. No mem<lb break="no"/>ber of any district handled his own money in
                  cash. <lb/> What he did was make out a requisition and send <lb/> it to the
                  government departments and had them <lb/> send outenough money to build a wharf,
                  or a road <lb/> or something. There was a reason for that. In 1932 <lb/> when we
                  came back as a legislative body we <lb/> found the country could not get along.
                  Our in<lb break="no"/>come could not meet our expenditures, and it <lb/> boiled
                  down to the question of giving up respon<lb break="no"/>sible government and
                  letting Commission of <lb/> Government come in, or letting 70,000 people, <lb/>
                  men, women and children in this country starve <lb/>

                  <fw type="dateline">September 1946</fw> throughout that winter. As one who
                  represented <lb/> labour for many years I would never be one who <lb/> would cast
                  my vote to let 70,000 starve. I agree <lb/> with my honourable friends Mr. Newell
                  and <lb/> Mr. Keough, but I am interested today, as a rep<lb break="no"/>resentative of the people, in the question of how <lb/> we are going to get
                  three meals a day for oursel<lb break="no"/>ves and our families. We must not
                  forget that <lb/> while the Commission of Government have <lb/> made mistakes they
                  have done some good things <lb/> as well. I wish it to be distinctly understood
                  that <lb/> I don't like Commission of Government, al<lb break="no"/>though I
                  helped bring it in. I would rather see <lb/> responsible government or some other
                  form of <lb/> government if this country could afford it. I came <lb/> to this
                  Convention with an open mind and no <lb/> preconceived ideas. I told my supporters
                  that it <lb/> was useless to ask me what form of government <lb/> I wanted. I
                  said, "I don't know, I must first go <lb/> there, and after every form of
                  government is <lb/> examined then, and only then, will I be in a <lb/> position to
                  cast my vote for what form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment I think is best for the
                  people of this country." <lb/> And the form of government that is best for the
                  <lb/> people of this country is best for me and what I <lb/> represent. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
     Now, some may be running away with the idea 
     <lb/>
     that all this country is down on Commission of 
     <lb/>
     Government. That is not correct. I think that if 
     <lb/>
     there was a vote taken among the fishermen, you 
     <lb/>
     would find 85% of them for it. This is the only 
     <lb/>
     form of government that ever did anything for the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen... I just bring back to your memories 
     <lb/>
     two or three years ago, when the government first 
     <lb/>
     announced the prices of codfish in the foreign 
     <lb/>
     markets. That was done, I think, as much through 
     <lb/>
     my influence and advice as through anybody's. I 
     <lb/>
     was after Mr. Dunn for two years to do that and, 
     <lb/>
     by the way, I feel that Mr. Dunn was the finest 
     <lb/>
     commissioner that has come here in the Natural 
     <lb/>
     Resources department â and the fishermen 
     <lb/>
     knew for the first time in the history of the New<lb break="no"/>foundland fishery that year and since, before they 
     <lb/>
     put a cod trap, or a trawl, or net or line in the 
     <lb/>
     water, what they were going to get for a quintal 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     of fish when it was taken out and dried. Take 
     <lb/>
     labour. The government created conciliation 
     <lb/>
     boards first. They created an arbitration board 
     <lb/>
     and gave labour a show, and I may say that I think 
     <lb/>
     that in eight out of ten cases that came before that 
     <lb/>
     board, labour got the benefit. Ask any of the 
     <lb/>
     clerks on Water Street. Labour today can thank 
     <lb/>
     the Commission of Government for that. Take 
     <lb/>
     public health, cottage hospitals, and other things 
     <lb/>
     carried through by the Commission of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. We must, if we are going to condemn any 
     <lb/>
     form of government, give credit where credit is 
     <lb/>
     due. The Commission of Government has, in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, done as much and more for the industry 
     <lb/>
     of the country than any government which has 
     <lb/>
     existed. As far as the government of today is 
     <lb/>
     concerned and the future government, sir, I have 
     <lb/>
     an open mind. After this Convention has got 
     <lb/>
     through its work and settled down to make some 
     <lb/>
     recommendations to the Dominions Office as to 
     <lb/>
     what forms of government are best for this 
     <lb/>
     country, then I will cast my vote according to the 
     <lb/>
     dictates of my conscience. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When the discussion was on in connection 
     <lb/>
     with Mr. Wild coming to address the Conven<lb break="no"/>tion, and the discussion lasted some time as to 
     <lb/>
     whether he would address the Convention as a 
     <lb/>
     committee of the whole with no outsiders, or in 
     <lb/>
     public with strangers in the gallery, I said I 
     <lb/>
     thought it was better not to cross our bridges until 
     <lb/>
     we came to them. I said that if Mr. Wild refused 
     <lb/>
     to give us information in public, then that was all 
     <lb/>
     we could do about it. Never kick a man until you 
     <lb/>
     have reason. One of the daily papers reported I 
     <lb/>
     said that if he refused to give us the information, 
     <lb/>
     it was time to jump on him. That gave a wrong 
     <lb/>
     impression. I do not think any members, myself 
     <lb/>
     included, are ready to jump on anybody's back. 
     <lb/>
     Every man should get a decent hearing, and never 
     <lb/>
     condemn a man until you have reason to con<lb break="no"/>demn. If Mr. Wild or any of the commissioners 
     <lb/>
     cross me I would not be afraid to tell them what 
     <lb/>
     I thought of them. The paper's statement was 
     <lb/>
     misleading and I ask that it be corrected.
