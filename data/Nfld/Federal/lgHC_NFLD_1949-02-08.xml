            <p><persName ref="pers:MACN2">Mr. John R. MacNicol</persName> (Davenport): Mr. 
     <lb/>Speaker, during the last fifteen years I have 
     <lb/>given a good deal of study to problems affect<lb break="no"/>ing Newfoundland; therefore I should like to 
     <lb/>add some comments to what has already been 
     <lb/>said with regard to the measure now before 
     <lb/>us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I wish to congratulate all four leaders upon 
     <lb/>the splendid addresses they delivered yester<lb break="no"/>day. I assume it is quite in order that I 
     <lb/>should say a special word about my own 
     <lb/>leader (Mr. Drew), who delivered an able and 
     <lb/>instructive address. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     I first became interested in the question of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland through a study of the history 
     <lb/>
     of the Newfoundland regiment which served 
     <lb/>
     in the war of 1812. This study took me on 
     <lb/>
     a trip of over a thousand miles, because the 
  

            <cb/>
         

     Newfoundland regiment travelled 2,500 miles 
     <lb/>
     before seeing action in this country in the first 
     <lb/>
     year of that war. The Royal Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     regiment was not large. The part of it which 
     <lb/>
     served in Canada at that time consisted of 
     <lb/>
     not more than fifty men, but they were fifty 
     <lb/>
     heroes. Having been born in Ontario I am 
     <lb/>
     proud of the part that regiment took in keep<lb break="no"/>ing Canada within the empire. I do not know 
     <lb/>
     what we would have done had they not come 
     <lb/>
     here at that time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Newfoundland regiment was brought 
     <lb/>
     here by General Brock. Before the war broke 
     <lb/>
     out, General Brock had been at Quebec city. 
     <lb/>
     Having come from the island of Guernsey, one 
     <lb/>
     of the Channel islands, the former home of 
     <lb/>
     many Newfoundlanders, General Brock 
     <lb/>
     desired a portion of the Newfoundland regi<lb break="no"/>ment to go with him to York, now called 
     <lb/>
     Toronto. This they did. Brock took them with 
     <lb/>
     him to what is now called Amherstburg, and 
     <lb/>
     they were not long there before they were in 
     <lb/>
     the thick of the fighting. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When Brock arrived before Detroit—or, as 
     <lb/>
     the English called the area at that time, the 
     <lb/>
     straits—he had with him about fifty of the 
     <lb/>
     Royal Newfoundland regiment. The euphon<lb break="no"/>ious French word, Detroit, has been applied 
     <lb/>
     to this place ever since. These fifty men 
     <lb/>
     participated in that great victory, the capture 
     <lb/>
     of Detroit, which helped Brock in the splendid 
     <lb/>
     work he did before his death. After that bat<lb break="no"/>tle, members of this regiment remained in 
     <lb/>
     the forces in that part of Canada, in what 
     <lb/>
     was then called the "right division." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have made an exhaustive study of this 
     <lb/>
     period in our history in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     work I am doing for the restoration of the 
     <lb/>
     site of Moraviantown, in Kent county—Mora<lb break="no"/>viantown was known in those days as Fair<lb break="no"/>field. The Royal Newfoundland regiment 
     <lb/>
     remained under Colonel Proctor in the "right 
     <lb/>
     division" and took part in the engagements 
     <lb/>
     on the Maumee. They fought up as far as 
     <lb/>
     Fort Wayne. They also took part in the 
     <lb/>
     attack by Proctor on Fort Meigs. I do not 
     <lb/>
     know whether they were at Fort Stevenson, 
     <lb/>
     Sandusky, but I presume they were. After 
     <lb/>
     the retreat of Proctor, the members of the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland regiment retreated with him. 
     <lb/>
     The majority of the party were taken prisoner 
     <lb/>
     east of the present city of Chatham when the 
     <lb/>
     boat in which they were ascending the 
     <lb/>
     Thames river was captured. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Later members of this regiment served in 
     <lb/>
     the vicinity of Toronto, then called York, and 
     <lb/>
     still later in the vicinity of Prescott in the 
     <lb/>
     attack on Ogdensburg. I shall not take the 
     <lb/>
     time of the house to enumerate all the points 
     <lb/>
     in which they served, but history records 
     <lb/>
     that on many fields a portion of the Royal 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland regiment did a major job in 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada and aided in preserving this 
     <lb/>
     part of Canada for the British empire. 
     <lb/>

 <p>
     In the pursuit of my inquiries I learned 
     <lb/>
     of course about the battle of Moraviantown— 
     <lb/>
     or, as it is called in American history, the 
     <lb/>
     battle of the Thames—which was fought on 
     <lb/>
     the 5th of October, .1813, about three miles 
     <lb/>
     east of the present town of Thamesville in 
     <lb/>
     Kent county. During the last ten years I 
     <lb/>
     have made extensive studies in that part of 
     <lb/>
     the country, because, Mr. Speaker, in 1950 we 
     <lb/>
     expect to hold an international commemora<lb break="no"/>tion service at the site of Moraviantown. We 
     <lb/>
     hope the President of. the United States will 
     <lb/>
     attend, along with the governors of the states 
     <lb/>
     of Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Michi<lb break="no"/>gan. At the battle of Moraviantown the 
     <lb/>
     governor of Michigan was present, Governor 
     <lb/>
     Cass. General Meigs, the governor of Ohio, 
     <lb/>
     was not on the battlefield, but was on his 
     <lb/>
     way there. Many of his troops served in 
     <lb/>
     that battle. Governor Shelby of Kentucky 
     <lb/>
     was on the field. I assume that the present 
     <lb/>
     governors of these states will attend the com<lb break="no"/>memoration service. The American com<lb break="no"/>manding general at that battle was General 
     <lb/>
     W. H. Harrison, who later became President 
     <lb/>
     of the United States. I expect that President 
     <lb/>
     Truman will attend this service next year; 
     <lb/>
     also the governor of Pennsylvania, from 
     <lb/>
     which state many of the soldiers came, as 
     <lb/>
     well as many of the citizens of Moraviantown. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     More than fifteen years ago, in the pursuit 
     <lb/>
     of the studies I was making, I decided to go 
     <lb/>
     to Newfoundland. While there I made an 
     <lb/>
     exhaustive survey of What will soon be our 
     <lb/>
     tenth province. The names of places in New<lb break="no"/>foundland are interesting, because the people 
     <lb/>
     are nearly all from the Channel islands, Ire<lb break="no"/>land, or England. Not many of them are 
     <lb/>
     from Scotland. Even in St. John's I could 
     <lb/>
     hardly find a church of my own persuasion 
     <lb/>
     to which I could go on Sunday, because there 
     <lb/>
     are few Scots on the island. Quite a number 
     <lb/>
     of the people there are from France, or from 
     <lb/>
     the northern provinces of Spain, called the 
     <lb/>
     Basque provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The names are beautiful. The first port at 
     <lb/>
     which one lands from Canada is Port aux 
     <lb/>
     Basques—one could hardly find a more attrac<lb break="no"/>tive name. Then there is a port called St. 
     <lb/>
     George, and as you go round the coast you 
     <lb/>
     come to a place called Curling. There is 
     <lb/>
     Corner Brook, in which the big paper mills 
     <lb/>
     are situated; and there is Twillingate, from 
     <lb/>
     which so many Newfoundlanders left to come 
     <lb/>
     to Canada. As I said yesterday, perhaps a 
     <lb/>
     thousand of them now live in the riding of 
     <lb/>
     Davenport. I am well acquainted with many 
     <lb/>
     of them and know of their splendid qualities, 
     <lb/>
     their fine character, their ability and their 
     <lb/>
     industry. Naturally I am pleased indeed that 
     <lb/>
     their homeland is to become a province of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I could mention other names, such as Grand 
     <lb/>
     Falls, Harbour Grace, Carbonear, Bay 
     <lb/>
     Roberts—I spent some time there; Brigus; 
    

            <cb/>

Ferryland, first settled by Lord Baltimore 
     <lb/>before he went to what is now the city of 
     <lb/>Baltimore in the United States. It is too bad 
     <lb/>he did not remain in Newfoundland; per<lb break="no"/>haps it would have been better for that 
     <lb/>country had he done so. All around the 
     <lb/>coast of Newfoundland you find these euphon<lb break="no"/>ious and beautiful names. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I made a thorough survey of the resources 
     <lb/>
     of the country, of which there are many. I 
     <lb/>
     was greatly interested in the iron mines, hav<lb break="no"/>ing been in the iron smelting business 
     <lb/>
     myself. Canada has bought from Newfound<lb break="no"/>land as many as several million tons a year 
     <lb/>
     of raw high-grade iron, all of which I believe 
     <lb/>
     went to the furnaces at Sydney, Nova Scotia. 
     <lb/>
     I hope it will continue to go there so that 
     <lb/>
     that great port in Nova Scotia may be kept 
     <lb/>
     prosperous. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     After my return home I read an article in 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Collier's</hi>, the issue of April 12, 1941, which 
     <lb/>
     argued that Newfoundland should become 
     <lb/>
     part of the United States. I always found 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland to be intensely British and 
     <lb/>
     intensely loyal to British institutions and 
     <lb/>
     traditions. It will be perhaps the most 
     <lb/>
     British province in Canada, and will be a 
     <lb/>
     welcome addition to that sentiment here. 
     <lb/>
     When I spoke on this matter in 1941 I quoted 
     <lb/>
     this paragraph from the article in Collier's 
     <lb/>
     to which I have referred: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     <lb/>
     Maybe they would never leave. Maybe presently

     they'd take the whole island over, ship the commis<lb break="no"/>sion of government back to England, build roads, 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     That possibility will exist no longer when 
     <lb/>
     the house passes this bill, as I know it will. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are one or two statements in this 
     <lb/>
     quotation of which we might take particular 
     <lb/>
     notice. One is "build roads." We must do 
     <lb/>
     that to help them out. I made a careful sur<lb break="no"/>vey in the south part of the island, and it 
     <lb/>
     struck me that we would have a golden 
     <lb/>
     opportunity to make the island happy by 
     <lb/>
     building a road directly through from St. 
     <lb/>
     John's to Port aux Basques. I do not believe 
     <lb/>
     you can now motor across the island at all. 
     <lb/>
     But if the road followed the railway it would 
     <lb/>
     have to run away up north from St. John's to 
     <lb/>
     Grand Falls and finally come to Port aux 
     <lb/>
     Basques, a distance of over five hundred 
     <lb/>
     miles. A road straight across from St. 
     <lb/>
     John's to Port aux Basques would shorten 
     <lb/>
     the distance to be traveled and would speed 
     <lb/>
     up transportation between the various parts 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland and St. John's, and from 
     <lb/>
     the Avalon peninsula to Canada. The con<lb break="no"/>struction of such a road is one thing we 
     <lb/>
     might well keep in mind. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We should welcome these people by doing 
     <lb/>
     everything we can to make them happy. As

 someone said yesterday, there may be differ<lb break="no"/>ences of opinion, but there are differences of 
     <lb/>opinion about many matters of importance, 
     <lb/>and I shall not worry about that. I like the 
     <lb/>remarks made by my leader in that regard. 
     <lb/>I thought he handled the subject effectively 
     <lb/>and satisfactorily, as did the hon. member for 
     <lb/>Cape Breton South (Mr. Gillis.) We have an 
     <lb/>opportunity to do something for these people, 
     <lb/>to make them happy after Newfoundland 
     <lb/>becomes part of the confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     In addition to the roadway I have sug<lb break="no"/>gested I would strongly recommend that we 
     <lb/>
     have a new boat for the service between 
     <lb/>
     North Sydney and Port aux Basques. The last 
     <lb/>
     time I went across the strait I remember that 
     <lb/>
     the boat was a small one. It was satisfactory; 
     <lb/>
     I have nothing but compliments for it, but a 
     <lb/>
     new boat should be constructed so that freight 
     <lb/>
     cars as well could be transported. The narrow 
     <lb/>
     gauge railway from Port aux Basques to 
     <lb/>
     St. John's should be widened to standard 
     <lb/>
     gauge. I realize that it would take some time 
     <lb/>
     to do this, but it would make the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland happy that they had come into 
     <lb/>
     union with Canada. It would result in a 
     <lb/>
     great deal of business to them and to us also. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let us consider Newfoundland as a tourist 
     <lb/>
     centre. We can say that every province in 
     <lb/>
     Canada is a magnificent tourist centre, and 
     <lb/>
     so it is. Newfoundland is a tourist's paradise. 
     <lb/>
     It has magnificent bays all around the island. 
     <lb/>
     As my leader said yesterday, when John 
     <lb/>
     Cabot and his son first reached Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
      they were so strongly impressed by what 
     <lb/>
     they saw that they called the place Bonavista, 
     <lb/>
     which means "beautiful view", and it certainly 
     <lb/>
     is a beautiful view. That name could be 
     <lb/>
     applied to any of the magnificent bays about 
     <lb/>
     the island. Then up in the north, at the 
     <lb/>
     centre of the island, as those who have been 
     <lb/>
     there know, for two hours before you arrive 
     <lb/>
     you see high projections or peaks which they 
     <lb/>
     call the Topsails. They are named the Fore<lb break="no"/>sail, the Mizzen Topsail, the Main Topsail and 
     <lb/>
     the Gaff Topsail. The view which they pre<lb break="no"/>sent is a topographical wonder, well worth 
     <lb/>
     anyone's trouble and expense to go to see; 
     <lb/>
     and so all over the island. It is a natural 
     <lb/>
     paradise. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Finally, Newfoundland has magnificent 
     <lb/>
     ores, one of which I have mentioned, iron. 
     <lb/>
     Iron ore from that country is the basis on 
     <lb/>
     which the fine city of Sydney has been built. 
     <lb/>
     I hope that every effort will be made to keep 
     <lb/>
     the Sydney plants in operation, using the iron 
     <lb/>
     ore which will now probably come in in 
     <lb/>
     larger quantities. It came in free of duty 
     <lb/>
     anyway. It is obtained at Bell island, not far 
     <lb/>
     from St. John's. I have been there. It is a 
     <lb/>
     very high grade ore, and a resource which 
     <lb/>
     can help to build up eastern Canada. We must 
     <lb/>
     do all we can to build up eastern Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
   
            <cb/>
            

<p>
     In the addition of seven representatives to 
     <lb/>
     the membership of the House of Commons, 
     <lb/>
     and six in the other place, the union of New<lb break="no"/>foundland with Canada will greatly strengthen 
     <lb/>
     the delegation from the maritime provinces. 
     <lb/>
     From the maritimes we now have twenty-six 
     <lb/>
     members in the House of Commons and 
     <lb/>
     twenty-four in the other place. The members 
     <lb/>
     and senators from Newfoundland will be a 
     <lb/>
     welcome addition to the strength of the mari<lb break="no"/>time delegation—and it cannot be too strong. 
     <lb/>
     If the electricity program I announced last 
     <lb/>
     year were carried out in its entirety, the 
     <lb/>
     delegation from there would be doubled. I 
     <lb/>
     am happy to say that at the conclusion of my 
     <lb/>
     speech in 1941 I said that the island would be 
     <lb/>
     entitled to seven members in the House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons and five in the other place. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am pleased at having had some small part 
     <lb/>
     in creating favourable sentiment towards 
     <lb/>
     union, both in Canada and in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     I have been given some credit for that in the 
     <lb/>
     press in Newfoundland. I created favour<lb break="no"/>able sentiment here, particularly through the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders in my own riding. I feel 
     <lb/>
     that I have had some small part in bringing 
     <lb/>
     about this sentiment in Canada, in relation 
     <lb/>
     to a project which has been mooted since 
     <lb/>
     1858, as the hon. member for Carleton (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Drew) said yesterday. I take a good deal 
     <lb/>
     of satisfaction in having had a small part in 
     <lb/>
     the creation of the feeling which has brought 
     <lb/>
     this grand climax to the whole program of 
     <lb/>
     the fathers of confederation, namely, the 
     <lb/>
     bringing in of Newfoundland to form the 
     <lb/>
     tenth province of Canada.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHUR1">Mr. T. L. Church</persName> (Broadview): Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     I was a member of the committee which con<lb break="no"/>sidered the Labrador case, and I took part in 
     <lb/>
     the debate regarding that important part of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. As hon. members know, 
     <lb/>
     Labrador was given to Newfoundland by a 
     <lb/>
     decision of the privy council. It had been 
     <lb/>
     under the protection of the British govern<lb break="no"/>ment, you might say; a governor had been 
     <lb/>
     appointed to the territory and Labrador was 
     <lb/>
     given to Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I wish to bring before the house the ques<lb break="no"/>tions which were before the committee at that 
     <lb/>
     time. First of all, according to Beauchesne's 
     <lb/>
     Parliamentary Rules and Forms:

            <fw type="dateline">FEBRUARY 8, 1949</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">Newfoundland</hi></fw> <fw type="num">329</fw>
  
     in my hand a copy of <hi rendition="simple:italic">Everybody's</hi> magazine, 
     <lb/>
     published by a great man in England, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Poke. In an article he refers to the present 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister. The article is a laudable 
     <lb/>
     one, which I approve. I knew the present 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister before he was a member of 
     <lb/>
     this house. I have always had a great admir<lb break="no"/>ation for him because of his many personal 
     <lb/>
     qualities, which have endeared him to a 
     <lb/>
     large number of people. In the city I come 
     <lb/>
     from he opened our winter fair, and he has 
     <lb/>
     been a welcome guest there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I also wish to refer to the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition (Mr. Drew) because I have known 
     <lb/>
     him longer than anyone else in the house has. 
     <lb/>
     I knew his father: I knew our leader as a 
     <lb/>
     student at the university of Toronto. I did not 
     <lb/>
     like the reception the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     met with here last Friday night, because he 
     <lb/>
     is a great Christian gentleman. He is a 
     <lb/>
     distinguished lawyer, and was an athlete. He 
     <lb/>
     is a kind-hearted man. I cannot speak too 
     <lb/>
     highly of the services which he gave to the 
     <lb/>
     glorious cause of education. I remember 
     <lb/>
     when he lived on Wellesley street. I lived 
     <lb/>
     around the corner from him, and he was a 
     <lb/>
     member of a great fraternity, D.K.E., oppos<lb break="no"/>ite the house where young Jack Copp, a 
     <lb/>
     varsity rugby player, was killed by a burglar 
     <lb/>
     a few years ago. I have always been a great 
     <lb/>
     admirer of the leader of the opposition and 
     <lb/>
     I am a strong supporter of his today. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I wish to say something about the 
     <lb/>
     merits of the proposed bill. I was a member 
     <lb/>
     of the house in 1941 when the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Davenport, the great traveler and dis<lb break="no"/>coverer, took a trip down there in the sum<lb break="no"/>mer of 1941. He made some discoveries about 
     <lb/>
     Labrador. The bill which was before us in 
     <lb/>
     1947 had to do with the Quebec, North Shore 
     <lb/>
     and Labrador railway. I was a member of 
     <lb/>
     the committee which dealt with that bill. 
     <lb/>
     Important matters came up in that connection. 
     <lb/>
     At that time we had no control over New<lb break="no"/>foundland. The sponsors of the bill were 
     <lb/>
     proposing to deal with the natural resources 
     <lb/>
     of Labrador and to build railways in contra<lb break="no"/>vention of the Railway Act. At that time we 
     <lb/>
     inserted a saving clause which read: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Provided that authority be obtained from New<lb break="no"/>foundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     That was a wise provision, because Labra<lb break="no"/>dor, I understand, is to have one member in 
     <lb/>
     the House of Commons and one senator. The 
     <lb/>
     final discussion on Labrador took place on 
     <lb/>
     April 25, 1947, and I shall quote from page 
     <lb/>
     2433 of <hi rendition="simple:italic">Hansard</hi> of that year. In connection 
     <lb/>
     with the bill many matters came up. The 
     <lb/>
     sponsors of the bill were asking for hotel ser<lb break="no"/>vices and railway services. At that time we 


            <cb/>

did not own the territory or the country. Here 
     <lb/>is a matter which I brought up at that time: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Another point I wish to make is that we are com<lb break="no"/>mitted to a 99-year lease on bases, from Newfound<lb break="no"/>land to British Guiana, between Britain and the 
     <lb/>
     United States. That lease was given with the con<lb break="no"/>sent of Canada. We have given to the United States 
     <lb/>
     leases on all the bases in the Atlantic ocean, includ<lb break="no"/>ing some on the shores of Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     Labrador. The bases are not all out in the ocean, 
     <lb/>
     because some are on Greenland. Iceland and other 
     <lb/>
     places in the north country, including Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     and Labrador, the territory under the joint defence 
     <lb/>
     board and the atomic board. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     This proposed agreement is ultra vires of the 
     <lb/>
     dominion. At the end of the bill it is brought under 
     <lb/>
     the Railway Act by saying that it is declared to be 
     <lb/>
     for the general advantage of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     We did not have the power in the House 
     <lb/>
     of Commons at that time to sanction the 
     <lb/>
     Labrador bill. But this lease for ninety-nine 
     <lb/>
     years was practically a freehold. They were 
     <lb/>
     urging that the Newfoundland and Labrador 
     <lb/>
     bases be given to the United States, although 
     <lb/>
     the lease for ninety-nine years was to protect 
     <lb/>
     United States shores. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I believe the government of Canada, the 
     <lb/>
     provincial governments and Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     would be well advised to seek the co<lb break="no"/>operation of Britain and the United States 
     <lb/>
     in having that lease cancelled and charged 
     <lb/>
     up to lend-lease. In the darkest hours of 
     <lb/>
     the war, during the battle of the Atlantic, 
     <lb/>
     fifty ships, many of which were not fit for 
     <lb/>
     use and some of which could not be taken 
     <lb/>
     to sea, were given as consideration for that 
     <lb/>
     lease. I hope the Prime Minister will do 
     <lb/>
     something to help Newfoundland and Labra<lb break="no"/>dor by taking the action which I suggest. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I support the principle of the bill now 
     <lb/>
     before the house, and hope that it passes the 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons unanimously. If it does, 
     <lb/>
     I know that sooner or later we shall have 
     <lb/>
     the Chignecto canal leading into the bay of 
     <lb/>
     Fundy, because that is the back door into 
     <lb/>
     the St. Lawrence waterway. I speak with 
     <lb/>
     the possibility of war in mind—because this 
     <lb/>
     present weaponless war, as I call it, is just 
     <lb/>
     as dangerous as was the Hitler war. They 
     <lb/>
     are almost two of a kind. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I believe a better day is dawning for 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland and Labrador and also for this 
     <lb/>
     country. Newfoundland was a pioneer at 
     <lb/>
     the time of confederation. I support my 
     <lb/>
     leader on the stand he has taken, and also 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister in what he has said. I 
     <lb/>
     do urge, however, that the giving up of those 
     <lb/>
     bases in Newfoundland and British Guiana 
     <lb/>
     in the darkest hours of the battle of the 
     <lb/>
     Atlantic should not be charged against 
     <lb/>
     Canada, Newfoundland and Labrador, but 
     <lb/>
     that negotiations should be had with the 
     <lb/>
     British government and with the United 
     <lb/>
     States to have them charged up to lend-lease. </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KNOW1">Mr. Stanley Knowles</persName> (Winnipeg North 
     <lb/>
     Centre): Mr. Speaker, I wish to speak briefly 
     <lb/>
     concerning only two matters which arise 
     <lb/>
     from the bill now before us. It has been 
     <lb/>
     said by a number of hon. members who have 
     <lb/>
     already spoken that as Canadians we must 
     <lb/>
     do our best to extend the warmest possible 
     <lb/>
     welcome to the people of Newfoundland as 
     <lb/>
     they enter confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     One of the consequences of confederation 
     <lb/>
     will be the coming to this city and to parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of seven members of the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons and six members of the other place. 
     <lb/>
     The question I raise, and which I hope is 
     <lb/>
     being considered by the government, is this: 
     <lb/>
     What sort of welcome will it be for these 
     <lb/>
     thirteen new members of the Canadian par<lb break="no"/>liament if, upon arriving here, they find they 
     <lb/>
     have no office space?  I suggest strongly that 
     <lb/>
     this is a matter which should receive the 
     <lb/>
     serious consideration of the government, and 
     <lb/>
     I suggest further it would not be out of place 
     <lb/>
     for the government to indicate to parliament 
     <lb/>
     whether or not such consideration is being 
     <lb/>
     given, and if so, along what lines. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This matter has been taken up on many 
     <lb/>
     occasions both in the house and with officials 
     <lb/>
     of the house, not only because of the coming 
     <lb/>
     to parliament of representatives of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, but because of the overcrowding 
     <lb/>
     already existing, and because of the increase 
     <lb/>
     in membership provided by redistribution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PROB1">Mr. Probe</persName>: Put the senators in the new 
     <lb/>
     printing bureau.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KNOW1">Mr. Knowles</persName>: My hon. friend suggests that 
     <lb/>
     the senators' offices might be moved to the 
     <lb/>
     printing bureau. To say the least, space 
     <lb/>
     might be found in the east block for mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the other place; they would be some<lb break="no"/>what closer to the Chateau Laurier. But 
     <lb/>
     speaking seriously, this is a matter that does 
     <lb/>
     require consideration. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I could make a case for the greater space 
     <lb/>
     needed for members on the opposition side of 
     <lb/>
     the house. Were I to do so, it might be 
     <lb/>
     regarded as a case of self-interest. May I 
     <lb/>
     add however that it seems to me to be 
     <lb/>
     unfair and poor business when so many par<lb break="no"/>liamentary assistants, who have certain extra 
     <lb/>
     duties as a result of their appointments, find 
     <lb/>
     themselves crowded in the matter of office 
     <lb/>
     space. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I urge the government to give considera<lb break="no"/>tion to this matter, particularly because of 
     <lb/>
     the way in which the problem will be aggra<lb break="no"/>vated when these new members come from 
     <lb/>
     the province of Newfoundland. I would ask 
     <lb/>
     the government to do the fair thing and to 
     <lb/>
     tell us, either from the floor of the house or 
     <lb/>
     informally, what ideas they have, and to 
     <lb/>
     indicate whether or not progress is being 
     <lb/>
     made toward implementing those ideas. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
  
            <cb/>
           
 <p>
     If the government wishes to have my sug<lb break="no"/>gestion, then I have already made it, namely, 
     <lb/>
     that space be found in the east block for the 
     <lb/>
     offices of a number of senators, including 
     <lb/>
     those we now have and the new ones who 
     <lb/>
     may be appointed within the next few 
     <lb/>
     months, and that members of the House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons be permitted to move into some of 
     <lb/>
     the offices thus vacated. As a matter of fact, 
     <lb/>
     in the light of the number of vacancies in the 
     <lb/>
     other place at this time, it seems to me only 
     <lb/>
     fair that this working section of parliament 
     <lb/>
     should be entitled to some of the vacant 
     <lb/>
     space on the other side of the building. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GRAY2">Mr. Graydon</persName>: The government will not need 
     <lb/>
     much space after this. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FRAS3">Mr. Fraser</persName>: The C.C.F. want to go into the

     <persName ref="pers:KNOW1">Mr. Knowles</persName>: My hon. friend's remarks are 
     <lb/>
     understandable. They are the observations 
     <lb/>
     one would expect to be made the morning 
     <lb/>
     after the night before. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GRAY2">Mr. Graydon</persName>: What a day!

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KNOW1">Mr. Knowles</persName>: I move on to say a word 
     <lb/>
     about the other matter I mentioned at the 
     <lb/>
     opening of my remarks. It has been touched 
     <lb/>
     upon by the hon. member for Broadview 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Church), although I must confess I was 
     <lb/>
     not able to hear his remarks well enough to 
     <lb/>
     get clearly the point he was making. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I too am concerned about the relationship 
     <lb/>
     between the measure now before us and 
     <lb/>
     chapter 80 of the statutes of 1947, an act to 
     <lb/>
     incorporate Quebec, North Shore and Labra<lb break="no"/>dor Railway Company. I understood the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Broadview to point out that there 
     <lb/>
     had been inserted in that act a saving 
     <lb/>
     clause as set out in section 7 to the effect that 
     <lb/>
     all the things parliament was permitting this 
     <lb/>
     company to do should be done only up to the 
     <lb/>
     border of Labrador, and that from that point 
     <lb/>
     on, permission would have to be secured from 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. The reference is not to the 
     <lb/>
     government of Newfoundland, to the provin<lb break="no"/>cial government of Newfoundland or to any 
     <lb/>
     government in the future. I raise the ques<lb break="no"/>tion as to what now happens when New<lb break="no"/>foundland becomes a province of Canada. My 
     <lb/>
     point is of particular concern in view of the 
     <lb/>
     fact that section 20 of the Quebec, North 
     <lb/>
     Shore and Labrador Railway Act says that— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     We all recall the arguments in the house 
     <lb/>
     at the time this bill was before us. Hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers will have in mind our opposition, lest 
     <lb/>
     this act be made a means whereby private 
     <lb/>
     interests would have the opportunity to 
     <lb/>
     exploit a great natural resource in the north<lb break="no"/>eastern section of this continent, a resource

     part of which was in Canada and part in 
     <lb/>
     another country, namely, Newfoundland. I 
     <lb/>
     am wondering whether the action we are tak<lb break="no"/>ing today, without some kind of assurance or 
     <lb/>
     saving clause, does not give to the company 
     <lb/>
    —provided they exercise the right within the 
     <lb/>five-year period set out in section 19 of the 
     <lb/>act to which I have referred—the right to go 
     <lb/>in and exploit for private gain the iron ore 
     <lb/>resources and other great natural wealth to 
     <lb/>be found there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     That wealth can mean great things for 
     <lb/>
     the people of Newfoundland, if properly 
     <lb/>
     developed in the interests of the people. It 
     <lb/>
     can mean great things for the people of Can<lb break="no"/>ada as a whole. I should hope that when we 
     <lb/>
     reach the committee stage on the bill and are 
     <lb/>
     dealing with the section concerning natural 
     <lb/>
     resources, the ministers piloting the various 
     <lb/>
     sections through the committee might be in 
     <lb/>
     a position to give us at least their opinions 
     <lb/>
     as to what the situation would be with respect 
     <lb/>
     to the act to which I have referred. As hon. 
     <lb/>
     members are aware, we are vitally concerned 
     <lb/>
     that the great natural resource be developed 
     <lb/>
     for the good of the people of Canada as a 
     <lb/>
     whole, including the people of Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     and not for the advantage of private interests.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: I had intended to say 
     <lb/>
     something about the points that have been 
     <lb/>
     raised, but I did not insist because I thought 
     <lb/>
     I could make those remarks as soon as the 
     <lb/>
     house got into committee. Then if what I 
     <lb/>
     said suggested further questions, those ques<lb break="no"/>tions could be answered during the com<lb break="no"/>mittee stage. While Mr. Speaker is in the 
     <lb/>
     chair I could say what I intended to say but 
     <lb/>
     I do not think that that would be of any 
     <lb/>
     particular advantage to hon. members. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DREW2">Mr. Drew</persName>: I do not want in any way to seek 
     <lb/>
     a change in the ordinary rules of the house. 
     <lb/>
     The reason I did not speak on second read<lb break="no"/>ing was that I thought the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     had indicated that he was going to speak. 
     <lb/>
     There are certain observations that I should 
     <lb/>
     like to make on the second reading, and in 
     <lb/>
     View of that I should like to have your con<lb break="no"/>sent, Mr. Speaker, to proceed.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: That will be quite agree<lb break="no"/>able to us. After I had moved the second

reading, if I spoke I would close the debate. 
     <lb/>I thought that if I were going to close the 
     <lb/>debate it would be just as convenient to have 
     <lb/>my intended remarks made in committee, 
     <lb/>where there would be an opportunity to ask 
     <lb/>further questions as might be suggested. I 
     <lb/>think it is the desire of all hon. members of 
     <lb/>the house that no one be deprived of his 
     <lb/>right to speak on the second reading. If the 
     <lb/>leader of the opposition wishes to do so I

     certain remarks on second reading of this 
     <lb/>
     bill and explain my position in regard to the 
     <lb/>
     agreement which accompanies it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     First of all, I should like to refer to the 
     <lb/>
     remarks that I made yesterday when the 
     <lb/>
     motion was before the house, and express 
     <lb/>
     the hope that the Prime Minister (Mr. St. 
     <lb/>
     Laurent) will have something to say on those 
     <lb/>
     points before the house goes into committee. 
     <lb/>
     I believe that they raise important considera<lb break="no"/>tions which should be borne in mind by hon. 
     <lb/>
     members when dealing with this extremely 
     <lb/>
     important bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The bill itself is simple and brief. It 
     <lb/>
     merely has the effect of approving the terms 
     <lb/>
     of the draft agreement which was settled by 
     <lb/>
     the representatives of the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment and by those who had been appointed 
     <lb/>
     to represent Newfoundland in those discus<lb break="no"/>sions. In effect, the considerations before 
     <lb/>
     hon. members on second reading of this bill 
     <lb/>
     are very similar to those which were before 
     <lb/>
     them yesterday when they were dealing with 
     <lb/>
     the motion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The question before hon. members is really 
     <lb/>
     whether or not they wish to proceed with 
     <lb/>
     the arrangements which have been made to 
     <lb/>
     bring Newfoundland into confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think it should be pointed out and remem<lb break="no"/>bered during the discussions that in a case 
     <lb/>
     of this kind there is not the latitude to suggest 
     <lb/>
     amendments which can be exercised ordinar<lb break="no"/>ily when a bill is in committee. Usually, 
     <lb/>
     when a bill is in committee, any changes that 
     <lb/>
     are made by way of amendment or deletion 
     <lb/>
     affect the legislative' authority of this house 


            <pb n="332" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-02-08_Page_0332.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">332</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">Newfoundland</hi></fw> <fw type="running">HOUSE OF COMMONS</fw>

alone. Therefore if there are any changes 
     <lb/>in the minds of hon. members, there is no 
     <lb/>reason why those proposals should not be 
     <lb/>put forward, by way of argument, by way of 
     <lb/>amendment, or otherwise within the rules 
     <lb/>of the house. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But in this case it must be remembered 
     <lb/>
     that the government, acting on behalf of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, has signed a draft agreement which 
     <lb/>
     is now before us as an appendix to this bill. 
     <lb/>
     The same draft agreement has been signed 
     <lb/>
     by those who were called upon to represent 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, no matter what their status 
     <lb/>
     may have been. Therefore, the house must 
     <lb/>
     recognize that if the terms of union are to 
     <lb/>
     proceed they must of necessity proceed upon 
     <lb/>
     the basis of the draft agreement which has 
     <lb/>
     been presented if there is to be concurrence 
     <lb/>
     within the terms of that agreement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The principle involved is to agree or 
     <lb/>
     not to agree to proceed with the terms of 
     <lb/>
     union along the lines of this draft agreement, 
     <lb/>
     but the support of this bill which brings such 
     <lb/>
     draft agreement into effect for the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of completing the confederation cannot be 
     <lb/>
     regarded as approval of every term of that 
     <lb/>
     draft agreement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As I pointed out to the Prime Minister yes<lb break="no"/>terday, there is real objection to the inclusion 
     <lb/>
     in an agreement of this kind of a provision 
     <lb/>
     which, on the one hand, permits a province 
     <lb/>
     to do a particular thing and to carry out a 
     <lb/>
     particular type of production and, at the same 
     <lb/>
     time, places a limitation upon the sale of 
     <lb/>
     that product in other parts of Canada. It 
     <lb/>
     matters not that the particular provision may 
     <lb/>
     have no practical effect now that the decision 
     <lb/>
     of the supreme court has been given in regard 
     <lb/>
     to the constitutional authority of the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada to place restrictions on the 
     <lb/>
     manufacture and sale of oleomargarine. The 
     <lb/>
     fact remains that imbedded in this agreement 
     <lb/>
     is a principle which, if it were accepted as 
     <lb/>
     one which could apply to other types of pro<lb break="no"/>duction within Canada, would produce very 
     <lb/>
     unsatisfactory results. It could, in fact, pro<lb break="no"/>duce the very thing that confederation was 
     <lb/>
     intended to bring to an end; that is, any form 
     <lb/>
     of trade barrier between the provincial areas 
     <lb/>
     within Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For that reason I think this particular pro<lb break="no"/>vision might well be made the subject of 
     <lb/>
     discussion between the government of Canada 
     <lb/>
     and the representatives of Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     with the idea of deleting it so that a principle 
     <lb/>
     which may have very serious consequences 
     <lb/>
     in some other case might not be established 
     <lb/>
     as a precedent which would be contrary to 
     <lb/>
     the practice that has been so carefully fol<lb break="no"/>lowed ever since confederation. I strongly 
     <lb/>
     urge the Prime Minister (Mr. St. Laurent) to 
     <lb/>
     take this suggestion into consideration, 
     <lb/>
     because it would seem to me that there is no 
     <lb/>
     reason why the dominion government on the 
  

            <cb/>
        

     one hand should wish to put forward any 
     <lb/>
     special provision for one province, and on 
     <lb/>
     the other hand impose a restriction in rela<lb break="no"/>tion to that particular provision. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I should like to point out also that in rela<lb break="no"/>tion to the financial arrangements there is a 
     <lb/>
     restriction which does not apply to any other 
     <lb/>
     province. As I pointed out yesterday, there 
     <lb/>
     is a specific undertaking that, even though 
     <lb/>
     new financial arrangements are made with 
     <lb/>
     other provinces, that is not to be taken as a 
     <lb/>
     ground for any claim by Newfoundland for 
     <lb/>
     similar consideration by way of adjustment 
     <lb/>
     of their position. Again, it seems to me, that 
     <lb/>
     is imposing a particular restriction on a single 
     <lb/>
     province, which is not consistent with the 
     <lb/>
     uniform type of arrangements which have 
     <lb/>
     applied to the other provinces of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     As will be recalled, this provision is not 
     <lb/>
     something which can have only a theoretical 
     <lb/>
     importance. It is related to events which 
     <lb/>
     actually occurred in regard to the adjustment 
     <lb/>
     of financial arrangements with other provin<lb break="no"/>ces during the past two years. When the 
     <lb/>
     then minister of finance, Mr. Ilsley, announced 
     <lb/>
     in this house in 1946 the terms the dominion 
     <lb/>
     government would put before the provinces 
     <lb/>
     as the alternative to the retention by the prov<lb break="no"/>inces of their major taxing powers, no 
     <lb/>
     provision was made for any changes to fol<lb break="no"/>low. But very shortly after those proposals, 
     <lb/>
     or I should say those arbitrary terms, had 
     <lb/>
     been stated in this house, negotiations took 
     <lb/>
     place between the dominion government and 
     <lb/>
     different provincial governments. As the result 
     <lb/>
     of arguments advanced by one provincial gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, some changes were made; and those 
     <lb/>
     changes were passed on to the other provin<lb break="no"/>ces. Then certain very advantageous terms 
     <lb/>
     were placed before British Columbia. I am 
     <lb/>
     not suggesting that those terms were not quite 
     <lb/>
     properly demanded by that province, because 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia has found even the present 
     <lb/>
     terms inadequate. Nevertheless there was an 
     <lb/>
     immediate demand from the premier of New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick and other premiers that they 
     <lb/>
     should receive equally favourable terms, and 
     <lb/>
     so the bidding and the consequent adjustment 
     <lb/>
     went on. It was a form of horse trading 
     <lb/>
     between governments, such as had been 
     <lb/>
     anticipated by Sir Wilfrid Laurier so many 
     <lb/>
     years ago when be condemned this very prac<lb break="no"/>tice in such vigorous terms, saying that such 
     <lb/>
     arrangements usually were merely the pay<lb break="no"/>ment of a note given in return for political 
     <lb/>
     treachery. I remind hon. members that those 
     <lb/>
     are the words of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, not 
     <lb/>
     mine; but this type of horse trading over the 
     <lb/>
     subsidies that should be paid in return for 
     <lb/>
     taxing powers has produced precisely the 
     <lb/>
     result anticipated so many years ago by Sir 
     <lb/>
     Wilfrid Laurier. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

 <p>
     At this point may I interject that when I 
     <lb/>
     was premier of Ontario and was putting for<lb break="no"/>ward the position of my province, I did not 
     <lb/>
     refuse to deal with subsidies as part of the 
     <lb/>
     arrangement. I mention that because of cer<lb break="no"/>tain remarks made during the debate on the 
     <lb/>
     address prior to its adjournment last Friday 
     <lb/>
     evening. I would remind hon. members that 
     <lb/>
     the proposals I put forward at that time are 
     <lb/>
     a matter of record, and that we in fact pro<lb break="no"/>posed a system of subsidies on a basis which 
     <lb/>
     would adjust itself to the requirements of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces, with a national adjustment fund, 
     <lb/>
     which was the key recommendation of the 
     <lb/>
     Rowell-Sirois report. We stated that we 
     <lb/>
     wished to enter into arrangements of that 
     <lb/>
     kind under a transitional agreement which 
     <lb/>
     would also provide for an examination of the 
     <lb/>
     whole combined taxing system of Canada by 
     <lb/>
     competent experts of all the governments and 
     <lb/>
     other experts who would be brought in to 
     <lb/>
     examine this extremely important subject. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We pointed out that there is only one group 
     <lb/>
     of taxpayers in Canada, who pay taxes to 
     <lb/>
     the dominion government, the provincial gov<lb break="no"/>ernments and the municipal councils. We 
     <lb/>
     pointed out that there is no magic by means 
     <lb/>
     of which money can be drawn from any 
     <lb/>
     obscure source. There is no question of 
     <lb/>
     generosity on the part of the dominion gov<lb break="no"/>ernment involved in any of these proposals or, 
     <lb/>
     if one chooses to use the term preferred by 
     <lb/>
     the minister of reconstruction (Mr. Winters), 
     <lb/>
     no question of beneficence. There is nothing 
     <lb/>
     of that kind. The dominion government is 
     <lb/>
     merely the collecting body which draws from 
     <lb/>
     the people of Canada taxes for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     undertaking certain responsibilities. If the 
     <lb/>
     dominion government requires more money 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of making payments back to 
     <lb/>
     the provinces, the money comes from the very 
     <lb/>
     same people; it comes from the taxpayers of 
     <lb/>
     Canada as a whole.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What we recommended then, and what I 
     <lb/>
     still recommend, is that there be an examina<lb break="no"/>tion of our whole taxing system so that the 
     <lb/>
     taxes required by the dominion government, 
     <lb/>
     the provincial governments and the munici<lb break="no"/>palities may be adequate for the responsibi<lb break="no"/>lities they are called upon to assume. In 
     <lb/>
     this way we may be enabled to establish in 
     <lb/>
     Canada the most scientific tax system possible, 
     <lb/>
     adjusted to meet the modern conditions in 
     <lb/>
     which we live, so that the taxes called for 
     <lb/>
     by these three levels of government may be 
     <lb/>
     imposed upon the people of Canada in a way 
     <lb/>
     that will place a less onerous burden upon 
     <lb/>
     them and place the least possible restriction 
     <lb/>
     upon personal effort and upon production 
     <lb/>
     in every part of this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think it is appropriate that I should recall 
     <lb/>
     my recommendation in that respect, because 
     <lb/>
     certain comments have obviously been made 
   

            <cb/>
 
without knowledge of what we actually 
     <lb/>recommended. I also refer to that proposal 
     <lb/>because it has a very direct bearing on the 
     <lb/>terms that are included in this draft agree<lb break="no"/>ment between Canada and Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>The representatives of Newfoundland have 
     <lb/>accepted terms similar to those which were 
     <lb/>placed before the provinces of Canada in 
     <lb/>this house in 1946. This restriction has, of 
     <lb/>course, been placed upon Newfoundland that 
     <lb/>they cannot apply for an adjustment in 
     <lb/>consequence of a subsequent adjustment with 
     <lb/>any other province. I suggest, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>there is a particular reason for that restric<lb break="no"/>tion being included.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This agreement also does something that 
     <lb/>
     I recommended, and recommended very 
     <lb/>
     strongly as premier of Ontario at these 
     <lb/>
     dominion-provincial conferences. I urged 
     <lb/>
     that, in addition to the taxing systems we 
     <lb/>
     proposed and the subsidy payment provided 
     <lb/>
     by a transitional agreement, there be also 
     <lb/>
     an immediate recognition of the recommenda<lb break="no"/>tions in the Rowell-Sirois report that a 
     <lb/>
     national adjustment fund be set up. We 
     <lb/>
     urged that such a fund be set up on a basis 
     <lb/>
     very much higher, however, than that recom<lb break="no"/>mended in the Rowell-Sirois report. This 
     <lb/>
     would enable those provinces still needing 
     <lb/>
     additional financial support, over and above 
     <lb/>
     the ordinary subsidy payments during the 
     <lb/>
     transitional period, to obtain funds from this 
     <lb/>
     national adjustment fund. Perhaps I should 
     <lb/>
     interject that it is a matter of record that 
     <lb/>
     I also said I was prepared to agree to any 
     <lb/>
     form of distribution of that fund, which was 
     <lb/>
     acceptable to those provinces receiving contri<lb break="no"/>butions from it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I mention that for this reason. In the 
     <lb/>
     draft agreement with Newfoundland the 
     <lb/>
     principle of grants in aid, recommended by 
     <lb/>
     the Rowell-Sirois commission, is recognized. 
     <lb/>
     Over and above the ordinary subsidy pay<lb break="no"/>ments, there are substantial grants in aid 
     <lb/>
     which are related to the recognition of special 
     <lb/>
     financial requirements. I find it difficult to 
     <lb/>
     believe it was not in the mind of the dominion 
     <lb/>
     government that, when this new province 
     <lb/>
     shall receive these special grants, there may 
     <lb/>
     well be demands from those provinces that 
     <lb/>
     have accepted these unsatisfactory terms. 
     <lb/>
     In some cases the provinces are not satisfied 
     <lb/>
     and there may well be a demand from them 
     <lb/>
     that they receive similar consideration. It 
     <lb/>
     would look as though the dominion govern<lb break="no"/>ment had decided that this type of horse 
     <lb/>
     trading would have to stop some place. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore they decided, after further negotia<lb break="no"/>tions, that they would say to Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     at that point it stops; you cannot claim any 
     <lb/>
     more. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If that is the purpose, and I cannot see any 
     <lb/>
     other purpose in placing such a limitation 
  

            <pb n="334" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-02-08_Page_0334.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">334</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">Newfoundland</hi></fw> <fw type="running">HOUSE OF COMMONS</fw>
        
 
     in the agreement, then right at the outset 
     <lb/>
     we are accepting the inclusion in the agree<lb break="no"/>ment of something that the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, within a comparatively short 
     <lb/>
     time, may consider unsatisfactory, having 
     <lb/>
     regard to the speed with which those 
     <lb/>
     adjustments took place after the terms of 
     <lb/>
     the dominion-provincial agreements were 
     <lb/>
     announced in the House of Commons in 1946. 
     <lb/>
     I therefore come back to my comments of 
     <lb/>
     yesterday on this subject. I suggest to the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister that consideration be given 
     <lb/>
     to the unsatisfactory results that might follow 
     <lb/>
     the inclusion of a limitation of that kind, 
     <lb/>
     and that, through negotiation with the 
     <lb/>
     representatives of Newfoundland, this parti<lb break="no"/>cular restriction be deleted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     In so far as these arrangements are con<lb break="no"/>cerned, it is appropriate to point out that the 
     <lb/>
     representatives of Newfoundland have con<lb break="no"/>curred in these terms. Whether the authority 
     <lb/>
     of those who represented Newfoundland was 
     <lb/>
     adequate is, as I said yesterday, something 
     <lb/>
     to be determined by the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland and the government of the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom. The mere fact of concurrence, 
     <lb/>
     however, does not constitute a reason for 
     <lb/>
     opposing the terms under which the union 
     <lb/>
     goes forward. I wish to make it clear that I 
     <lb/>
     see very serious objections to the provisions 
     <lb/>
     I have mentioned. I think it would be desir<lb break="no"/>able that these grounds of possible objection 
     <lb/>
     be removed. It could be done by consulta<lb break="no"/>tion; and, if it is done, at least two reasons 
     <lb/>
     for misunderstanding in the near future may 
     <lb/>
     have been withdrawn from the terms of 
     <lb/>
     union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is in this agreement a provision that 
     <lb/>
     the subsidy payments may continue, not for 
     <lb/>
     the shorter period in which they are payable 
     <lb/>
     to the other provinces but, on the option of 
     <lb/>
     the representatives of Newfoundland, for an 
     <lb/>
     extended period of eight years. This is not 
     <lb/>
     a ground for opposing the terms of. union, 
     <lb/>
     although I do object in principle to such an 
     <lb/>
     arrangement. It has been agreed to by 
     <lb/>
     certain provinces. I think it is an unsatis<lb break="no"/>factory arrangement, but that is for them to 
     <lb/>
     decide. The whole problem, of course, can 
     <lb/>
     be solved when there is a resumption of the 
     <lb/>
     dominion-provincial conferences and the 
     <lb/>
     dominion government and provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ments sit down, as they should, and discuss 
     <lb/>
     the whole relationship of the dominion and 
     <lb/>
     provincial governments in the tax field, with 
     <lb/>
     particular reference to the financial require<lb break="no"/>ments of the municipalities in Canada from 
     <lb/>
     the Atlantic to the Pacific. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The very terms of this agreement once 
     <lb/>
     more emphasize the need for the revival of 
     <lb/>
     that conference, which only stands adjourned 
     <lb/>
     by the dominion government and can be 


            <cb/>
         

     recalled at any time by them. This action 
     <lb/>
     has been requested over and over again, not 
     <lb/>
     only by myself, but by other premiers of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces of Canada. The terms of the agree<lb break="no"/>ment emphasize as well the need for a con<lb break="no"/>ference which will set up a continuing, inte<lb break="no"/>grated, functional relationship between the 
     <lb/>
     dominion government and the governments 
     <lb/>
     of the provinces, so that the very type of dis<lb break="no"/>cussions which are suggested by some of the 
     <lb/>
     terms of this agreement could, from time to 
     <lb/>
     time, be dealt with by the representatives of 
     <lb/>
     those governments who are working together 
     <lb/>
     within this federal structure, and who can 
     <lb/>
     deal with practically any problem that may 
     <lb/>
     arise, without the necessity of any constitu<lb break="no"/>tional change, so long as they work together 
     <lb/>
     in a spirit of co-operation and good will. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I should like particularly to remind the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland that, in supporting 
     <lb/>
     this bill which embodies these terms, it will 
     <lb/>
     be my aim, as it will be the aim of those asso<lb break="no"/>ciated with me in this house, to bring about 
     <lb/>
     such a conference at which Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     and the other provinces will be present, where 
     <lb/>
     the combined constitutional authority of all 
     <lb/>
     these governments can be brought together 
     <lb/>
     most effectively for the advantage of the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland, of every other prov<lb break="no"/>ince of Canada, and generally for the wel<lb break="no"/>fare of Canadians.

     moments ago for the unanimous consent of

     of the opposition, I did not realize what I

     spoken. If the leader of the opposition felt

     object would have prevented him, in the 
     <lb/>
     absence of consent of the house, from himself 
     <lb/>
     being heard. That explanation having been 
     <lb/>
     made, and because I felt that possibly there 
     <lb/>
     might have been some misunderstanding of 
     <lb/>
     the effect of the rules of this house, I asked 
     <lb/>
     the house to waive the application of the 
     <lb/>
     rule, even to waive the motion that had been 
     <lb/>
     put for the second reading of the bill, and to 
     <lb/>
     revert to a previous stage so that the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition might be heard, not after 
     <lb/>
     I had spoken but before. He could not be 
     <lb/>
     heard after I had spoken. I think that is 
     <lb/>
     exactly what the position is. If the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman did not wish to have any courteous 
     <lb/>
     waiver of the rules by the house, I am sorry 
     <lb/>
     that the circumstances made it necessary for 
     <lb/>
     him to have it in order to make the remarks 
     <lb/>
     he has made at this stage of the discussion.

     of dominion-provincial relations. The motion 
     <lb/>
     before the house is for the second reading of 
     <lb/>
     this bill. Other opportunities will be pre<lb break="no"/>sented when the matter of dominion-provin<lb break="no"/>cial relations can be taken up again. On this 
     <lb/>
     bill I wish to deal with the pertinent points 
     <lb/>
     made by the leader of the opposition. The 
     <lb/>
     first one is the undesirability of there being 
     <lb/>
     in the terms of union something which 
     <lb/>
     appears to many to be a new principle; that 
     <lb/>
     is to say, some impediment or barrier to 
     <lb/>
     interprovincial trade arising out of the terms 
     <lb/>
     of this clause which was inserted in the agree<lb break="no"/>ment with respect to oleomargarine. I think 
     <lb/>
     I am privileged to refer to the document, 
     <lb/>
     since it has been tabled, and I am referring 
     <lb/>
     to the document that was tabled and not to 
     <lb/>
     the schedule of the bill as such. In the docu<lb break="no"/>ment tabled, term 46 provides as follows: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

            <p>
     Hon. gentlemen will notice with what care 
     <lb/>
     this provision was drafted. It provided that 
     <lb/>
     the parliament of Canada would not prohibit 
     <lb/>
     or restrict such manufacture and sale in New<lb break="no"/>foundland except at the request of the legis<lb break="no"/>lature of the province of Newfoundland. By 
     <lb/>
     a majority judgment the supreme court has 
     <lb/>
     now decided that the parliament of Canada 
     <lb/>
     cannot prohibit or restrict the manufacture 
     <lb/>
     or sale of oleomargarine in any of the prov<lb break="no"/>inces. I must confess that one of the reasons 
     <lb/>
     given in the majority judgment came to me 
     <lb/>
     rather as a surprise. I had assumed that this 
     <lb/>
     provision in the Dairy Industry Act was one 
     <lb/>
     which related to the subject of agriculture. 
     <lb/>
     As hon. members know, parliament and the 
     <lb/>
     legislatures of the provinces have concurrent 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction in respect of matters dealing with 
     <lb/>
     agriculture. But the supreme court held that 
     <lb/>
     this was not a matter related to agriculture, 
     <lb/>
     but rather something which was local and 
     <lb/>
     private within the province. Consequently 
     <lb/>
     it held that the parliament of Canada had no 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction in regard to it. The clause as 
     <lb/>
     drafted envisages that the parliament of 
     <lb/>
     Canada would not so "prohibit or restrict" 
     <lb/>
     except at the request of the legislature of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. If the parliament of Canada 
     <lb/>
     has no jurisdiction, in that the matter does 
     <lb/>
     not come within the clause relating to agri<lb break="no"/>culture in the British North America Act, it 
     <lb/>
     cannot do anything at all about it. My view 
     <lb/>
     was that if it had jurisdiction, it was because 
     <lb/>
     the subject matter related to agriculture, 
     <lb/>
     over which both parliament and the legis<lb break="no"/>lature would have jurisdiction. As far as I 
     <lb/>
     was concerned, I felt that it might be proper, 
     <lb/>
     in a matter in which both had jurisdiction, 
     <lb/>
     to agree, since oleomargarine had been avail<lb break="no"/>able in Newfoundland for a long time, that 
     <lb/>
     the parliament of Canada would not exercise 
     <lb/>
     its jurisdiction unless the legislature of the 
     <lb/>
     province requested it to do so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The term provided in addition that, if this 
     <lb/>
     was something over which parliament had 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction, the oleomargarine manufactured 
     <lb/>
     and offered for sale in Newfoundland would 
     <lb/>
     not be exported into any other of. the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian provinces, unless the parliament of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, having jurisdiction, made it legal for 
     <lb/>
     oleomargarine to be manufactured and sold 
     <lb/>
     in those provinces. That is the thing that is 
     <lb/>
     regarded as setting up a barrier to trade, 
     <lb/>
     involving a new principle. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Well, Mr. Speaker, it does not involve a 
     <lb/>
     new principle. There have been for many 
     <lb/>
     years in the dominion and in the provinces a 
     <lb/>
     barrier to the transportation, or to the for<lb break="no"/>warding from one province to another, of any 
     <lb/>
     form of intoxicants. The provinces have 


            <pb n="336" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-02-08_Page_0336.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">336</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">Newfoundland</hi></fw> <fw type="running">HOUSE OF COMMONS</fw>
   

     asserted their control over the sale and distri<lb break="no"/>bution of intoxicants within their respective 
     <lb/>
     areas; and under these provincial laws it is 
     <lb/>
     an offence, which is sometimes committed 
     <lb/>
     unwittingly by Canadians going from one 
     <lb/>
     province to another, to have in a province 
     <lb/>
     any intoxicant which has not been purchased 
     <lb/>
     from the liquor control board of that prov<lb break="no"/>ince. Very recently I was a bit embarrassed 
     <lb/>
     by a guest at my own apartment who had an 
     <lb/>
     empty bottle that had contained something 
     <lb/>
     which would be regarded by most persons as 
     <lb/>
     coming within the legal definition of intoxi<lb break="no"/>cants, and which had been purchased from 
     <lb/>
     the board of  Quebec. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Under the legislation administered by the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition, it has been for a 
     <lb/>
     good many years an  offence to have in 
     <lb/>
     Ontario any intoxicant that has not been 
     <lb/>
     purchased from the board of control which 
     <lb/>
     operated under the government of which the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman was the premier for several 
     <lb/>
     years. That was not only something done by 
     <lb/>
     the provinces. So that it might be fully 
     <lb/>
     effective throughout the whole dominion, in 
     <lb/>
     spite of the fact that the dominion has juris<lb break="no"/>diction in interprovincial trade, there were 
     <lb/>
     introduced into the Canada Temperance Act 
     <lb/>
     by a statute of 1916, amended in 1919, the 
     <lb/>
     provisions which are now sections 168 and 
     <lb/>
     following of the Canada Temperance Act, 
     <lb/>
     which is itself chapter 196 of the Revised 
     <lb/>
     Statutes of Canada, 1927. That makes it 
     <lb/>
     an offence punishable under the terms of the 
     <lb/>
     legislation of the parliament of Canada to 
     <lb/>
     transport or have in one's possession any 
     <lb/>
     intoxicant—and the word is defined by the 
     <lb/>
     statute—contrary to the provisions of the laws 
     <lb/>
     of the province where the person happens to 
     <lb/>
     be. Therefore, in order to make effective this 
     <lb/>
     barrier to the trade in intoxicants produced 
     <lb/>
     or manufactured in one province and designed 
     <lb/>
     to be sold in other parts of Canada, the 
     <lb/>
     legislatures of the nine provinces of Canada 
     <lb/>
     and the federal parliament agreed in setting 
     <lb/>
     up this concurrent system which makes it an 
     <lb/>
     offence punishable under the laws of Canada 
     <lb/>
     to have anything which is not allowed under 
     <lb/>
     what the legislature has seen fit to provide as 
     <lb/>
     the regime in the province where it exercises 
     <lb/>
     its jurisdiction. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In a general way, since 1919, the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     public has regarded that portion of the legis<lb break="no"/>lation of the provinces and of the dominion 
     <lb/>
     as good legislation. Perhaps I should say 
     <lb/>
     that I have heard it is the intention of the 
     <lb/>
     government of one province to recommend 
     <lb/>
     to the legislature a prohibition against the 
     <lb/>
     manufacture and sale of oleomargarine within 
     <lb/>
     its limits. There was a report that the premier 
     <lb/>
     of Prince Edward Island, in the exercise of 
     <lb/>
     the jurisdiction which the majority of the 
     <lb/>
     supreme court have declared to be that of 
     <lb/>
     the provinces, had said that he was going to 


            <cb/>
        

     recommend to the legislature of his province 
     <lb/>
     that the manufacture and sale of oleomar<lb break="no"/>garine be prohibited. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DREW2">Mr. Drew</persName>: I believe he has already dealt 
     <lb/>
     with it by order in council. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: That may be so. I was 
     <lb/>
     not aware that it had come into effect, but I 
     <lb/>
     did read in the newspapers that it was the 
     <lb/>
     intention to do that.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This matter of where the jurisdiction lies 
     <lb/>
     in the sale of commodities that might com<lb break="no"/>pete with the produce of the dairy industry 
     <lb/>
     may not yet be finally settled. The Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Federation of Agriculture is still considering 
     <lb/>
     the advisability of applying to the privy 
     <lb/>
     council for leave to appeal, and has quite 
     <lb/>
     recently asked the Canadian government 
     <lb/>
     whether it would not itself assert an appeal. 
     <lb/>
     It has been informed that that was highly 
     <lb/>
     improper in view of the attitude taken by 
     <lb/>
     the government in recommending to this 
     <lb/>
     house that there be in future litigation no 
     <lb/>
     further appeals to the privy council. Whether 
     <lb/>
     or not there will be an appeal has not yet 
     <lb/>
     become certain. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When these terms of union were drafted 
     <lb/>
     and signed there had been no decision from 
     <lb/>
     the supreme court. If hon. members will 
     <lb/>
     reread them they 'will see that they were 
     <lb/>
     carefully prepared, to be applicable to any 
     <lb/>
     situation that might arise. If the jurisdiction 
     <lb/>
     had remained with the federal parliament, or 
     <lb/>
     if an appeal to the privy council results in 
     <lb/>
     that tribunal saying that it does rest in the 
     <lb/>
     parliament of Canada, then term 46 will make 
     <lb/>
     it certain that the people of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     will not be deprived of the right to continue 
     <lb/>
     to use a substitute for the butter they do not 
     <lb/>
     produce in their island, and which they have 
     <lb/>
     been using for so many years. If on the 
     <lb/>
     other hand it is decided by the courts that 
     <lb/>
     the parliament of Canada has no right to do 
     <lb/>
     anything about it, the fact that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada agreed with the delegation 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland that it would not do any<lb break="no"/>thing about it is not going to cause any harm 
     <lb/>
     to anybody. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It may be suggested that there is a dif<lb break="no"/>ference between intoxicants and oleomargar<lb break="no"/>ine. There is. Intoxicants are obviously 
     <lb/>
     connected with peace, order and good govern<lb break="no"/>ment in a local way. Therefore it is obvious 
     <lb/>
     that those who are responsible for peace, 
     <lb/>
     order and good government in a local and 
     <lb/>
     private way within a province can be con<lb break="no"/>cerned about exercising proper control over 
     <lb/>
     the sale and distribution of intoxicants. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Are the manufacture and sale of oleo<lb break="no"/>margarine something about which provincial 
     <lb/>
     governments or provincial legislatures are 
     <lb/>
     concerned? The majority of the supreme 
     <lb/>
     court have said that it is. They have said 
     <lb/>
     that it is something of local and private con<lb break="no"/>

     cern within the province. Well, if it is, the 
     <lb/>
     provincial legislatures have a right to do 
     <lb/>
     about it that which may appear to them to be 
     <lb/>
     in the public interest. They are the ones to 
     <lb/>
     judge, if they have the jurisdiction, what they 
     <lb/>
     should do about it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The exercise of jurisdiction is never in any 
     <lb/>
     instance controlled by the opinion one may 
     <lb/>
     hold about the wisdom of the way in which 
     <lb/>
     the person having the jurisdiction has exer<lb break="no"/>cised it. The privy council has repeatedly 
     <lb/>
     said that it will not concern itself with the 
     <lb/>
     wisdom or otherwise of the exercise of juris<lb break="no"/>diction, if there is jurisdiction. If there is 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction, the constitution says where that 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction lies; and it is those who have the 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction who are supposed to have the 
     <lb/>
     wisdom to exercise it properly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With respect to the second point, that there 
     <lb/>
     is in the terms of agreement with the prov<lb break="no"/>ince of Newfoundland something which is 
     <lb/>
     different from the terms to be found in the 
     <lb/>
     tax agreements with the other provinces, I 
     <lb/>
     believe the leader of the opposition (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Drew) has omitted to look at the last part of 
     <lb/>
     the clause in question. That clause provides 
     <lb/>
     that the government of the province of New<lb break="no"/>foundland shall have the right to enter into 
     <lb/>
     a contract with the dominion government 
     <lb/>
     along the same lines as the contracts made 
     <lb/>
     with the other provinces; but that it shall 
     <lb/>
     also have the option of making that contract, 
     <lb/>
     not only for the period for which it is made 
     <lb/>
     with the other provinces, but for five years 
     <lb/>
     longer than the period made with the other

     the agreement may be entered into either for a 
     <lb/>
     number of fiscal years expiring at the end of the 
     <lb/>
     fiscal year in 1952, as in the case of other provinces, 
     <lb/>
     or for a number of fiscal years expiring at the end 
     <lb/>
     of the fiscal year in 1957, at the option of the 
     <lb/>
     government of the province of Newfoundland, but 
     <lb/>
     if the government of the province of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     accepts the latter option the agreement will provide 
     <lb/>
     that the subsequent entry into a tax agreement by 
     <lb/>
     the government of Canada with any other province 
     <lb/>
     will not entitle the government of the province of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland to any alteration in the terms of its 
     <lb/>
     agreement.

     In other words we say to them: You may

     have your choice; first, you may place your<lb break="no"/>
        

            <cb/>

selves in the same position as the other prov<lb break="no"/>inces. But if for greater security you wish 
     <lb/>
     to have at once an agreement that will go on 
     <lb/>
     five years beyond the agreement with the 
     <lb/>
     present provinces, you have to make it as a 
     <lb/>
     firm agreement for the whole period. And 
     <lb/>
     if we make a new agreement in 1952 with 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces, that will not entitle you 
     <lb/>
     to have yours revised. In other words, you 
     <lb/>
     cannot have it both ways. You cannot have 
     <lb/>
     an agreement whereby, if we make a less 
     <lb/>
     favourable agreement from 1952 to 1957 with 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces, you will keep the former 
     <lb/>
     advantage, whilst, if we make a more favour<lb break="no"/>able agreement with the other provinces, you 
     <lb/>
     will get the increased benefits. You must say 
     <lb/>
     at the outset whether you will stand on the 
     <lb/>
     same level as the other provinces and get in 
     <lb/>
     1952 the same kind of agreement they get, or 
     <lb/>
     you can at once secure for yourselves the 
     <lb/>
     benefit for a further period of five years on 
     <lb/>
     the present basis. But if you do that, you 
     <lb/>
     take it for the period for which you are exer<lb break="no"/>cising your option.

     I submit that is not a principle which would 
     <lb/>
     prove substantially to be objectionable. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am fully in accord with the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition when he states that the principle 
     <lb/>
     we are now debating on second reading is as 
     <lb/>
     to whether there should be made an agree<lb break="no"/>ment for the union of Newfoundland with 
     <lb/>
     Canada on terms which will appeal to the 
     <lb/>
     people of both sections as fair and reason<lb break="no"/>able. We suggest that these terms are fair 
     <lb/>
     and reasonable. But accepting the principle 
     <lb/>
     of the bill does not involve acceptance of the 
     <lb/>
     individual terms. It involves merely the 
     <lb/>
     desire of parliament to look at the document 
     <lb/>
     to see whether or not it amounts to fair and 
     <lb/>
     reasonable terms. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. member for Broadview (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Church) raised the question of the embarrass<lb break="no"/>ment which might result to the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada from having Newfoundland join with 
     <lb/>
     Canada in view of the fact that in 1941 there 
     <lb/>
     had been given a ninety-nine year lease for 
     <lb/>
     certain military bases in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     Those leases were made on terms agreed to 
     <lb/>
     by the government of the United Kingdom 
     <lb/>
     and that of the United States at a time when 
     <lb/>
     the situation was a most unhappy one. The 
     <lb/>
     leases are in existence. The government of 
     <lb/>
     the United Kingdom, the government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland and the government of Canada 
     <lb/>
     alone can do nothing to modify those terms. 
     <lb/>
     They create a condition for years in certain 
     <lb/>
     areas in Newfoundland; and they must be 
     <lb/>
     respected, unless it can be arranged with the 
     <lb/>
     government of the United States that they 
     <lb/>
     shall be varied. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There are in process at the present time 
     <lb/>
     negotiations looking to variation in the leases 
     <lb/>
     to bring them into accord with the joint 
     <lb/>
     declaration made by the President and the

     Prime Minister on February 12, 1947, about 
     <lb/>
     the principles which would govern the 
     <lb/>
     arrangements for military co-operation 
     <lb/>
     between the two countries. Those principles 
     <lb/>
     were agreed to by the two governments. 
     <lb/>
     They were announced simultaneously by the 
     <lb/>
     President and by the Prime Minister. I 
     <lb/>
     believe they have received pretty universal 
     <lb/>
     approval throughout the United States and 
     <lb/>
     Canada. It is our hope that in our negotia<lb break="no"/>tions with the government of the United 
     <lb/>
     States we shall have the actual exercise of 
     <lb/>
     the rights provided for by these leases 
     <lb/>
     brought into line with the principles which 
     <lb/>
     have been set out in this joint declaration. 
     <lb/>
     We hope that will be so because of the 
     <lb/>
     attitude of the two governments of Canada 
     <lb/>
     and the United States. Their practice has not 
     <lb/>
     been to deal with each other at arm's length, 
     <lb/>
     but rather to try to make arrangements 
     <lb/>
     which would afford the most satisfactory 
     <lb/>
     method and degree of co-operation between 
     <lb/>
     the peoples of the two countries. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     We hope it will be possible to have the 
     <lb/>
     lessees, who by contract have their rights for 
     <lb/>
     ninety-nine years in these leases, agree that 
     <lb/>
     they should exercise their rights in the man<lb break="no"/>ner which the two governments of. Canada 
     <lb/>
     and the United States agreed would be the 
     <lb/>
     proper way to ensure co-operation between 
     <lb/>
     them as set out in their joint declaration of 
     <lb/>
     February 12, 1947. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Broadview may be assured that I hope to be 
     <lb/>
     able to discuss with the President of the 
     <lb/>
     United States some aspects of these leases 
     <lb/>
     on the occasion of the visit I am to have the 
     <lb/>
     honour of paying him on this very week end. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. member for Winnipeg North Cen<lb break="no"/>tre (Mr. Knowles) feels that the entry of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland into confederation and the 
     <lb/>
     presence of six senators and seven members 
     <lb/>
     of parliament in addition to the present mem<lb break="no"/>bership of our houses of parliament is going 
     <lb/>
     to place a serious burden upon the restricted 
     <lb/>
     office space available in this central block. I 
     <lb/>
     think everyone who occupies any portion of 
     <lb/>
     the central block will be in full agreement 
     <lb/>
     with him as to the facts. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     His suggestion that space should be made 
     <lb/>
     in the east block for the hon. members 
     <lb/>
     of the other house would seem to indicate 
     <lb/>
     that he does not realize to what extent there 
     <lb/>
     is already congestion in the space available 
     <lb/>
     in the east block for the services located 
     <lb/>
     there. I was Secretary of State for External 
     <lb/>
     Affairs for well over a year before I could 
     <lb/>
     get space in the east block. During that 
     <lb/>
     period I had to use as my office the one that 
     <lb/>
     was available for me during the session in the 
     <lb/>
     centre block. 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:CRUI1">Mr. Cruickshank</persName>: Put them in the printing

            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: The suggestion is made 
     <lb/>
     that they might be put in the printing bureau, 
     <lb/>
     but those who have visited the printing 
     <lb/>
     bureau know that there is such congestion 
     <lb/>
     there that a large part of the work which 
     <lb/>
     should be done by the king's printer has to 
     <lb/>
     be let out by private contract. Hon. members 
     <lb/>
     are aware of the serious difficulties which 
     <lb/>
     arise in providing additional buildings for 
     <lb/>
     government services in this capital district. 
     <lb/>
     There are urgently required in the capital 
     <lb/>
     district more buildings for the housing of gov<lb break="no"/>ernment services. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Up to the present time it has been felt that 
     <lb/>
     it would be unfair to take any building 
     <lb/>
     materials or manpower which could be used 
     <lb/>
     for the provision of houses and devote them 
     <lb/>
     to the construction of government buildings. 
     <lb/>
     But there has been some easing in the supply 
     <lb/>
     situation. Hon. members are aware that for 
     <lb/>
     the last week or so there has been quite a 
     <lb/>
     controversy here in Ottawa as to where the 
     <lb/>
     additional buildings are going to be located. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The matter was submitted to the federal 
     <lb/>
     district commission and to the planning com<lb break="no"/>mission. They were told that the three 
     <lb/>
     services that require new accommodation 
     <lb/>
     were the Department of Veterans Affairs, the 
     <lb/>
     Department of Trade and Commerce and the 
     <lb/>
     printing bureau. They looked over the field 
     <lb/>
     and found two sites in Ottawa and one in 
     <lb/>
     Hull. One site in Ottawa was opposite the 
     <lb/>
     supreme court building on Wellington street 
     <lb/>
     and it was decided that that should be used 
     <lb/>
     for a building for the Department of Veterans 
     <lb/>
     Affairs. They recommended that the other 
     <lb/>
     site in Ottawa west should be devoted to 
     <lb/>
     the building for the Department of Trade and 
     <lb/>
     Commerce and that the printing bureau, 
     <lb/>
     which requires a large site—I am told it will 
     <lb/>
     have a frontage of seven hundred feet and a 
     <lb/>
     depth of three hundred and fifty feet—should 
     <lb/>
     be located in the city of Hull. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KNOW1">Mr. Knowles</persName>: Let the senators go to Hull. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: The provision of addi<lb break="no"/>tional accommodation for government ser<lb break="no"/>vices is necessary in order to relieve 
     <lb/>
     congestion throughout the whole service. If 
     <lb/>
     accommodation is made available for the 
     <lb/>
     Department of Veterans Affairs and the 
     <lb/>
     Department of Trade and Commerce it will 
     <lb/>
     relieve congestion in the space available for 
     <lb/>
     the houses of parliament. The project I hear 
     <lb/>
     discussed most frequently for the housing of 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen of the other place is the east 
     <lb/>
     block. The west block is the one I hear 
     <lb/>
     discussed as being the proper location for 
     <lb/>
     additional offices for members of parliament. 
     <lb/>
     I feel it is urgent that more space be provided 
     <lb/>
     for hon. members. This is something which 
     <lb/>
     is receiving active consideration, not only 
     <lb/>
     out of concern for the comfort of others but

     out of concern for the comfort of each one 
     <lb/>
     of us who is affected by the congestion which 
     <lb/>
     now exists. Perhaps hon. members do not 
     <lb/>
     realize that the Minister of Trade and Com<lb break="no"/>merce (Mr. Howe) is still located in one of 
     <lb/>
     the temporary buildings where he has been 
     <lb/>
     since the beginning of the war. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is a necessity that something should 
     <lb/>
     be done. It is recognized that the redistribu<lb break="no"/>tion which we have provided for and the 
     <lb/>
     augmented number of hon. members occa<lb break="no"/>sioned by union with Newfoundland will 
     <lb/>
     increase the urgency for additional space. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have attempted to deal with the matters 
     <lb/>
     which relate to the principle of this bill. My 
     <lb/>
     own  is that in accepting the principle 
     <lb/>
     of the bill the house does not go beyond 
     <lb/>
     asserting that it is desirable that there be 
     <lb/>
     union of Canada and Newfoundland on terms 
     <lb/>
     advantageous to the people of both sections. 
     <lb/>
     When the bill is in committee it will be the 
     <lb/>
     responsibility of hon. members to look at the 
     <lb/>
     terms set out in the schedule annexed to the 
     <lb/>
     bill and determine whether those terms will 
     <lb/>
     be of mutual advantage to the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada and to the people of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     in their desire to be united with the people 
     <lb/>
     of Canada.

     Motion agreed to, on division, bill read the 
     <lb/>
     second time and the house went into com<lb break="no"/>mittee thereon, Mr. Macdonald (Brantford

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: As hon. members will 
     <lb/>
     see, there is only one section to this bill, 
     <lb/>
     which asserts that the terms set out in the 
     <lb/>
     agreement are approved. I think probably 
     <lb/>
     it would be more satisfactory to hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers if the terms were first read so that hon. 
     <lb/>
     members would know what is implied in ap<lb break="no"/>proving or refusing to approve these terms. 
     <lb/>
     I would suggest that we suspend considera<lb break="no"/>tion of section 1 of the bill and immediately 
     <lb/>
     give consideration to the terms of union.

     The Chairman: Then clause 1 of the bill 
     <lb/>
     stands, and the preamble to the schedule will 
     <lb/>
     also stand until we have considered the sec<lb break="no"/>tions of the schedule. Is it the wish of the 
     <lb/>
     committee that we consider the schedule under 
     <lb/>
     headings? For example, the first heading is 
     <lb/>
     "Union" and includes sections 1 and 2 of the 
     <lb/>
     schedule.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DIEF1">Mr. Diefenbaker</persName>: I was just wondering 
     <lb/>
     whether it would not be better to take the 
     <lb/>
     preamble first, for the reason that certain 
     <lb/>
     questions arise in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     preamble which might be cleared away at 
     <lb/>
     this time.

     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: I think the suggestion of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Lake Centre is that we 
     <lb/>
     consider the preamble of the schedule, not 
     <lb/>
     the preamble of the bill. I may be mistaken, 
     <lb/>
     but I have always taken it that standing 
     <lb/>
     order 76 referred to the preamble of a bill. 
     <lb/>
     Here the preamble of the schedule is part of 
     <lb/>
     a document which, coming to us in the form 
     <lb/>
     it does, has to be taken or rejected as it is, 
     <lb/>
     because it is an agreement made with another 
     <lb/>
     party which is submitted for approval. It 
     <lb/>
     can be approved or disapproved; parliament 
     <lb/>
     can say it will not approve this one but that 
     <lb/>
     it would be perhaps disposed to approve one 
     <lb/>
     that contained something else, but in that 
     <lb/>
     event the bill would be defeated and this 
     <lb/>
     agreement would not be approved. It seems 
     <lb/>
     to me there is some value in the suggestion 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. member for Lake Centre, because 
     <lb/>
     I think the facts alleged in the preamble help 
     <lb/>
     us to understand the terms of the agreement. 
     <lb/>
     Even if it were necessary to have unanimous 
     <lb/>
     consent to do so, I would suggest that such 
     <lb/>
     unanimous consent might be given and that 
     <lb/>
     we take up the preamble of the schedule 
     <lb/>
     before attempting to deal with the individual 
     <lb/>
     terms.

     The Chairman: Then it is agreed that the 
     <lb/>
     preamble to the schedule be considered now.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DIEF1">Mr. Diefenbaker</persName>: Mr. Chairman, the pre<lb break="no"/>amble generally deals with the discussions 
     <lb/>
     that took place with members of the national 
     <lb/>
     convention of Newfoundland, and also the 
     <lb/>
     submissions made and the arrangements 
     <lb/>
     entered into at the discussions which took 
     <lb/>
     place between the governments of the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom and Canada and the representatives 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland. Yesterday my leader made 
     <lb/>
     clear that we in this house had but one matter 
     <lb/>
     to determine, and that was the question of 
     <lb/>
     whether or not we favoured consummation of 
     <lb/>
     the dream of confederation by the inclusion 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That, of course, is the legal and parliament<lb break="no"/>ary position. But in addition to the legal 
     <lb/>
     position, as I see it there is also a moral 
     <lb/>
     responsibility resting upon this parliament to 
     <lb/>
     remove or alleviate any causes of discontent 
     <lb/>
     on the part of the very large minority who 
     <lb/>
     voted in the negative during the two refer<lb break="no"/>endums. The essence of democracy is a 
     <lb/>
     recognition of the need to preserve the rights

of minorities. Dictatorship denies that minori<lb break="no"/>ties have rights and, as far as minorities are 
     <lb/>concerned, those rights are determined by 
     <lb/>the simple process of coercion. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     On June 19 of last year I asked the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. Prime Minister a number of questions in 
     <lb/>
     regard to the proceedings that led up to the 
     <lb/>
     question of confederation between Newfound<lb break="no"/>land and Canada. At page 5545 of <hi rendition="simple:italic">Hansard</hi> 
     <lb/>
     for last year the right hon. gentleman used 
     <lb/>
     these words: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The British North America Act contemplated that 
     <lb/>
     there might be union between Canada and New<lb break="no"/>foundland on a joint address of the houses of par<lb break="no"/>liament of Canada and the legislature of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land. That principle could be resorted to; but it 
     <lb/>
     would require, in order to be resorted to, the 
     <lb/>
     restoration of self-government in Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     and then joint addresses under the terms of section 
     <lb/>
     146 of the British North America Act. On those 
     <lb/>
     joint addresses, union could be consummated by 
     <lb/>
     order of His Majesty in council without legislation 
     <lb/>
     in the parliament at Westminster or legislation in 
     <lb/>
     the parliament of Canada. But if that method is not 
     <lb/>
     resorted to, the matter is not expressly provided for 
     <lb/>
     and would have to be accomplished by new legis<lb break="no"/>lation that could, I suppose, be adopted only by the 
     <lb/>
     parliament at Westminster if there were joint add<lb break="no"/>resses from the houses of the Canadian parliament

     Then he goes on to set out in detail the 
     <lb/>
     usual processes. Once more I should like to 
     <lb/>
     point out that we in this parliament recog<lb break="no"/>nize with pride the fact that the hopes of the 
     <lb/>
     fathers of confederation are about to be con<lb break="no"/>summated. The acquisition of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     will take its place, in strategic importance, 
     <lb/>
     with the acquisition by the United States of 
     <lb/>
     Alaska and Louisiana. It is actually the 
     <lb/>
     completion of that unity which caused Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Galt, as he then was, to say at the time of 
     <lb/>
     confederation:

            <p>
     In taking up that burden, in welcoming 
     <lb/>
     those who heretofore have belonged to a

     <lb/>
     want to be sure that these new citizens who

     unity, thereby making their contribution to 
     <lb/>
     the strength, power and destiny of this con<lb break="no"/>federation. For that reason I bring up these 
     <lb/>
     questions, because as I read the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act the procedure followed here was 
     <lb/>
     never contemplated. Section 146 contem<lb break="no"/>plated only one procedure, much different

     from that now being adopted.

            <p>
     With a view to ameliorating the causes of 
     <lb/>
     division and bringing into this confederation 
     <lb/>
     the people of Newfoundland in that spirit of 
     <lb/>
     dedication to our common destiny, I ask cer<lb break="no"/>tain questions by way of explanation. I 
     <lb/>
     believe that the answers to these questions, 
     <lb/>
     properly given by the Prime Minister of this 
     <lb/>
     country, will go far to remove the causes of 
     <lb/>
     the discontent which now exists in New<lb break="no"/>


            <cb/>
        

     foundland, which cannot be denied and 
     <lb/>
     cannot be answered by a refusal to face the 
     <lb/>
     facts. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I ask, first, in view of the fact that under 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland Act, 1933, and the commis<lb break="no"/>sion report at that time, it was contemplated 
     <lb/>
     that responsible government would be 
     <lb/>
     restored, why is it that the plan of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion as provided for under section 146 of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act has not, in fact, 
     <lb/>
     been followed in this case? Secondly, what 
     <lb/>
     has the Canadian government done to remove 
     <lb/>
     the reasons for the objections that have been 
     <lb/>
     made by that very large minority that showed 
     <lb/>
     its strength in the vote on the two references? 
     <lb/>
     Thirdly, have any representations been 
     <lb/>
     received in opposition to the course followed 
     <lb/>
     by the Canadian government from groups of 
     <lb/>
     individuals in Newfoundland claiming to 
     <lb/>
     represent the seventy odd thousand who voted 
     <lb/>
     for the restoration of responsible government? 
     <lb/>
     If such representations have been made, 
     <lb/>
     would the Prime Minister table them and also 
     <lb/>
     table the replies given in reference thereto? 
     <lb/>
     Fourthly, and I think it is very important, the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition has made clear that 
     <lb/>
     our responsibility as Canadians is to vote on 
     <lb/>
     this legislation and in no way to infringe 
     <lb/>
     upon the sovereignty of another dominion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Recognizing that, I should like to ask this 
     <lb/>
     question. In view of the fact that Newfound<lb break="no"/>landers will now become Canadians, and the 
     <lb/>
     desire of each of us must be to remove any pos<lb break="no"/>sibility of disunity by reason of the fact that 
     <lb/>
     the government has not followed the scheme 
     <lb/>
     set forth in the British North America Act 
     <lb/>
     to cover possible union in the future, has this 
     <lb/>
     government made any representations to the 
     <lb/>
     British government regarding the question 
     <lb/>
     whether or not it would be preferable that 
     <lb/>
     responsible government be restored in New<lb break="no"/>foundland prior to the matter of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion being discussed in this house? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think an answer to those questions would 
     <lb/>
     go a long way towards arousing the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland to a realization that we in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, in welcoming them, want them to 
     <lb/>
     realize that in no action we take are we 
     <lb/>
     endeavouring to control their destiny with<lb break="no"/>out a recognition of their rights.

     <persName ref="pers:CHUR1">Mr. Church</persName>: In passing Bill No. 11 you are

     <lb/>
     the criminal law, the civil law, the law of 
     <lb/>
     patents, the law of trade-marks and many 
     <lb/>
     other matters. I do not wish to take any fur<lb break="no"/>ther part in the debate on the control bill,

     Last night I read a statement by the 
     <lb/>
     attorney general of England, Sir Hartley 
     <lb/>
     Shawcross, in an address at Lincoln's Inn, in 
 

            <pb n="341" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-02-08_Page_0341.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">FEBRUARY 8, 1949</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">Newfoundland</hi></fw> <fw type="num">341</fw> 
 

     which he complained about the costs of law. 
     <lb/>
     He said that it was too complicated, the 
     <lb/>
     procedure too involved for the ordinary liti<lb break="no"/>gant to be able to afford court costs. It is 
     <lb/>
     this type of thing we are passing on to the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland under Bill 11. 
     <lb/>
     Nothing is being done to rectify these con<lb break="no"/>ditions in Canada. Reference has been 
     <lb/>
     made by Sir Hartley to the shocking state of 
     <lb/>
     statute law in England. The criminal code 
     <lb/>
     even in Canada has not been revised by the 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons since its inception in 1905. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     In a radio address reported in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Daily 
     <lb/>
     Telegraph</hi>, Mr. Churchill spoke of the need 
     <lb/>
     for legal reform. In the same article it was 
     <lb/>
     reported that he said the same thing in a 
     <lb/>
     radio address on March 2 last. Mr. Churchill 
     <lb/>
     was complaining about the very same thing, 
     <lb/>
     the cost of litigation. There were 25,000 new 
     <lb/>
     rules, orders in council and so on, and no one 
     <lb/>
     can tell about their validity until the court 
     <lb/>
     of last resort has been reached. He said that 
     <lb/>
     only about five of these orders in council had 
     <lb/>
     been considered by the Supreme Court of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Last night, I asked about the difference 
     <lb/>
     between that kind of rule and the lucidity of 
     <lb/>
     the divine laws. I am reading something 
     <lb/>
     from the twelfth chapter of St. Luke in which 
     <lb/>
     lawyers were reproved. I wish to quote the 
     <lb/>
     following verses: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     44. Woe unto you. scribes and Pharisees. hypo<lb break="no"/>crites! for ye are as graves which appear not. and 
     <lb/>
     the men that walk over them are not aware of them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     45. Then answered one of the lawyers, and said 
     <lb/>
     unto him, Master. thus saying thou reproachest us 
     <lb/>also.</p>

            <p>46. And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for<lb/>ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and<lb/>ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of<lb/>your fingers.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     52. Woe unto you. lawyers! for ye have taken 
     <lb/>
     away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in 
     <lb/>
     yourselves. and them that were entering in ye 
     <lb/>
     hindered. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     So, you see, we have a divine rule relating 
     <lb/>
     to lawyers who are needed in the law courts. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In 1491 BC. the ten commandments were 
     <lb/>
     laid down by Moses from Mount Sinai, yet 
     <lb/>
     their lucidity is amazing. Everybody under<lb break="no"/>stands them. Now, there is a conflict between 
     <lb/>
     divine law and constitutional law. Any 
     <lb/>
     minister or member of the government knows 
     <lb/>
     that he must follow constitutional practice. 
     <lb/>
     A government which does otherwise is pro<lb break="no"/>ceeding unconstitutionally, as a great lawyer 
     <lb/>
     in England, P. St. George Kirke, said. It is 
     <lb/>
     difficult for us, men of all occupations, to 
     <lb/>
     decide what should be done about the criminal 
     <lb/>
     law, civil law and matters of the kind. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Last night I referred to a town in England, 
     <lb/>
     called Stevenage, which had been planned by 
     <lb/>
     the Labour government. They tore down the 
     <lb/>
     old buildings and started something else. An 
     <lb/>
     appeal was taken to the law courts. A judge 


            <cb/>

of the lower courts expressed the opinion that 
     <lb/>nothing like it had been done since the time 
     <lb/>of Ahab, who was a king of Samaria, when 
     <lb/>he took Naboth's vineyard. But Ahab gave 
     <lb/>Naboth compensation for it. Of all the judges 
     <lb/>in England, there was only one county court 
     <lb/>judge who questioned these rules and regu<lb break="no"/>lations of statute law. He said that this 
     <lb/>statute law conflicted with the eighth, ninth 
     <lb/>and tenth commandments which are as 
     <lb/>follows: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Thou shalt not steal. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Thou shalt not bear false witness— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Thou shalt not covet— 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>


            <p>
     The county court judge referred to that, 
     <lb/>
     and he did something which was 'very fine 
     <lb/>
     indeed. This shows the need for law reform 
     <lb/>
     in this country as well. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Another matter came up which I should 
     <lb/>
     like to mention, and with that I shall con<lb break="no"/>clude. This matter came up in connection 
     <lb/>
     with the nationalization of a very important 
     <lb/>
     industry in Great Britain. A billion dollars 
     <lb/>
     of paper money was issued. It is turned out 
     <lb/>
     by printing presses and adds nothing to the 
     <lb/>
     national wealth of the country. After depre<lb break="no"/>ciating a person's investment, the govern<lb break="no"/>ment compels him to take that particular 
     <lb/>
     type of money. What chance have the people 
     <lb/>
     in the law courts when the judges over there 
     <lb/>
     do not act? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The other matter about which I wanted to 
     <lb/>
     speak was with regard to patents and inven<lb break="no"/>tions. The law regarding patents and 
     <lb/>
     inventions mentions a seal. The law is set 
     <lb/>
     out in the 15th chapter of Genesis, verses 
     <lb/>
     5 to 18. God made a covenant with Abraham. 
     <lb/>
     That was the authorship of that seal. What 
     <lb/>
     did the inventors get? They have been inter<lb break="no"/>fered with; something has been written into 
     <lb/>
     the law which should not have been put in. 
     <lb/>
     The patentees have been interfered with. 
     <lb/>
     The patentee was to get all the rights and 
     <lb/>
     privileges under the patent. Every patent 
     <lb/>
     had been granted by the king and the 
     <lb/>
     crown to the patentee. It is issued by the 
     <lb/>
     crown under the royal seal which goes with 
     <lb/>
     this patent or trade-mark, the patentee to 
     <lb/>
     have and enjoy the whole profit and advan<lb break="no"/>tage from time to time accruing by reason of 
     <lb/>
     the said invention during the time of sixteen 
     <lb/>
     years. What is being done? Inventors are 
     <lb/>
     being driven out of Great Britain, and here 
     <lb/>
     in Canada they are being driven to the 
     <lb/>
     United States by the same factors, by the 
     <lb/>
     control system, income tax and surtax up to 
     <lb/>
     a large sum of money. The surtax is 2 1/2; per 
     <lb/>
     cent. The result is that inventors are leaving 
     <lb/>
     this country and are going to a free country, 
     <lb/>
     namely the United States. The inventors are 
     <lb/>
     also leaving Britain with the same object in 
     <lb/>
     View. I commend the changes made in this 
     <lb/>
     law. In conclusion, I can only say that these 
     <lb/>
     instances I have given are violations of the

     eighth, ninth and tenth commandments: thou

     government is doing with regard to patents 
     <lb/>
     and trade-marks under the law as it is. The 
     <lb/>
     lawyers know something about that. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p> I do not wish to criticize the high court 
     <lb/>judges. Far from it. I can tell hon. members, 
     <lb/>however, that we have no real law reform 
     <lb/>in this country. For many years past I have 
     <lb/>been trying to get some. It is a forgotten 
     <lb/>subject here. We should have a committee 
     <lb/>to go over these legal bills and see that we 
     <lb/>get some reform. With the complexity of the 
     <lb/>law, with the maelstrom of red tape and the 
     <lb/>cobwebs in it, I can tell hon. members that 
     <lb/>it is a relic of other days. In England, as a 
     <lb/>result of the summary offenders act, half the 
     <lb/>prisons have been closed. How? The people 
     <lb/>are given time to pay. Yet we have no law 
     <lb/>reform in Canada of the criminal law which 
     <lb/>we are to pass on to Newfoundland according 
     <lb/>to this bill. In Toronto we built the Toronto 
     <lb/>jail, the jail farm on Yonge street for men 
     <lb/>and the jail farm for women three miles from 
     <lb/>there at Concord. The government here, 
     <lb/>through one of the departments, have taken 
     <lb/>those two new jail farms. I do not know 
     <lb/>why that was done. I can tell hon. members 
     <lb/>that 400 people have been crowded into the 
     <lb/>Toronto jail. It was built after 1867 for use 
     <lb/>only for remands, and is fit for no more than 
     <lb/>200 persons. We have been trying to get 
     <lb/>something done, and we did get something 
     <lb/>done by establishing these two jail farms. If 
     <lb/>that is the kind of law reform that is to be 
     <lb/>passed on to Newfoundland, it is another 
     <lb/>matter. Having explained these matters, and 
     <lb/>pointed out the urgent need for law reform in 
     <lb/>this country, I suggest that we should have 
     <lb/>a legal committee to go over every one of 
     <lb/>these laws every year in order to see that we 
     <lb/>get some real law reform.

     <persName ref="pers:MACI1">Mr. MacInnis</persName>: Mr. Speaker, I want to 
     <lb/>
     say a few words along the same lines as those 
     <lb/>
     spoken by the hon. member for Lake Centre 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Diefenbaker), although I am not taking 
     <lb/>
     the same position. Indeed, I am taking the 
     <lb/>
     opposite one. I am speaking not in criticism 
     <lb/>
     of what he said but because two members 
     <lb/>
     from this group spoke along the same lines 
     <lb/>
     in the debate yesterday. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
      <persName ref="pers:DIEF1">Mr. Diefenbaker</persName>: I merely asked ques<lb break="no"/>tions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACI1">Mr. MacInnis</persName>: Yes, I quite understand. It 
     <lb/>
     seems to me that we are going a little bit too 
     <lb/>
     far when we say that the fathers of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion could lay down the procedure by which 
     <lb/>
     the dominion of Newfoundland, some eighty 
     <lb/>
     years later, could come into confederation. It 
     <lb/>
     is true that a procedure was laid down in the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act, but when that 


            <cb/>
      

     procedure was laid down it could not be fore<lb break="no"/>seen that the dominion of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>would not have a responsible government in 
     <lb/>1949 when its entry into confederation was 
     <lb/>being considered. That is one of the points 
     <lb/>I wish to make. There is so much unanimity 
     <lb/>in this house on the desirability of New<lb break="no"/>foundland joining with Canada that I think 
     <lb/>it would be a mistake to indulge in criticism 
     <lb/>that can lead nowhere; because, in my 
     <lb/>opinion, there is nothing this parliament can 
     <lb/>or could do in the matters complained of. I 
     <lb/>am not attempting to defend the government 
     <lb/>in what it has done. It does not need my 
     <lb/>defence, because .it has plenty of supporters 
     <lb/>on its own side quite able to defend its 
     <lb/>actions. I do not believe it was up to this 
     <lb/>government to suggest to the government of 
     <lb/>the United Kingdom that it should restore 
     <lb/>responsible government to Newfoundland to 
     <lb/>enable it to negotiate with the government of 
     <lb/>Canada. I am not well versed in how these 
     <lb/>things are done, but I do not believe that it 
     <lb/>would be proper for the Dominion of Canada 
     <lb/>to make proposals of that kind to the United 
     <lb/>Kingdom government. There were two refer<lb break="no"/>endum votes taken on this question by the 
     <lb/>people of Newfoundland. According to the 
     <lb/>system of voting followed, both votes were 
     <lb/>opposed to the reconstitution of responsible 
     <lb/>government. The first vote was on three 
     <lb/>questions: the commission form of govern<lb break="no"/>ment, responsible government and confed<lb break="no"/>eration. Responsible government received 
     <lb/>the largest vote. But it was stipulated that 
     <lb/>it would require to have an over-all major<lb break="no"/>ity. The first vote then stood at 85,000 to 
     <lb/>69,000 against responsible government. In 
     <lb/>the next vote the situation was somewhat 
     <lb/>similar. Confederation carried by quite a 
     <lb/>reasonable majority. If an hon. member 
     <lb/>came to this house with as clear a majority 
     <lb/>as confederation received I believe he would 
     <lb/>think that he was quite justified in speaking 
     <lb/>for the electors of his constituency. There 
     <lb/>is only one logical conclusion to the criticism 
     <lb/>of how the negotiations were carried out, and 
     <lb/>I do not think any hon. member would want 
     <lb/>to accept that conclusion because, in the first 
     <lb/>place, it would delay confederation and in my 
     <lb/>opinion the results would be the same as they 
     <lb/>are now. That conclusion is to have another 
     <lb/>referendum taken by the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland with the exact terms of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion before them. They should be asked 
     <lb/>whether they want confederation or not. 
     <lb/>That is the logical conclusion to the criticism 
     <lb/>made by the hon. member for Lake Centre 
     <lb/>and the two hon. members from my own 
     <lb/>party. I do not think anyone would suggest 
     <lb/>that seriously as a solution, if a solution is 
     <lb/>required, or if we want to insist that a greater

     degree of democracy should be used in the 
     <lb/>
     circumstances. I believe that the procedure 
     <lb/>
     followed, namely a referendum vote of the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland, was a democratic 
     <lb/>
     one. There may be a difference of opinion 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland between those who wanted 
     <lb/>
     responsible government and those who wanted 
     <lb/>
     confederation, but I do not believe that the 
     <lb/>
     best way to smooth out those differences 
     <lb/>
     of opinion, and put an end to any bad feeling 
     <lb/>
     that may still exist, is to keep harping on it 
     <lb/>
     in this house. Let us get ahead with the 
     <lb/>
     terms of confederation as quickly as possible, 
     <lb/>
     and when we bring Newfoundland into con<lb break="no"/>federation with the rest of Canada I hope 
     <lb/>
     that neither they nor we will ever regret it.

     <persName ref="pers:DORI2">Mr. Dorion</persName>: Mr. Speaker, the bill now under 
     <lb/>
     consideration will undoubtedly assume con<lb break="no"/>siderable importance in the annals of this 
     <lb/>
     country. I therefore feel it only proper 
     <lb/>
     that, upon the entry of the new province into 
     <lb/>
     confederation, a small part at least of the 
     <lb/>
     debate in the house be carried out in French, 
     <lb/>
     so that our future fellow citizens may remem<lb break="no"/>ber that Canada has two official languages.

     The few comments I wish to make in con<lb break="no"/>nection with the preamble of this bill are as

     follows: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Following the statements made by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Lake Centre (Mr. Diefenbaker), 
     <lb/>
     I must first agree with the view he has 
     <lb/>
     expressed, and maintain that, in so far as 
     <lb/>
     the entry of Newfoundland into confedera<lb break="no"/>tion is concerned, we should have been gov<lb break="no"/>erned by the stipulations not of an ordinary 
     <lb/>
     statute, but of that basic, fundamental law 
     <lb/>
     which governed the birth of Canada, the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act. As we all know, 
     <lb/>
     section 146 of the act provides for the entry 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland into confederation. It is 
     <lb/>
     probably expedient to recall it.

     I must point out, Mr. Speaker, that this has 
     <lb/>
     already been done. Indeed, when British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia joined confederation in 1871, the 
     <lb/>
     process followed was that provided in the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act. The preamble 
     <lb/>
     of the order of Her Majesty in council, dated 
     <lb/>
     May 16, 1871, states unequivocally:

     And later when Prince Edward Island

     America Act was once more complied with. 
     <lb/>
     The procedure followed was that which is

     outlined in section 146. The preamble to the

            <p>
     In my opinion, Mr. Speaker, the new bill 
     <lb/>
     before the house is a further departure from 
     <lb/>
     the provisions of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act and I take the liberty of drawing the 
     <lb/>
     attention of hon. members to that fact. When 
     <lb/>
     one is aware of the present government's 
     <lb/>
     ideas on centralization, this breach assumes a 
     <lb/>
     great deal of importance. Not only do the 
     <lb/>
     government deliberately overrule a section of 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act, but they dis<lb break="no"/>regard explicit undertakings agreed upon 
     <lb/>
     since 1934 with the people of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     In November 1933 Newfoundland's legislative 
     <lb/>
     assembly requested the suspension of its 
     <lb/>
     letters patent, and the said act was ratified 
     <lb/>
     by the British parliament. The act passed 
     <lb/>
     by the assembly of Newfoundland included 
     <lb/>
     the following proviso:

            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

            <p>
     In 1945, in violation of this agreement— 
     <lb/>
     since it actually was an agreement between 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland legislature and the British 
     <lb/>
     parliament—the commonwealth relations 
     <lb/>
     office, through the government commission, 
     <lb/>
     decided to call a national convention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Members of this convention were elected 
     <lb/>
     during the summer of 1946 and on February 
     <lb/>
     8, 1947, the convention decided to send a 
     <lb/>
     delegation to Ottawa to examine the condi<lb break="no"/>tions under which Newfoundland might 
     <lb/>
     possibly enter confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     After the lengthy discussions with which 
     <lb/>
     we are familiar, proposals were submitted by 
     <lb/>
     Canada and there occurred at this stage a 
     <lb/>
     rather important development: the proposals 
     <lb/>
     made by Canada to the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     national convention that had been called in 
     <lb/>
     the summer of 1946 were implicitly rejected, 
     <lb/>
     since it was decided to submit to the people 
     <lb/>
     two questions only: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     First, were the electors in favour of respon<lb break="no"/>sible government and second did they favour 
     <lb/>
     a commission of government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This means that the national convention, 
     <lb/>
     having been apprized of the proposals made 
     <lb/>
     by Canada, had decided to ask the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, by means of a referendum, if 
     <lb/>
     they wished to return to their pre-1933 type 
     <lb/>
     of administration or whether they were con<lb break="no"/>tent to keep the system which had been in 
     <lb/>
     force since that date. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What happened then? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The British government, without consulting 
     <lb/>
     anybody in Newfoundland, without the appro<lb break="no"/>val of anyone there, or, at any rate without 
     <lb/>
     the approval of any legally constituted body, 
     <lb/>
     decided to put three questions to the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland, in spite of what had been 
     <lb/>
     formerly decided upon by the national con<lb break="no"/>vention. This is how the first referendum 
     <lb/>
     came about. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, evidently, the only legally organized 
     <lb/>
     body which at the time could speak on behalf 
     <lb/>
     of the people of Newfoundland was this 
     <lb/>
     national convention, and that is why, contrary 
     <lb/>
     to the wishes and decisions of that conven<lb break="no"/>tion, the British government resolved to put 
     <lb/>
     three questions to the people of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land in the referendum of June 1948. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I submit that this decision by the British 
     <lb/>
     government was irregular, even illegal and 


            <cb/>
 

     unjustified. In my opinion, it would be 
     <lb/>
     interesting to know what interests were then 
     <lb/>
     at stake, what lobbying took place about 
     <lb/>
     which no report has reached us. Why did 
     <lb/>
     British interests decide to put the third ques<lb break="no"/>tion to the people of Newfoundland so that 
     <lb/>
     they could answer whether or not they 
     <lb/>
     favoured the entry of the island into con<lb break="no"/>federation? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     It would surely be interesting to know 
     <lb/>
     what must have taken place at the time, 
     <lb/>
     about which we have not been told anything. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     And so on June 3, 1948, when the first 
     <lb/>
     referendum took place, there were 22,311 
     <lb/>
     votes cast for the commission government, 
     <lb/>
     64,066 for confederation with Canada and 
     <lb/>
     69,400 for responsible government. Here I 
     <lb/>
     ask myself this question: On what grounds, 
     <lb/>
     under what statute, legislation or authority 
     <lb/>
     was the result of the first referendum dis<lb break="no"/>regarded and a second one held? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If the result of the first referendum, in 
     <lb/>
     which responsible government received a 
     <lb/>
     majority, had been complied with, conditions 
     <lb/>
     would have become again as they were before 
     <lb/>
     1933. The government of Canada could then 
     <lb/>
     have dealt with the established responsible 
     <lb/>
     government according to the rules set forth 
     <lb/>
     in the British North America Act. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Why was the result of that vote disregard<lb break="no"/>ed? On what grounds? Under what author<lb break="no"/>ity? We do not know. All we know is that 
     <lb/>
     the second referendum took place on July 22, 
     <lb/>
     1948. At that time 78,323 votes were cast for 
     <lb/>
     confederation with Canada and 71,334 for 
     <lb/>
     responsible government, a majority for con<lb break="no"/>federation with Canada of 7,000 votes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But it must be noted that only 78,323 votes 
     <lb/>
     favoured the entry of. Newfoundland into con<lb break="no"/>federation and the electoral list comprised 
     <lb/>
     176,297 electors. Therefore if the first result 
     <lb/>
     had not been satisfactory because there had 
     <lb/>
     not been an absolute majority, the same prin<lb break="no"/>ciple could have applied to the second refer<lb break="no"/>endum, and the latter might conceivably nave 
     <lb/>
     been rejected, in view of the fact that the 
     <lb/>
     results were far from expressing the will of 
     <lb/>
     an absolute majority of the electors. It must 
     <lb/>
     also be noted how the appeal was made to 
     <lb/>
     the electors in favour of the entry of New<lb break="no"/>foundland into confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have here an article written by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Camille l'Heureux in <hi rendition="simple:italic">Le Droit</hi> of November

     All kinds of abuses crept into the pre-referendum 
     <lb/>
     campaign. Aided and abetted by members of the 
     <lb/>
     commission government, the advocates of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion openly led an intensive campaign of scandal, 
     <lb/>
     trickery and sectarianism. The propaganda in favour 
     <lb/>
     of responsible government was not only delayed in 
     <lb/>
     post offices but in many cases it was destroyed. The 
     <lb/>
     responsible government league goes so far as to 
     <lb/>
     accuse the leaders of those who advocate confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, of pitting Orangemen again Roman Catholics 
     <lb/>
     on the island. In this connection, the league quotes 
     <lb/>
     the rallying cry given its members by the Grand 
     <lb/>
     Master.

            <p>
     However, it happened that Canada accepted 
     <lb/>
     that second vote which was taken on July 22, 
     <lb/>
     1948, and after such irregularities, after that 
     <lb/>
     infringement of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act, we are now told that things must be 
     <lb/>
     done quickly, that the debate must necessarily 
     <lb/>
     be shortened, so that Newfoundland's entry 
     <lb/>
     may be decided as soon as possible. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     That is not satisfactory, especially since the 
     <lb/>
     scanty details we have been able to obtain 
     <lb/>
     do not permit us to size up the extent of the 
     <lb/>
     burden which the entry of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     into the confederation will mean for the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian ratepayers. I submit that we have not 
     <lb/>
     been given all the information which would 
     <lb/>
     enable us to analyse the importance of the 
     <lb/>
     action we are going to take, because if we are 
     <lb/>
     to rely on what the press has brought to our 
     <lb/>
     knowledge on various occasions, it would 
     <lb/>
     appear that Newfoundland's entry into con<lb break="no"/>federation is going to be exceedingly costly 
     <lb/>
     for us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Here, Mr. Chairman, there is a third point 
     <lb/>
     I wish to make. As the cost of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land's entry into confederation will no doubt 
     <lb/>
     come out of the present revenues of the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian government, it is clear that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment will draw from the income tax as well as 
     <lb/>
     from all other existing revenues, a consider<lb break="no"/>able part of which belongs to the provinces, 
     <lb/>
     and that is why we were and still are right 
     <lb/>
     in claiming that the provinces should have 
     <lb/>
     been consulted. The province of Quebec espe<lb break="no"/>cially should have been consulted, because of 
     <lb/>
     the marking of boundaries between Labrador 
     <lb/>
     and that province, which is a matter included 
     <lb/>
     in this bill. No doubt that is why the premier 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec used these words which I quote 
     <lb/>
     from a statement he made on November 8, 
     <lb/>
     1947: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     That is a problem of the highest importance, con<lb break="no"/>cerning as it does all provinces in Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     especially the province of Quebec. It seems to me 
     <lb/>
     altogether discourteous for the federal authorities 
     <lb/>
     to take such important action without even consult<lb break="no"/>ing provincial authorities. particularly those of the

            <cb/>
   
yesterday to show- why we should have 
     <lb/>this union, but more important than trade, 
     <lb/>more important than national defence is 
     <lb/>something else which has not yet been pre<lb break="no"/>sented to this committee. I refer to the 
     <lb/>religious union that exists already between 
     <lb/>Canada and Newfoundland. I can give you 
     <lb/>a concrete example. The advisory board of 
     <lb/>the Salvation Army, of which I am a member, 
     <lb/>has jurisdiction over Canada, Newfoundland 
     <lb/>and Bermuda. Perhaps this is one of the 
     <lb/>indirect reasons why we are to have union 
     <lb/>at this time. I say that when the Christian 
     <lb/>church leads, all others can intelligently 
     <lb/>follow.

     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: The hon. member for Lake 
     <lb/>
     Centre asked certain questions. I have not 
     <lb/>
     all the material here but in order that the 
     <lb/>
     record may not appear incomplete I shall 
     <lb/>
     attempt to give a provisional answer. First, I 
     <lb/>
     should like to say that I appreciate the atti<lb break="no"/>tude which has been taken by hon. members 
     <lb/>
     in respect of this proposal. Personally I share 
     <lb/>
     the views expressed by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Vancouver East, that it is not apt to be 
     <lb/>
     helpful, in eradicating the irritation that 
     <lb/>
     naturally comes from losing out in any 
     <lb/>
     contest by popular vote, to be constantly 
     <lb/>
     referring to that fact. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Rules were set for this matter. It so hap<lb break="no"/>pens that there was a substantial minority 
     <lb/>
     that did not have its way and that would 
     <lb/>
     now like to see the thing started over again. 
     <lb/>
     There are some people who would like to 
     <lb/>
     see a more recent test determined by a vote 
     <lb/>
     started over again, but that is not the way 
     <lb/>
     democracies work. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In this case there was originally an under<lb break="no"/>taking by the government of the United King<lb break="no"/>dom—I am not attempting to make a defence 
     <lb/>
     of the government of the United Kingdom, I 
     <lb/>
     am simply stating the facts which I think 
     <lb/>
     afford justification—to restore responsible 
     <lb/>
     government to Newfoundland on demand or 
     <lb/>
     on request—I do not remember exactly what 
     <lb/>
     the terms were—when the situation had 
     <lb/>
     improved. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In December, 1945, the government of the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom decided—there was no other 
     <lb/>
     government in Newfoundland at that time than 
     <lb/>
     the commission of government composed of 
     <lb/>
     a governor appointed by the United Kingdom, 
     <lb/>
     three residents of the United Kingdom, and 
     <lb/>
     three residents of Newfoundland—that they 
     <lb/>
     were not the ones to make the request for the 
     <lb/>
     restoration of responsible government and 
     <lb/>
     determined that there would be a national

convention, elected by the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, to consider the form of their 
     <lb/>future government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That convention was elected. After it had 
     <lb/>
     investigated the financial situation and so 
     <lb/>
     forth its findings were made public. Then the 
     <lb/>
     government of Newfoundland said: We will 
     <lb/>
     ask the people themselves whether they want 
     <lb/>
     responsible government, a continuation of the 
     <lb/>
     commission of government, or confederation 
     <lb/>
     with Canada. In view of the fact that three 
     <lb/>
     questions were to be submitted, they said, if 
     <lb/>
     there is not an absolute majority in favour of 
     <lb/>
     any one there will have to be a second 
     <lb/>
     referendum. There was a vote but there was 
     <lb/>
     no absolute majority in favour of any of the 
     <lb/>
     three questions, and a second referendum was 
     <lb/>
     held. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On that second occasion the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, instead of saying that they wanted 
     <lb/>
     responsible government restored, decided 
     <lb/>
     against it. In the first referendum some of 
     <lb/>
     them had wanted responsible government 
     <lb/>
     restored, but they were not a majority of 
     <lb/>
     those who voted. In the second referendum 
     <lb/>
     the majority said: No, we do not want respon<lb break="no"/>sible government restored; we want union 
     <lb/>
     with Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Twenty-five members of the convention 
     <lb/>
     voted against the submission of the proposal 
     <lb/>
     of the convention and I am rather surprised 
     <lb/>
     at the attitude taken by the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Charlevoix-Saguenay that there was no 
     <lb/>
     justification for putting the question to the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland. The national con<lb break="no"/>vention was merely a convention to inquire 
     <lb/>
     into the situation and to make recommenda<lb break="no"/>tions; it was not even a legislative body. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     In the absence of any legislative body other 
     <lb/>
     than the commission of government, which was 
     <lb/>
     not representative, and a referendum having 
     <lb/>
     been submitted to the people, it seems to me 
     <lb/>
     that the result of that referendum was a 
     <lb/>
     democratic expression of what the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland wanted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I shall deal with the other questions at 
     <lb/>
     eight o'clock. I appreciate that the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Lake Centre is as desirous as any of 
     <lb/>
     us here to have union accomplished under 
     <lb/>
     such terms as will leave the least possible 
     <lb/>
     resentment in the minds of the new Canad<lb break="no"/>ians who are joining our nation.

     can throw on the fact the greater help will be 
     <lb/>
     given to dispelling resentment.

            <p><persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: When the committee rose 
     <lb/>at the dinner hour I was proceeding to deal 
     <lb/>with the questions suggested by the hon. 
     <lb/>member for Lake Centre, and I believe I said 
     <lb/>I appreciated that he was putting these ques<lb break="no"/>tions for the purpose of having the facts upon 
     <lb/>the record in the hope that it might dissolve 
     <lb/>some of the resentment felt by those who 
     <lb/>believe some other procedure to achieve con<lb break="no"/>federation should have been followed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     If I understood the hon. member correctly 
     <lb/>
     his first question was why, in view of the 
     <lb/>
     terms of the Newfoundland act of 1933— 
     <lb/>
     which provided that on request of the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland, when their financial situa<lb break="no"/>tion had been restored, they would get back 
     <lb/>
     responsible government—the procedure to 
     <lb/>
     bring about union had not been that con<lb break="no"/>templated in section 146 of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act. That section, as hon. members 
     <lb/>
     will recall, provided that her majesty, on the 
     <lb/>
     advice of her most honourable privy council, 
     <lb/>
     might on the joint addresses of the houses of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian parliament and the houses of 
     <lb/>
     the legislature of Newfoundland or Prince 
     <lb/>
     Edward Island, admit those colonies into 
     <lb/>
     union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think I have dealt with the first part. 
     <lb/>
     We did not consider it would be proper for 
     <lb/>
     us to express any views in respect to the 
     <lb/>
     manner in which the government of the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom and the government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland should carry out the provisions 
     <lb/>
     that had been made in 1933. We constantly 
     <lb/>
     maintained the position that we felt the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian people would be glad to welcome the 
     <lb/>
     entry of Newfoundland into confederation, 
     <lb/>
     but that we should not do anything to influ<lb break="no"/>ence her decision or course of action in the 
     <lb/>
     matter. To be quite frank, I may say we 
     <lb/>
     felt that this would probably be the most 
     <lb/>
     helpful attitude for us to maintain in order 
     <lb/>
     to bring about a desire to join Canada. We 
     <lb/>
     felt that the people of Newfoundland, natur<lb break="no"/>ally proud of their history and the control 
     <lb/>
     over their own affairs which they had up to 
     <lb/>
     1933, would resent any action by the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian government or the Canadian people 
     <lb/>
     which might be construed as expressing an 
     <lb/>
     opinion as to what they should do. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. member for Lake Centre will 
     <lb/>
     remember that we had some exchanges in 
     <lb/>
     that regard at the end of the session of 1948. 
     <lb/>
     He referred to the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Hansard</hi> report of Satur<lb break="no"/>day, June 19, 1948. I will not take time to

     in answering questions put by the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Lake Centre I said our position was 
     <lb/>
     that we felt we should not attempt to inter<lb break="no"/>fere with the discharge of the responsibilities 
     <lb/>
     of the government of the United Kingdom or 
     <lb/>
     the government of Newfoundland, and that 
     <lb/>
     we would scrupulously endeavour to avoid 
     <lb/>
     doing anything which might be construed as 
     <lb/>
     an attempt on our part to dictate to our good 
     <lb/>
     friends of the island. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The situation which presented itself to us 
     <lb/>
     was that the government of the United King<lb break="no"/>dom had requested the election of a national 
     <lb/>
     convention; that this national convention had 
     <lb/>
     passed a resolution requesting the governor 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland to inquire whether the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government would be prepared to 
     <lb/>
     receive a delegation and to explore with that 
     <lb/>
     delegation whether or not there were satis<lb break="no"/>factory terms which could govern the union 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland with Canada. The reply 
     <lb/>
     given was that we would welcome that dele<lb break="no"/>gation. The delegation came. We worked 
     <lb/>
     with them for over three months, and after<lb break="no"/>ward submitted what we then considered 
     <lb/>
     would appear to be fair terms upon which 
     <lb/>
     the union could be consummated. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     We did nothing beyond that at that time. 
     <lb/>
     I'he matter came before the national conven<lb break="no"/>tion; and after discussing the terms a majority 
     <lb/>
     of the national convention voted against 
     <lb/>
     including in the referendum a question as to 
     <lb/>
     whether or not the people would wish to 
     <lb/>
     unite with Canada. I can give this house the 
     <lb/>
     assurance that we expressed no views as to 
     <lb/>
     whether that question should or should not 
     <lb/>
     be included in the ballot. The government 
     <lb/>
     of the United Kingdom decided that, in view 
     <lb/>
     of the number who had voted for its inclu<lb break="no"/>sion in the ballot, and in View of what we 
     <lb/>
     were told, that there were petitions signed 
     <lb/>
     by great numbers in Newfoundland asking 
     <lb/>
     that it should be included, they would sub<lb break="no"/>mit the question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     During the whole of that period we were 
     <lb/>
     maintaining an attitude of the strictest 
     <lb/>
     neutrality, because personally I think many of 
     <lb/>
     us felt that by doing so we would favour the 
     <lb/>
     prospects of union to a greater degree than 
     <lb/>
     if we attempted to say or do anything which 
     <lb/>
     could be construed on the island as showing 
     <lb/>
     a desire to influence their decision in the 
     <lb/>
     matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The question was submitted, with the result 
     <lb/>
     that has been referred to already in the 
     <lb/>
     course of the debate. After the first referen<lb break="no"/>dum a statement was made by my predeces<lb break="no"/>sor, the Prime Minister at that time, that if 
     <lb/>
     on the second ballot the people of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land indicated in a clear and unmistakable 
     <lb/>
     way that they wished to join Canada on sub<lb break="no"/>stantially the terms of the proposal that had 
     <lb/>
     been submitted, the Canadian government 


            <cb/>
    
would co-operate with their representatives 
     <lb/>in giving final form to those terms. If I 
     <lb/>remember correctly the hon. gentleman, or 
     <lb/>some hon. gentleman on the other side, asked 
     <lb/>what would be considered a clear and unmis<lb break="no"/>takable decision of the people of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land. Speaking for myself—because we had 
     <lb/>not discussed the matter in council—I said I 
     <lb/>thought it would be the usual democratic 
     <lb/>process; that if there was a majority, that 
     <lb/>majority would be apt to be considered as 
     <lb/>the expression of the views that should pre<lb break="no"/>vail, but that after all it was not our respon<lb break="no"/>sibility to count the ballots or decide the 
     <lb/>sufficiency or insufficiency of the vote. If the 
     <lb/>government of the United Kingdom and the 
     <lb/>government of Newfoundland, after counting 
     <lb/>the ballots, stated to us on their responsibility 
     <lb/>that there had been a majority for union with 
     <lb/>Canada, I said I thought it would be very 
     <lb/>difficult for us to refuse to recognize the 
     <lb/>validity of that statement; and they did state 
     <lb/>to us that there had been a clear majority 
     <lb/>expressing a desire to unite with Canada, and 
     <lb/>that the governor was appointing a delegation 
     <lb/>to come and discuss the final terms of union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That delegation came. The situation was 
     <lb/>
     discussed, I think, in a manner that did credit 
     <lb/>
     to both the Canadian and the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     delegations. I believe the view that prevailed 
     <lb/>
     was that it was not a time to try to get this 
     <lb/>
     or that particular advantage but that it was 
     <lb/>
     in the interests of all, if there was to be union, 
     <lb/>
     to have such terms determined as could be 
     <lb/>
     accepted by the majority of the reasonably- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     minded people in Canada and Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     as being fair and apt to promote the welfare 
     <lb/>
     of the enlarged Canadian nation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the day those terms were to be signed 
     <lb/>
     there arrived from St. John's a telegram 
     <lb/>
     addressed to me, which in compliance with 
     <lb/>
     the request made by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Lake Centre I shall table. It is signed by 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Fred W. Marshall, chairman of the 
     <lb/>
     responsible government league. Perhaps I 
     <lb/>
     should read the telegram so that its contents 
     <lb/>
     may be available to all hon. members in the 
     <lb/>
     house. It was in the form of a night letter, 
     <lb/>
     dispatched from St. John's, Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     on December 10, and which reached us here 
     <lb/>
     on the morning of December 11. It is 
     <lb/>
     addressed to the Right Hon. Louis St. 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     report delivery Ottawa, Ontario.

     One other document which I have not

     before me at this moment was addressed, not

     to the Canadian government, but to the

     certainly have it found. During the dinner

     hour efforts were made to have it located,

     that time, done anything to rebuff or repulse 
     <lb/>
     the advances being made by the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland we would have seriously 
     <lb/>
     offended a large number of them, and pos<lb break="no"/>sibly offended them to the point where the 
     <lb/>
     matter of union with Canada would have 
     <lb/>
     been shelved again. We felt we must be 
     <lb/>
     extremely careful to do nothing which would 
     <lb/>
     offend the susceptibilities of. those who we 
     <lb/>
     hoped, as the fathers of confederation had 
     <lb/>
     hoped more than eighty years ago, would 
     <lb/>
     ultimately become our fellow citizens in this 
     <lb/>
     Canadian nation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The hon. member for Lake Centre (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Diefenbaker) has asked what the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government has done to remove the objec<lb break="no"/>tions. For the reasons I have stated, the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government did nothing to remove 
     <lb/>
     those objections, leaving it to the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland to make their decision and 
     <lb/>
     deal with those who favoured and those who 
     <lb/>
     did not favour union with Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The third question was, Have any repre<lb break="no"/>sentations in opposition been received by the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government. I have answered that 
     <lb/>
     question, and as soon as the staff find it for 
     <lb/>
     me I will table the further document which 
     <lb/>
     was addressed to the prime ministers in con<lb break="no"/>ference at the London meeting. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The fourth question was, Has this govern<lb break="no"/>ment made any representations to the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom government as to the desirability of 
     <lb/>
     restoring responsible government. To that 
     <lb/>
     question I must answer that we did not. We 
     <lb/>
     felt that it was not our province to do so 
     <lb/>
     and that, in so far as the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment was concerned, it should leave entirely 
     <lb/>
     to the government of the United Kingdom 
     <lb/>
     and the government of Newfoundland the 
     <lb/>
     taking of such steps on their side as they 
     <lb/>
     might see fit. We felt that the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government would have its responsibilities to 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian parliament in the attitude it 
     <lb/>
     was taking for Canada in these issues, and 
     <lb/>
     that it should not assume any further or 
     <lb/>
     greater responsibility than that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I hope that this statement of fact will 
     <lb/>
     satisfy most people that we endeavoured to 
     <lb/>
     maintain a correct attitude in the course of 
     <lb/>
     these negotiations. As I have seen in news<lb break="no"/>paper articles the statement that this sug<lb break="no"/>gestion of union was the result of a deep-laid 
     <lb/>
     conspiracy which had arisen out of the meet<lb break="no"/>ing of the Quebec conference in 1943, there 
     <lb/>
     is one assertion I wish to make. I do not 
     <lb/>
     think I need to do more than mention the 
     <lb/>
     date. Hon. members know what it was that 
     <lb/>
     brought together in Quebec, in 1943, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Winston Churchill and Mr. Franklin D. 
     <lb/>
     Roosevelt, and I do not need to deny that 
     <lb/>
     statement. But for the record I deny that 
     <lb/>
     any question whatsoever of the entry of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland into confederation or of the 

<cb/>

     union of Newfoundland with Canada was 
     <lb/>
     discussed at the Quebec conference of 1943. 
     <lb/>
     At that time the leaders of those democratic 
     <lb/>
     nations were endeavouring to devise ways 
     <lb/>
     and means by which to bring to an end the 
     <lb/>
     horrible war which was threatening the very 
     <lb/>
     existence of us all. That was the matter 
     <lb/>
     that was discussed at the Quebec conference 
     <lb/>
     of 1943. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Moreover, I emphatically deny that there 
     <lb/>
     was at any time any attempt by the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government, otherwise than by maintaining 
     <lb/>
     a correct attitude and by maintaining the 
     <lb/>
     attitude that the whole of the people have 
     <lb/>
     maintained, to induce our Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     friends to become associated with us. We felt 
     <lb/>
     then, as I still feel today, that the most effec<lb break="no"/>tive way we could act to bring about, as early 
     <lb/>
     as possible, a consummation of this dream of 
     <lb/>
     1867, was to behave as honourable, free men 
     <lb/>
     in a prosperous community, acting in a cor<lb break="no"/>rect manner in the administration of their 
     <lb/>
     affairs. We felt that was the thing that would 
     <lb/>
     be most apt to make an impression upon the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland. That attitude was 
     <lb/>
     adopted and maintained with the most 
     <lb/>
     scrupulous exactitude. On the other hand, 
     <lb/>
     we felt that to do anything that might be 
     <lb/>
     construed as a rebuff to or a repulse of any 
     <lb/>
     advances that were being made would be 
     <lb/>
     offensive to that population; and we refrained 
     <lb/>
     from doing anything of that kind. I hope the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland and the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada will find in the end that this union, 
     <lb/>
     on the terms that have been proposed, will 
     <lb/>
     work out to the mutual advantage of all those 
     <lb/>
     who will be citizens of greater Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     that it will prove to be a step forward in the 
     <lb/>
     progress of that people, which already occu<lb break="no"/>pies an important position in the family of 
     <lb/>
     nations.

     <persName ref="pers:RAYM1">Mr. Raymond</persName> (Beauharnois-Laprairie): Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, before I proceed with the observa<lb break="no"/>tions I intend to offer to the house on this sub<lb break="no"/>ject I should like to ask the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     a question. I should like to know whether 
     <lb/>
     the Statute of Westminster applies to New<lb break="no"/>foundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: I should not like to be too 
     <lb/>
     positive about that. We are told by the New<lb break="no"/>foundland delegation that it did not apply to 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland inasmuch as it provided that 
     <lb/>
     it would come into force in any one of the 
     <lb/>
     dominions upon adoption by the parliament 
     <lb/>
     of that dominion, and the parliament or the 
     <lb/>
     then legislature of Newfoundland had not 
     <lb/>
     adopted it. But the terms of union provide 
     <lb/>
     that, if union is consummated, it will there<lb break="no"/>after apply to the province of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     in the same way as it applies to the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces of Canada.

     <persName ref="pers:RAYM1">Mr. Raymond</persName> (Beauharnois-Laprairie): Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, the question of a union between 
     <lb/>
     Canada and Newfoundland—the latter com<lb break="no"/>ing into confederation as a tenth province— 
     <lb/>
     gives rise to a certain number of problems 
     <lb/>
     which may be classified under the following 
     <lb/>
     headings: constitutional, financial and eco<lb break="no"/>nomic, political, both from the national and 
     <lb/>
     international points of view, and all that 
     <lb/>
     follows therefrom. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We are therefore about to commit ourselves 
     <lb/>
     to a most important undertaking, one that 
     <lb/>
     carries with it most serious consequences for 
     <lb/>
     the future of this country. For the time 
     <lb/>
     being, I will restrict my remarks to the con<lb break="no"/>stitutional problems. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Prime Minister (Mr. St. Laurent) gave, 
     <lb/>
     as his authority for the procedure adopted, 
     <lb/>
     section 146 of the British North America Act. 
     <lb/>
     He does not believe it necessary to obtain 
     <lb/>
     the approval of the provinces, being of the 
     <lb/>
     opinion that, in cases like this, the members 
     <lb/>
     of this house represent the particular prov<lb break="no"/>inces from which they come. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Had the act of 1867 not provided for the 
     <lb/>
     annexation of Newfoundland, I would main<lb break="no"/>tain that this procedure is altogether uncon<lb break="no"/>stitutional since I do not share the opinion 
     <lb/>
     expressed by the Prime Minister (Mr. St. 
     <lb/>
     Laurent) to the effect that our constitution 
     <lb/>
     is merely a law that may be amended or 
     <lb/>
     changed according to the fancy of a majority 
     <lb/>
     of this house, without the consent of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces, the contracting parties to the act. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the contrary, it is not an act in the 
     <lb/>
     ordinary sense of the word; it is, in the words 
     <lb/>
     of an eminent member of the Montreal bar 
     <lb/>
     and a former bâtonnier, "the outcome of an 
     <lb/>
     understanding, of an agreement, of a contract. 
     <lb/>
     It is a pact agreed to between the provinces; 
     <lb/>
     more than that, it is an agreement between 
     <lb/>
     two totally different races and creeds." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The statutes passed by the imperial par<lb break="no"/>liament only served to enact this contract 
     <lb/>
     into a law; they ratified it. Proof thereof is 
     <lb/>
     found in sections 91, 92, 93 and 133 which are 
     <lb/>
     a recognition of the agreement, of the contract 
     <lb/>
     entered into, without which recognition Que<lb break="no"/>bec never would have agreed to it. I will 
     <lb/>
     never allow that, after having secured our 
     <lb/>
     agreement to a contract, the power given by 
     <lb/>
     a parliamentary majority be used to amend 
     <lb/>
     this contract. That would be a denial of 
     <lb/>
     justice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This truth was recognized by the judicial 
     <lb/>
     committee of the Privy Council, in the matter 
     <lb/>
     of <hi rendition="simple:italic">The regulation and control of Aeronautics

     It will be noted that Lord Sankey insists 
     <lb/>
     on the word "contract." Now, I agree that 
     <lb/>
     section 146 of the British North America Act, 
     <lb/>
     to which the four contracting provinces had 
     <lb/>
     agreed, grants the power to proceed with the 
     <lb/>
     union of Newfoundland, but it does not fol<lb break="no"/>low that in the exercise of that power, the 
     <lb/>
     constitution could be transgressed in other 
     <lb/>
     respects. According to section 146, a very 
     <lb/>
     definite method must be followed and a 
     <lb/>
     majority of this house has no right to change 
     <lb/>
     it without the consent of the provinces which 
     <lb/>
     were parties to the act of 1867. Section 146

            <p>
     To invoke that section of the constitution, all 
     <lb/>
     the conditions mentioned would have to be 
     <lb/>
     fulfilled, to wit: addresses from the parlia<lb break="no"/>ments of Canada and Newfoundland. This 
     <lb/>
     implies the existence of a legislature in New<lb break="no"/>foundland, but such a legislature does not 
     <lb/>
     exist. The island is governed by a com<lb break="no"/>mission appointed by London in 1934. There 
     <lb/>
     can therefore be no address from the New<lb break="no"/>foundland legislature before it has been 
     <lb/>

     out union is missing.

            <p>
     The procedure followed is counter to the

     the non-existing Newfoundland legislature; 
     <lb/>
     we have dealt with the creatures of the

     I do not mean to insinuate that the confederate

     I do say that they used communistic tactics to obtain

            <p>
     That gives us an inkling of the means used 
     <lb/>
     to secure a majority. In addition to that, 
     <lb/>
     reference was made to the trying conditions 
     <lb/>
     of 1933, when the people who were on relief 
     <lb/>
     were getting six cents a day. Then there was 
     <lb/>
     the lure of family allowances, and old age 
     <lb/>
     pensions, considerably higher in Canada than 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland. I believe that in Newfound<lb break="no"/>land the old age pension does not exceed $72 
     <lb/>
     per person and $120 per couple, while here it 
     <lb/>
     is at least $360 per person. The members of 
     <lb/>
     the imperial commission participated in the 
     <lb/>
     campaign in favour of the union. ' No stone 
     <lb/>
     was left unturned to reverse the wish

     people in favour of responsible government.

     inquiry by a royal commission, the New<lb break="no"/>foundland legislature sent to London a request

     for the temporary suspension of the con<lb break="no"/>stitution, the statutes show that it was agreed

     Having acquainted itself with the terms of 
     <lb/>
     union submitted by Ottawa, the national con<lb break="no"/>vention, appointed in 1946, suggested to the 
     <lb/>
     British parliament two forms of government 
     <lb/>
     between which the people would be asked to 
     <lb/>
     choose: firstly, maintenance of the present 
     <lb/>
     status and, secondly, restoration of responsible 
     <lb/>
     government. It also defeated, by 29 votes 
     <lb/>
     to 16, a motion recommending a third form 
     <lb/>
     of government, namely, union with Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Notwithstanding the decision of the people's 
     <lb/>
     elected assembly, the British government ruled 
     <lb/>
     to include union with Canada on the ballot 
     <lb/>
     forms, even though this had been turned 
     <lb/>
     down by a majority of almost 2 to 1. In the 
     <lb/>
     referendum of June 3, 1948, the majority 
     <lb/>
     voted for responsible government. This was 
     <lb/>
     the second time, so to speak, that the people

     and their representatives expressed them<lb break="no"/>selves in favour of or against union between 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland and Canada. The govern<lb break="no"/>ment commission, however, never admitting 
     <lb/>
     defeat, arranged for a second referendum 
     <lb/>
     which gave a slight edge to those favouring 
     <lb/>
     confederation after the struggle I have already 
     <lb/>
     summarized. The governor then appointed a 
     <lb/>
     delegation to negotiate union with Canada. 
     <lb/>
     This delegation had no legal status to enter 
     <lb/>
     into such an agreement; such a step was

     The reply given by the national conven<lb break="no"/>tion, by a vote of 29 to 16, on January 27,

     1948, was a plain answer, more so surely

     than the slight majority afforded by the

     second referendum. Moreover, no doubts 
     <lb/>
     could remain after the first referendum,

     which favoured responsible government and

     excluded entry into confederation. Yet we

     wishes of the majority of people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland who, in referendum, stated they

     not wish to have restored now their respon<lb break="no"/>sible government. How will that become

     <lb/>
     of a confirmatory statute of the parliament 
     <lb/>
     of the United Kingdom, which is the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment that passed the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act and which, according to the terms of the

     The hon. gentleman asks why the other 
     <lb/>
     procedure was not resorted to. The other 
     <lb/>
     procedure was not resorted to, first, because 
     <lb/>
     it could not be resorted to without restoring 
     <lb/>
     responsible government, and the majority of 
     <lb/>
     the people had said that they did not want 
     <lb/>
     that done; and, secondly, because of the con<lb break="no"/>stitutional developments which have taken 
     <lb/>
     place since confederation and which are 
     <lb/>
     reflected in the terms of the Statute of West<lb break="no"/>minster. No longer does His Majesty exercise

     the royal prerogative. in respect of Canadian

     affairs on the advice of his most honourable

     <lb/>
     prerogative in respect of Canadian affairs on 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>

     It must not be forgotten that the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act was passed in 1867, 
     <lb/>
     almost eighty-two years ago, and that con<lb break="no"/>ditions in this country, its people, its parlia<lb break="no"/>ment and its government are not the same 
     <lb/>
     today as they were then. I was surprised at 
     <lb/>
     the attitude expressed this afternoon by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Charlevoix-Saguenay. Most 
     <lb/>
     of us from my province derive perhaps some 
     <lb/>
     sentimental satisfaction from the develop<lb break="no"/>ments that have taken place and that have 
     <lb/>
     brought about the situation whereby the 
     <lb/>
     prerogative of His Majesty is now exercised 
     <lb/>
     on the advice of ministers responsible to his 
     <lb/>
     Canadian subjects, but the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Charlevoix-Saguenay seems to be one of those 
     <lb/>
     who have lagged behind, and he is not willing 
     <lb/>
     to keep pace with the developments that time 
     <lb/>
     has brought about. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The situation is that a statute will have 
     <lb/>
     to be passed by the parliament of the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom before these terms of union become 
     <lb/>
     effective. If that statute is passed it will have 
     <lb/>
     the same effect as had the statute of the 
     <lb/>
     parliament of the United Kingdom which 
     <lb/>
     confirmed the agreement made, in a manner 
     <lb/>
     not strictly in accord with the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act, for the return to the province 
     <lb/>
     of Saskatchewan, to the province of Alberta 
     <lb/>
     and to the province of Manitoba of their 
     <lb/>
     natural resources. The procedure being fol<lb break="no"/>lowed here is the procedure that was followed 
     <lb/>
     there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was found that the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act did not provide the proper machinery 
     <lb/>
     for the return of those resources to the west<lb break="no"/>ern provinces. In order to get them back 
     <lb/>
     to the western provinces, as my hon. friend's 
     <lb/>
     constituents wanted, and as the rest of the 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada felt was fair, an agree<lb break="no"/>ment was made that they would be returned. 
     <lb/>
     It was provided that that agreement would 
     <lb/>
     not come into operation until it was ratified 
     <lb/>
     by the parliament of Canada, by the legis<lb break="no"/>lature of the province, as far as that province 
     <lb/>
     was concerned, and then confirmed by an act 
     <lb/>
     of the parliament of the United Kingdom. 
     <lb/>
     That was necessary because it was a pro<lb break="no"/>cedure not strictly in accord with the terms 
     <lb/>
     of the British North America Act. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This is the same thing. This procedure is 
     <lb/>
     not strictly in accord with the terms of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act. It is to do some<lb break="no"/>thing which the British North America Act 
     <lb/>
     contemplated, but it is being done under 
     <lb/>
     conditions which have changed over the 
     <lb/>
     eighty-two years. The requirements of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act, in so far as they 
     <lb/>
     can be complied with, are being complied 
     <lb/>
     with, but in order to give it the effect of law 
     <lb/>
     —no one can dispute that something is being 


            <cb/>

added—there must be a confirming statute 
     <lb/>of the parliament of the United Kingdom, 
     <lb/>the same parliament that originally passed 
     <lb/>the British North America Act.

     <persName ref="pers:NICH1">Mr. Nicholson</persName>: I am sure the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister is making a sound legal argument, but 
     <lb/>
     I should like to draw the attention of the com<lb break="no"/>mittee again to the fact that this is a very 
     <lb/>
     controversial question in Newfoundland. As 
     <lb/>
     I mentioned last night, I spent a week there 
     <lb/>
     in December. I have been in a great many

     <lb/>
     that was the first time I have ever been in an

     <lb/>
     embarrassed on a great many occasions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I want to make it clear that the people I 
     <lb/>
     met, who were so bitter about the question, 
     <lb/>
     were not necessarily opposed to becoming 
     <lb/>
     part of Canada, but they felt that an injustice 
     <lb/>
     was being done. They felt that it would have 
     <lb/>
     been better in the long run to have taken the 
     <lb/>
     additional step of granting responsible gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to Newfoundland and then having 
     <lb/>
     the elected representatives of the people carry 
     <lb/>
     out the terms of the British North America

     Act and negotiate with the elected repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of the Canadian people.

     Now, regardless of the terms of the British

     Newfoundland cannot be happy as a part of

     was rejected by 29 to 16. Then the demo<lb break="no"/>cratically elected representatives of. New<lb break="no"/>foundland decided unanimously that at that

     stage they would not confuse the issue by 
     <lb/>
     pressing the question of confederation with

     I take it that once union becomes a fact

     there will be no delay in the appointment of

     the six senators. Patents can be issued, and

     they can take their places in the Senate very

     within which Newfoundland will obtain 
     <lb/>
     representation in the House of Commons, 
     <lb/>
     through the election to this chamber of seven

     representatives. In the terms of union there 
     <lb/>
     is no time limit within which this election is

     16, Where you find a time limit imposed by 
     <lb/>

      There is no similar time limit with respect

     House of Commons. Once union becomes a

     fact, presumably this parliament will proceed 
     <lb/>
     at once to enact legislation which will be as 
     <lb/>
     binding upon Newfoundland as upon any 
     <lb/>
     other part of Canada. In particular, taxation 
     <lb/>
     will be imposed upon Newfoundland just as 
     <lb/>
     upon any other part of Canada; and as this 
     <lb/>
     parliament proceeds to impose such taxation 
     <lb/>
     while there are no members from the prov<lb break="no"/>ince of Newfoundland holding seats in this 
     <lb/>
     house, we shall be in the position that par<lb break="no"/>liament will levy taxation without representa<lb break="no"/>tion, something I hope every one of us will

     <lb/>
     unless we are to have some assurance that 
     <lb/>
     there will be a general election this spring 
     <lb/>
     I think the house is not only entitled to but 
     <lb/>
     should require an assurance from the govern<lb break="no"/>ment that, immediately union becomes effec<lb break="no"/>tive, writs will be issued for the holding of

     <persName ref="pers:JAEN1">Mr. Jaenicke</persName>: The question I should like 
     <lb/>
     to raise is somewhat different. Not long ago 
     <lb/>
     we amended the British North America Act, 
     <lb/>
     and the representation in parliament was 
     <lb/>
     fixed at 255. This amendment was brought 
     <lb/>
     about by an address to His Majesty. As I 
     <lb/>
     read this section, the number of members of 
     <lb/>
     parliament is now to be increased by seven. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore this will be contrary to the provis<lb break="no"/>ions of the British North America Act. Is it 
     <lb/>
     the intention of the government to present 
     <lb/>
     another address to His Majesty to increase 
     <lb/>
     the representation, or will the British legisla<lb break="no"/>tion provide for that increase? The same 
     <lb/>
     thing also would apply to the number of 
     <lb/>
     senators. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: The British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act provides that, in the event of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land becoming a province of Canada, it would 
     <lb/>
     be entitled to six senators. In 1867 the act 
     <lb/>
     provided for four senators, but by virtue of an 
     <lb/>
     amendment which was made, I think in 1915, 
     <lb/>
     it was provided that the number would be 
     <lb/>
     six instead of four. This provision has existed 
     <lb/>
     in the British North America Act for over 
     <lb/>
     thirty years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     With respect to representation in the House 
     <lb/>
     of Commons, if and when the terms of union 
     <lb/>
     are ratified here and approved by the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of the United Kingdom, provision will 
     <lb/>
     automatically be made for seven members 
     <lb/>
     additional to the representation in the house. 
     <lb/>
     In the omnibus bill which was read for the 
     <lb/>
     first time yesterday, hon. members will find 
     <lb/>
     provision is made for the required amend<lb break="no"/>ments in the Representation Act to refer to 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland and to refer in the schedule 
     <lb/>
     to the electoral divisions of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In answer to the question of the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Eglinton (Mr. Fleming), I may say 
     <lb/>
     that this parliament has decided what provi<lb break="no"/>sions will apply to elections required to pro<lb break="no"/>vide representation for all parts of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     As soon as the existence of a vacancy is 
     <lb/>
     brought to his notice, the Speaker is required 
     <lb/>
     to notify the chief electoral officer. It is a 
     <lb/>
     statutory provision of the Dominion Elections 
     <lb/>
     Act that writs for the filling of that vacancy 
     <lb/>
     must be issued within six months. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JAEN1">Mr. Jaenicke</persName>: I should like to ask the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister whether the procedure he out<lb break="no"/>lined would not be a departure from the 
     <lb/>
     established precedent concerning the manner 
     <lb/>
     in which the British» North America Act is 
     <lb/>
     amended? In my opinion it can only be done 
     <lb/>
     by an address to His Majesty, and the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of the United Kingdom would have to 
     <lb/>
     pass a special act in order to amend the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act, or to change the 
     <lb/>
     representation in the House of Commons. </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: I submit not, Mr. Chair<lb break="no"/>man—any more than it was necessary to 
     <lb/>
     amend the British North America Act for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of giving legal effect to the return 
     <lb/>
     of the natural resources to the western prov<lb break="no"/>inces. It was not done in the form provided 
     <lb/>
     by the British North America Act, but it was 
     <lb/>
     confirmed by the parliament that passed the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act and made effective 
     <lb/>
     notwithstanding anything to the contrary. In 
     <lb/>
     the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Votes and Proceedings</hi> tomorrow the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member will probably find the form of ad<lb break="no"/>dress which it is proposed to ask the houses 
     <lb/>
     of parliament to adopt. I think he will find 
     <lb/>
     the matter is properly taken care of in that 
     <lb/>
     form of address. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FLEM1">Mr. Fleming</persName>: I appreciate the point the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister has raised in his 'answer, but 
     <lb/>
     I am also not unmindful of the fact we wait 
     <lb/>
     very long sometimes for the holding of by- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     elections. I recall very well that two years 
     <lb/>
     ago, owing to inclement weather, we were 
     <lb/>
     told, the by-election in the riding of Halifax 
     <lb/>
     was delayed for seven or eight months. In 
     <lb/>
     view of the circumstances under which these 
     <lb/>
     vacancies will exist, presumably on the first 
     <lb/>
     day of April, would it not be very simple 
     <lb/>
     for the Prime Minister to assure the house 
     <lb/>
     that steps will be taken immediately to see 
     <lb/>
     that the writs are issued and everything pos<lb break="no"/>sible is done to expedite the filling of the 
     <lb/>
     vacancies in the Newfoundland seats in this 
     <lb/>
     house. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: The only assurance I can 
     <lb/>
     give the hon. member is that we will attempt 
     <lb/>
     to discharge our responsibilities in that 
     <lb/>
     regard in such a manner as will satisfy both 
     <lb/>
     the house and the Canadian public. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CASE1">Mr. Case</persName>: I should like to make this obser<lb break="no"/>vation. It has been some time since the 
     <lb/>
     dominion of. Newfoundland has had an elec<lb break="no"/>tion. Clause 4 provides for the election of 
     <lb/>
     seven members. I think it can be reasonably 
     <lb/>
     assumed that the people, given that oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of expressing themselves, may or may 
     <lb/>
     not elect all of one party on certain condi<lb break="no"/>tions or matters of policy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I notice provision is made for the appoint<lb break="no"/>ment of six members to the Senate. I do not 
     <lb/>
     know what practice was followed by the 
     <lb/>
     fathers of confederation when the upper 
     <lb/>
     chamber was created. Appointments were 
     <lb/>
    made from Ontario, from Quebec and from 
     <lb/>the other provinces which entered into the 
     <lb/>union. I may now be trying to pry into an 
     <lb/>internal secret, but it would be interesting if 
     <lb/>the government would disclose how generous 
     <lb/>they might be in seeing to it that, not only 
     <lb/>the government, but His Majesty's loyal 
     <lb/>opposition would be represented in the 
     <lb/>Senate. I can understand how these appoint<lb break="no"/>ments are made at a later stage; but when a 

<cb/>

     province is coming in and there are these 
     <lb/>
     appointments to be made, it would seem 
     <lb/>
     reasonable to think that some recognition 
     <lb/>
     should be given to the minority who have 
     <lb/>
     never had an opportunity of electing any part 
     <lb/>
     of the federal government of the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     of Canada. If I am not presuming too much, 
     <lb/>
     and the Prime Minister would care to make 
     <lb/>
     an observation, I am sure I would appreciate 
     <lb/>
     it very much. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: All I can say is that we 
     <lb/>
     are endeavouring to obtain the best possible 
     <lb/>
     information concerning what would be apt 
     <lb/>
     to make the people of Newfoundland feel 
     <lb/>
     they had chosen wisely in joining confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. So far, the only specific recommenda<lb break="no"/>tion we have had is that, because of the 
     <lb/>
     general mentality of the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, it would be wise if it were pos<lb break="no"/>sible to have two of the six senators chosen 
     <lb/>
     from the Anglican denomination which 
     <lb/>
     represents about a third of the population. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACN2">Mr. MacNicol</persName>: From what group? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: Two chosen from members 
     <lb/>
     of the Anglican denomination; two chosen 
     <lb/>
     from the Roman Catholic denomination and 
     <lb/>
     two chosen from the United church or other 
     <lb/>
     denominations which make up the remainder 
     <lb/>
     of the population. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I inquired how soon after the entry of 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island, British Columbia, 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba and the setting-up of Alberta and 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan appointments had been made 
     <lb/>
     to the Senate. To my surprise I was informed 
     <lb/>
     it was about five months. I am not sure 
     <lb/>
     whether there was one earlier than that, but 
     <lb/>
     I believe the earliest were made around the 
     <lb/>
     five-month period, and in some cases it was 
     <lb/>
     much longer than five months. I was sur<lb break="no"/>prised to find that so long a time had been 
     <lb/>
     found necessary to deal with these vacancies. 
     <lb/>
     This point was discussed with those from 
     <lb/>
     whom we were seeking to be enlightened 
     <lb/>
     about the situation in Newfoundland. We 
     <lb/>
     were told it would be unwise to proceed 
     <lb/>
     otherwise than by threes, if we could not 
     <lb/>
     make six appointments. If we made the six 
     <lb/>
     appointments, it would be all right provided 
     <lb/>
     they were distributed according to religious 
     <lb/>
     denominations, as I have described. But if 
     <lb/>
     we did not do that we should make at least 
     <lb/>
     three appointments at a time, because it 
     <lb/>
     would be unsatisfactory if any one of these 
     <lb/>
     three groups was preferred to the other two. 
     <lb/>
     We were told we should be careful to avoid 
     <lb/>
     offending the susceptibilities of these three 
     <lb/>
     separate religious groups in the island. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STEP2">Mr. Stephenson</persName>: I should like to ask the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister one question. He has men<lb break="no"/>tioned that two members of various religious 
     <lb/>
     denominations might be appointed, but is it 
     <lb/>
     not possible for them to be all of the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     faith?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: I am told it has been so 
     <lb/>
     long since elections were held in Newfound<lb break="no"/>land that most of the people are unable to 
     <lb/>
     indicate what their political faith is. On the 
     <lb/>
     other hand, I have received representations 
     <lb/>
     which were along the lines of the statement 
     <lb/>
     made by the Minister of Reconstruction and 
     <lb/>
     Supply (Mr. Winters) about the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada generally, that they are Liberals and 
     <lb/>
     it behooves us to go out and see that they vote

     that way.

     <persName ref="pers:GRAY2">Mr. Graydon</persName>: Perhaps the Prime Minister

     <lb/>
     figures he gave the house the other day. I 
     <lb/>
     would ask him this question. Does the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment anticipate arranging the election so 
     <lb/>
     that there will be representation from New<lb break="no"/>foundland in this particular session, pro<lb break="no"/>vided that this session goes its normal

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: I hope it will not be pos<lb break="no"/>sible to have representation during this 
     <lb/>
     session, because that would mean that the 
     <lb/>
     session would have to go on until late in the 
     <lb/>
     summer. The matter cannot be dealt with 
     <lb/>
     until after March 31, and it then requires two 
     <lb/>
     months at the very least in order to arrange 
     <lb/>
     an election. That would account for April 
     <lb/>
     and May. I would hope that by the time 
     <lb/>
     April and May were over we would be 
     <lb/>
     nearing the close of this session. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     As to the other question, that matter has 
     <lb/>
     also been under consideration and discussion. 
     <lb/>
     We were told that it would be unfortunate 
     <lb/>
     if gentlemen were elected to this parliament 
     <lb/>
     and then a general dissolution came about as 
     <lb/>
     a result of which they were not able to take 
     <lb/>
     their seats but were forced to go back for 
     <lb/>
     re-election, or in other words to be elected 
     <lb/>
     twice before they really became members of 
     <lb/>
     parliament. We would have to wait and see 
     <lb/>
     how events developed in order to determine 
     <lb/>
     whether or not the holding of a by-election or 
     <lb/>
     by-elections would provide those who were 
     <lb/>
     elected with an opportunity of being intro<lb break="no"/>duced to the Speaker and taking their seats 
     <lb/>
     in the house.

     <persName ref="pers:KNOW1">Mr. Knowles</persName>: Purely for the information 
     <lb/>
     of the people of Newfoundland and of course 
     <lb/>
     not because we here are interested, the Prime

     Minister might solve this whole problem by 
     <lb/>
     telling us the date of the election.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: If the Prime Minister

            <cb/>

<p><persName ref="pers:FULT1">Mr. Fulton</persName>: There is one consideration 
     <lb/>which I feel should be borne in mind and 
     <lb/>given careful thought in making appoint<lb break="no"/>ments from Newfoundland to the other house. 
     <lb/>A number of hon. members have observed— 
     <lb/>with some degree of deprecation, I take it 
     <lb/>—that there is in Newfoundland a substantial 
     <lb/>body of opinion which is opposed, we will 
     <lb/>say, not to the idea but to the method of 
     <lb/>confederation. I feel that that fact should 
     <lb/>be carefully borne in mind when appoint<lb break="no"/>ments are being made to the Senate. That 
     <lb/>body of opinion, which we understand is 
     <lb/>substantiel, is entitled to representation in 
     <lb/>the six appointments to be made to the other 
     <lb/>chamber. 1 think we can all take it as a fact 
     <lb/>that the purpose of the other house is, among 
     <lb/>other things, to provide representation for all 
     <lb/>groups of opinion, particularly minority 
     <lb/>groups, in the Canadian parliament. I would 
     <lb/>strongly urge that this matter be taken into 
     <lb/>consideration. Perhaps the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>would be willing to give us some assurance 
     <lb/>that that fact would be borne in mind when 
     <lb/>making those appointments.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: The only assurance I would 
     <lb/>
     care to give the hon. member is that we 
     <lb/>
     shall endeavour to take into consideration, in 
     <lb/>
     making those appointments, all factors that 
     <lb/>
     will tend to bring about a state of satisfaction 
     <lb/>
     among the people of Newfoundland.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DREW2">Mr. Drew</persName>: That is not one of the things

     that are to be referred to the royal commission 
     <lb/>
     to find out what will enrich the life of the 
     <lb/>

            <p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACI1">Mr. MacInnis</persName>: Some of this debate on 
     <lb/>
     appointments to the Senate has been in a 
     <lb/>
     jocular vein and perhaps some of it has been 
     <lb/>
     serious. But if it has done nothing else, it 
     <lb/>
     has pointed out the farcical way in which 
     <lb/>
     appointments to our Senate are made. Per<lb break="no"/>haps the debate also offers a good opportunity 
     <lb/>
     for this house to consider whether we should 
     <lb/>
     not change the way in which such appoint<lb break="no"/>ments are made? I have been reading 
     <lb/>
     editorials in the press from one end of 
     <lb/>
     Canada to the other, and what is said about 
     <lb/>
     the other place is not particularly compli<lb break="no"/>mentary. I was reading recently one of 
     <lb/>
     the few books on politics written by a Cana<lb break="no"/>dian—"Democratic Government and Politics", 
     <lb/>
     by Professor J. A. Correy—and what he says 
     <lb/>
     about the Canadian Senate is not particularly 
     <lb/>
     complimentary either. After many years as 
     <lb/>
     a member of parliament, I find myself in 


            <pb n="358" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-02-08_Page_0358.jpg"/>

     general agreement with him. If we are to 
     <lb/>
     have a second house, it should be such a 
     <lb/>
     house as to warrant the respect of the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian people, and be of some use in the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada. Otherwise we should abolish 
     <lb/>
     it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROWE2">Mr. Rowe</persName>: It is of plenty of use to the 
     <lb/>
     government; but that is all the use it is.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACN2">Mr. MacNicol</persName>: Is a question about appoint<lb break="no"/>ments to the Senate in order? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The Chairman: I do not think that discus<lb break="no"/>sion generally on appointments to the Senate 
     <lb/>
     is in order. When the house is in committee 
     <lb/>
     of the whole, discussion must be strictly 
     <lb/>
     relevant to the clause under consideration. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HAZE1">Mr. Hazen</persName>: I should like to support the 
     <lb/>
     suggestion made by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Kamloops. The Prime Minister has just told 
     <lb/>
     us, perhaps jocularly, that the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland do not know just what their poli<lb break="no"/>tical opinions are now, because they have not 
     <lb/>
     had an election for so long a time. I would 
     <lb/>
     point out to him that at the time of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion there was a great upheaval in political 
     <lb/>
     opinion, and some men who took an active 
     <lb/>
     interest in public affairs changed their ideas. 
     <lb/>
     Some went one way and some went the other. 
     <lb/>
     Some were in favour of confederation and 
     <lb/>
     some were against it. I believe it is true that, 
     <lb/>
     when the senators were appointed after con<lb break="no"/>federation, they were chosen both from those 
     <lb/>
     who opposed confederation and from those 
     <lb/>
     who favoured it. The government of that 
     <lb/>
     day took care to see that the Senate was 
     <lb/>
     represented by both those who favoured con<lb break="no"/>federation and those who opposed it. In 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland today there are people who 
     <lb/>
     oppose this union and people who favour it. 
     <lb/>
     I think that the example followed at the 
     <lb/>
     time of confederation could well be followed 
     <lb/>
     today, and that it would have good results 
     <lb/>
     in the end. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACN2">Mr. MacNicol</persName>: I was going to say, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, that if the present government 
     <lb/>
     remains in power— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
    <persName ref="pers:HARR2">Mr. Harris</persName> (Grey-Bruce): As it will. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACN2">Mr. MacNicol</persName>: Wait a minute. I know 
     <lb/>
     what I am going to say. If it remains in 
     <lb/>
     power for another five years, there may be 
     <lb/>
     only one party in the other place. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROWE2">Mr. Rowe</persName>:
     Five years? You mean five months. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACN2">Mr. MacNicol</persName>: I am taking an arbitrary 
     <lb/>
     position. If the government remains in power 
     <lb/>
     for another five years, and appointments are 
     <lb/>
     continued on the present basis, all from their 
     <lb/>
     own party, it will mean that there may be 
     <lb/>
     only one party in the other place. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Saint John-Albert brought up the 
  

            <cb/>
   

     matter I had in mind. Right after confedera<lb break="no"/>tion a bill was introduced. I forget the name 
     <lb/>
     of the sponsor, but I have a copy of the 
     <lb/>
     original bill at home. There was a sugges<lb break="no"/>tion that the government of each province 
     <lb/>
     should appoint one half the senators from that 
     <lb/>
     province. The Prime Minister nods his head. 
     <lb/>
     He is familiar with that suggestion. The 
     <lb/>
     government in each province would name 
     <lb/>
     one half. of the senators and the federal gov<lb break="no"/>ernment would name the other half. In that 
     <lb/>
     way the government would avoid what is 
     <lb/>
     taking place now. I have forgotten how 
     <lb/>
     many Liberal senators and how many Conser<lb break="no"/>vative senators there are in the other place. 
     <lb/>
     They are so far apart in numbers that the 
     <lb/>
     other place has become only a government 
     <lb/>
     rubber stamp, with no possibility of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition affecting any controversial legis<lb break="no"/>lation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Since the government will name the sen<lb break="no"/>ators from Newfoundland, I suggest to the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister that one half be named from 
     <lb/>
     supporters of the official opposition and one 
     <lb/>
     half from government supporters. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROO1">Mr. Brooks</persName>: Everybody seems to be giv<lb break="no"/>ing advice to the government as to whom they 
     <lb/>
     should appoint to the Senate. I noticed that 
     <lb/>
     three religious denominations were men<lb break="no"/>tioned. I thought that I should mention the 
     <lb/>
     military forces of Newfoundland. Yesterday 
     <lb/>
     we heard of the splendid record of the navy, 
     <lb/>
     the army and the air force of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     I remember that after the first world war 
     <lb/>
     vacancies in the Senate were filled from the 
     <lb/>
     different armed forces. If that practice was 
     <lb/>
     good in those days it is good now. I suggest 
     <lb/>
     to the Prime Minister that in making these 
     <lb/>
     appointments he consider making some of 
     <lb/>
     them from the different armed forces. The 
     <lb/>
     armed forces are entitled to this consideration 
     <lb/>
     and Newfoundland would be a good place to 
     <lb/>
     start. It could then be followed out in filling 
     <lb/>
     the large number of vacancies that we have 
     <lb/>
     in Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: I thank hon. members for 
     <lb/>
     the advice that is being tendered tonight. I 
     <lb/>
     would not have risen even to express my 
     <lb/>
     thanks were it not that I find it necessary to 
     <lb/>
     differ from the opinion expressed by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Davenport. It would be a mistake 
     <lb/>
     to have in the other place gentlemen feeling 
     <lb/>
     that they had a responsibility to a govern<lb break="no"/>ment of a Canadian province. National unity 
     <lb/>
     in Canada demands that all those who form 
     <lb/>
     part of the Canadian parliament feel that 
     <lb/>
     their responsibility is to the Canadian people 
     <lb/>
     as a whole, and that they are not the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of any provincial government or 
     <lb/>
     any municipality or other local authority. 
     <lb/>
     On that point I feel that I have to differ from 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman. But I do recognize that

     it is abnormal that there should be, in the 
     <lb/>
     event forecast by the hon. member, a Senate 
     <lb/>
     composed exclusively of members of one 
     <lb/>
     party. That is something which is giving 
     <lb/>
     concern not only to hon. members on the 
     <lb/>
     other side of the house but to others. I can 
     <lb/>
     assure hon. members that we have within 
     <lb/>
     our own party serious misgivings about the 
     <lb/>
     situation that is apt to occur because of the 
     <lb/>
     way in which the Canadian public favours 
     <lb/>
     those who are elected to this house.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACN2">Mr. MacNicol</persName>: Can the minister give the

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: I do not remember his

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HANS1">Mr. Hansell</persName>: The Prime Minister has 
     <lb/>
     thanked us for some little advice that he may 
     <lb/>
     have received from members of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion. I should like to put my little finger in 
     <lb/>
     the pie and give him some further advice. I 
     <lb/>
     appreciate what he has said with respect to 
     <lb/>
     the overbalancing of one side of the other 
     <lb/>
     place, but there is a way in which it can be 
     <lb/>
     overcome. I know that I am not voicing 
     <lb/>
     anything new, but from my experience here 
     <lb/>
     a feeling has grown upon me that we are in 
     <lb/>
     need of some parliamentary and electoral 
     <lb/>
     reform. No country remains static. We make 
     <lb/>
     progress. We change our ideas and we 
     <lb/>
     change the machinery which is used to put 
     <lb/>
     over those ideas. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I contend, Mr. Chairman, that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment and this entire house should give some 
     <lb/>
     consideration to a change in our parlia<lb break="no"/>mentary and electoral machinery and have 
     <lb/>
     the gentlemen who sit in the other place 
     <lb/>
     elected by common consent of the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. Personally I see no particular 
     <lb/>
     reason why in the other place there should be 
     <lb/>
     sitting two apparently separate bodies, one 
     <lb/>
     the counterpart of the government side of 
     <lb/>
     the house and the other the counterpart of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition side. Why cannot that body be 
     <lb/>
     a true example of a democratic institution? 
     <lb/>
     Let each member act independently and 
     <lb/>
     oppose or favour a measure as his experience 
     <lb/>
     guides him. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I know it is difficult to put this election idea 
     <lb/>
     over to any government which is in power. 
     <lb/>
     It is extremely difficult to do that because 
     <lb/>
     naturally they like to have the privilege of 
     <lb/>
     appointing various distinguished gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     to that other place. I am confident every one 
     <lb/>
     of us is aware of the fact that in Canada 
     <lb/>
     there is a large body of opinion which be<lb break="no"/>littles our parliamentary institutions. I do 
     <lb/>
     not know that the hon. member for Van<lb break="no"/>couver Centre was right when he made the 


            <cb/>

remark which caused so much discussion the 
     <lb/>other day, but I just wonder how much of 
     <lb/>that kind of thinking is retained in the public 
     <lb/>mind. The effectiveness or the ineffectiveness 
     <lb/>of our parliamentary institutions is the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of some concern to us and to the people 
     <lb/>of Canada. We do know that in Canada 
     <lb/>many people hold the view that the gentle<lb break="no"/>men who sit in the other place sit there as 
     <lb/>the result of having been good party sup<lb break="no"/>porters in the past, and what they have 
     <lb/>received is just a juicy political plum.

     should be elected by the people of Canada.

     fact that gentlemen are called to the other

     place. I was wondering whether the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister was going to select some ladies for 
     <lb/>
     the other place. There are two there now. 
     <lb/>
     The women of Canada constitute over 50 per 
     <lb/>
     cent of the voting strength of the country. 
     <lb/>
     They should also be appointed to the other

     <persName ref="pers:ROWE2">Mr. Rowe</persName>: The Minister of Justice has said

     that we have it now. It is reformed because 
     <lb/>
     nothing has been appointed to it for a number 
     <lb/>
     of years except reformers. However, the pre<lb break="no"/>decessor of the Prime Minister stated on one

     occasion, when asking about reforming the

     Senate by his government except those who 
     <lb/>
     were committed to submit to any reforms the

     <lb/>
     should like to ask the Prime Minister whether 
     <lb/>
     in the appointment of these new senators 
     <lb/>
     from Newfoundland he would inflict that 
     <lb/>
     obligation upon them which, I understand,

     has been inflicted upon every senator

     <persName ref="pers:KNOW1">Mr. Knowles</persName>: —suggests the sense of frus<lb break="no"/>tration which we feel about this branch of 
     <lb/>
     parliamentary government, namely the other 
     <lb/>
     place. I think the hon. member for Macleod 
     <lb/>
     was hitting the nail on the head when he 
     <lb/>
     referred to some disillusionment on the part 
     <lb/>
     of people with respect to parliamentary insti<lb break="no"/>tutions; and that part of that stems from the 
     <lb/>
     feeling that we are maintaining an institution 
     <lb/>
     which does not fill a proper and necessary 
     <lb/>
     place.

            <p>
     My question, either of the Prime Minister, 
     <lb/>
     or of the Minister of National Defence, both 
     <lb/>
     of whom were involved in these negotiations, 
     <lb/>
     is this: Was there any discussion with the 
     <lb/>
     representatives from Newfoundland about 
     <lb/>
     possible changes in or reforms of the Senate? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: To the best of my knowl<lb break="no"/>edge the question was not raised.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KNOW1">Mr. Knowles</persName>: By neither side?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KNOW1">Mr. Knowles</persName>: Then I take it that the 
     <lb/>
     present government is not concerned with 
     <lb/>
     reforming the Senate?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: Oh, my hon. friend can 
     <lb/>
     take what he likes from it, but that does not 
     <lb/>
     flow from anything I said. I said, on the 
     <lb/>
     contrary, that there were in our party many 
     <lb/>
     members who were concerned about a situa<lb break="no"/>tion which was apt to arise under conditions

     forecast by the hon. member for Davenport.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GRAY2">Mr. Graydon</persName>: Not forecast, no; it was a

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FLEM1">Mr. Fleming</persName>: At the risk of changing the

     subject, I should like to draw the attention 
 

            <cb/>
       

     of the committee to another provision in the 
     <lb/>
     group of articles with which the committee 
     <lb/>
     is now dealing. Article 6 (3) states: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     The chief electoral officer shall have authority to

            <p>
     Attention has already been directed to the 
     <lb/>
     fact that this election cannot take place in 
     <lb/>
     any event until after April 1. In view of that 
     <lb/>
     circumstance, what justification can there be 
     <lb/>
     for vesting, in an appointed official, authority 
     <lb/>
     to adapt legislative enactments of this par<lb break="no"/>liament? That seems to me an extraordinary 
     <lb/>
     provision. Parliament enacts provisions, and 
     <lb/>
     now it is proposed that an appointed official 
     <lb/>
     shall be given authority to adapt those legis<lb break="no"/>lative provisions to meet the circumstances 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I suggest there is ample time for parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to do everything required to adapt the 
     <lb/>
     provisions of the elections act to the circum<lb break="no"/>stances to be found in Newfoundland, and 
     <lb/>
     that this is a departure which parliament 
     <lb/>
     ought not lightly to tolerate, namely the 
     <lb/>
     proposal that authority be vested in an 
     <lb/>
     appointed official to adapt the legislative 
     <lb/>
     enactments of this parliament.

     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Eglinton might do well to read the elections 
     <lb/>
     act. He would find in it provisions put there 
     <lb/>
     by parliament authorizing the electoral offi<lb break="no"/>cers to adapt the provisions of the act to 
     <lb/>
     special circumstances of individual cases. 
     <lb/>
     That was put there by parliament, and has 
     <lb/>
     been there for a great many years. Probably 
     <lb/>
     it was there when the hon. member was

            <p>
     There exist in Newfoundland special cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances which do not exist in other Cana<lb break="no"/>dian provinces. There are provisions for the 
     <lb/>
     revision of electoral lists by officials who are 
     <lb/>
     called by one name—county or district court 
     <lb/>
     judges—in the other Canadian provinces, and 
     <lb/>
     these judicial functions are normally per<lb break="no"/>formed by an official who goes under another 
     <lb/>
     designation in Newfoundland. It is matters 
     <lb/>
     of that kind which the chief electoral officer 
     <lb/>
     would have to adapt as conditions arose, as 
     <lb/>
     he is authorized to make those adaptations 
     <lb/>
     under the elections act for the other parts of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. That is all there is to it; there is 
     <lb/>
     nothing more sinister than that.

     Dominion Elections Act to Newfoundland as 
     <lb/>
     it applies to other parts of Canada? This 
     <lb/>
     article certainly suggests on the face of it 
     <lb/>
     much more than what I contend is in the 
     <lb/>
     elections act, by way of vesting powers in 
     <lb/>
     the chief electoral officer. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: An attempt was made in 
     <lb/>
     drafting these terms to satisfy the delegation 
     <lb/>
     from Newfoundland, one which in its com<lb break="no"/>position comprised some very distinguished 
     <lb/>
     lawyers. In the group there were the law 
     <lb/>
     officers of the Canadian government, and the 
     <lb/>
     law officers the delegation from Newfound<lb break="no"/>land brought with them. They suggested it 
     <lb/>
     would be advisable to have this provision in 
     <lb/>
     there to take care of such differences as con<lb break="no"/>ditions might present. And the recommenda<lb break="no"/>tion made by the law officers accompanying 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland delegation and those ac<lb break="no"/>companying the Canadian delegation were 
     <lb/>
     thought to be unobjectionable, with the result 
     <lb/>
     that the clause was inserted. One of the law 
     <lb/>
     officers acting for the Newfoundland delega<lb break="no"/>tion was the dean of the law school of Dal<lb break="no"/>housie university. They considered all these 
     <lb/>
     matters in detail and made their recommen<lb break="no"/>dations. They appeared to the two delega<lb break="no"/>tions to be unobjectionable,   and were 
     <lb/>inserted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TIMM1">Mr. Timmins</persName>: My recollection is that last 
     <lb/>
     year when the previous prime minister was 
     <lb/>
     speaking to the house, and we were talking 
     <lb/>
     on the matter of Senate reform, he informed 
     <lb/>
     the house that in respect of later appoint<lb break="no"/>ments he had made to the Senate there were 
     <lb/>
     certain conditions attached—that he had 
     <lb/>
     spoken to members to be appointed, and had 
     <lb/>
     suggested to them some conditions, and that 
     <lb/>
     he would expect them to respect any change 
     <lb/>
     or reform that might be made in the Senate, 
     <lb/>
     if any reforms or changes were to be made. 
     <lb/>
     I say, if there are changes or reforms to be 
     <lb/>
     made. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I am sure the Prime Minister is not un<lb break="no"/>mindful, and has knowledge, of what those 
     <lb/>
     recommendations or commitments were when 
     <lb/>
     they were made, and I should like to have 
     <lb/>
     him tell the house whether that same policy 
     <lb/>
     is to be followed in the future in making 
     <lb/>
     appointments to the Senate from Newfound<lb break="no"/>land or whether the matter was given any 
     <lb/>
     consideration when the discussions took place.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: The matter was given no 
     <lb/>
     consideration when the discussions took place. 
     <lb/>
     With respect to conditions imposed upon 
     <lb/>
     appointees to the Senate, I must say to the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member that I have no knowledge of 
     <lb/>
     any having been imposed.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GREE1">Mr. Green</persName>: May I ask the Prime Minister a 
     <lb/>
     question. On the same date that the terms 
     <lb/>
     were signed certain statements were given to 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland delegation some of which 
     <lb/>
     seemed to tie in with sections of the terms 
     <lb/>
     of union. Can the Prime Minister tell us 
     <lb/>
     whether there are to be subsequent agree<lb break="no"/>ments between Canada and Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     with regard to some of the questions con<lb break="no"/>tained in the statements, or just what is to 
     <lb/>
     be done? For example, there is one state<lb break="no"/>ment having to do with elections and changes 
     <lb/>
     in electoral divisions. Are there to be further 
     <lb/>
     agreements dealing with some of these items 
     <lb/>
    that were raised by the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>delegation?   
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: I know of no further 
     <lb/>agreements. These statements were in respect 
     <lb/>of matters which it was felt Were not proper 
     <lb/>to have put into the terms of union which 
     <lb/>would become the constitution of the new pro<lb break="no"/>vince. We were constantly being told by mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Newfoundland delegation: Our 
     <lb/>understanding is such and so. I told them that 
     <lb/>I did not want them to understand anything 
     <lb/>that was not going to be brought before the 
     <lb/>houses of parliament when the terms of 
     <lb/>union were being confirmed, that everything 
     <lb/>that they felt had influenced their attitude 
     <lb/>should be put in the form of statements that 
     <lb/>could be given to the houses of parliament. 
     <lb/>We could then assert to the houses of parlia<lb break="no"/>ment that all that was being undertaken in 
     <lb/>the form of constitutional obligations was in 
     <lb/>the terms of union; that in discussing the 
     <lb/>terms of union we had declared what would 
     <lb/>be the policy of this government but that 
     <lb/>that would not bind anyone but ourselves. 
     <lb/>Nevertheless we felt that it would be unfair

     to the houses of parliament if we did not 
     <lb/>
     make known to them what declarations as 
     <lb/>
     to policy we had made during the course of 
     <lb/>
     the discussions. It was for that reason that 
     <lb/>
     these statements were made up. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Many more things were talked about than 
     <lb/>
     are referred to in these statements. We asked 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland delegation to give us an 
     <lb/>
     indication of all the things that they were 
     <lb/>
     taking as probable future happenings, and 
     <lb/>
     we said that we would put them in the docu<lb break="no"/>ment that we would produce before parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. We would not ask parliament to make 
     <lb/>
     these part of the terms of union but parlia<lb break="no"/>ment would know what this government 
     <lb/>
     intended to do so long as it was the govern<lb break="no"/>ment responsible for the direction of affairs. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I have not looked at the terms, but with 
     <lb/>
     respect to the electoral boundaries my recol<lb break="no"/>lection is that they were told that, after each 
     <lb/>
     decennial census, a redistribution bill was 
     <lb/>
     introduced and a committee set up to con<lb break="no"/>sider the boundaries of each constituency and 
     <lb/>
     to make a report to parliament. They were 
     <lb/>
     told that with respect to the boundaries of 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland constituencies that would 
     <lb/>
     come about in the regular way. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     There were some members who did not 
     <lb/>
     want to take the responsibility for those 
     <lb/>
     boundaries because they said that they did 
     <lb/>
     not know enough about where the lines would 
     <lb/>
     run to want them to be permanent boundaries. 
     <lb/>
     They were quite satisfied that they be the 
     <lb/>
     boundaries for the first election and that 
     <lb/>
     somebody else should take the responsibility 
     <lb/>
     of saying what should be the boundaries of 
     <lb/>
     the constituencies for future elections. They 
     <lb/>
     were told that that responsibility would be 
     <lb/>
     taken, in the first instance, by the committee 
     <lb/>
     of the house that studied the matter and 
     <lb/>
     reported to parliament and, ultimately, by 
     <lb/>
     parliament when approving or disapproving 
     <lb/>
     of the recommendations made by the 
     <lb/>
     committee. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GREE1">Mr. Green</persName>: I raised the question because 
     <lb/>
     some of the statements are an indication of 
     <lb/>
     government policies while others say that 
     <lb/>
     further consideration will be given to this or 
     <lb/>
     that subject and then agreement will be 
     <lb/>
     reached. In reading over the pamphlet it 
     <lb/>
     seemed to me that several things had been 
     <lb/>
     left in the air, that they have not yet been 
     <lb/>
     decided, and apparently are to be dealt with 
     <lb/>
     at a later date. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     For example, there is the question of

     responsibility for the Northern Labrador 
     <lb/>
     Trading Operations, which is to be the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of discussions between Canada and New<lb break="no"/>foundland, or if necessary the province of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. Then reference is made to

     penitentiaries and the question whether 
     <lb/>
     national harbours will be set up in New<lb break="no"/>foundland.

            <cb/>
 
            <p>
     What is the intention of the government 
     <lb/>
     with respect to these particular items where 
     <lb/>
     obviously no conclusion has been reached as 
     <lb/>
     yet but on which conclusion is to be reached 
     <lb/>
     shortly? Will there be further agreements, 
     <lb/>
     or just what does the government plan to do? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: These are matters which 
     <lb/>
     would be determined either by the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government, under its responsibility to the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian parliament, or by the government 
     <lb/>
     of the island, under its responsibility to the 
     <lb/>
     legislature, according to where the jurisdic<lb break="no"/>tion may lie. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With respect to penitentiaries, there will 
     <lb/>
     have to be an agreement with the province. 
     <lb/>
     They were told it was unlikely, that probably 
     <lb/>
     it would be undesirable to establish a federal 
     <lb/>
     penitentiary in Newfoundland, and that it 
     <lb/>
     probably would also be undesirable to bring 
     <lb/>
     prisoners convicted by the courts of New<lb break="no"/>foundland to the penitentiary at Dorchester 
     <lb/>
     because of the inconvenience to their families 
     <lb/>
     or friends when visiting them. It was stated 
     <lb/>
     that for the start there would be made an 
     <lb/>
     arrangement whereby the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment, being responsible for the care and main<lb break="no"/>tenance of those sentenced to terms of two 
     <lb/>
     years or more, would undertake to reimburse 
     <lb/>
     the government of Newfoundland for caring 
     <lb/>
     for these prisoners in the provincial jails. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That is something which will have to be 
     <lb/>
     worked out and we would hope to have it 
     <lb/>
     worked out in a manner that would be most 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory to the people of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     and to the Canadian people. There is another 
     <lb/>
     provision concerning certain boats that are 
     <lb/>
     presently owned by the government of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GREE1">Mr. Green</persName>: Clarenville boats? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: Yes, Clarenville boats. 
     <lb/>
     They are operated in a manner which is con<lb break="no"/>ducive to the development of the trade of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. They carry relatively small 
     <lb/>
     cargoes of fish down to ports they can get 
     <lb/>
     into and that large boats carrying heavier 
     <lb/>
     cargoes cannot visit, and from those ports 
     <lb/>
     they bring back commodities that enter into 
     <lb/>
     the trade of Newfoundland. It is a desirable 
     <lb/>
     trade for the economy of Newfoundland. It 
     <lb/>
     might be very undesirable to attempt to have 
     <lb/>
     these boats operated by the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     National steamship lines, because then their 
     <lb/>
     operation would come under the collective 
     <lb/>
     agreements between the steamship lines and 
     <lb/>
     the seamen, which might make the operation 
     <lb/>
     of these boats so costly that instead of being 
     <lb/>
     profitable it would be detrimental to the 
     <lb/>
     economy of Newfoundland. There had not 
     <lb/>
     been time or opportunity to determine just 
     <lb/>
     what would be the most practicable way of 
     <lb/>
     continuing the operation of those boats in 
     <lb/>
     order to benefit the economy of the island. 
     <lb/>
     There a question arose as to whether the

     government of the island could operate boats 
     <lb/>
     in international trade, and that was not 
     <lb/>
     finally determined. The outcome was, "Well, 
     <lb/>
     we all know that we want to have done that 
     <lb/>
     which will best contribute to the economy of 
     <lb/>
     the island, but at the present time we do not 
     <lb/>
     know what that will have to be. We will 
     <lb/>
     trust each other and work out something 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory in that regard."

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GREE1">Mr. Green</persName>: These are more or less loose

     ends that will have to be tied up as the

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: That is so; just as there 
     <lb/>
     is another loose end with respect to public

     advice to other hon. members as to how we

     brought up this question because in this

     to the ex-servicemen of Newfoundland. I

     <lb/>
     much because of the statement made a few 
     <lb/>
     moments ago by the Prime Minister that 
     <lb/>
     some eminent counsel and the law officers of 
     <lb/>
     the crown drafted this agreement; but sup<lb break="no"/>posing we have an amendment to the British

     North America Act subsequent to this date, 
     <lb/>
     dealing with the representation in the House

     of Commons and the Senate. Is the Prime

     Minister satisfied that Newfoundland, the 
     <lb/>
     new province, could not take the position 
     <lb/>
     that they would not be bound by a subse<lb break="no"/>quent amendment, in view of this wording? 
     <lb/>
     Should it not read "1867 and amendments

     thereto"?

            <cb/>


            <p><persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: This is the official descrip<lb break="no"/>tion of the British North America Acts deter<lb break="no"/>mined by the parliament of the United 
     <lb/>Kingdom. Each of the amending statutes 
     <lb/>contains a provision substantially along this 
     <lb/>line: "This act may be known as the British 
     <lb/>North America Act, 1946; and this act and 
     <lb/>the others may be described together as the 
     <lb/>British North America Acts, 1867 to 1946." 
     <lb/>The description is always of the original and 
     <lb/>all those up to the date of the one that is 
     <lb/>mentioned.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JAEN1">Mr. Jaenicke</persName>: I realize that; but supposing 
     <lb/>
     we have another amendment, say in 1950 or 
     <lb/>
     1951. Would not Newfoundland then be in a 
     <lb/>
     position, if they do not agree with that 
     <lb/>
     amendment, to say, "We are not bound by it, 
     <lb/>
     because we are only bound by the amend<lb break="no"/>ments to the British North America Act up 
     <lb/>
     to 1946"?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: No. That matter was given 
     <lb/>
     serious consideration, and a provision was 
     <lb/>
     even drafted and considered by the law 
     <lb/>
     officers providing that the reference to any 
     <lb/>
     act would mean that act or any amendments 
     <lb/>
     made or to be made thereto. However, they 
     <lb/>
     came to the conclusion that it was unneces<lb break="no"/>sary to have this kind of statement, that the

     interpretation acts of Canada, Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     and the United Kingdom were sufficient in

     the same number of members in the other

     At that stage, when Newfoundland comes

     the constitution which, as I understand it,

     was derogated from, or whatever the proper

     by the parliament of Canada; it would have

     to be done by the parliament of the United

            <p>
     The delegation from Newfoundland and its

     the province of Newfoundland to get a new

     constitution out of the union. They wanted 
     <lb/>
     to be in the position of the provinces of

     Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, which had

     constitutions before union and retained all 
     <lb/>
     the powers of their constitutions, except those

     given to the central authority. It was for 
     <lb/>
     that reason that the dean of the law school

     was insistent upon having the constitution 
     <lb/>
     revived an instant before union becomes

     <lb/>
     At that time, this parliament had control

     reasonably stipulate it would part with that 
     <lb/>
     control, subject only to certain guarantees 
     <lb/>
     of the rights of minorities. The delegates 
     <lb/>
     from Newfoundland were told we had no con<lb break="no"/>trol over their educational system at the

     <lb/>
     make any provision it wished to make with

     being written into the constitution because 
     <lb/>
     they have complete jurisdiction themselves; 
     <lb/>
     but if, for the satisfaction of their own people, 
     <lb/>
     they felt it was preferable to have a guarantee 
     <lb/>
     written into the constitution, we could not 
     <lb/>
     object. The matter was discussed back and 
     <lb/>
     forth for quite a long time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. member knows that the sanction 
     <lb/>
     of the rights of minorities under section 93 
     <lb/>
     of the British North America Act is an appeal 
     <lb/>
     to the governor in council and the enact<lb break="no"/>ment by this parliament of remedial legisla<lb break="no"/>tion. The hon. member knows what difficul<lb break="no"/>ties arose out of appeals under that section 
     <lb/>
     and out of the attempt to pass remedial legis<lb break="no"/>lation some forty years ago. It was felt by 
     <lb/>
     the delegation from Newfoundland that it 
     <lb/>
     would be more effective to have the clause 
     <lb/>
     concerning guarantees drawn in this way so 
     <lb/>
     that the legislature would have complete con<lb break="no"/>trol over education but would not have juris<lb break="no"/>diction to do things that would impinge upon 
     <lb/>
     the rights of minorities. To do those things 
     <lb/>
     would be a denial of jurisdiction. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If an attempt were made to do those things, 
     <lb/>
     the recourse is to the courts of law. The 
     <lb/>
     courts of law will examine whether or not 
     <lb/>
     the thing that is being done is contrary to the 
     <lb/>
     guarantee written into this clause. If it is 
     <lb/>
     found by the courts of law to be contrary, 
     <lb/>
     the courts of law declare it to be void and 
     <lb/>
     unconstitutional. It was felt that would be 
     <lb/>
     a more effective safeguard than appeal to the 
     <lb/>
     governor in council and a requestto the cen<lb break="no"/>tral parliament to pass remedial legislation.

     <persName ref="pers:FULT1">Mr. Fulton</persName>: I take it, then, one might sum<lb break="no"/>marize the effect of this section by saying it 
     <lb/>
     has the effect of preserving permanently the 
     <lb/>
     status quo in Newfoundland and providing, 
     <lb/>
     instead of an appeal to the governor in coun<lb break="no"/>cil against infringement and action by parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, an appeal to the bench of the Supreme 
     <lb/>
     Court of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: The ultimate appeal 
     <lb/>
     would be to the Supreme Court of Canada. It 
     <lb/>
     would be an appeal to the ordinary provincial 
     <lb/>
     courts in the first instance, but ultimately 
     <lb/>
     there could be an appeal to the Supreme 
     <lb/>
     Court of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. member says the effect is to fix 
     <lb/>
     the status quo for all time, but that is subject 
     <lb/>
     to some modification. I understand the 
     <lb/>
     schools in Newfoundland are denominational 
     <lb/>
     schools, but under the present practice differ<lb break="no"/>ent denominations can amalgamate for a 
     <lb/>
     school district. The right to do that is pre<lb break="no"/>served. Moreover, there is a right in the 
     <lb/>
     legislature to set up other schools than those 
     <lb/>
     which exist at the present time, but it is 
     <lb/>
     provided that if they do set up other schools 
     <lb/>
     they must not discriminate against the 
     <lb/>
     denominational schools in the districts. Such 
     <lb/>
     was the desire of the delegates from New<lb break="no"/>foundland; and, as the hon. member has indi<lb break="no"/>cated, the sanction was to be an appeal to 
     <lb/>
     the courts, not an appeal to a political body. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KIDD2">Mr. Kidd</persName>: May I direct a question to the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. the Prime Minister? It has to do 
     <lb/>
     with the education of veterans. I notice that 
     <lb/>
     veterans affairs comes under section 38, but 
     <lb/>
     I do not see the word "education" mentioned 
     <lb/>
     in section 38, so I am taking this opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of asking my question. The Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     may be familiar with the educational system 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland. There are no universities 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland and a student wishing to 
     <lb/>
     receive advanced education, after receiving 
     <lb/>
     first or second year college, has to go to 
     <lb/>
     Dalhousie, McGill, Queen's or varsity. The 
     <lb/>
     student finishes his education and takes his 
     <lb/>
     degree there. The result has been that a 
     <lb/>
     great many Newfoundlanders who came to 
     <lb/>
     Canada for their education remained in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. There were those, of course, who 
     <lb/>
     had to go back because of some business 
     <lb/>
     association in the island. I may say that 
     <lb/>
     Canada has benefited during the past thirty 
     <lb/>
     or forty years from the large number of New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders who have remained here upon 
     <lb/>
     completion of their education. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
       In the universities at the present time we 
     <lb/>
     have the veterans of world war II. Will the 
     <lb/>
     veterans who are attending university today, 
     <lb/>
     and those who come in next year, receive' the 
     <lb/>
     same grants? My question might be directed 
     <lb/>
     through you, Mr. Chairman, to the Minister of 
    

            <cb/>


     Veterans Affairs. I know this matter has 
     <lb/>
     been taken up, and that the student veterans 
     <lb/>
     in university today get $60 and $80. I have 
     <lb/>
     in mind particularly the veteran who today 
     <lb/>
     is taking a medical course, who has perhaps 
     <lb/>
     another three or four years ahead of him—it 
     <lb/>
     is a long course—and whose money is running 
     <lb/>
     out. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GREG1">Mr. Gregg</persName>: As my hon. friend said, that 
     <lb/>
     matter properly comes under section 38, 
     <lb/>
     paragraph (f). Perhaps I am out of order 
     <lb/>
     but I think I can answer the question quite 
     <lb/>
     briefly. Paragraph (f) reads:

     <lb/>
     had been a Canadian veteran.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DICK1">Mr. Dickey</persName>: On this section on education 
     <lb/>
     I should like to say just a word. Many 
     <lb/>
     tributes were paid in this house yesterday to 
     <lb/>
     the various groups and influences which, 
     <lb/>
     down through the years, have contributed to 
     <lb/>
     the drawing together of the old colony of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland and this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think one of the strongest and most 
     <lb/>
     important of those influences, which was not 
     <lb/>
     mentioned, is the number of young men and 
     <lb/>
     young women of Newfoundland who, through 
     <lb/>
     the years, have come to the universities and 
     <lb/>
     colleges of eastern Canada for the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of completing their education, and I refer 
     <lb/>
     particularly to the colleges and universities of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia. It has been a delight to those 
     <lb/>
     institutions to have these welcome visitors 
     <lb/>
     who have made so signal a contribution to 
     <lb/>
     their academic life. When speaking a few 
     <lb/>
     minutes ago, one hon. member referred to 
     <lb/>
     the fact that, of those Newfoundland young 
     <lb/>
     people who came to Canada to complete their 
     <lb/>
     education, a great many stayed in Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Happily that has not been true in every case. 
     <lb/>
     Perhaps indicative of the importance of the 
     <lb/>
     bearing this has on the happy subject we 
     <lb/>
     are discussing tonight is the fact that four 
     <lb/>
     out of the six Newfoundland delegates, who 
     <lb/>
     came here to discuss with the representatives 
     <lb/>
     of the government of Canada the terms of 
     <lb/>
     union which we are here discussing, were 
     <lb/>
     graduates of the law school of Dalhousie 
     <lb/>
     university. I am sure we all hope that the 
     <lb/>
     young men and young women of the new 
     <lb/>
     province will continue to come and pursue 
     <lb/>
     their studies at the eastern Canadian univer<lb break="no"/>sities to which their' fathers and mothers 
     <lb/>
     came in their day. Along with a widespread 
     <lb/>
     and, I hope, important development in the

     educational life of the new province itself, 
     <lb/>
     will be the backing and the help of the 
     <lb/>
     existing institutions which have contributed 
     <lb/>
     in great measure to the professional and 
     <lb/>
     cultural life of Newfoundland down through 
     <lb/>
     the years.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TIMM1">Mr. Timmins</persName>: I do not think it would be 
     <lb/>
     inappropriate to say that a good number of 
     <lb/>
     the young men from Newfoundland have 
     <lb/>
     found their way up to Ontario to seek their 
     <lb/>
     education. The   Secretary of State for 
     <lb/>
     External Affairs will bear me out when I say 
     <lb/>
     that he and I, as students at Victoria col<lb break="no"/>lege in Toronto, had with us many young men 
     <lb/>
     from Newfoundland, a good number of whom 
     <lb/>
     have become professors in Canadian univer<lb break="no"/>sities. One of them was also a delegate who 
     <lb/>
     came from Newfoundland to consult with our 
     <lb/>
     officials and our Prime Minister in respect of 
     <lb/>
     this act of union. We have welcomed many 
     <lb/>
     in the past, and I think that in the future 
     <lb/>
     we will welcome more and more of these 
     <lb/>
     young men to our various universities, par<lb break="no"/>ticularly those in Ontario.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BENT1">Mr. Bentley</persName>: I should like to ask the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister whether consideration has been 
     <lb/>
     given to certain things. When speaking on 
     <lb/>
     second reading of the bill this afternoon, the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition pointed out, in con<lb break="no"/>nection with oleomargarine, that there was 
     <lb/>
     embodied in this agreement a certain term 
     <lb/>
     which, while it may not be operative now, 
     <lb/>
     since time and circumstances have removed 
     <lb/>
     the need for it at the present time, is never<lb break="no"/>theless there for future consideration by any<lb break="no"/>one who may feel that he may want to take 
     <lb/>
     advantage of it. In this section the same 
     <lb/>
     thing happens. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Prime Minister has said that the terms 
     <lb/>
     of the Newfoundland delegation with regard 
     <lb/>
     to their educational system were something 
     <lb/>
     they themselves wanted, and that the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian delegation agreed to them because the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland delegation wanted them. That 
     <lb/>
     means that there is a departure from the 
     <lb/>
     regular practices under the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act in that the new province of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, when union takes place, will 
     <lb/>
     not need to appeal to His Excellency the 
     <lb/>
     Governor General—or to the lieutenant 
     <lb/>
     governor, I presume, in the case of a province 
     <lb/>
     —for any changes in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     agreement. That may be all right. Tradi<lb break="no"/>tionally, Newfoundland undoubtedly wants 
     <lb/>
     that. They are accustomed to it. But did the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian delegates consider seriously the 
     <lb/>
     pOSsibility that if this becomes part of the 
     <lb/>
     agreement by consent of Canada, then in the 
     <lb/>
     future some other provinces which may wish 
     <lb/>
     to adopt this particular procedure may pos<lb break="no"/>sibly put up a strenuous fight, and that we 
     <lb/>
     shall find our whole Canadian system of 


            <cb/>


     education altered to suit that of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land? Was that possibility considered when 
     <lb/>
     the matter was under discussion? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: I do not think this term 
     <lb/>
     can have any effect on the educational system 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland or in Canada. It is a modi<lb break="no"/>fication of the guarantees of minority rights 
     <lb/>
     set out in the original British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act. In the acts which created the provinces 
     <lb/>
     of Alberta and Saskatchewan there were 
     <lb/>
     made for those two provinces special pro<lb break="no"/>visions which were somewhat ditferent from 
     <lb/>
     the terms set out in the original British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act. The hon. member sug<lb break="no"/>gests the possibility of some province wishing 
     <lb/>
     to have these or similar terms instead of 
     <lb/>
     having the terms that are now in the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act. I do not know how an 
     <lb/>
     an amendment of that kind could be brought 
     <lb/>
     about. I think it would be a relief to all of 
     <lb/>
     us in Canada if these matters could be dealt 
     <lb/>
     with by the courts of justice whenever there 
     <lb/>
     was any feeling that a minority right had 
     <lb/>
     been violated, instead of being dealt with 
     <lb/>
     by means of an appeal to a political body. 
     <lb/>
     The experience of the Canadian public with 
     <lb/>
     respect to appeals that have been taken under 
     <lb/>
     section 93 of the British North America Act 
     <lb/>
     is really an unhappy one. It has created 
     <lb/>
     disunion, and whatever disposition was made 
     <lb/>
     by the governor in council, there was a large 
     <lb/>
     section disappointed and dissatisfied with 
     <lb/>
     the decision. They are apt to consider that 
     <lb/>
     the decision is not really a judicial but a 
     <lb/>
     political one. In these matters where there 
     <lb/>
     are to be constitutional safeguards it is better 
     <lb/>
     to have them sanctioned by judicial decisions 
     <lb/>
     than by decisions which many people feel 
     <lb/>
     are more of a political than of a judicial 
     <lb/>
     character.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BENT1">Mr. Bentley</persName>: The Prime Minister has tacitly 
     <lb/>
     agreed that what I suggested might happen 
     <lb/>
     could happen and would be desirable. If a 
     <lb/>
     province wished to adopt this particular prin<lb break="no"/>ciple or practice, any changes in educational 
     <lb/>
     matters would not be subject to a legislative 
     <lb/>
     body.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: No; all changes, under this 
     <lb/>
     section, have to be made by the legislative 
     <lb/>
     body of Newfoundland, but if the legislative 
     <lb/>
     body of Newfoundland attempted to do some<lb break="no"/>thing that violated a minority right, instead 
     <lb/>
     of having a political body decide the question 
     <lb/>
     whether or not there was a violation, that 
     <lb/>
     question would be decided by a judicial body. 
     <lb/>
     It is the same in the other provinces. There 
     <lb/>
     are guarantees of minority rights. But when 
     <lb/>
     there is a contention that they have been 
     <lb/>
     violated, instead of going to the courts to 
     <lb/>
     determine whether that is so or not the matter 
     <lb/>

     language which does not perhaps accurately

     describe what the supreme court did. The

     supreme court did not abolish the law. The

     their jurisdiction. Beyond that I cannot go. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member knows that it is not only 
     <lb/>
     with respect to oleomargarine that the courts

     have found that after a long period something

     Perhaps he remembers what happened to the

     <lb/>many years in a manner which the Canadian

     regard to the following subsection: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     (1) Subject to these terms, all laws enforced in

     I presume that means that the criminal law 
     <lb/>
     of Canada will probably come into force 
     <lb/>
     immediately after the passing of the act of 
     <lb/>
     union. I should like to know whether the 
     <lb/>
     criminal law of Canada will immediately 
     <lb/>
     supersede the criminal law of Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     or just what the situation is to be. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: No, Mr. Chairman. This 
     <lb/>
     section was drawn precisely for the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of not having the criminal law, among others, 
     <lb/>
     come into force immediately, because we 
     <lb/>
     were informed that it would be embarrassing 
     <lb/>
     to administer the criminal law of Canada 
     <lb/>
     until arrangements had been made to provide 
     <lb/>
     the proper machinery, and that therefore it 
     <lb/>
     would be preferable to have a provision that 
     <lb/>
     these general laws of Canada could from 
     <lb/>
     time to time be put into force in the province 
     <lb/>
     as machinery to administer them had been 
     <lb/>
     previously provided; and that pending that 
     <lb/>
     time the laws in force at the time of union 
     <lb/>
     would continue. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In Quebec at the present time there is a 
     <lb/>
     civil code which came into force in 1866, and 
     <lb/>
     which contains provisions that the parliament 
     <lb/>
     of Canada would have the right to amend or 
     <lb/>
     repeal. But it has not yet been seen fit to 
     <lb/>
     do that. The legislature of Quebec would not 
     <lb/>
     have the right to enact that kind of legisla<lb break="no"/>tion, but it does apply as a part of the legis<lb break="no"/>lation of Quebec until such time as parlia<lb break="no"/>ment sees fit to deal with it. It will be the 
     <lb/>
     same with respect to Newfoundland. They 
     <lb/>
     have a certain body of laws which will con<lb break="no"/>tinue to be applied until by proclamation it 
     <lb/>
     is stated that the present laws of the domin<lb break="no"/>ion in that regard will be substituted for 
     <lb/>
     those that exist in the province. or course it 
     <lb/>
     is not intended that it will take very long. 
     <lb/>
     It is intended to be merely a transitional 
     <lb/>
     measure to bring progressively into force 
     <lb/>
     those Canadian laws under conditions which 
     <lb/>
     will not prove to be embarrassing; and it is 
     <lb/>
     perhaps because there were on the delegation

     those distinguished lawyers, graduates of 
     <lb/>
     Toronto and Dalhousie, that a section such as 
     <lb/>
     this was very carefully considered. We were 
     <lb/>
     told that it would be embarrassing to them in 
     <lb/>
     the administration of criminal justice to jump 
     <lb/>
     right away from a common law system to 
     <lb/>
     the code; that they were not going to take the 
     <lb/>
     trouble of learning our code and our pro<lb break="no"/>cedure until they were sure that they were 
     <lb/>
     going to have to apply it; and that it would 
     <lb/>
     take them some little time after they became 
     <lb/>
     sure that the union was going to be realized 
     <lb/>
     to put themselves in a position properly to 
     <lb/>
     administer the provisions of the Criminal

     <persName ref="pers:HACK1">Mr. Hackett</persName>: Will the Prime Minister say

     to what extent the judgments of the Supreme

     Court of Canada and of the privy council, 
     <lb/>
     in so far as they bear upon the relationship 
     <lb/>
     between the provinces and the dominion, 
     <lb/>
     would find application to the new relation<lb break="no"/>ship about to be established between New<lb break="no"/>foundland and the dominion?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: The only answer I can 
     <lb/>
     make is that it was assumed by delegates on 
     <lb/>
     both sides that the Canadian constitution as 
     <lb/>
     it applies in fact to the other Canadian prov<lb break="no"/>inces would apply to Newfoundland after the

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HACK1">Mr. Hackett</persName>: Is there any enactment to that

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: It was felt that section 3 
     <lb/>
     would have that effect. And then, as the 
     <lb/>
     Statute of Westminster is not one of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Acts, and the decisions 
     <lb/>
     which may be given with respect to the 
     <lb/>
     Statute of Westminster do not affect the Brit<lb break="no"/>ish North America Acts, and vice versa, it 
     <lb/>
     was felt there should be a special declaration 
     <lb/>
     as to the manner in which the Statute of 
     <lb/>
     Westminster would apply to Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     That was provided in section 48. From and 
     <lb/>
     after the date of union it will apply to the 
     <lb/>
     province of Newfoundland as it applies to the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was felt that having section 3, which 
     <lb/>
     refers to the British North America Acts, that 
     <lb/>
     included not only British North America Acts 
     <lb/>
     but those acts as the courts have construed 
     <lb/>
     them to be; and that section 48, adding to it 
     <lb/>
     the Statute of Westminster, would give the 
     <lb/>
     new province exactly the same status as the 
     <lb/>
     other Canadian provinces.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JAEN1">Mr. Jaenicke</persName>: Will the Prime Minister tell

     us whether Newfoundland has a divorce law?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: Newfoundland has no 
     <lb/>
     divorce law; and we were informed that there 
     <lb/>
     were, I believe, three persons who claimed 
    

            <cb/>


     to be divorced because they had gone to other 
     <lb/>
     jurisdictions and there obtained decrees. But 
     <lb/>
     there seemed to be some doubt as to whether 
     <lb/>
     those divorces were divorces which should be 
     <lb/>
     recognized. And of course that would depend 
     <lb/>
     upon whether there had been really a change 
     <lb/>
     of domicile before the divorce decrees were 
     <lb/>
     granted.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PEAR2">Mr. Pearkes</persName>: Will there be any change in 
     <lb/>
     the laws in force on those portions of the 
     <lb/>
     ocean between Canada and Newfoundland? 
     <lb/>
     In other words, will there be any extension 
     <lb/>
     of the extraterritorial waters, now that New<lb break="no"/>foundland will become part of Canada— 
     <lb/>
     because I believe it is customary that when 
     <lb/>
     a portion of the ocean is nearly surrounded 
     <lb/>
     by a country, that water is declared a terri<lb break="no"/>torial water.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: We intend to contend, and 
     <lb/>
     hope to be able to get acquiescence in the con<lb break="no"/>tention that the waters west of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     constituting the gulf of St. Lawrence shall 
     <lb/>
     become an inland sea. We hope that, with 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland as a part of Canadian terri<lb break="no"/>tory, the gulf of St. Lawrence west of New<lb break="no"/>foundland will all become territorial waters 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, whereas before there would be 
     <lb/>
     only the usual off-shore portion that would 
     <lb/>
     thus become part of the territorial waters. Of 
     <lb/>
     course that is a matter which is not governed 
     <lb/>
     by statutes; it is governed by the comity of 
     <lb/>
     nations. It is our intention to assert that 
     <lb/>
     position and it is our hope that it will be 
     <lb/>
     recognized as a valid contention.

     I am afraid the Prime Minister's argument 
     <lb/>
     does not hold good at all. This will mean six 
     <lb/>
     people we will have to look after in that 
     <lb/>
     little island over there—and a certain par<lb break="no"/>liamentary assistant made a speech here not 
     <lb/>
     so long ago along the very lines I am follow<lb break="no"/>ing. If Prince Edward Island, with a handful 
     <lb/>
     of population, is entitled to four senators, then 
     <lb/>
     surely to goodness British Columbia is 
     <lb/>
     entitled to more than six. Surely we are 
     <lb/>
     entitled to more than that, when one of our 
     <lb/>
     larger centres has a greater population than 
     <lb/>
     either of these districts I have mentioned— 
     <lb/>
     including the new province entering con<lb break="no"/>federation. I do not think the Prime Minis<lb break="no"/>ter's argument holds good at all.

     <persName ref="pers:GIBS2">Mr. Gibson</persName> (Comox-Albemi): What the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Fraser Valley has said 
     <lb/>
     must bring closely to the attention of the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister the very urgent need for 
     <lb/>
     reform in the Senate, which was so often 
     <lb/>
     promised by his illustrious predecessor. It 
     <lb/>
     does seem fantastic that the maritime prov<lb break="no"/>inces—

     all night?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GIBS2">Mr. Gibson</persName> (Comox-Albemi): I thought 
     <lb/>
     you were interested in the reform of the 
     <lb/>
     Senate?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KNOW1">Mr. Knowles</persName>: On a point of order, we dis<lb break="no"/>cussed this matter for an hour.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GIBS2">Mr. Gibson</persName> (Comox-Alberni): After all, in 
     <lb/>
     the maritime provinces, producing about the 
     <lb/>
     same amount of fish as British Columbia does, 
     <lb/>
     there will be 30 senators; yet we have only 
     <lb/>
     six senators. I can assure the committee that 
     <lb/>
     there are as many indigent politicians in 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia as there are in the maritime 
     <lb/>
     provinces.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KNOW1">Mr. Knowles</persName>: I wonder if the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Fisheries would make some comment on the 
     <lb/>
     sections having to do with fisheries? This is 
     <lb/>
     one of the subjects connected with the coming 
     <lb/>
     into confederation of Newfoundland about 
     <lb/>
     which I have been reading and I have found 
     <lb/>
     it rather interesting, in fact almost intriguing. 
     <lb/>
     Such documents as I have read would seem 
     <lb/>
     to suggest that Newfoundland may be ahead 
     <lb/>
     of Canada in her legislative provisions for 
     <lb/>
     the marketing of fish. I understand that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland is to have the right to con<lb break="no"/>tinue for another five years the arrangements 
     <lb/>
     that she now has. May I inquire whether 
     <lb/>
     the Department of Fisheries and the govern<lb break="no"/>ment generally will be considering the 
     <lb/>
     methods employed in Newfoundland with the 
     <lb/>
     possibility, should it be found that theirs are 
     <lb/>
     better than ours, of changing the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     laws.

     wish to call it eleven o'clock, but it will take 
     <lb/>
     longer than five minutes for me to give an

     adequate answer.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: Perhaps if the explana<lb break="no"/>tion will extend beyond eleven o'clock it 
     <lb/>
     might suit the convenience of hon. members

     if I moved that the committee rise, report
