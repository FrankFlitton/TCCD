            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:CART2">Sir George E. Cartier</persName>, in moving the third <lb/> reading of
                  the Bill respecting Patents of In<lb break="no"/>vention, said he had decided to
                  accept the <lb/> ﬁrst amendment of which Mr. Blake had given <lb/> notice, which
                  was as follows:—"That there be <lb/> added to the 33rd clause the words follow<lb
                     break="no"/>ing—[']Provided always that if application shall <lb/> be made by any
                  other person for a patent for <lb/> any invention or discovery with which such
                  <lb/> caveat may in any respect interfere, it shall <lb/> be the duty of the
                  Commissioner forthwith <lb/> to give notice by mail to the person who has <lb/>
                  ﬁled such caveat, and such person shall within <lb/> three months after the date
                  of mailing the <lb/> notice, if he would avail himself of the caveat, <lb/> ﬁle
                  his petition, and take other steps neces<lb break="no"/>sary on an application for
                  patent, and if in <lb/> the opinion of the Commissioner the appli<lb break="no"
                  />cations are interfering, like proceedings may <lb/> be had in all respects as by
                  this Act provided <lb/> in the case of interfering applications. Pro<lb break="no"
                  />vided further that, unless the person ﬁling <lb/> any caveat shall, within four
                  years from <lb/> ﬁling thereof, have made application for a <lb/> patent, the
                  caveat shall be void." He could <lb/> not, however, accept the other amendment of
                  <lb/> which the hon. gentleman had given notice. <lb/> That there be added, as a
                  subsection of the <lb/> 37th clause, the words following "no decision <lb/> of
                  arbitration shall preclude any person in<lb break="no"/>terested in favour of or
                  against the validity <lb/> of any patent from his right to assert or con<lb
                     break="no"/>test the same in any Court in which its val<lb break="no"/>idity
                  may come in question." This clause <lb/> merely provided for Ministerial duty and
                  did <lb/> not give the patentee any right which might <lb/> not be conferred on
                  him under the patent, <lb/> and there was, therefore, no necessity for <lb/>
                  making the reserve suggested. <lb/>
               </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:BLAK1">Mr. Blake</persName> said he was willing to accept the <lb/> hon.
                  Baronet[']s interpretation of the 37th <lb/> clause, although his own interpretation
                  of it <lb/> had been different. <lb/>
               </p>
            
            
            <p>
               The House then went back into Committee

                  was <lb/> prepared to lay before the House information <lb/> as to the statistics
                  of Newfoundland, which <lb/> it was necessary the House should possess be<lb

                  this information <lb/> for themselves. He had gone to the Library <lb/> to-day and
                  found that almost every volume <lb/> relating to the statistics of Newfoundland
                  had <lb/> been taken away by parties connected with <lb/> the Government. <lb/>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:ROSE1">Hon. Mr. Rose</persName> said. that very full statistics <lb/> as to
                  Newfoundland had been submitted to <lb/> the Quebec Conference, and little change
                  had <lb/> taken place since in the relative status of <lb/> that Colony compared
                  with the others. He <lb/> would be happy to give the fullest information <lb/> in

                     rendition="simple:italic">seriatim</hi>. He was not aware of any books <lb/> on
                  the subject having been taken from the <lb/> Library, except that two hours ago he
                  had <lb/> sent for a volume containing the latest state<lb break="no"/>ments of
                  exports and imports. In now mov<lb break="no"/>ing that the Speaker do leave the
                  chair, for <lb/> the House to go into Committee on these <lb/> resolutions, he
                  would brieﬂy give the House <lb/> such information as he thought it should be
                  <lb/> put in possession of. At this period of the <lb/> session, and as the terms
                  of the agreement <lb/> had been very fully discussed at the time of <lb/> the
                  Quebec Conference and subsequently, he <lb/> did not intend to weary the House
                  with many <lb/> observations. He took it for granted that the <lb/> policy of
                  bringing Newfoundland into the <lb/> Union would not be disputed. Any one who
                  <lb/> looked at the matter would see that this <lb/> Union could not be complete
                  so long as this <lb/> Island, stretching across the Gulf of the St. <lb/>
                  Lawrence, with Nova Scotia on one side and <lb/> Labrador on the other, did not
                  belong to <lb/> the Dominion. He thought, too, that the ex<lb break="no"/>tent and
                  value of the trade of Newfoundland <lb/> were not sufﬁciently known. He would ﬁrst
                  <lb/> allude to the extent of the Maritime interest. <lb/> According to the latest
                  statistical information <lb/> within our reach, no less than 1,557 vessels <lb/>
                  were owned in Newfoundland, having a ton<lb break="no"/>nage of 87,000 tons, and
                  an estimated value <lb/> of $4,000,000. Then as regarded its foreign <lb/> trade
                  1,216 vessels in one year entered the <lb/> various ports of Newfoundland, and
                  1,016 <lb/> vessels cleared. The aggregate of seamen be<lb break="no"/>longing to
                  these vessels was upwards of <lb/> 10,000. There were engaged besides in the <lb/>
                  seal-ﬁshing 230 sail, and in the cod-ﬁshing <lb/> 13,000 boats, employing a
                  population of nearly <lb/> 40,000 persons. Newfoundland stood in a happy <lb/>

                  than her imports, but <lb/> the character of her population and of her <lb/>
                  industries was such that she furnished a <lb/> market for the surplus products of
                  the rest of <lb/> the Dominion. The population of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land was
                  wholly a consuming population, <lb/> raising nothing and manufacturing nothing.
                  <lb/> They were wholly a consuming population, <lb/> engaged in maritime pursuits.
                  The following <lb/> were some of the leading articles of import:-<lb/> Flour,
                  200,000 bbls; Indian meal, 40,000 bbls; <lb/> biscuit, 50,000 cwt; butter,

                  leather, etc., <lb/> $1,500,000. The great bulk of the importations <lb/> were the
                  products in which other portions of <lb/> Canada abounded, and which we could
                     sup<lb break="no"/>ply, and she would furnish a market not only <lb/> for our

                  The articles he had just men<lb break="no"/>tioned, he continued, constituted the

                  them could be supplied by the <lb/> other portions of the Dominion. Then the
                     sea<lb break="no"/>faring population which Newfoundland would <lb/> add to the
                  Union would be very valuable. <lb/> France had long shown her appreciation of
                  <lb/> such a body of men by the bounty which she <lb/> gave her ﬁshermen. She gave
                  $2 on each quin<lb break="no"/>tal of ﬁsh taken, or a total bounty of about a
                  <lb/> quarter of a million sterling. (Hear.) He now <lb/> desired to say a word or
                  two regarding the <lb/> exports of that Colony. The last returns give <lb/> the
                  total exports at about $5,000,000 and a <lb/> little over, of which $1,500,000
                  went to the <lb/> United States, and over $3,000,000 to England; <lb/> $70,000
                  direct to Spain, $800,000 direct to Por<lb break="no"/>tugal, and $70,000 direct
                  to Brazil. Now, what <lb/> the Dominion needs is variety of markets. <lb/> Here we
                  can secure three outlets. To show the <lb/> trade we might look forward to with
                  this <lb/> colony, the honourable gentleman stated the <lb/> sources from whence
                  the principal articles con<lb break="no"/>sumed there were at present imported.
                  Out of <lb/> their entire $5,500,000 of imports of last year, <lb/> $1,500,000
                  came from the United States, in<lb break="no"/>cluding and principally composed of
                  the very <lb/> articles he had just now enumerated—ﬂour, <lb/> butter, cheese, and
                  such articles as we pro<lb break="no"/>duce. About one-third of a million came
                  from <lb/> Hamburg, and consisted of butter, lard, bis<lb break="no"/>cuits,

                  doubt, that instead of this miserable moiety we <lb/> got, the whole of this large
                  trade might be <lb/> ours. To show how much more was consumed <lb/> by
                  Newfoundland, in comparison with the <lb/> other Provinces, he would state that in
                  the lat<lb break="no"/>ter the imports ranged from about $20 to $30 <lb/> per

                  Its development had increased <lb/> only recently. Only two mines were yet open,
                  <lb/> in which 500 men were employed, who, with <lb/> their families, made a
                  population of over a <lb/> thousand souls settled in a country, where <lb/> four
                  years ago only three or four families were <lb/> resident. Having read from Sir

                  Newfoundland was <lb/> a matter of prime importance. We were en<lb break="no"

                  may throw oﬁ the great West, <lb/> but we cannot throw oﬁ Newfoundland. It lies

                  Dominion he would say, Newfoundland <lb/> is a necessity. Newfoundland is worth

                  importance, in looking at the <lb/> future, could not be over-rated. The ﬁve North

                  would bring <lb/> to the Dominion some 38,000, and stated that <lb/> this would

                  70,000. The hon. gentleman went on to allude <lb/> to the political celebrities of
                  Newfoundland. <lb/> Men of enlarged mind and true political saga<lb break="no"

                  difficulties arose, and he <lb/> hoped to see some of these men in the service
                  <lb/> of the Confederacy. She was a country with <lb/> an interior. All her wealth
                  and industry lay <lb/> on the sea coast; but she had got an interior, <lb/> and
                  you can reach it. You can cross nearly the <lb/> whole island by water. The hon.
                  gentleman <lb/> spoke of the ﬁne harbours of the island, and <lb/> said in some of
                  the towns, although the in<lb break="no"/>habitants appeared to be few, they were
                  worth <lb/> their thousands of pounds sterling. The cod- <lb break="yes"/> ﬁshery
                  was one for which they had a hard <lb/> contest, and out of which they made
                     compara<lb break="no"/>tively little; but the seal-ﬁshery was a rich <lb/> one,
                  peculiarly their own, and could not be <lb/> taken from them. In a small town, in
                  which he <lb/> was one day, he met a ﬁne sturdy ﬁsherman <lb/> with a gin-bottle
                  about as big as a clothes <lb/> basket, (loud laughter,) who had got in $10,000
                  <lb/> worth of seals in four weeks. That would show <lb/> the exceeding value of
                  the crop. With another <lb/> story about a relative of his, named Paddy <lb/>

                  taken too low and practical a view of <lb/> some of the aspects of the question.
                  He did <lb/> not think, however, that they had done more <lb/> to arrive at the

                  <fw type="dateline">June 8, 1869<lb/></fw> sought to carry it to a conclusion. On
                  a <lb/> question so important, he should give the <lb/> whole details that were
                  involved in the ar<lb break="no"/>rangement under which it was proposed to <lb/>
                  incorporate the Province of Newfoundland, <lb/> so that members might have an
                  intelligent <lb/> understanding of the whole matter, and <lb/> know What they
                  would probably have to pay <lb/> for Newfoundland, and what they would <lb/>
                  probably derive from it, so that they might <lb/> understand whether the bargain
                  was a fair or <lb/> an unfair one. The Finance Minister answered <lb/> this by
                  saying that they were merely con<lb break="no"/>summating the proposition which
                  was made <lb/> at the Quebec Conference. He (Mr. Blake) <lb/> apprehended that
                  this House could not be held <lb/> as bound by any propositions made at the <lb/>
                  Quebec Conference, which were not then as<lb break="no"/>sented to, because
                  certain terms were then <lb/> laid down of which many members of this <lb/> House
                  might not approve, for the admission <lb/> of Newfoundland and Prince Edward
                  Island, <lb/> and which were not accepted by these <lb/> Colonies. This House was
                  not to be bound <lb/> for all time to come to incorporate Newfound<lb break="no"
                  />land and Prince Edward Island on these terms. <lb/> This was entirely a new
                  proposition for the <lb/> admission of Newfoundland, and the House <lb/> were
                  entitled to discuss and ascertain the <lb/> justice or injustice of the terms on
                  which it <lb/> was now proposed that it should enter the <lb/> Union. Nor were the
                  terms the same. They <lb/> differed in very important and material <lb/> respects
                  from those offered at the Quebec Con<lb break="no"/>ference. The present aspect of
                  the question <lb/> also differed very materially from its aspect <lb/> at that
                  time. Then it was a question whether <lb/> Confederation could at all be
                  accomplished, <lb/> and the interests of the various Provinces had <lb/> to be
                  consulted so as to get a scheme under <lb/> which the subsidies to the various
                  local Legis<lb break="no"/>latures should be based on some uniform <lb/>
                  principle. As regards Newfoundland, there <lb/> was an exceptional arrangement
                  that she <lb/> should sell her Crown Lands to the Dominion <lb/> and receive a
                  large annual sum for them. A <lb/> reason for that existed then which did not
                  <lb/> exist now. It was necessary in order not to <lb/> interfere with the

                  of the population. If fair to Newfoundland let <lb/> a much larger sum than even
                  28c per head be <lb/> given, as special subsidy, but he objected to <lb/> its
                  being given under the guise of a sham <lb/> bargain, to buy lands which we did not
                  want, <lb/> which, to the Newfoundland Government it<lb break="no"/>self, were a
                  source of annual expenditure <lb/> instead of income, and would be still more so
                  <lb/> when managed from this distance. The argu<lb break="no"/>ment of necessity
                  was used by the President <lb/> of the Council. That hon. gentleman said it <lb/>
                  was absolutely necessary we should have <lb/> Newfoundland, and the logical result
                  of that <lb/> would be, as necessity had no law, that we <lb/> would have to take
                  her own terms, whatever <lb/> they might be. He (Mr. Blake) apprehended <lb/> that
                  if there was any necessity in the case, <lb/> it was just as necessary for
                  Newfoundland to <lb/> have her fortunes united to the Dominion as <lb/> it was for
                  the Dominion to get Newfoundland. <lb/> He considered it not necessary, but of
                  high <lb/> consequence to the future of the Dominion <lb/> that Newfoundland
                  should be brought into the <lb/> Union; yet not however of so high conse<lb
                     break="no"/>quence as that we should agree to unreason<lb break="no"/>able
                  demands, if unreasonable demands should <lb/> be made; of not so high consequence
                  as that <lb/> we could not afford to wait until reasonable <lb/> propositions
                  should be submitted. He did not <lb/> say that these demands were unreasonable. He
                  <lb/> was simply pointing out that it was their <lb/> duty to ascertain whether
                  they were reason<lb break="no"/>able or not, before acceding to them. The <lb/>
                  following ﬁgures showed what he understood <lb/> would have to be paid annually by
                  the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion for Newfoundland:—Subsidy, at 80c <lb/> per head on a
                  population of 130,000, $104,000; <lb/> special subsidy, $35,000; Interest on debt
                  at <lb/> 5.23 per cent, $73,220; Five per cent allowed <lb/> on the balance, by
                  which the debt fell short <lb/> of the proposition of the other Provinces, <lb/>
                  $110,505; annual payment for Crown Lands, <lb/> $150,000. These sums amounted to
                  $472,725, <lb/> all cash payments. Besides these, there were <lb/> the charges for
                  the services which the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion performed ordinarily, and which it
                  <lb/> would have to perform for Newfoundland, <lb/> amounting, he estimated, to
                  $165,000, which, <lb/> added to the other sum, made a total of <lb/> $637,725 per
                  annum. He thought it might <lb/> safely be said that the charge to the Dominion
                  <lb/> on account of Newfoundland would be be<lb break="no"/>tween $600,000 and
                  $650,000. Now from any <lb/> statements he had seen as to the revenue he <lb/> did
                  not anticipate that Newfoundland after <lb/> she entered the Union would produce
                  an <lb/> amount of revenue in any way approaching to <lb/> $600,000. A
                  considerable proportion of the <lb/> goods on which duty was now paid Would be
                  <lb/> supplied from the other Provinces, and though <lb/>

                  would correspondingly de<lb break="no"/>crease, and the Finance Minister would not

                  expenditure which <lb/> the Government of Newfoundland now exer<lb break="no"
                  />cised, by adding 30 per cent to the duties when <lb/> it suited their
                  discretion. The Finance Minister <lb/> said that last year the revenue was
                  estimated <lb/> at $450,000, and actually reached $600,000. <lb/> But how was this
                  affected? By the simple <lb/> process of adding 30 per cent to the duties. He
                  <lb/> thought it could not be doubted that in carry<lb break="no"/>ing out this
                  bargain the Dominion would have <lb/> to pay a very large sum in excess of what it
                  <lb/> would receive. If his hon. friend could show <lb/> him that those ﬁgures
                  were not correct, and <lb/> that the arrangements were of a better char<lb
                     break="no"/>acter than he supposed, no one would be <lb/> more delighted to be
                  convinced of that. He <lb/> could see, however, no such pressing neces<lb
                     break="no"/>sity for the junction of Newfoundland as to <lb/> justify us in the
                  present state of our ﬁnances, <lb/> in making a bargain, by which we would <lb/>
                  have to pay a much larger sum than we would <lb/> receive; a bargain by which we
                  would pay a <lb/> large sum in order to bribe Newfoundland to <lb/> join us. He
                  should like the Finance Minister <lb/> to deal with these ﬁgures which made out a <lb/>
                  <hi rendition="simple:italic">prima facie</hi> loss on our part, and if he could
                  <lb/> not set them aside to show why we should <lb/> encounter that loss. He (Mr.

                  loss. He wanted to be liberal towards New<lb break="no"/>foundland, but he did not

                  These amounts did not come under <lb/> the Consolidated Revenue of the country.

                  be conceded to them; but the land transaction <lb/> for which the Dominion was
                  asked to pay <lb/> $150,000 a year was absurd. Let Newfoundland <lb/> keep her
                  land, and collect her revenues by <lb/> all means. The Dominion did not need it.
                  <lb/> Basing his calculations on the estimates for<lb break="no"/>merly needed for
                  the local services, he believed <lb/> that instead of paying $140,000 we would,
                  <lb/> within twelve months after confederation, <lb/> have to vote $160,000 or
                  $200,000 for these <lb/> services. In all he calculated that the ex<lb break="no"
                  />pense would be $625,000. That would be the <lb/> expense of the Colony to
                  Confederation, not <lb/> including additional legislative expenses. For <lb/> all
                  this we would receive at the most a <lb/> fraction over $400,000, so that we would
                  really <lb/> pay $250,000 a year more than we received <lb/> from this Province.
                  What he complained of <lb/> was that unfair terms should be given. He <lb/> would,
                  however, support the resolutions, <lb/> believing that it would be better to
                  complete <lb/> the Union. As to the land, he would again <lb/> say, by all means
                  let Newfoundland keep her <lb/> land. If she wants to get rid of it, perhaps the
                  <lb/> great Ontario Ship Canal Company might get <lb/> it to advantage.

                  The Finance Minister gives detail, ap<lb break="no"/>proximates to some other
                  detail, and then <lb/> asks the House not to discuss the scheme too <lb/> much.
                  He, (Mr. Bodwell), thought it absurd <lb/> to ask the House to go blindly into
                  this scheme <lb/> lest the discussion might effect the scheme <lb/> adversely in
                  Newfoundland. What was the <lb/> meaning of that proposition? Was it that they
                  <lb/> should lend themselves to practice deception <lb/> on the people of
                  Newfoundland in order to <lb/> induce them to enter the Confederation? Such <lb/>
                  a proposition was as monstrous as that by <lb/> which they were called on to give
                  $150,000 a <lb/> year for the land of Newfoundland. From all <lb/> he could gather
                  these lands were of little <lb/> value as mineral lands, and agriculturally <lb/>
                  they were worth little or nothing. The real <lb/> question was, is Newfoundland
                  taking the <lb/> value of its imports, revenue &amp;c, worth to <lb/> the Dominion
                  what it is proposed we should <lb/> give for it? If it is, we ought to accept the
                  <lb/> offer made; if not, we ought to reject it. The <lb/> question was not so
                  much what Newfoundland <lb/> required, but what the Dominion required. <lb/> The
                  land proposition he regarded as especially <lb/> deceptive and absurd. Although he
                  would not <lb/> oppose the resolutions, he felt that insufficient <lb/>
                  explanation had been offered. Before the <lb/> scheme ﬁnally passed, he hoped that
                  more in<lb break="no"/>formation would be given, and the land grant <lb/> would be

                  Hence the question was not in fact one <lb/> susceptible of much discussion. There
                  was a <lb/> bright and dark side to the picture, and cer<lb break="no"/>tainly it
                  could not be said that the Finance <lb/> Minister had altogether pointed out the

                  side, as spoken of by the member <lb/> for West Durham. That honourable gentle<lb

                  because he had not been in <lb/> Parliament then. He was certainly a prominent

                  responsible, and <lb/> could not now deny that responsibility. As to <lb/> the

                  the Quebec Convention, <lb/> no longer exist. (Hear, hear.) We are as <lb/> terms
                  proposed in the Quebec Convention, <lb/> little trammelled as were the delegates
                  at that <lb/> Convention; and we are bound by every <lb/> consideration of public
                  duty to consider the <lb/> terms submitted to us upon their merits. The <lb/>
                  gentlemen who formed the Quebec Con<lb break="no"/>vention had long been connected
                  with public <lb/> affairs. They were no doubt able men; but <lb/> they had been
                  connected with a system of <lb/> Government very different from the one they <lb/>
                  proposed to adopt. I am doing them no in<lb break="no"/>justice when I say that
                  although they may <lb/> have had some general knowledge of the <lb/> external
                  features of the federal system, they <lb/> were totally unacquainted with its
                  internal <lb/> organization and with many of its vital <lb/> principles; they were
                  not aware of all the <lb/> changes and modifications the new system <lb/>
                  necessitated in the old. (Hear, hear.) This <lb/> is abundantly verified in the
                  anomalies and <lb/> contradictions in our system. Already our <lb/> short
                  experience has brought many defects <lb/> under our observation, and it appears to
                  me <lb/> it would be the height of folly to throw <lb/> away the experience we
                  have acquired, abdi<lb break="no"/>cate the right to judge for ourselves, and
                     ad<lb break="no"/>here without a pretence of reason to what was <lb/> done in
                  great haste, under great pressure, ﬁve <lb/> or six years ago. (Hear, hear.) The
                  terms pro<lb break="no"/>posed in these resolutions is a proposal that <lb/>
                  Newfoundland shall come in with a debt of <lb/> $6,500,000 with the chance of
                  having her <lb/> general subsidy increased from $104,000 to <lb/> $320,000 a year.
                  If Ontario were allowed <lb/> the same amount instead of coming into the <lb/>
                  Confederation with a debt of $35,000,000 she <lb/> would enter with a debt of
                  $100,000,000. <lb/> Now, sir, I do not propose we should deal <lb/> niggardly with
                  Newfoundland. I admit she <lb/> is entitled to a much larger amount than the <lb/>
                  Provinces now in the Dominion. In addition <lb/> to the debt with which the

                  </fw>minion, and Newfoundland so far, is entitled <lb/> to have an equivalent
                  allowed her. The <lb/> Minister of Militia and the Minister of Fi<lb break="no"
                  />nance have spoken of the large amount of <lb/> revenue collected in
                  Newfoundland—being <lb/> nearly ﬁve dollars <hi rendition="simple:italic">per
                     capita</hi>. How much of <lb/> this is collected on breadstuffs that will pay
                  <lb/> nothing after Confederation? Newfoundland <lb/> imports nearly everything
                  she consumes. <lb/> Every thing imported pays a high duty and <lb/> if that
                  intercolonial trade springs up of which <lb/> the Minister of Finance has spoken,
                  the re<lb break="no"/>venue collected there after the union must <lb/> greatly
                  diminish. (Hear, hear.) Now it was <lb/> the bounden duty of the Minister of Fi<lb
                     break="no"/>nance, in coming down to the House to <lb/> show what amount of
                  revenue would be col<lb break="no"/>lected there under the Canadian tariff. He
                  <lb/> has told us Newfoundland imports largely, <lb/> ﬁour, beef, butter and
                  biscuits, which in <lb/> future she will purchase from Ontario; that <lb/> she
                  purchases a large quantity of woolen <lb/> goods, and these she will buy from the
                     Cana<lb break="no"/>dian manufacturers. Well, sir, admit this <lb/> and what
                  follows? Why, that upon a large <lb/> portion of her imports, upon which now a
                  <lb/> duty is paid, no duty in future will be col<lb break="no"/>lected, and by so
                  much the revenue of New<lb break="no"/>foundland is diminished. (Hear, hear.) What
                  <lb/> of that, asks the Minister of Militia, if the <lb/> people of Ontario ﬁnd a
                  market for their <lb/> breadstuffs? They can afford to pay. Well, <lb/> sir, I
                  confess this is a new doctrine in political <lb/> economy. There is to be no duty
                  on bread<lb break="no"/>stuffs. If the people of Newfoundland can <lb/> buy ﬂour
                  for less in Boston than in Montreal <lb/> they will buy in Boston. They will buy
                  <lb/> where they can buy cheapest; there is to be <lb/> no restriction. Now, who
                  does that benefit; <lb/> is it not the people of Newfoundland? The <lb/> doctrine
                  of economists is that restrictions on <lb/> trade increases prices to the
                  consumer. The <lb/> removal of such, then, must benefit New<lb break="no"
                  />foundland. Why then should we, of all the <lb/> world, be compelled to pay ten
                  or ﬁfteen per <lb/> cent, for the privilege of trading? (Hear, <lb/> hear.) My
                  honorable friend from West Durham <lb/> has conclusively shown that we must pay,
                     un<lb break="no"/>der the proposed system to Newfoundland an <lb/> amount
                  largely in excess of what we receive; <lb/> and as yet nothing has been said to

                  assume, I think I am justiﬁed <lb/> in assuming, that he is about to take a new

                  good will. (Hear, hear.) I supposed, sir, he had <lb/> importuned the Government
                  for more money; <lb/> that he very nearly had Nova Scotia into <lb/> civil war for
                  more money, that he asked for <lb/> repeal, because Nova Scotia did not get more

                  entered the Cabinet for <lb/> more money. (Cheers.) Well, sir, I am pleased <lb/>
                  he deprecates this way of viewing great <lb/> questions of state, and I hope we

                  it might be well to glance back at <lb/> the past, and when he remembered all that
                  <lb/> had been predicted of Confederation, he was <lb/> forced to conclude that it
                  was not proving all <lb/> that its ardent admirers had expected. Indeed, <lb/> he
                  feared that the worst predictions made <lb/> by those who then opposed it, would
                  be ful<lb break="no"/>ﬁlled. The House should therefore be careful <lb/> as to the

                  <lb/> new partners in the ﬁrm, and it would be <lb/> well to scan closely what
                  they will bring in <lb/> as assets, and what they will take out. <lb/> (Hear,
                  hear.) The British America Act placed <lb/> the subsidies to be paid to Ontario
                  and Que<lb break="no"/>bec at 80c. per head for all time to come, but <lb/> the
                  amount to be paid Nova Scotia and New <lb/> Brunswick was to augment until their
                     popu<lb break="no"/>lation increased to 400,000 souls; and besides <lb/> all
                  this the special subsidies gave 5c. per <lb/> head to Ontario, 6c. Quebec, 18c.
                  Nova Scotia, <lb/> 44c. to New Brunswick, and now the spe<lb break="no"/>cial
                  subsidy to Newfoundland would be <lb/> about 30c. per head! (Hear, hear.) This was
                  <lb/> a very unequal arrangement, and it might be <lb/> well to enquire what
                  Ontario loses under this <lb/> system. The subsidy to Nova Scotia would go <lb/>
                  on increasing for 9 years, which time would <lb/> elapse before her population
                  amounted to <lb/> 400,000; that of New Brunswick would aug<lb break="no"/>ment for

                  Eastern allies, he was not prepared <lb/> to allow them more than terms of
                  equality. <lb/> As an Upper Canadian he was not willing <lb/> that the interests
                  of that section should be <lb/> sacrificed. There was the Intercolonial Rail<lb

                  spent <lb/> within 400 miles of its border. (Hear, hear.) <lb/> Now, we were asked
                  to give $150,000 a year, <lb/> for all time to come, for the lands of New<lb

                  the <lb/> House did not, he considered, possess an <lb/> undue share of modesty.
                  (Laughter and ap<lb break="no"/>plause.) He thought the great leader of Upper

<p>
                  <persName ref="pers:RYMA1">Mr. Rymal</persName>—He would admit George Brown <lb/> controlled Upper
                  Canada then, but at the <lb/> same time he was acting under the Knight <lb/> of
                  Kingston. (Hear, hear.) He deprecated <lb/> departures from the Quebec agreement.
                  The <lb/> Member for Cumberland (Dr. Tupper) had <lb/> spoken last session of that
                  agreement being <lb/> quite fair and just to Nova Scotia, and that <lb/> it would
                  only be opposed by demagogues like <lb/> the member for Hants. (Laughter.) The
                  past <lb/> records of the latter gentleman had secured <lb/> him a place in his
                  (the speaker[']s) heart, and <lb/> he thought last session Mr. Howe had been <lb/>
                  animated by a love for his country. But <lb/> what would he say now? (laughter.)
                  He would <lb/> not hurl a shaft between the joints of his <lb/> harness, as he was
                  made familiar with Mr. <lb/> Howe[']s name and doings at his father[']s ﬁre<lb
                     break="no"/>side during dark days in Colonial history; but <lb/> he must,
                  nevertheless, say that last year he <lb/> thought that gentleman did not object so
                  <lb/> much to Confederation on acount of ﬁnancial <lb/> considerations as in
                  consequence of the lia<lb break="no"/>bilities of his country being rather many.
                  But <lb/> when he secured better terms, he had changed <lb/> his position to a
                  supporter of union, and he <lb/> (Mr. R.) was delighted with the change, but <lb/>
                  particularly on his friend[']s own account. <lb/> (Laughter.) We should consider
                  where all <lb/> these concessions were landing us. Our debt <lb/> was getting
                  oppressive. All the inventions of <lb/> the Minister of Finance were unavailing to
                  <lb/> meet our necessities, and yet, day after day <lb/> the Government offered
                  fresh schemes of <lb/> expenditure. Financial ruin could not be <lb/> averted by
                  any country beyond a certain line, <lb/> and if ruin came to the Dominion he
                  believed <lb/> it would be ﬁnancial. If we went on trying <lb/> to walk before we
                  could stand, to trot before <lb/> we could walk, and race before we could trot,
                  <lb/> we would never become a consolidated and <lb/> great people. (Hear, hear.)
                  Poverty generally <lb/> fails to command respect and if by extrava<lb break="no"
                  />gance the Dominion became poverty-stricken, <lb/> we would fail to command the
                  respect of our <lb/> neighbours. Mr. Rymal went on to say that <lb/> he had
                  proposed calling this his Financial <lb/> statement, (laughter) having a tendency
                  to <lb/> ﬁgures. He did not think the ﬁgures he had <lb/> given could be
                  contradicted—even Mr. Rose, <lb/> or his chief assistant, could not show them to
                  <lb/> be wrong. He had taken a fair basis, and if <lb/> injustice had been
                  suffered by Ontario, and <lb/> also by Quebec to some extent, why seek <lb/> more
                  eastern allies to draw the last drop of <lb/> blood from us? The Member for
                  Cornwall <lb/> (Sandﬁeld Macdonald) had given his views of <lb/> Confederation
                  before it was carried. He <lb/> would read a short extract from his speech. <lb/>
                  Speaking of the Coalition Government of that <lb/> day, that gentleman prophesied

                  is as <lb/> true as if the Prophet Jeremiah had uttered <lb/> it. (Roars of
                  laughter.) The Hon. Premier of <lb/> Ontario had lately been canonized as a saint
                  <lb/> —whether he deserved that title or not, in <lb/> the prediction he had read,
                  that gentleman <lb/> had certainly proved himself a true prophet. <lb/>
                  (Laughter.) A great deal had been said about <lb/> Confederation allaying
                  sectional difficulties, <lb/> but he feared these difficulties were being <lb/>
                  extended. There was, in some quarters, too <lb/> strong a liking for the loaves
                  and ﬁshes—too <lb/> strong a desire to bring in the grab game. <lb/> (Laughter.)
                  The cow which gave the milk <lb/> would be often sought for. The Minister of <lb/>
                  Justice knew which Province was the cow. <lb/> He would soon know who were the
                  suckers. <lb/> (Much laughter.) The speaker then said he <lb/> would not give the
                  Member for Cornwall all <lb/> the credit, but would quote from another <lb/>
                  speech made when Confederation was before <lb/> the Canadian Parliament—that was
                  his own. <lb/> (Hear, hear) This quotation showed the <lb/> speaker had opposed
                  Confederation at that <lb/> time because they had no right to change <lb/> the
                  Constitution, because he wanted the ques<lb break="no"/>tion referred to the
                  people, because it dis<lb break="no"/>carded an Elective Legislative Council, and
                  <lb/> because he believed it would not heal our <lb/> sectional difficulties. He
                  thought he then <lb/> struck the nail on the head, and that the <lb/> heavy
                  expenditure entailed upon the country <lb/> would not be made up by corresponding
                  <lb/> advantages. He feared Ontario would suffer <lb/> just as new partners were
                  taken in, and that <lb/> that Province would not have one but several <lb/> small
                  Provinces clinging to her skirts. Mr. <lb/> Rymal resumed his seat admidst

                  <lb/> made during the debate. He said that the <lb/> Finance Minister declined to
                  say what the <lb/> result of this arrangement would be on the <lb/> income of the
                  country. Although the hon. <lb/> gentleman might quite possibly come to a <lb/>
                  conclusion, the hon. gentleman had not dealt <lb/> with that question, simply
                  because he was <lb/> afraid the result would be too alarming. <lb/> There could,
                  indeed, be no doubt but the <lb/> statement of the member for Westmorland <lb/>
                  was the correct one, and that was that the <lb/> Colony would cost us a quarter of
                  a million. <lb/> At present and for years past the Colony did <lb/> not pay its
                  expenses. Clearly it would be less <lb/> able to meet an enlarged expenditure, and

                     gener<lb break="no"/>ous it was necessary to see that we were just. <lb/>
                  (Hear.) As to the proposition that we ought <lb/> not to ask for details lest it
                  might embarrass <lb/> the delegates in Newfoundland, he implored <lb/> the House
                  to adopt no such proposition, to <lb/> allow the people of Newfoundland to see
                  <lb/> this matter in all its details, and to prevent <lb/> as far as possible any
                  such adverse under<lb break="no"/>standing as occurred in Nova Scotia. (Cheers.)
                  <lb/> It was argued by the Minister of Militia that <lb/> he (Mr. Blake) was bound
                  by the resolutions <lb/> of the Quebec Conference, and that these <lb/> favoured
                  the present scheme; but he denied <lb/> the proposition. He denied that at this
                     dis<lb break="no"/>tance of time any one was bound by these <lb/> Quebec
                  resolutions, and even if it were other<lb break="no"/>wise, still in many
                  important particulars the <lb/> present terms varied widely from the Que<lb

                  details. How the hon. gentleman <lb/> could expect the House to come to a general

<p>
                  <persName ref="pers:HOWE2">Hon. Mr. Howe</persName> said that Newfoundland <lb/> had hitherto been

                  <lb/> any help from abroad. Therefore she must <lb/> have considerable
                  capabilities, and he be<lb break="no"/>lieved if she did not join the
                  Confederation, <lb/> she could continue as she had been; but the <lb/> other
                  Provinces wanted her for reasons of <lb/> State. No one would deprecate more than
                  <lb/> himself the old rivalries between East and <lb/> West, and he hoped such a
                  state of things <lb/> would not be perpetuated in the New Do<lb break="no"
                  />minion. Some twenty millions of dollars were <lb/> about being expended in
                  connection with the <lb/> Intercolonial Railway, and the West would <lb/> have to
                  supply the breadstuffs and other <lb/> provisions required for the labourers on
                  this <lb/> work. Already under Confederation the Low<lb break="no"/>er Provinces
                  had been large purchasers of <lb/> the ﬂour of Ontario, and Newfoundland <lb/>
                  would henceforth do the same. The people <lb/> of Newfoundland would buy the
                  timber of <lb/> Canada, and build ships, and thus engage in <lb/> a new and
                  proﬁtable branch of industry. It <lb/> was hardly worth while now, under the

                  thought it to the <lb/> advantage of all the Provinces that the Union <lb/> should
                  be consummated at as early a day as <lb/> possible, based on such terms as would
                  not <lb/> occasion heart-burnings hereafter, and he <lb/> could not but
                  congratulate the House and the <lb/> President of the Council himself in being in
                  <lb/> the right way. Some of the arguments ad<lb break="no"/>vanced required a
                  little attention, and to <lb/> these he would address himself for a few <lb/>
                  moments. The Minister of Militia seemed to <lb/> think that the resolutions of the
                  Quebec Con<lb break="no"/>ference were binding for all time to come, <lb/> and
                  that there should be no departure from <lb/> them. He (Mr. Mackenzie) was quite
                     will<lb break="no"/>ing to coincide in that argument if the hon<lb break="no"
                  />ourable gentleman made these resolutions <lb/> binding all round. (Hear, hear.)
                  While de<lb break="no"/>manding that he should be placed in the <lb/> position of
                  obeying strictly these resolutions, <lb/> the Minister of Militia was himself
                     disobey<lb break="no"/>ing them by the very resolutions before the <lb/> House.
                  (Hear, and cheers.) There could be <lb/> nothing more illogical than the
                  honourable <lb/> gentleman[']s proposition. Did he imagine that <lb/> honourable
                  gentlemen were merely to accept <lb/> the dicta of the Ministry of the day, and
                  that <lb/> every argument was to be put down by a <lb/> reference to something
                  which happened years <lb/> ago. (Hear.) He could assure the Minister <lb/> of
                  Militia that he would take what course he <lb/> thought best with those Quebec
                  resolutions. <lb/> (Hear.) Some fallacious arguments had been <lb/> advanced
                  during the debate to which the <lb/> honourable gentleman (Mr. Mackenzie) next
                  <lb/> drew attention. It had been urged that the <lb/> market to be opened in this
                  island would be <lb/> a great benefit to Ontario. He was not dis<lb break="no"
                  />posed to underrate the advantages to the <lb/> Provinces or the Dominion arising
                  from the <lb/> opening of this market; but he might say <lb/> that he did not
                  anticipate that the result of <lb/> the Union would be to advance the interests
                  <lb/> of the agricultural portion of the Dominion <lb/> one whit; but rather the
                  contrary. Again, <lb/> Canada affords but a poor market for New<lb break="no"

                  abolition of the duty <lb/> on ﬂour in Newfoundland; but, as had been <lb/>
                  stated, the reverse. (Hear, hear.) Hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen seemed to take

                  market. <lb/> Such he would assure them was not the case. <lb/> In grain, what
                  they needed a market for was <lb/> coarse grains, and these were precisely the
                  <lb/> articles not wanted in Newfoundland. Again, <lb/> the Finance Minister
                  argued that our woollen <lb/> manufacturers would get a market in this <lb/>
                  island, but his (Mr. Mackenzie[']s) impression <lb/> was that the bulk of these
                  goods would be <lb/> put on the market by those having an in<lb break="no"/>terest
                  in a return cargo from England. The <lb/> hon. gentleman indicated that on
                     concur<lb break="no"/>rence he would indicate his views on some <lb/> matters
                  connected with the resolutions, which <lb/> he would not touch till then. At

                  himself as a <lb/> free agent in that matter, allowing himself <lb/> to be bound
                  by no conditions whatever. <lb/> Having replied at some length to the mem<lb

               the lands and mines of Newfoundland paying

               a certain sum therefor: it was not now open 
               <lb/>
               to this House to go back from that arrange<lb break="no"/>ment. The reason why this arrangement was 
               <lb/>
               made was that Newfoundland had no sources 
               <lb/>
               of local revenue, and it became necessary to 
               <lb/>
               make special provision in this way for its local 
               <lb/>
               services. He believed the mineral wealth of

               a harder bargain with the gentleman repre<lb break="no"/>senting Newfoundland, he did not think it 
               <lb/>
               was desirable to do so, as it was very im<lb break="no"/>portant that they should come into the Union

               The member for Lambton had spoken of this

               matter as a marriage. If so, if we were about

               to vote what was necessary to enlarge our
