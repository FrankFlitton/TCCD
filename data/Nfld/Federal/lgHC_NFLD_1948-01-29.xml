IMPORT RESTRICTIONS—PLANS FOR SPRING<lb/>
PLANTING<lb/></head>

<p>On the orders of the day:</p>
<p>
                  <persName ref="pers:FRAS3">Mr. G. K. FRASER</persName> (Peterborough West):<lb/> I should like to
                  direct a question to the<lb/> Minister of Agriculture or the Minister of<lb/>
                  Finance. Does the government intend to<lb/> announce the future plans regarding
                  the impor<lb break="no"/>tation of lettuce, celery and vegetables, so that<lb/>
                  the vegetable growers and hothouse men can<lb/> plan for the future and the needs
                  of the<lb/> Canadian people? Their vegetable seeds for<lb/> the spring planting
                  must be ordered at once.<lb/></p>
<p>
                  <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. SPEAKER</persName>: Order.<lb/></p>
<p>
                  <persName ref="pers:FRAS3">Mr. FRASER</persName>: Mr. Speaker, this is a very<lb/> important
                  question because the vegetable men<lb/> have to order their vegetable seeds within
                  the<lb/> next month.<lb/></p>
<p>
                  <persName ref="pers:GRAY2">Mr. GRAYDON</persName>: These people are not<lb/> interested in the
                  vegetable growers; one can<lb/> easily see that.<lb/></p>
<p>
                  <persName ref="pers:FRAS3">Mr. FRASER</persName>: Mr. Speaker, may I not have<lb/> an answer to
                  that question?<lb/></p>
<p>
                  <persName ref="pers:GRAY2">Mr. GRAYDON</persName>: He should have an answer<lb/> to the question.
                  It has to do with urgent<lb/> business of everyone.<lb/></p>
<p>
                  <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. SPEAKER</persName>: Order.<lb/></p>
<p>
                  <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Hon. DOUGLAS ABBOTT</persName> (Minister of<lb/> Finance): I always like
                  to answer questions. A<lb/> delegation from the vegetable growers came<lb/> to see
                  me this morning. That may be what<lb/> has prompted my hon. friend's
                  question.<lb/></p>
<p>
                  <persName ref="pers:GRAY2">Mr. GRAYDON</persName>: There is nothing wrong<lb/> with that.<lb/></p>
<p>
                  <persName ref="pers:FRAS3">Mr. FRASER</persName>: No.<lb/></p>
<p>
                  <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. ABBOTT</persName>: I discussed the matter of<lb/> fresh vegetables
                  with them. I pointed out that<lb/> the import restrictions on these vegetables
                  are<lb/> part of our exchange conservation program,<lb/> essentially temporary ID.
                  their nature, but that<lb/> for obvious reasons it was impossible for me<lb/> or
                  for anyone else to say how long it would<lb/> be necessary to keep these
                  restrictions on.<lb/></p>
<p>
                  <persName ref="pers:FRAS3">Mr. FRASER</persName>: My question was prompted<lb/> by a letter which I
                  wrote the Department of<lb/> Agriculture on January 5.<lb/>

<head rendition="simple:centre">REQUEST FOR STATEMENT ON ACTION OF<lb/>
NEWFOUNDLAND NATIONAL CONVENTION</head>
<p>
On the orders of the day:<lb/></p>
<p>
                  <persName ref="pers:GRAY2">Mr. GORDON GRAYDON</persName> (Peel): I<lb/> should like to direct a
                  question to the Secre<lb break="no"/>tary of State for External Affairs. In view
                  of<lb/> the interest across Canada in our negotiations<lb/>
                  <!--[Mr. Abbott]--><cb/> with Newfoundland, and the fact that yester<lb break="no"/>day its national convention opposed the sub<lb break="no"/>mission of the
                  confederation plan to the people<lb/> of Newfoundland, would the government<lb/>
                  through the Prime Minister or the Secretary<lb/> of State for External Affairs
                  make a statement<lb/> to the house so that the country will under<lb break="no"/>stand from parliament, rather than from the<lb/> press so far away, just how the
                  situation now<lb/> stands, whether or not the door is closed to<lb/> further
                  negotiations, and the prospect of<lb/> further confederation discussions?<lb/></p>
<p>
                  <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Right Hon. L. S. ST. LAURENT</persName> (Secretary<lb/> of State for
                  External Affairs): I will examine<lb/> carefully the terms of the question that
                  has<lb/> just been asked by -the hon. member and<lb/> endeavour to have some
                  statement made. The<lb/> hon. member will realize that the Canadian<lb/>
                  government stated terms which in its opinion<lb/> would be fair for union and is
                  taking no part<lb/> whatsoever in presenting those terms to the<lb/> people of
                  Newfoundland, nor would it venture<lb/> to do or say anything which might be
                  regarded<lb/> there as trying to influence the decision of the<lb/> free people of
                  Newfoundland.<lb/></p>
<p>
The information we have is that there was<lb/>
a vote against recommending to the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the United Kingdom the inclusion on<lb/>
the ballot of any question about union with<lb/>
Canada. The information we have is that<lb/>
this national convention was an advisory body<lb/>
and that its decisions were not binding either<lb/>
on the people of Newfoundland or on the<lb/>
United Kingdom government. We have not<lb/>
received any information of decisions taken<lb/>
since the report in the newspapers of the vote<lb/>
in the national convention.<lb/></p>
<p>
                  <persName ref="pers:GRAY2">Mr. GRAYDON</persName>: I take it from the minis<lb break="no"/>ter's
                  remarks that the door to further negotia<lb break="no"/>tions is not definitely
                  closed.<lb/></p>
<p>
                  <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. ST. LAURENT</persName>: No. The offer is still<lb/> before the
                  people of Newfoundland and before<lb/> the commission government of
                  Newfoundland.<lb/></p>
<p>
The national convention has expressed by<lb/>
vote its views, but it is only, as I said, an<lb/>
advisory body and the matter still has to be<lb/>
dealt with by those who have the constitutional<lb/>
responsibility for a decision.<lb/></p>
