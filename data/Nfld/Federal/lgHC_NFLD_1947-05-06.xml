               Mr. CHURCH: I want to ask one question 
               <lb/>
               about section 7. We are giving the company 
               <lb/>
               the right to build a railway and, as the Secre<lb break="no"/>tary of State for External Affairs said the 
               <lb/>
               other night, we can only give them jurisdiction 
               <lb/>
               in Canada, and only capacity to act. I would 
               <lb/>
               call the attention of the government to a 
               <lb/>
               meeting held today between fifteen representa<lb break="no"/>tives of Newfoundland and the British govern<lb break="no"/>ment in London, England, regarding New<lb break="no"/>foundland's future government. The repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of Newfoundland were insisting that 
               <lb/>
               Labrador be part of that country, and said 
               <lb/>
               they are now to come to Canada in June and 
               <lb/>
               go into the question of the tenth province of 
               <lb/>
               Canada's federation, Newfoundland and Lab<lb break="no"/>rador, and the whole future of it. Under 
               <lb/>
               section 7 the company is given power to act, 
               <lb/>
               capacity powers only as a corporation to con<lb break="no"/>struct within Canada. To proceed with con<lb break="no"/>struction beyond Canada. they will have to 
               <lb/>
               deal with Newfoundland. and Labrador. I under<lb break="no"/>stand that they dealt with them twenty years 
               <lb/>
               ago but spent only about $100,000. While I 
               <lb/>
               do not believe in railways and coal mines and 
               <lb/>
               electric distribution systems being taken over 
               <lb/>
               as is now being done in England, I believe that 
               <lb/>
               the Canadian National Railways should have 
               <lb/>
               had a survey made of this territory not only 
               <lb/>
               in Canada but in Labrador. The policy of 
               <lb/>
               our national railway in the past has been to go 
               <lb/>
               into territories far less profitable than this 
               <lb/>
               proposition may turn out to be. While 
               <lb/>
               these mining men are going in at their own 
               <lb/>
               expense and surveys have been made under 
               <lb/>
               section 7, the fact remains that we are giving 
               <lb/>
               away public property. We have only the 
               <lb/>
               capacity to give the company railway and 
               <lb/>
               subsidiary powers to operate within Canada. 
               <lb/>
               For anything else the company wants outside 
               <lb/>
               Canada, hotels, power, highways, ocean services, 
               <lb/>
               vessels, elevators, wharves, it will have to deal 
               <lb/>
               with the provisional government of Labrador 
               <lb/>
               and Newfoundland. I would: ask the Secretary 
               <lb/>
               of State for External Affairs if that is not 
               <lb/>
               right? 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>

            
            
            <p>
               Mr. ST. LAURENT: I think the hon. 
               <lb/>
               gentleman is quite right, though perhaps not 
               <lb/>
               quite complete. The purposes of this bill as 
               <lb/>
               I read it are two-fold. One is to incorporate a 
               <lb/>
               company, thereby giving it the capacity to 
               <lb/>
               acquire powers through any jurisdiction that 
               <lb/>
               may be willing to grant powers to it; and the 
               <lb/>
               other is to build a railway from a point on 
               <lb/>
               the St. Lawrence in Quebec to the border 
               <lb/>
               between Quebec and Labrador. That is some<lb break="no"/>thing which, under the British North America 
               <lb/>
               Act, can be granted only by parliament. There 
               <lb/>
               is no doubt that the parliament of Canada 
               <lb/>
               cannot grant the right to the company to build 
               <lb/>
               
         
            
         
            <!--<p>

            </p>-->


               a railway in Labrador, but the parliament of 
               <lb/>
               Canada can grant the capacity to the corpora<lb break="no"/>tion to go to the government of Labrador and 
               <lb/>
               acquire from that government the right to 
               <lb/>
               build in the territory governed by the com<lb break="no"/>mission government.

               Mr. POULIOT: A moment ago I heard one 
               <lb/>
               hon. member say that he has the right to argue 
               <lb/>
               in this committee just as well as in the railway 
               <lb/>
               committee. He is perfectly right. The differ<lb break="no"/>ence is that in the railway committee wit<lb break="no"/>nesses and experts can be heard and be asked 
               <lb/>
               questions to satisfy the minds of hon. members 
               <lb/>
               who desire information. 
               <lb/>

               Mr. Chairman, in order to ascertain the 
               <lb/>
               opinion of the provincial government in re<lb break="no"/>gard to this bill, I sent a copy thereof to 
               <lb/>
               the premier of Quebec, asking him to kindly 
               <lb/>
               let me have his views.
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               I received today the following telegram, 
               <lb/>
               copy of which I shall hand over to the hon. 
               <lb/>
               member for Outremont (Mr. Rinfret). It 
               <lb/>
               reads as follows:

               <lb/>
               Labrador Railway Company, which I have re<lb break="no"/>ceived this morning, a few moments before the 
               <lb/>
               house met. Insofar as the territory of the prov<lb break="no"/>ince of Quebec is concerned, it is obvious that 
               <lb/>
               the provincial authorities alone have the power 
               <lb/>
               to deal with hotels, water power and their 
               <lb/>
               operation as well as with transportation by 
               <lb/>
               truck, bus and automobile. In the province of 
               <lb/>
               Quebec, there are proper agencies having the 
               <lb/>
               power and the duty to supervise and control the 
               <lb/>
               operations arising from the use of highways and 
               <lb/>
               the development of provincial natural resources. 
               <lb/>
               As always, we are prepared to cooperate sin<lb break="no"/>cerely with the federal authorities in order to 
               <lb/>
               solve the problems which concern both the 
               <lb/>
               dominion and the provincial authorities, accord<lb break="no"/>ing to their respective constitutional rights and 
               <lb/>
               on a friendly basis if possible. However, you 
               <lb/>
               understand that encroachments can never serve 
               <lb/>
               as a basis for cooperation. Again I thank you 
               <lb/>
               for your courtesy in this connection.

               I wish to ask the hon. member who has

               sponsored this bill whether it is the intention

               of the company to have subsidiary companies 
               <lb/>
               exercise the rights which may be granted to 
               <lb/>
               it under this bill. It is necessary to distinguish 
               <lb/>
               as between the right itself and the power to 
               <lb/>
               exercise such right.
