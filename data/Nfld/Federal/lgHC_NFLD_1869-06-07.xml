               <persName ref="pers:MACD2">Hon. John Sandfield Macdonald</persName> said he <lb/> had never heard a
               more flimsy excuse offered <lb/> by a gentleman sworn to discharge an im<lb break="no"
               />portant public duty. <lb/>

               <persName ref="pers:CAME3">Mr. M. C. Cameron</persName> said the hon. gentleman <lb/> was hard to
               please. The afﬁdavit contained <lb/> the exact truth. The member for Carleton <lb/>
               was absent from the city on a great public <lb/> duty. Some gentlemen were here from
                  New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and it was the duty of Ministers <lb/> to have
               entertained them hospitably. As Min<lb break="no"/>isters neglected their duty, the
               member for <lb/> Carleton was one of a party who undertook <lb/> to show these
               gentlemen hospitality by tak<lb break="no"/>ing them on a trip up the Ottawa, and
               there <lb/> was no saying how much progress had been <lb/> made on that trip towards
               the annexation of <lb/> Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island. <lb/> (Hear, hear, and
               laughter.) <lb/>
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               The discussion was continued by Sir George 
               <lb/>
               E. Cartier, Messrs. D. A. McDonald, Masson 
               <lb/>
               (Soulanges), Pope and Wright (Ottawa), the 
               <lb/>
               remarks being mostly of a jocular nature, 
               <lb/>
               and at the expense of Mr. Connell, Mr. Pope 
               <lb/>
               proposing that he be imprisoned during the 
               <lb/>
               pleasure of the House, or that a codicil to 
               <lb/>
               suit his case be put at the end of the Flogging

               had allowed the member <lb/> for Carleton from his Parliamentary duties to <lb/>
               taste of the tree of knowledge on the waters <lb/> of the Upper Ottawa and pleaded
               that the <lb/> punishment should be of the highest descrip<lb break="no"/>tion. <lb/>
