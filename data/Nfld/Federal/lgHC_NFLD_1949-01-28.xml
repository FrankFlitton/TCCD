       <p>
    [...] assured that representations have been made 
     <lb/>
     to me in this regard by members of the house, 
     <lb/>
     members of the press gallery and visitors to 
     <lb/>
     this house. I would be very pleased if a 
     <lb/>
     system could be found which would give 
     <lb/>
     satisfaction. I think it is my duty, though, 
     <lb/>
     to call the attention of the hon. leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition to the fact that one of the diffi— 
     <lb/>
     culties in adopting the method used in the 
     <lb/>
     French house or the Italian house or even in 
     <lb/>
     the congress of the United States is the fact 
     <lb/>
     that in most of these places the members 
     <lb/>
     speak from a rostrum. This means only one 
     <lb/>
     microphone need be connected to the loud 
     <lb/>
     speaker. 
       </p>
            

            <p>
     Here, the problem is quite different, but 
     <lb/>
     the hon. members may be assured that they 
     <lb/>
     have all my sympathy. The Speaker exper— 
     <lb/>
     iences considerable difficulty in hearing what 
     <lb/>
     is going on in the house. I will do every<lb break="no"/>thing possible to give you satisfaction, though 
     <lb/>
     I consider it my duty not to recommend an 
     <lb/>
     expensive installation which would not give 
     <lb/>
     satisfaction. You may depend upon it, how— 
     <lb/>
     ever, that I will do my very best, in consul<lb break="no"/>tation with the proper officials, to make a 
     <lb/>
     recommendation satisfactory to all hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers as soon as possible. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DREW2">Mr. Drew</persName>: Perhaps you will permit me to 
     <lb/>
     say a word in view of the fact that you have 
     <lb/>
     referred to what I have said. In the French 
     <lb/>
     and Italian chambers the ministers speak 
     <lb/>
     from the rostrum, but the members speak 
     <lb/>
     from their seats. I believe that system would 
     <lb/>
     work here.

     the consideration of this motion this after<lb break="no"/>noon. Certainly nothing has been put before 
     <lb/>
     the house which would suggest any reason 
     <lb/>
     for supporting such a motion.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: The reason for making the 
     <lb/>
     motion is to determine now that on February 
     <lb/>
     7 we may proceed with the resolutions and 
     <lb/>
     legislation necessary to implement the agree<lb break="no"/>ment for the union of Newfoundland with 
     <lb/>
     Canada. It is an express term of that agree<lb break="no"/>ment for union that it will come into force 
     <lb/>
     and bring about the union if there is assented 
     <lb/>
     to, by His Majesty, a bill of the parliament 
     <lb/>
     of the United Kingdom confirming legislation 
     <lb/>
     passed by this parliament and by the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Newfoundland ratifying the terms of 
     <lb/>
     that agreement. That procedure requires that 
     <lb/>
     there be in this house first of all a resolution, 
     <lb/>
     the one that was mentioned first under the 
     <lb/>
     heading "government notices of motions" to<lb break="no"/>day. That resolution is necessary before any 
     <lb/>
     bill can be introduced, because a bill to con<lb break="no"/>firm the agreement will impose charges upon 
     <lb/>
     the consolidated revenue fund. Then the bill 
     <lb/>
     itself must run the gauntlet of the usual 
     <lb/>
     stages of procedure in this house and in the 
     <lb/>
     other place before it can become the law of 
     <lb/>
     the land. It is felt that it would be undesir<lb break="no"/>able to have the matter dealt with at all by 
     <lb/>
     the parliament of the United Kingdom until 
     <lb/>
     the parliament of Canada has expressed the 
     <lb/>
     views of the people of Canada with respect 
     <lb/>
     to the union. Before the parliament of the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom will attempt to deal with 
     <lb/>
     the matter at all, in order to comply with the 
     <lb/>
     terms of the statute of Westminster there will 
     <lb/>
     be required a joint address of this house and 
     <lb/>
     of the senate asking His Majesty to lay before 
     <lb/>
     the parliament of the United Kingdom a bill 
     <lb/>
     embodying the proper legislation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When I was over in London some months 
     <lb/>
     ago I had some discussion on this subject with 
     <lb/>
     members of the government of the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom, and I was told that they would like 
     <lb/>
     to have not less than three weeks to deal with 
     <lb/>
     the legislation in their houses of parliament 
     <lb/>
     after the proceedings had been completed 
     <lb/>
     here. It is therefore urgent, I think, that we 
     <lb/>
     reach this matter and ascertain, at as early a 
     <lb/>
     date as possible, the views of the parliament 
     <lb/>
     of Canada upon the terms of union that were 
     <lb/>
     signed last December. It was for that reason 
     <lb/>
     that, when I announced to the gentlemen of 
     <lb/>
     the press the date that was fixed for the 
     <lb/>
     session, I explained to them that we were 
     <lb/>
     calling parliament together on a Wednesday 
     <lb/>
     instead of a Thursday, as had been done in 
     <lb/>
     several previous years, so that there might 
     <lb/>
     be a couple of days of debate on the address 
     <lb/>
     before we asked parliament to suspend the 
     <lb/>
     debate and deal with the matters concerning 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, as it had been our intention 


            <cb/>
 

     to ask parliament to do at the time specified 
     <lb/>
     in the motion as printed on the order paper. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When notice of this motion was given I 
     <lb/>
     found that there were many members of par<lb break="no"/>liament on both sides of the house who felt 
     <lb/>
     that it was not necessary to commence on 
     <lb/>
     January 31 in order to have the Newfound<lb break="no"/>land proceedings properly dealt with in time, 
     <lb/>
     and that they wished to have at least another 
     <lb/>
     full week of debate on the address before 
     <lb/>
     adjourning it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is my view that we do generally make 
     <lb/>
     better progress in dealing with the substan<lb break="no"/>tive business of parliament if we do not have 
     <lb/>
     too many disputes over matters of procedure, 
     <lb/>
     and I would take it for granted that we would 
     <lb/>
     be probably just as far advanced with the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland matter after a week or two if 
     <lb/>
     we met the wishes of hon. members who wish 
     <lb/>
     to have an additional week to debate the 
     <lb/>
     address. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The reason for bringing the motion forward 
     <lb/>
     is to have it fixed, that we will start on this 
     <lb/>
     matter on February 7, and to inform the law 
     <lb/>
     officers of the United Kingdom of this change, 
     <lb/>
     which we hope will not necessarily mean that 
     <lb/>
     we shall be delaying them in putting before 
     <lb/>
     them, if parliament approves of the agree<lb break="no"/>ment, the required material so that it can be 
     <lb/>
     dealt with in orderly fashion in the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom parliament.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DREW2">Mr. George A. Drew</persName> (Leader of the Oppo<lb break="no"/>sition): Mr. Speaker, first of all may I assure 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister (Mr. St. Laurent) and hon. 
     <lb/>
     members that on any procedural matters that 
     <lb/>
     will facilitate the business of this house he 
     <lb/>
     will find the full concurrence of myself as 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition and those associated 
     <lb/>
     with me; but that concurrence does not 
     <lb/>
     extend to the point of departing from well 
     <lb/>
     established practices, for which departure no 
     <lb/>
     substantial reason can be offered. The reasons 
     <lb/>
     now presented by the Prime Minister offer no 
     <lb/>
     justification whatever for presenting this 
     <lb/>
     motion today. I would point out that through<lb break="no"/>out the whole record of the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons, not only in this chamber but in other 
     <lb/>
     chambers in early buildings since confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, in the majority of occasions on which 
     <lb/>
     the debate on the speech from the throne has 
     <lb/>
     proceeded without interruption it has actually 
     <lb/>
     been completed within the time which would 
     <lb/>
     elapse between now and next Friday.

            <p>
     I do not wonder that hon. members at the 
     <lb/>
     other end of the chamber have difficulty in 
     <lb/>
     hearing the debate when it seems so difficult 
     <lb/>
     for some hon. members to keep their own 
     <lb/>
     thoughts inaudible. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The motion that is before the house at the 
     <lb/>
     present time is one which has the effect of 
     <lb/>
     terminating the debate on the address before 
     <lb/>
     anyone in the house knows whether in fact 
     <lb/>
     it will still be going on next Friday. It is a 
     <lb/>
     very easy matter to examine the record of 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Hansard</hi> and to ascertain that postponing the 
     <lb/>
     debate and then reviving it, and thereby bring<lb break="no"/>ing back the subject matter that was under 
     <lb/>
     consideration, inevitably prolongs the whole 
     <lb/>
     debate. But there are other reasons why 
     <lb/>
     this motion should not be accepted by hon. 
     <lb/>
     members without a great deal more explana<lb break="no"/>tion than has been offered. The date on which 
     <lb/>
     agreement was called for between the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada and the representatives of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, described in the agreement 
     <lb/>
     as the government of Newfoundland, was 
     <lb/>
     March 31. That date was decided on before 
     <lb/>
     the government had fixed the date of the 
     <lb/>
     session. If there was any reason to believe 
     <lb/>
     that additional time was needed it would 
     <lb/>
     have been very easy to have fixed an earlier 
     <lb/>
     date for the opening of the session so that 
     <lb/>
     the debate on the speech from the throne 
     <lb/>
     could have proceeded in an orderly way to 
     <lb/>
     its customary termination without interrup<lb break="no"/>tion, such as is now suggested. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is difficult to imagine what the urgency 
     <lb/>
     is which suggests that it is necessary to have 
     <lb/>
     this bill considered a week from Monday, 
     <lb/>
     particularly when more than two months will 
     <lb/>
     still elapse between the date on which agree<lb break="no"/>ment is required and today. After all, there 
     <lb/>
     is no reason to suggest that any extended 
     <lb/>
     delay will be involved in presenting the views 
     <lb/>
     of this house to Westminster, because it is 
     <lb/>
     inconceivable that the government of Canada 
     <lb/>
     has not already presented all the facts to the 
     <lb/>
     government of the United Kingdom other 
     <lb/>
     than the appropriate indication of such deci<lb break="no"/>sion as may be reached by this parliament. 
     <lb/>
     That being so, the time that is suggested as 
     <lb/>
     being necessary for these proceedings seems 
     <lb/>
     to bear no relationship whatever to any 
     <lb/>
     reasonable requirements to deal with this 
     <lb/>
     matter in the ordinary way. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is of course another and very much 
     <lb/>
     more cogent reason why this motion should 
     <lb/>
     not be accepted by hon. members. The rules 
     <lb/>
     of this house are not different from the rules 
     <lb/>
     of any other house. Please do not think for 
     <lb/>
     one moment that I am unaware of the tactics 
     <lb/>
     that can be employed in delaying the con<lb break="no"/>sideration of a debate on the speech from the 
     <lb/>
     throne, because if it is delayed the govern<lb break="no"/>ment finds an opportunity to introduce a 
     <lb/>
     number of extraneous subject matters which 
     <lb/>
     in their opinion will divert public attention 
    

            <cb/>
         

 
     from the inadequacy of the statements in the 
     <lb/>
     speech from the throne and from the weak<lb break="no"/>nesses in the position of the government. I 
     <lb/>
     am certainly convinced that this is the reason 
     <lb/>
     the adjournment is sought, rather than the 
     <lb/>
     reason that has been suggested in the house 
     <lb/>
     today. It will of course be very convenient 
     <lb/>
     if the striking omissions from the speech from 
     <lb/>
     the throne are supplemented by appropriate 
     <lb/>
     statements from day to day by various minis<lb break="no"/>ters who will make those bright promises 
     <lb/>
     which the minister of reconstruction does 
     <lb/>
     not think are as useful as they once were. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     But these can go on from day to day in the 
     <lb/>
     intervening period. And of course it would 
     <lb/>
     appear that the Minister of Finance (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Abbott) holds a similar view. These can go on 
     <lb/>
     indefinitely—and this is nothing new. I think 
     <lb/>
     the hon. members of this house not only on 
     <lb/>
     the opposition side but on the government 
     <lb/>
     side should seek to have an explanation on 
     <lb/>
     the one hand in regard to certain statements, 
     <lb/>
     which are extremely vague, in the speech 
     <lb/>
     from the throne and—

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DREW2">Mr. Drew</persName>: I think it is very obvious that 
     <lb/>
     a number of motions can be padded out with 
     <lb/>
     various statements that can be introduced on 
     <lb/>
     the one hand by presentation to the house, 
     <lb/>
     and on the other hand by those interesting 
     <lb/>
     pieces of information which appear in the 
     <lb/>
     press throughout Canada, without any names 
     <lb/>
     attached to them, stating that the press is 
     <lb/>
     authoritatively informed from someone very 
     <lb/>
     close to the minister that such and such a 
     <lb/>
     thing is going to be done. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     There is of course a still further reason, 
     <lb/>
     and one which, it seems to me, is very difficult 
     <lb/>
     for some hon. members opposite to dispute: 
     <lb/>
     that is, that the debate on the speech from 
     <lb/>
     the throne is no mere formality, as some 
     <lb/>
     people seem to suggest from time to time. 
     <lb/>
     It is in fact the most important debate in 
     <lb/>
     many cases which will take place in any 
     <lb/>
     legislative assembly. Because, under the 
     <lb/>
     practice established here, as in every other 
     <lb/>
     parliament or legislature within the common<lb break="no"/>wealth, the debate on the speech from the 
     <lb/>
     throne offers an opportunity to the house to 
     <lb/>
     say by its vote whether the government still 
     <lb/>
     commands the confidence of the House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons. It may be a comfortable assump<lb break="no"/>tion on the part of the government that they 
  

            <pb n="32" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-01-28_Page_0032.jpg"/>

<fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">Business of the House</hi></fw>
            <fw type="running">HOUSE OF COMMONS</fw>
          
      


     can look at the list of members and count 
     <lb/>
     every vote according to the places where 
     <lb/>
     they seat themselves in the house. But if 
     <lb/>
     any house of commons or legislative assembly 
     <lb/>
     reduces itself to a position where individual 
     <lb/>
     discretion, intelligence and conscience mean 
     <lb/>
     nothing, then there might just as well be no 
     <lb/>
     recorded vote at all, and the vote might just 
     <lb/>
     as well be taken from the printed sheet. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The fact is that members of this House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons and other legislative bodies in the 
     <lb/>
     country have demonstrated that measure of 
     <lb/>
     independence which is the hallmark of free 
     <lb/>
     parliaments. There is no reason on this or 
     <lb/>
     any other occasion to assume that merely 
     <lb/>
     because of the tag on which a member was 
     <lb/>
     elected he is simply to become a servile digit 
     <lb/>
     to be named by the leader of his group, with<lb break="no"/>out any respect for his own conscience, when 
     <lb/>
     some subject is before the house. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The practice is very well established, and 
     <lb/>
     on this occasion I think it would be well if 
     <lb/>
     I were to place before the house the opinion 
     <lb/>
     of a member whose virtues have been loudly 
     <lb/>
     extolled by a number of hon. members op<lb break="no"/>posite as one who understands the real mean<lb break="no"/>ing of parliament, and of this parliament 
     <lb/>
     particularly. I would quote the words of the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. member for Glengarry (Mr. Mac<lb break="no"/>kenzie King). It is true that we have not<lb/>always agreed on every subject; but in this<lb/>instance surely I can offer to hon. members<lb/>opposite no better advice than that of the<lb/>man for whom they have shown such un<lb break="no"/>reserved respect in these past few days and <lb/>for whose opinion they have the highest<lb/>regard.<lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     Therefore I should like to read what the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. member for Glengarry said in 
     <lb/>
     1921, as it is reported at page 151, volume I 
     <lb/>
     of <hi rendition="simple:italic">Hansard</hi> for that year. These words, it 
     <lb/>
     seems to me, set forth the very core of the 
     <lb/>
     consideration that should be in our minds. I 
     <lb/>
     shall quote his words, and these will be his 
     <lb/>
     words until I have indicated that the quota<lb break="no"/>tion is ended: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     We take the position that without the confidence 
     <lb/>
     of this house and of the country they are not en<lb break="no"/>titled to introduce a bill or to spend a dollar; and 
     <lb/>
     unless my right hon. friend can show us some pre<lb break="no"/>cedent for adjourning the debate on a motion of 
     <lb/>
     want of confidence in the government to take up 
     <lb/>
     another matter, we would be justified I think in 
     <lb/>
     adhering to the position which we have taken from 
     <lb/>
     the outset, namely that the government lacks the 
     <lb/>confidence of the country, and therefore is not<lb/>entitled to proceed with any legislation.<lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     There the quotation ends. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The mere fact that the want of confidence 
     <lb/>
     motion has not yet been moved varies in no 
     <lb/>
     way the effectiveness of this statement— 
     <lb/>
     because the only reason there is no want of 
     <lb/>
     confidence motion before the house is that 
     <lb/>
     this motion has been introduced before the 
     <lb/>
     debate has been resumed. The view put 
 
            <cb/>
      

     forth there by the right hon. gentleman is 
     <lb/>
     one in which I think all hon. members might 
     <lb/>
     well concur; because if for any reason mem<lb break="no"/>bers in the house do not support the govern<lb break="no"/>ment, then the government may well have 
     <lb/>
     committed itself to a course with which it had 
     <lb/>
     no right to proceed, unless that confidence 
     <lb/>
     has once been established. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There may of course be varying reasons. 
     <lb/>
     We would simply not recognize reality if we 
     <lb/>
     were to say that there could be no occasion 
     <lb/>
     upon which some emergency situation might 
     <lb/>
     arise where a motion of this kind might be 
     <lb/>
     called for, if the debate were to be unreason<lb break="no"/>ably protracted. But no such situation arises 
     <lb/>
     now. The debate is going on next week, by 
     <lb/>
     decision of the Prime Minister (Mr. St. 
     <lb/>
     Laurent) and his colleagues. That being so, 
     <lb/>
     until there is any indication whatever that an 
     <lb/>
     emergency actually presents itself, and the 
     <lb/>
     debate is in fact proceeding next Friday, 
     <lb/>
     there is no reason whatever to support the 
     <lb/>
     motion. It should be opposed in principle in 
     <lb/>
     any event. But even without that, the motion 
     <lb/>
     is wholly unnecessary, and therefore it is 
     <lb/>
     opposed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:COLD1">Mr. M. J. Coldwell</persName> (Rosetown-Biggar): Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, when the proposal was first made 
     <lb/>
     that the debate should be interrupted from 
     <lb/>
     today, my colleagues felt the request was one 
     <lb/>
     we could not approve. The government, how<lb break="no"/>ever, has compromised to this extent, that 
     <lb/>
     next week the debate on the address will con<lb break="no"/>tinue, and that at the end of next week we 
     <lb/>
     shall take up the matter of union with 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think it is unfortunate that this debate 
     <lb/>
     must be interrupted, but my experience in the 
     <lb/>
     twelve years I have been here is that nor<lb break="no"/>mally the debate on the address lasts any<lb break="no"/>where from three to six weeks. I realize that 
     <lb/>
     there is great urgency in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland agreement, but that urgency 
     <lb/>
     arises because of a situation not in our own 
     <lb/>
     country or in our own parliament but in the 
     <lb/>
     British parliament. May I say that that is 
     <lb/>
     the reason why we shall support the amended 
     <lb/>
     resolution that has been introduced this after<lb break="no"/>noon. At the moment the British house is 
     <lb/>
     engaged in many important matters dealing 
     <lb/>
     not only with their own grave domestic situa<lb break="no"/>tion but with the international situation as 
     <lb/>
     well. I think we owe it to them, if they 
     <lb/>
     require at least three weeks to deal with this 
     <lb/>
     matter, to see that they have ample time in 
     <lb/>
     which to consider this agreement, which 
     <lb/>
     according to newspaper reports will be 
     <lb/>
     opposed by some members of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     in the British House of Commons. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     While we dislike these interruptions of the 
     <lb/>
     debate on the address, on this occasion we 
     <lb/>
     think that the government has a better reason 


            <pb n="33" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-01-28_Page_0033.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">JANUARY 28, 1949</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">Business of the House</hi></fw><fw type="num">33</fw> 


     for asking for an interruption than it has had 
     <lb/>
     on any other occasion I can remember. When 
     <lb/>
     we first saw the request made by the govern<lb break="no"/>ment we felt, particularly in view of the 
     <lb/>
     experience of last year, that we should hesi<lb break="no"/>tate and consider carefully whether we should 
     <lb/>
     consent to such an interruption. From time 
     <lb/>
     to time, however, it is necessary that those 
     <lb/>
     of us who are in opposition should view mat<lb break="no"/>ters of government convenience, particularly 
     <lb/>
     when they involve courtesy to another parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, in a broad way. I repeat that we have 
     <lb/>
     decided to support this amended resolution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would remind hon. members that many 
     <lb/>
     weeks ago, in the autumn, we asked that par<lb break="no"/>liament be called to deal with matters of 
     <lb/>
     urgency, and of course this has become one 
     <lb/>
     of the matters that could have been dealt 
     <lb/>
     with had parliament been called before 
     <lb/>
     Christmas or earlier this month. This is the 
     <lb/>
     criticism I make of the government at the 
     <lb/>
     moment—that the session should have been 
     <lb/>
     called earlier. But it was not called earlier, 
     <lb/>
     and we are now faced with the necessity of 
     <lb/>
     giving consideration to union with Newfound<lb break="no"/>land. After all, this is a most important 
     <lb/>
     event in the history of this country—the 
     <lb/>
     addition of a new province, something which 
     <lb/>
     was contemplated by the fathers of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion as long ago as 1867 and, in relation to 
     <lb/>
     what will be the tenth province, is about to 
     <lb/>
     be consummated in 1949. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I say again that we dislike interruptions to 
     <lb/>
     the debate on the address. We believe that 
     <lb/>
     this interruption could have been avoided by 
     <lb/>
     calling parliament earlier. But since par<lb break="no"/>liament was not called, since the union of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland with Canada is an important 
     <lb/>
     matter which should be dealt with, and since 
     <lb/>
     we should give the British parliament ample 
     <lb/>
     time in which to deal with it and to plan its 
     <lb/>
     work, we will support the amended resolution.

     Biggar I should like to ask the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Carleton (Mr. Drew) if he suggested 
     <lb/>
     earlier that parliament should have been 
     <lb/>

     the Prime Minister (Mr. St. Laurent), and to 
     <lb/>
     the arguments advanced by the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     C.C.F. (Mr. Coldwell). I agree with the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member that everything should be done to 
     <lb/>
     enable consideration at the earliest possible 
     <lb/>
     day of the resolution with regard to the 
     <lb/>
     admission of Newfoundland into confedera<lb break="no"/>

     tion. With him I agree also that that event 
     <lb/>
     will represent a step forward in the com<lb break="no"/>pletion of the destiny of this dominion. In 
     <lb/>
     that regard I am in agreement with him; 
     <lb/>
     but he failed to answer the argument advan<lb break="no"/>ced, and the government has as yet not 
     <lb/>
     answered the argument of the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition (Mr. Drew), that first and fore<lb break="no"/>most the government of this country must 
     <lb/>
     have the confidence of the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons.

     This resolution carries out an old plan; 
     <lb/>
     there is nothing new about it. Parliament 
     <lb/>
     could have been called three weeks ago, if 
     <lb/>
     not before, and this matter could have been

     that this debate will take a considerable time.

     of the hon. member for Carleton were to that

     effect. During the war there were invasions

     of the rights of a free parliament, but we of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition intend to be assured that they 
     <lb/>
     shall not be continued in the days of peace. 
     <lb/>
     More than anything else the people of this

     country are asking that parliament be restored 
     <lb/>
     to the prestige that it enjoyed in the years 
     <lb/>
     prior to the war. They are asking that parlia<lb break="no"/>ment shall not continue in living stagnation 
     <lb/>
     while government by bureaucracy continues 
     <lb/>
     in this country. They are asking to have re<lb break="no"/>stored the right of the people's representatives

     to preserve the rights of the people and to 
     <lb/>
     represent all the people in this country. I 
     <lb/>
     congratulate my right hon. friend upon be<lb break="no"/>coming Prime Minister, but I say to him that 
     <lb/>
     his duty as the leader of this government, 
     <lb/>
     with the reshuffling of the cards that has 
     <lb/>
     taken place and the addition of certain mem<lb break="no"/>bers to the cabinet, is to demand at the first 
     <lb/>
     opportunity a vote of confidence, thus giving 
     <lb/>
     to hon members the opportunity to deter<lb break="no"/>mine the question once and for all. 
     <lb/>
     I do not want to be over-critical—

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. Members</persName>: Oh, oh! 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DIEF1">Mr. Diefenbaker</persName>: I said over-critical; but I 
     <lb/>
     do say to my right hon. friend that in the last 
     <lb/>
     couple of days the government has shown an 
     <lb/>
     uncertainty, a lack of unity, and a failure to 
     <lb/>
     realize in what direction it is going except in 
     <lb/>
     the direction of an election. We have the 
     <lb/>
     right to know whether my right hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     and those associated with him have the con<lb break="no"/>fidence of this house. The people want the 
     <lb/>
     members of this parliament to have an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity to let the government know that its 
     <lb/>
     taxation policy is wrong, that its income tax 
     <lb/>
     is unjust. When I say this I speak for the 
     <lb/>
     farmers. The government says it has the 
     <lb/>
     confidence of the people. The farmers want 
     <lb/>
     an opportunity of having their lack of con<lb break="no"/>fidence in this government placed before this 
     <lb/>
     house, because that lack of confidence extends 
     <lb/>
     from one end of the country to the other. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     My hon. leader says members of parlia<lb break="no"/>ment are not mere digits to be pushed about, 
     <lb/>
     to be directed. Not since the end of the war 
     <lb/>
     was there a finer declaration of the principles 
     <lb/>
     of parliament and what it stands for than was 
     <lb/>
     contained in the words of my hon. leader 
     <lb/>
     this afternoon when he pointed out that, 
     <lb/>
     regardless of our position, we in this house 
     <lb/>
     have a responsibility which can be discharged 
     <lb/>
     only when each of us individually votes on 
     <lb/>
     the question of confidence or non-confidence 
     <lb/>
     in the government. I say to my right hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend that he should give the members of 
     <lb/>
     this house an opportunity of saying to him 
     <lb/>
     and to those associated with him—and I 
     <lb/>
     should think they would want it—whether 
     <lb/>
     this house has any confidence in them, before 
     <lb/>
     they proceed with notices of motions and 
     <lb/>
     resolutions calling for the expenditure of 
     <lb/>
     millions of dollars. On one occasion the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Carleton expressed similar 
     <lb/>
     views.

     of war, which all too often was contrary to 
     <lb/>
     the highest principles of constitutional gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. We on this side intend to do our 
     <lb/>
     utmost to see that the invasions of parlia<lb break="no"/>mentary rights, which were pathways in the 
     <lb/>
     days of war, do not become permanent high<lb break="no"/>ways of peace.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FLEM1">Mr. Donald M. Fleming</persName> (Eglinton): Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, I am glad hon. members opposite 
     <lb/>
     are beginning to show some evidence of 
     <lb/>
     awakening from their normal lethargy, and 
     <lb/>
     I trust that this degree of awakening will 
     <lb/>
     extend also to the rights of this house which 
     <lb/>
     are placed in jeopardy by the motion now 
     <lb/>
     under debate. It would be a happy day indeed 
     <lb/>
     if we could see on the part of hon. members 
     <lb/>
     to your right, Mr. Speaker, some degree of 
     <lb/>
     concern for constitutional practices and the 
     <lb/>
     preservation of the rights and responsibilities 
     <lb/>
     of a free parliament. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let no one underestimate the importance of 
     <lb/>
     the subject now under discussion. It is not a 
     <lb/>
     mere question of procedure for today or pro<lb break="no"/>cedure for Monday. What is at issue here 
     <lb/>
     goes far deeper than that. It is procedure 
     <lb/>
     measured in terms of the duties and respon<lb break="no"/>sibilities of the executive branch of govern<lb break="no"/>ment to this house. Is the government sup<lb break="no"/>reme? If so, it matters little what happens 
     <lb/>
     here, and certainly the motion should pass. 
     <lb/>
     If, however, the house is supreme, then it is 
     <lb/>
     the house that should determine the order 
     <lb/>
     in which business shall be taken up; and 
     <lb/>
     above all things, before this government is 
     <lb/>
     permitted to lay any business before the 
     <lb/>
     house, it must establish, in the recognized 
     <lb/>
     constitutional manner, that it possesses the 
     <lb/>
     confidence of the house. Under conditions 
     <lb/>
     now obtaining in this house and this country 
     <lb/>
     the government has no right to lay before 
     <lb/>
     this chamber one item of government business 
     <lb/>
     calling for a decision without having estab<lb break="no"/>lished that it does possess the confidence of 
     <lb/>
     the house. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Consider exactly what it means if this 
     <lb/>
     motion is adopted. In the first place, it means 
     <lb/>
     the government has asserted that the time of 
     <lb/>
     this house must be rationed. It means that 
     <lb/>
     the government asserts its right to sidetrack 
     <lb/>
     the important debate on the address in 
     <lb/>
     favour of a measure it proposes to introduce. 
     <lb/>
     It means also, in effect, that the government 
     <lb/>
     does not owe a primary responsibility to the 
     <lb/>
     house. It is time this house, out of self-respect, 
     <lb/>
     out of a sense of responsibility for the main<lb break="no"/>tenance of its constitutional position in the 
     <lb/>
     interests of freedom in this country, asserted 
     <lb/>
     its right to determine the kind of government 
     <lb/>
     that should occupy the seats of office; and 
     <lb/>
     that can be determined under present cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances only by a vote in this house which 
 

            <pb n="35" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-01-28_Page_0035.jpg"/>

     will show the confidence hon. members are 
     <lb/>
     prepared to extend to or withhold from the 
     <lb/>
     government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     At no time in the life of this parliament was 
     <lb/>
     it more important that the debate on the 
     <lb/>
     address should proceed without interruption 
     <lb/>
     until it was established whether or not the 
     <lb/>
     government held the confidence of the house. 
     <lb/>
     Hon. members opposite seem to forget that, 
     <lb/>
     technically at least, there has been a change 
     <lb/>
     of government with the change of prime 
     <lb/>
     ministers, that there has been a change in 
     <lb/>
     portfolios, though in most cases the same 
     <lb/>
     ministers were reappointed. It is in that 
     <lb/>
     sense a different government; and it has not 
     <lb/>
     established in any particular that it possesses 
     <lb/>
     the confidence of the house. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Perhaps I should not have been amazed, 
     <lb/>
     but I must confess to some degree of surprise 
     <lb/>
     that the hon. member for Rosetown-Biggar 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Coldwell) should have submitted so 
     <lb/>
     weakly this afternoon in the face of the 
     <lb/>
     government's steam roller. That is evidence 
     <lb/>
     of an altogether too friendly association 
     <lb/>
     between Liberal members and the C.C.F. 
     <lb/>
     party in this house. If that is to be an 
     <lb/>
     example of the way in which that group is to 
     <lb/>
     function in opposition, then I suggest it come 
     <lb/>
     out in its true colours and proclaim itself as 
     <lb/>
     simply a wing of the government party. If 
     <lb/>
     we are to have a continuation of that attitude 
     <lb/>
     the criticism of government policy we may 
     <lb/>
     expect from the C.C.F. party during this 
     <lb/>
     session will be a very friendly, mild and 
     <lb/>
     ladylike kind of criticism. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, there has been an 
     <lb/>
     attempt on the other side to ridicule the 
     <lb/>
     importance of this debate. The reason is 
     <lb/>
     perfectly obvious, Mr. Speaker. The fact of 
     <lb/>
     the matter is that the debate on the address 
     <lb/>
     gives the members of the opposition, yes, 
     <lb/>
     and such other private members of the house 
     <lb/>
     as choose to assert their freedom and respon<lb break="no"/>sibility as members of the house, an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity to stand in their places and criticize 
     <lb/>
     the government on its past record, on its 
     <lb/>
     policy, on the contents of the speech from 
     <lb/>
     the throne, and on the omissions from it. 
     <lb/>
     Not only is this a duty; it is a responsibility 
     <lb/>
     which every member of the house must 
     <lb/>
     exercise according to his rights if he would 
     <lb/>
     do his duty by those whom he represents. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Necessarily, any government characterized 
     <lb/>
     by such flaws in its record affords very great 
     <lb/>
     opportunity for criticism. If this debate is 
     <lb/>
     not throttled, or sidetracked by the govern<lb break="no"/>ment steam roller, there will be plenty of 
     <lb/>
     criticism of the government in this chamber 
     <lb/>
     during the course of this debate. Is it any 
     <lb/>
     wonder, Mr. Speaker, that a government 
     <lb/>
     which has shown itself so impatient of 
     <lb/>
     criticism would desire in this way to throttle 
  

            <cb/>
         

     criticism? That is precisely the issue which 
     <lb/>
     is before the house today. Shall criticism 
     <lb/>
     have a free voice in a free parliament? It 
     <lb/>
     is that issue that will be determined in the 
     <lb/>
     vote on this resolution today. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     This resolution means precisely what it 
     <lb/>
     says. It signifies that the government is not 
     <lb/>
     prepared to permit parliament, in the 
     <lb/>
     ordinary way, to proceed in freedom to 
     <lb/>
     express criticism of government policy. The 
     <lb/>
     reason becomes all the more obvious in the 
     <lb/>
     light of what has been said of late—sup<lb break="no"/>posedly emanating from government circles 
     <lb/>
     or sources close to the government, and 
     <lb/>
     referred to by my esteemed leader— about 
     <lb/>
     the possibility of a general election. What 
     <lb/>
     could better suit the purposes of a govern<lb break="no"/>ment, such as the one in office today, than, 
     <lb/>
     on the eve of an election, to throttle criticism 
     <lb/>
     in this house, and this at a time when much 
     <lb/>
     criticism is being heard from the people of 
     <lb/>
     this country. That is the measure of the 
     <lb/>
     government's sense of responsibility to those 
     <lb/>
     to whom it owes responsibility, that, at this 
     <lb/>
     above all times, it should seek to stifle 
     <lb/>
     criticism. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In this house the day before yesterday, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, we went through a form which 
     <lb/>
     is followed on the opening day in every 
     <lb/>
     parliament which stems from the mother of 
     <lb/>
     parliaments. In the measure which has 
     <lb/>
     been traditionally introduced respecting the 
     <lb/>
     administration of the oaths of office, the 
     <lb/>
     house asserts its right to proceed with busi<lb break="no"/>ness of its choosing without first having to 
     <lb/>
     take up the program laid down before it in 
     <lb/>
     the speech from the throne. Is that an empty 
     <lb/>
     formality? Is it simply a reminder that in 
     <lb/>
     days gone by a free parliament found itself 
     <lb/>
     at odds with a monarch? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     It goes a good deal further than that, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker. It amounts to the assertion, if this 
     <lb/>
     house has the courage to assert what it 
     <lb/>
     should, of the right of the house to proceed 
     <lb/>
     with its business in the proper way. In this 
     <lb/>
     instance no business can be taken up, if that 
     <lb/>
     constitutional position is to be preserved, 
     <lb/>
     until the government has established that it 
     <lb/>
     possesses the confidence of the house. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The same old mentality dominates this gov<lb break="no"/>ernment as dominated the one which it suc<lb break="no"/>ceeded last fall. There is the same old com<lb break="no"/>plex; the same old bureaucratic approach to 
     <lb/>
     all of these problems; the same contempt for 
     <lb/>
     parliament; the same irresponsibility in its 
     <lb/>
     attitude towards the elected representatives 
     <lb/>
     of the people in this house. If this is a new 
     <lb/>
     govermnent, Mr. Speaker, it has learned its 
     <lb/>
     constitutional practice from the government 
     <lb/>
     which preceded it, and that was a poor way 
     <lb/>
     to learn sound constitutional practice. It was 
     <lb/>
     a very good way to learn oligarchic practice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     If this is a new government, it is not yet a

     parliament.

            </p>

            <p>
     Let me turn for a moment to a high 
     <lb/>
     authority, to no less a person than the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Quebec South (Mr. Power). Con<lb break="no"/>cerning this government and its attitude to 
     <lb/>
     such matters, he spoke words from which 
     <lb/>
     hon. members opposite would do well to 
     <lb/>
     profit. I will quote, Mr. Speaker, from a 
     <lb/>
     speech of the hon. and esteemed member for 
     <lb/>
     Quebec South, as reported in the Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     Journal of August 9, 1948. It happens that 
     <lb/>
     this speech was delivered before the national 
     <lb/>
     convention of the Liberal party. In review<lb break="no"/>ing some of the things to which I have 
     <lb/>
     alluded, the bureaucratic complex of this 
     <lb/>
     government and its tyrannical and irrespon<lb break="no"/>sible attitude towards the House of Commons, 
     <lb/>
     he said this: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Without the existence of an almost all-powerful 
     <lb/>
     bureaucracy, it is unlikely that we would have had 
     <lb/>
     budget by radio, restraint of trade by embargoes 
     <lb/>
     and prohibitions, bungling of freight rates, and a 
     <lb/>
     snarling of interprovincial relations. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     Let me say again, Mr. Speaker, that is just 
     <lb/>
     what this government has attempted to do. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     He says further: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     But to me loss of individual freedom through ir<lb break="no"/>responsible bureaucracy is too high a price to pay 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     I ask hon. members of all parties of this 
     <lb/>
     house to weigh well the memorable words 
     <lb/>
     uttered by the member for Quebec South on 
     <lb/>
     that occasion, when he said: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Since the beginning of this convention there have 
     <lb/>
     been hints that from high places from now on all 
     <lb/>
     would be well; that things would be different in the 
     <lb/>
     future; that we would mend our ways. The pride 
     <lb/>
     that could flout a parliamentary caucus or a house 
     <lb/>
     of commons quailed before a national convention. 
     <lb/>
     But tonight the delegates will be gone, the old pride 
     <lb/>
     will return. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     I say to you, Mr. Speaker, the old pride has 
     <lb/>
     returned. We have proof of it in this govern<lb break="no"/>ment resolution today. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The old plea of urgency has, of course, been 
     <lb/>
     trotted out. I think we have had enough in 
     <lb/>
     what the Prime Minister has said to com<lb break="no"/>pletely disprove this allegation of urgency 
     <lb/>
     with respect to the Newfoundland measure. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Where is the sense in the government 
     <lb/>
     seriously saying it is imperative that the 
     <lb/>
     throne speech debate should not be permitted 
     <lb/>
     to proceed—it would probably last two or 
     <lb/>
     three weeks—because there would not be time 
     <lb/>
     to pass this Newfoundland legislation? Why 
     <lb/>
     could not the house have been called two 
     <lb/>
     weeks ago? No reason has been given—no 
     <lb/>
     reason whatever. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But the Prime Minister was not satisfied 
     <lb/>
     with that. When we met here on Wednesday 
  

            <cb/>
          

     there was tremendous urgency about this 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland business. It was so urgent 
     <lb/>
     that it had to be proceeded with on Monday 
     <lb/>
     next. The most this government was pre<lb break="no"/>pared to permit, by way of rationed time in 
     <lb/>
     this chamber to speak in this debate, was 
     <lb/>
     Thursday and Friday. Two days to air the 
     <lb/>
     grievances of a nation in a parliament in 
     <lb/>
     which the new government has not yet proven 
     <lb/>
     it possesses the confidence of the house! Two 
     <lb/>
     whole days for the assertion of the rights of 
     <lb/>
     democracy in this House of Commons before 
     <lb/>
     the government steam roller begins to put 
     <lb/>
     legislation before the house and sidetrack 
     <lb/>
     other forms of discussion! 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Suddenly, Mr. Speaker, that urgency began 
     <lb/>
     to fade somewhat in View of the snarl into 
     <lb/>
     which the government had gotten itself by 
     <lb/>
     its attempt to dictate to the house. The Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister then decided that the house might 
     <lb/>
     have another week to discuss it. Today he 
     <lb/>
     says, and I recall his words, that we would be 
     <lb/>
     as far ahead after a week or two of debate on 
     <lb/>
     the speech from the throne. Then, why con<lb break="no"/>fine the debate on the address to one week if 
     <lb/>
     we would be as far ahead after a week or 
     <lb/>
     two? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The way in which democracy is functioning 
     <lb/>
     in free parliaments and legislatures the world 
     <lb/>
     over today is being watched by many people 
     <lb/>
     as the race narrows down between the true 
     <lb/>
     democratic way of life and the communist 
     <lb/>
     totalitarian method. There never was a time 
     <lb/>
     when it was so much the duty of members 
     <lb/>
     of a free parliament to assert the rights of 
     <lb/>
     all its members, if they would value their 
     <lb/>
     freedom and the constitutional processes they 
     <lb/>
     were elected not only to carry out but to 
     <lb/>
     defend. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What would be your attitude, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     if you were one of those detestable commun<lb break="no"/>ists, after seeing what was being attempted 
     <lb/>
     by the government in this House of Commons 
     <lb/>
     today, after hearing the talk about the rights 
     <lb/>
     of parliament, about parliament being a place 
     <lb/>
     where the grievances of the people are being 
     <lb/>
     aired, and where criticism can be leveled at 
     <lb/>
     the government without fear of individual 
     <lb/>
     retaliation, and then government comes along 
     <lb/>
     and decides that it will ration freedom of 
     <lb/>
     speech in this chamber? What would be your 
     <lb/>
     attitude, Mr. Speaker, if you were a com<lb break="no"/>munist? You would say, Is that not a fine 
     <lb/>
     sample of democracy? You would say, If that 
     <lb/>
     is democracy, then, after all, what is the fund<lb break="no"/>amental difference between it and the 
     <lb/>
     totalitarian method? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This is no way for any government to 
     <lb/>
     expedite the business of the session. If they 
     <lb/>
     want to do that, let them first give this house 
     <lb/>
     a free opportunity to express an opinion as 
     <lb/>
     to whether or not they possess its confidence. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, I submit to you and to the other 
     <lb/>
     members of the house that a serious question 
     <lb/>
     is raised by this debate, and I trust that you 
     <lb/>
     will bear with me for a few minutes while I 
     <lb/>
     try to analyse it in what I hope will be a 
     <lb/>
     nonpartisan way.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GREE1">Mr. Green</persName>: I realize that at times we all 
     <lb/>
     must show certain partisanship in this house, 
     <lb/>
     but I meant what I said when I indicated 
     <lb/>
     that I planned to try to analyze this question 
     <lb/>
     in an unbiased way. The question is whether 
     <lb/>
     or not the members of the government are 
     <lb/>
     taking the right attitude towards the debate 
     <lb/>
     on the address in reply to the speech from 
     <lb/>
     the throne. Let me direct the minds of hon. 
     <lb/>
     members back to the announcements made in 
     <lb/>
     the press about this session. In Vancouver 
     <lb/>
     I read that the speech from the throne would 
     <lb/>
     be considered for only a day or two and that 
     <lb/>
     we would then go on to discuss this proposed 
     <lb/>
     union with Newfoundland. In other words, 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister and the cabinet from the 
     <lb/>
     start have had the idea that this throne speech 
     <lb/>
     debate would last for a matter of only a few 
     <lb/>
     hours and then would be adjourned, or in 
     <lb/>
     effect would be pushed aside and used as a 
     <lb/>
     filler between other items of government 
     <lb/>
     business. The result must inevitably be that 
     <lb/>
     the debate on the speech from the throne will 
     <lb/>
     be of little use to the members of this house 
     <lb/>
     or to the country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We saw this same attitude taken at the 
     <lb/>
     opening of the last session. Back in Dec<lb break="no"/>ember 1947 we were all surprised to learn, 
     <lb/>
     again from the press, that the house was to be 
     <lb/>
     called into session a few days before Christ<lb break="no"/>mas, and that the reason it was being called 
     <lb/>
     was to deal with the Geneva trade treaties. 
     <lb/>
     I may be wrong in that, but I think that was 
     <lb/>
     the main reason given for calling the house 
 

            <cb/>


     in December. Mention may also have been 
     <lb/>
     made of the austerity program. In any 
     <lb/>
     event, I came east then believing that the 
     <lb/>
     main reason for calling that session was to 
     <lb/>
     consider the Geneva treaties. When we came 
     <lb/>
     here we were met with exactly the same plan 
     <lb/>
     that is being attempted at this session. The 
     <lb/>
     speech from the throne was to be dealt with 
     <lb/>
     for a day or two, and then we were to go on 
     <lb/>
     with this emergency business. As it turned 
     <lb/>
     out, the debate on the Geneva treaties lasted 
     <lb/>
     for two days, and then was adjourned until 
     <lb/>
     after Christmas, when it was again adjourned. 
     <lb/>
     The treaties were sent to a committee and 
     <lb/>
     the committee made a report, but the house 
     <lb/>
     never dealt with it or with the treaties; they 
     <lb/>
     have not been approved to this day. They are 
     <lb/>
     to come up again at this present session. On 
     <lb/>
     that former occasion the same attitude that is 
     <lb/>
     being taken today was taken by the cabinet 
     <lb/>
     towards parliament and towards the debate 
     <lb/>
     on the speech from the throne. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I submit that there are some serious objec<lb break="no"/>tions to that attitude; in fact, there are grave 
     <lb/>
     dangers in the government of Canada adopt<lb break="no"/>ing that attitude. First of all, the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister and his colleagues have placed far 
     <lb/>
     too little importance on this throne speech 
     <lb/>
     debate, which can only mean that they place 
     <lb/>
     far too little importance on parliament itself, 
     <lb/>
     on the private members of this house, whether 
     <lb/>
     they be in the opposition or on the govern<lb break="no"/>ment side, and on the people represented in 
     <lb/>
     this house by the private members. The 
     <lb/>
     keystone of our democratic system of govern<lb break="no"/>ment is parliament, not the cabinet. Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment is composed of men and women 
     <lb/>
     entrusted by their constituencies with the 
     <lb/>
     responsibility of leading the nation. Under 
     <lb/>
     our system the leadership of this nation 
     <lb/>
     should not come from the cabinet; in the 
     <lb/>
     final analysis it should come from parliament. 
     <lb/>
     The cabinet is only the executive of 
     <lb/>
     parliament. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     At the opening of each session the private 
     <lb/>
     members gather here from all over Canada, 
     <lb/>
     fresh from contacts with the people. They 
     <lb/>
     know the problems that are worrying the 
     <lb/>
     people and the action that the people want to 
     <lb/>
     have taken by parliament. We who come 
     <lb/>
     here as private members are certainly much 
     <lb/>
     closer to the people than any member of the 
     <lb/>
     cabinet can possibly be. He is here in Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     practically all the time; he has many other 
     <lb/>
     things to do and cannot be in such close 
     <lb/>
     touch with the people as a private member. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If the debate on the speech from the throne 
     <lb/>
     is held immediately after the opening of par<lb break="no"/>liament it gives the private members a chance 
     <lb/>
     to bring the views of their constituents 
     <lb/>
     directly to the attention of the cabinet. That 
     <lb/>
     is important, because it can, or it should, 
     <lb/>
     influence the legislation that will be brought

     to deter any aggressor who might otherwise 
     <lb/>
     feel disposed to repudiate the solemn under<lb break="no"/>taking he signed at San Francisco. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is no use deceiving ourselves or 
     <lb/>
     mincing words. We know that the people 
     <lb/>
     of the North American continent, that the 
     <lb/>
     people of the democracies of western Europe, 
     <lb/>
     fear there may be an aggression from this 
     <lb/>
     great power which was allied with us in the 
     <lb/>
     last war but which professes an ideology that 
     <lb/>
     would necessarily exclude the civilization 
     <lb/>
     under which our institutions have been estab<lb break="no"/>lished. We fear that those totalitarians who 
     <lb/>
     direct that great mass of human beings might 
     <lb/>
     attempt, by force, to impose their ideology 
     <lb/>
     upon the rest of the world. But we believe 
     <lb/>
     they are realistic, and we believe that, if we 
     <lb/>
     can negotiate with them from strength, they 
     <lb/>
     will be apt to feel there would be consider<lb break="no"/>able risk in starting any war. We believe 
     <lb/>
     they will not start any war they are not con<lb break="no"/>fident they can win. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We believe that those we mentioned as the 
     <lb/>
     likely signatories of this North Atlantic pact 
     <lb/>
     have the potential strength, manpower, 
     <lb/>
     industrial know-how, material, the courage 
     <lb/>
     and desire to remain free men which would 
     <lb/>
     make it very doubtful that any aggressor 
     <lb/>
     could overcome them. We are forming or 
     <lb/>
     hope to form the alliance not for the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of having to fight together—of course we 
     <lb/>
     will if it is imposed upon us, but it is not for 
     <lb/>
     that purpose. Primarily, it is being formed 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of doing that for which the 
     <lb/>
     charter of the united nations was signed at 
     <lb/>
     San Francisco in 1945. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It seems to me that any free man in any 
     <lb/>
     of our countries should have no greater 
     <lb/>
     hesitation in having his country become a 
     <lb/>
     party to that North Atlantic security pact 
     <lb/>
     than he had in having his country become a 
     <lb/>
     signatory to the San Francisco charter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, that is the matter in the international 
     <lb/>
     field which His Excellency says, in the speech 
     <lb/>
     from the throne, is the first concern of his 
     <lb/>
     government. The second paragraph reports 
     <lb/>
     that, in spite of the unsettled and disruptive 
     <lb/>
     activities of international communism, the 
     <lb/>
     nations of western Europe are making pro<lb break="no"/>gress towards recovery, and that North 
     <lb/>
     America is contributing substantially to the 
     <lb/>
     restoration of economic activity, thereby 
     <lb/>
     increasing their own power to resist aggres<lb break="no"/>sion, either within or from outside. I think 
     <lb/>
     that is a statement which needs no develop<lb break="no"/>ment here. We all know that has been hap<lb break="no"/>pening, and we know how effective it has 
     <lb/>
     been. From the elections that were held in 
     <lb/>
     Italy, we know what a partial restoration of 
     <lb/>
     economic activity in that country was able 
     <lb/>
     to do in repelling aggression from within. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is said that an offensive for peace is now 
     <lb/>
     being pushed by the eastern powers. This 


            <cb/>


     has been mentioned by the communist leader 
     <lb/>
     in Italy as well as by the communist leader 
     <lb/>
     in France. If it is anything but a sham, 
     <lb/>
     those leaders have a wonderful opportunity, 
     <lb/>
     as Mr. Lippmann pointed out in an article 
     <lb/>
     which I think was in yesterday's newspaper, 
     <lb/>
     of demonstrating their sincerity. If they will 
     <lb/>
     instruct their fellows to help rather than 
     <lb/>
     resist the restoration of economic activity in 
     <lb/>
     their respective countries, then we may be 
     <lb/>
     able to believe that this peace offensive is 
     <lb/>
     more than a sham, and that it is the 
     <lb/>
     expression of some desire by the rulers of 
     <lb/>
     these totalitarian states to put an end to this 
     <lb/>
     enervating cold war that has been having 
     <lb/>
     such serious effects throughout the world. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     At home the situation is one that the speech 
     <lb/>
     comments upon as being a cause for rejoicing 
     <lb/>
     and satisfaction. Just let me put three or four 
     <lb/>
     sets of figures on record in that connection. We 
     <lb/>
     say that the economy of the country is buoy<lb break="no"/>ant. Last year the gross national production, 
     <lb/>
     according to the best available statistics, was 
     <lb/>
     $15,500,000,000 as compared with something 
     <lb/>
     of the order of $5 billion or $6 billion in the 
     <lb/>
     years which preceded the war. The present 
     <lb/>
     estimates for 1949 are $16,550,000,000. The 
     <lb/>
     salaries, wages and supplementary labour 
     <lb/>
     income for 1948, or the amounts distributed 
     <lb/>
     to wage earners and salary earners, totalled 
     <lb/>
     $7,135,000,000. The estimate for 1949 is 
     <lb/>
     $7,810,000.000. The number employed in 1948 
     <lb/>
     in civilian employments was 4,890,000 and, 
     <lb/>
     in the armed forces, 35,000. The estimate 
     <lb/>
     for 1949 is 4,966,000 in civilian employments 
     <lb/>
     and 42,000 in the armed forces. Those are 
     <lb/>
     figures which are significant of the activity 
     <lb/>
     which is prevailing in this country and they 
     <lb/>
     are, I think, a justification for the further 
     <lb/>
     statement that progress towards social justice 
     <lb/>
     for all in any country is an effective safe<lb break="no"/>guard against the effect and influence of sub<lb break="no"/>versive doctrines. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The next matter dealt with in the speech 
     <lb/>
     from the throne is the union between New<lb break="no"/>foundland and Canada. I think all hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers in this house look upon that as an 
     <lb/>
     achievement, not an achievement of mine or 
     <lb/>
     of any one of our colleagues, but rather an 
     <lb/>
     achievement of the Canadian people in bring<lb break="no"/>ing about a situation where the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland desire to become associated 
     <lb/>
     with us as one nation. It is a matter whic 
     <lb/>
     should be consummated by March 31. This 
     <lb/>
     afternoon I indicated what were the steps 
     <lb/>
     which must be completed before the union 
     <lb/>
     could become effective, and what would hap<lb break="no"/>pen if those steps were not completed by 
     <lb/>
     March 31. I think there are quite a number 
     <lb/>
     of people in Canada and perhaps quite a 
     <lb/>
     number who are not yet Canadians but who, 
     <lb/>
     under this arrangement, will become Cana<lb break="no"/>dians, who will have noted the attitude of the

     various parties in this house this afternoon 
     <lb/>
     upon this question of the union of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land with Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was suggested that, if there was any 
     <lb/>
     reason why any more time were required 
     <lb/>
     than would be available until March 31, after 
     <lb/>
     the discussion on the speech from the throne 
     <lb/>
     of all the various matters that were referred 
     <lb/>
     to by the hon. gentlemen who addressed you 
     <lb/>
     this afternoon, Mr. Speaker, and the other 
     <lb/>
     matters which you or the Deputy Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     who sat in your chair, found it would not be 
     <lb/>
     in order to discuss at this time, parliament 
     <lb/>
     should have been called together earlier. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would remind hon. members that the 
     <lb/>
     terms of union which have been tabled and 
     <lb/>
     which will be submitted to this house for its 
     <lb/>
     consideration—and, if it sees fit, for its 
     <lb/>
     approval—were not arrived at in one or two 
     <lb/>
     days. Long and protracted negotiations took 
     <lb/>
     place in order to settle those terms. Those 
     <lb/>
     terms had been preceded by a fairly full pro<lb break="no"/>posal arrived at after months of delibera<lb break="no"/>tion last year. After the proposal had been 
     <lb/>
     approved by a majority vote of the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland in a referendum, the precise 
     <lb/>
     terms were under discussion here for 
     <lb/>
     upwards of two months, and the terms were 
     <lb/>
     not finally signed until December 11. I was 
     <lb/>
     the chairman of the Canadian committee that 
     <lb/>
     had to do with the negotiations with the 
     <lb/>
     representatives from Newfoundland; and I 
     <lb/>
     regarded the completion of that undertaking 
     <lb/>
     as something of consequence to the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, yes, and possibly of consequence to 
     <lb/>
     the people of the world. I felt that, so long 
     <lb/>
     as there was any hope that we could get that 
     <lb/>
     agreement into shape to have it for sub<lb break="no"/>mission at this fifth session of the twentieth 
     <lb/>
     parliament, it was worth while working at it. 
     <lb/>
     We worked at it until December 11, and on 
     <lb/>
     that date we put our signatures to the docu<lb break="no"/>ment, subject of course to ratification by 
     <lb/>
     parliament. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     After December 11 it would have been 
     <lb/>
     rather difficult, and not very convenient for 
     <lb/>
     the members of this house, if an attempt had 
     <lb/>
     been made to get them down here before 
     <lb/>
     Christmas. They might have arrived two or 
     <lb/>
     three days before Christmas; but I do not 
     <lb/>
     believe, Mr. Speaker, that there are very 
     <lb/>
     many of them who would have felt at all 
     <lb/>
     kindly towards a government that brought 
     <lb/>
     them down here at that time.

     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: The hon. member for Peel

     He knows that parliament is not called to 
     <lb/>
     meet the day after the proclamation is issued. 
     <lb/>
     He knows that a reasonable time must elapse 
     <lb/>
     between the issuing of the proclamation and 


            <cb/>
      

     the meeting of the house. Between December 
     <lb/>
     11 and Christmas there were just fourteen 
     <lb/>
     days, or two weeks; and it would not have 
     <lb/>
     been possible to bring hon. gentlemen down 
     <lb/>
     here at that time. While the negotiations 
     <lb/>
     were going on, the attention of many members 
     <lb/>
     of the cabinet was devoted almost exclusively 
     <lb/>
     to the discussion of these terms of union.

     which has concerned the Canadian people

     ever since confederation was mooted more

     these interruptions, among others, to say

     whether it should be completed or not. It is

     my responsibility. I will not Shirk it, and I 
     <lb/>
     will not blush for the way in which I dis<lb break="no"/>charged it, in recommending to my colleagues 
     <lb/>
     the date for the opening of parliament. I 
     <lb/>
     submit that the course I followed was a 
     <lb/>
     reasonable one, and I am quite prepared at 
     <lb/>
     any time to leave it to the public of Canada 
     <lb/>
     to determine whether or not it was reasonable 
     <lb/>
     under those circumstances.

     Supreme Court of Canada the court of last 
     <lb/>
     resort for Canadians. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There have been suggestions that this is 
     <lb/>
     something which constitutes a threat to the 
     <lb/>
     autonomy or liberty of the provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ments. I had a compilation made of what 
     <lb/>
     has been happening in that regard for the 
     <lb/>
     last ten years. I asked for ten years but I 
     <lb/>
     got it for eleven. It is given from the year 
     <lb/>
     1938 to 1948 both inclusive, and, unless my 
     <lb/>
     counting is wrong, that is eleven years. There 
     <lb/>
     were fifty-five cases in which appeals were 
     <lb/>
     asserted, or sought to be asserted, from judg<lb break="no"/>ments of the Supreme Court of Canada. In 
     <lb/>
     one case the appeal was withdrawn. In five 
     <lb/>
     the appeals were allowed. In forty-nine cases 
     <lb/>
     the appeals were dismissed and the judg<lb break="no"/>ments of the Supreme Court of Canada were 
     <lb/>
     affirmed. In no one of the five cases in which 
     <lb/>
     the appeals were allowed was there any 
     <lb/>
     constitutional issue between the dominion 
     <lb/>
     and the provinces. That is the record for the 
     <lb/>
     last eleven years in these fifty-five times

     freer trade between Great Britain and the 
     <lb/>rest of the world, Great Britain and Canada<lb/>and Great Britain and the United States, and<lb/>in fact between all nations.<lb/>
            </p>

   

            <p>
     I should like to say a few words about what 
     <lb/>
     I hope will be our new sister province—New<lb break="no"/>foundland. There is something fine in this 
     <lb/>
     possibility, something great. It is expected 
     <lb/>
     that within a few months there will be inte<lb break="no"/>grated into the Canadian federation that fine, 
     <lb/>
     old colony located in the gulf of St. Lawrence. 
     <lb/>
     In my youth, which was a long time ago, 
     <lb/>
     when I was attending a small rural school I 
     <lb/>
     was always baffled that Newfoundland, which 
     <lb/>
     was so close to the American continent, geo<lb break="no"/>graphically speaking, and which was so close 
     <lb/>
     to the Canadian mainland, was not a part of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. To me the gulf of St. Lawrence 
     <lb/>
     seemed to have opened its mouth deliberately 
     <lb/>
     so that Newfoundland could come into 
     <lb/>
     Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was a proud day for us and no doubt a 
     <lb/>
     proud day for Newfoundland when by a 
     <lb/>
     majority vote they decided to come into the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian confederation. They have prob<lb break="no"/>lems of their own and in my view it is the 
     <lb/>
     duty of every Canadian worthy of the name to 
     <lb/>
     study their problems, to try to know them, 
     <lb/>
     to sympathize with them and to help them 
     <lb/>
     in arriving at a solution. I believe that the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders will fully realize what it 
     <lb/>
     means to come into the great Canadian 
     <lb/>
     federation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When this is accomplished, when New<lb break="no"/>foundland does come into the Canadian fed<lb break="no"/>eration, I hope that they will send some of 
     <lb/>
     their fine sons and daughters to Canada to 
     <lb/>
     explain to us their aspirations, their struggles 
     <lb/>
     in the past, their love, their culture and what 
     <lb/>
     they expect of the future. Then in turn 
     <lb/>
     Canada should send some of her prominent 
     <lb/>
     sons and daughters to sell and make better 
     <lb/>
     known this country to that great strategic 
     <lb/>
     island which in the future may mean so 
     <lb/>
     much to the peace of the world. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I make that suggestion in all sincerity. I 
     <lb/>
     wonder how many Canadians know the fine 
     <lb/>
     qualities of the Newfoundlander? How many 
     <lb/>
     of us know their loyalty to British traditions? 
     <lb/>
     Perhaps the same thing could be said, 
     <lb/>
     although perhaps not as forcibly, of many 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders who have never had an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity to know Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It would not be just a matter of selling one 
     <lb/>
     to the other; it would be a matter of interest<lb break="no"/>ing our population and making them realize 
     <lb/>
     what a wonderful asset there is in having 
     <lb/>
     that fine sentinel between Greenland, Europe, 
     <lb/>
     and the Canadian mainland—a sentinel to 
     <lb/>
     guard us against things that may happen in 
     <lb/>
     the future, which have never happened in 
     <lb/>
     the past. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   

            <cb/>
 

            <p>
     I make this plea very sincerely. This is 
     <lb/>
     not just a political question; it is bigger than 
     <lb/>
     that. I hope that the moment Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     comes into confederation Canada will choose 
     <lb/>
     half a dozen of her sons and daughters who 
     <lb/>
     are well qualified, and that Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     will do the same. There are in each country 
     <lb/>
     many intelligent men and women—who will 
     <lb/>
     visit the other to tell them of their own. We 
     <lb/>
     love these people already because they belong 
     <lb/>
     to the British family of nations. We want 
     <lb/>
     them to come here to tell us of their aspira<lb break="no"/>tions, of their problems, of the things that 
     <lb/>
     they expect from the Canadian confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     It is true they will have to make sacrifices 
     <lb/>
     in order to enter confederation, but the same 
     <lb/>
     will also apply to us. We must be ready and 
     <lb/>
     willing to try to understand them, and to 
     <lb/>
     have respect for their traditions and ideals. 
     <lb/>
     Let us not get away from the fact that in the 
     <lb/>
     past Newfoundland has been a real sentinel 
     <lb/>
     of the British empire on this continent, and 
     <lb/>
     will remain faithful in its loyalty in the 
     <lb/>
     future.

            <p>
     I want to say a word or two about the 
     <lb/>
     St. Lawrence waterway. As a person who 
     <lb/>
     represents a section of Canada that, geograph<lb break="no"/>ically speaking, is really central, I may say 
     <lb/>
     that we are open-minded as far as the St. 
     <lb/>
     Lawrence waterway is concerned. The po<lb break="no"/>tential hydro power is needed at the present 
     <lb/>
     time in the province of Ontario. I do not say 
     <lb/>
     that in a critical way. It is because of the 
     <lb/>
     progress that industry has made. in the prov<lb break="no"/>ince. There are also the factors of immi<lb break="no"/>gration and transportation. I feel somewhat 
     <lb/>
     reticent about discussing the problem because, 
     <lb/>
     under Sir Wilfrid Laurier, a national rail link 
     <lb/>
     was built between the maritimes and Win<lb break="no"/>nipeg out of the federal treasury. Today, 
     <lb/>
     west of the town of Hearst, with one of the 
     <lb/>
     finest roadbeds on the North American con<lb break="no"/>tinent, the rails are practically rusty. We 
     <lb/>
     are in favour of the development of the St. 
     <lb/>
     Lawrence waterway because it is a necessity. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The United States and Canada are friendly 
     <lb/>
     nations and we should have no difficulty on 
     <lb/>
     that project. But, in saying that, I want to 
     <lb/>
     protest against a situation which has been 
     <lb/>
     allowed to exist for many years in regard to 
     <lb/>
     that fine national link between Quebec city 
     <lb/>
     and Winnipeg. It is practically unused at the 
     <lb/>
     present time. You have there a potential 
     <lb/>
     that should be used winter and summer. Why 
     <lb/>
     it is not is past my comprehension. It is true 
     <lb/>
     that when the national transcontinental line 
     <lb/>
     was built north from Quebec, and out through 
     <lb/>
     the wilds of northern Quebec and northern 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, they thought that there was nothing 
     <lb/>
     but muskeg. Then they found the area con<lb break="no"/>tained the finest natural resources, and today 
     <lb/>
     it is the real treasure house of Canada. From 
     <lb/>
     Quebec city to fifty miles west of the town [...]
