               Besides the Government were not responsible

               for any newspaper statement.

               The Committee reserved the item $40,000 
               <lb/>
               to meet the possible amount beyond the aver<lb break="no"/>age salaries voted. The items under the head 
               <lb/>
               Administration of Justice, amounting to $52,<lb break="no"/>000, were also carried; as well as the items 
               <lb/>
               under the head of Police $43,440; and under 
               <lb/>
               the head Legislation, as far as "Commission 
               <lb/>
               for making provisions for the uniformity of 
               <lb/>
               the laws of the Provinces, $20,000.

               In explanation of the item, Sir John A. 
               <lb/>
               Macdonald said the sum set apart for the 
               <lb/>
               Assimiliation of the Laws was about the same 
               <lb/>
               as that voted for the CodiÔ¨Åcation of the Laws 
               <lb/>
               of the old Province of Canada. It was in<lb break="no"/>tended that the sittings of the Commission 
               <lb/>
               should be as continuous as possible, so that 
               <lb/>
               by next session the laws of the three Provin<lb break="no"/>ces, and possibly also of Newfoundland, 
               <lb/>
               would all be assimilated.
