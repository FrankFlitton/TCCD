               Sir George E. Cartier said there was nothing

               the people of Lower Canada disliked so much

               <br />

               that cases of this kind should be tried by the

               Mr. Blake said the correct deduction from 
               <br />
               the premises of the Minister of Militia that the 
               <br />
               people of Lower Canada abhorred fraud 
               <br />

               <br />
               the power of trying cases of fraud. He dis- 
               <br />
               sented from the doctrine of the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice, that only the members from Lower 
               <br />
               Canada should discuss this clause. He (Mr. 
               <br />
               Blake) held it was a matter of consequence to 
               <br />

               troduced dissimilarity between the procedure

               <br />

               tween the mode of trial of criminal cases in 
               <br />
               Quebec under this Act, and the trial of other 
               <br />

               <br />
               jury was required.
