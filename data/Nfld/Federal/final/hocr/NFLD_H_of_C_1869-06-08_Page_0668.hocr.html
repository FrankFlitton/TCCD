               Mr. Rymal—He would admit George Brown 
               <br />
               controlled Upper Canada then, but at the 
               <br />
               same time he was acting under the Knight 
               <br />
               of Kingston. (Hear, hear.) He deprecated 
               <br />
               departures from the Quebec agreement. The 
               <br />
               Member for Cumberland (Dr. Tupper) had 
               <br />
               spoken last session of that agreement being 
               <br />
               quite fair and just to Nova Scotia, and that 
               <br />
               it would only be opposed by demagogues like 
               <br />
               the member for Hants. (Laughter.) The past 
               <br />
               records of the latter gentleman had secured 
               <br />
               him a place in his (the speaker’s) heart, and 
               <br />
               he thought last session Mr. Howe had been 
               <br />
               animated by a love for his country. But 
               <br />
               what would he say now? (laughter.) He would 
               <br />
               not hurl a shaft between the joints of his 
               <br />
               harness, as he was made familiar with Mr. 
               <br />
               Howe’s name and doings at his father’s ﬁre- 
               <br />
               side during dark days in Colonial history; but 
               <br />
               he must, nevertheless, say that last year he 
               <br />
               thought that gentleman did not object so 
               <br />
               much to Confederation on acount of ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               considerations as in consequence of the lia- 
               <br />
               bilities of his country being rather many. But 
               <br />
               when he secured better terms, he had changed 
               <br />
               his position to a supporter of union, and he 
               <br />
               (Mr. R.) was delighted with the change, but 
               <br />
               particularly on his friend’s own account. 
               <br />
               (Laughter.) We should consider where all 
               <br />
               these concessions were landing us. Our debt 
               <br />
               was getting oppressive. All the inventions of 
               <br />
               the Minister of Finance were unavailing to 
               <br />
               meet our necessities, and yet, day after day 
               <br />
               the Government offered fresh schemes of 
               <br />
               expenditure. Financial ruin could not be 
               <br />
               averted by any country beyond a certain line, 
               <br />
               and if ruin came to the Dominion he believed 
               <br />
               it would be ﬁnancial. If we went on trying 
               <br />
               to walk before we could stand, to trot before 
               <br />
               we could walk, and race before we could trot, 
               <br />
               we would never become a consolidated and 
               <br />
               great people. (Hear, hear.) Poverty generally 
               <br />
               fails to command respect and if by extrava-<br />
               gance the Dominion became poverty-stricken, 
               <br />
               we would fail to command the respect of our 
               <br />
               neighbours. Mr. Rymal went on to say that 
               <br />
               he had proposed calling this his Financial 
               <br />
               statement, (laughter) having a tendency to 
               <br />
               ﬁgures. He did not think the ﬁgures he had 
               <br />
               given could be contradicted—even Mr. Rose, 
               <br />
               or his chief assistant, could not show them to 
               <br />
               be wrong. He had taken a fair basis, and if 
               <br />
               injustice had been suffered by Ontario, and 
               <br />
               also by Quebec to some extent, why seek 
               <br />
               more eastern allies to draw the last drop of 
               <br />
               blood from us? The Member for Cornwall 
               <br />
               (Sandﬁeld Macdonald) had given his views of 
               <br />
               Confederation before it was carried. He 
               <br />
               would read a short extract from his speech. 
               <br />
               Speaking of the Coalition Government of that 
               <br />
               day, that gentleman prophesied they would
