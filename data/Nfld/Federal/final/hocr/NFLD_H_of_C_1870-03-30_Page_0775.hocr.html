               Everything asked for would be given, just as 
               <br />
               was done in 1841, when everything asked for 
               <br />
               was given at once, and all the changes at once 
               <br />

               attack upon the Constitution was useless, 
               <br />

               <br />
               ton. He did not know how he was going to vote, 
               <br />

               <br />
               would vote against all his recorded opinions. 
               <br />
               He declared that the salary to the Governor, 
               <br />
               fixed at £10,000, was an infringement on the 
               <br />

               Mr. Mackenzie said it was a mistake of the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice if he thought he would 
               <br />

               motion. He was amused by hearing the Minis-

               <br />
               was less familiar than with the Statute Book.

               He charged the member for West Durham with
