               Sir George E. Cartier, in moving the third 
               <br />
               reading of the Bill respecting Patents of In- 
               <br />
               vention, said he had decided to accept the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst amendment of which Mr. Blake had given 
               <br />
               notice, which was as follows:—“That there be 
               <br />
               added to the 33rd clause the words follow- 
               <br />
               ing—‘Provided always that if application shall 
               <br />
               be made by any other person for a patent for 
               <br />
               any invention or discovery with which such 
               <br />
               caveat may in any respect interfere, it shall 
               <br />
               be the duty of the Commissioner forthwith 
               <br />
               to give notice by mail to the person who has 
               <br />
               ﬁled such caveat, and such person shall within 
               <br />
               three months after the date of mailing the 
               <br />
               notice, if he would avail himself of the caveat, 
               <br />
               ﬁle his petition, and take other steps neces- 
               <br />
               sary on an application for patent, and if in 
               <br />
               the opinion of the Commissioner the appli- 
               <br />
               cations are interfering, like proceedings may 
               <br />
               be had in all respects as by this Act provided 
               <br />
               in the case of interfering applications. Pro- 
               <br />
               vided further that, unless the person ﬁling 
               <br />
               any caveat shall, within four years from 
               <br />
               ﬁling thereof, have made application for a 
               <br />
               patent, the caveat shall be void.” He could 
               <br />
               not, however, accept the other amendment of 
               <br />
               which the hon. gentleman had given notice. 
               <br />
               That there be added, as a subsection of the 
               <br />
               37th clause, the words following “no decision 
               <br />
               of arbitration shall preclude any person in- 
               <br />
               terested in favour of or against the validity 
               <br />
               of any patent from his right to assert or con- 
               <br />
               test the same in any Court in which its val- 
               <br />
               idity may come in question.” This clause 
               <br />
               merely provided for Ministerial duty and did 
               <br />
               not give the patentee any right which might 
               <br />
               not be conferred on him under the patent, 
               <br />
               and there was, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">therefore,</span> no necessity for 
               <br />
               making the reserve suggested.
