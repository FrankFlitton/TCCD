               position. Her exports for a number of years 
               <br />
               had always been larger than her imports, but 
               <br />
               the character of her population and of her 
               <br />
               industries was such that she furnished a 
               <br />
               market for the surplus products of the rest of 
               <br />
               the Dominion. The population of Newfound- 
               <br />
               land was wholly a consuming population, 
               <br />
               raising nothing and manufacturing nothing.

               They were wholly a consuming population, 
               <br />
               engaged in maritime pursuits. The following 
               <br />
               were some of the leading articles of import:— 
               <br />
               Flour, 200,000 bbls; Indian meal, 40,000 bbls; 
               <br />
               biscuit, 50,000 cwt; butter, 1,500,000 lbs; 
               <br />
               cheese 100,000 lbs; oatmeal, 4,000 bbls; peas, 
               <br />
               4,000 bbls; manufactured tobacco, 1,000,000 
               <br />
               lbs; woollen blankets, cloths, leather, etc., 
               <br />
               $1,500,000. The great bulk of the importations 
               <br />
               were the products in which other portions of 
               <br />
               Canada abounded, and which we could sup- 
               <br />
               ply, and she would furnish a market not only 
               <br />
               for our agricultural products, but for our 
               <br />
               woollen and other manufactures.

               Hon. Mr. Rose said they had struck him 
               <br />
               as rather large. The articles he had just men- 
               <br />
               tioned, he continued, constituted the great bulk 
               <br />
               of the imports of Newfoundland, and almost 
               <br />
               every one of them could be supplied by the 
               <br />
               other portions of the Dominion. Then the sea- 
               <br />
               faring population which Newfoundland would 
               <br />
               add to the Union would be very valuable.

               France had long shown her appreciation of 
               <br />
               such a body of men by the bounty which she 
               <br />
               gave her ﬁshermen. She gave $2 on each quin- 
               <br />
               tal of ﬁsh taken, or a total bounty of about a 
               <br />
               quarter of a million sterling. (Hear.) He now 
               <br />
               desired to say a word or two regarding the 
               <br />
               exports of that Colony. The last returns give 
               <br />
               the total exports at about $5,000,000 and a 
               <br />
               little over, of which $1,500,000 went to the 
               <br />
               United States, and over $3,000,000 to England; 
               <br />
               $70,000 direct to Spain, $800,000 direct to Por- 
               <br />
               tugal, and $70,000 direct to Brazil. Now, what 
               <br />
               the Dominion needs is variety of markets. 
               <br />
               Here we can secure three outlets. To show the 
               <br />
               trade we might look forward to with this 
               <br />
               colony, the honourable gentleman stated the 
               <br />
               sources from whence the principal articles con- 
               <br />
               sumed there were at present imported. Out of

               their entire $5,500,000 of imports of last year, 
               <br />
               $1,500,000 came from the United States, in-

               cluding and principally composed of the very 
               <br />
               articles he had just now enumerated—ﬂour, 
               <br />
               butter, cheese, and such articles as we pro- 
               <br />
               duce. About one-third of a million came from 
               <br />
               Hamburg, and consisted of butter, lard, bis-
