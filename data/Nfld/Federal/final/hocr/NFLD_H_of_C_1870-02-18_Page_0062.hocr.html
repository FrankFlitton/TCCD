               these lands, and this was the view of the people 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland. With regard to the accession 
               <br />
               of the North West, he did not intend to enter 
               <br />
               upon a discussion of a personal nature, but he 
               <br />
               had heard reports respecting language said to 
               <br />
               have been used by the Hon. Secretary of State, 
               <br />
               which he must characterize as unwise in the 
               <br />
               extreme, and unworthy of his position as the 
               <br />
               delegate of Canada to that country. These 
               <br />
               reported expressions were only in entire 
               <br />
               accordance with his (Mr. Howe’s) utterances 
               <br />
               in this House, where he had said that the single 
               <br />
               State of Minnesota could turn out more men in 
               <br />

               <br />
               take and keep possession of this Country. The 
               <br />
               indulgence of such expressions and sentiments 
               <br />
               was not part of wisdom or statesmanship, or 
               <br />
               prudence, especially on the part of a minister 
               <br />
               of the Crown. The hon. gentleman must have 
               <br />
               known something of the condition of the coun-

               <br />
               had taken no opportunity of giving any infor-

               mation to Mr. McDougall. He had not

               endeavoured to intercept Mr. McDougall, to 
               <br />
               give him information, but had allowed him to 
               <br />
               go on to Pembina, where he played such a 
               <br />
               wretched and humiliating part. He had seen

               <br />
