               <br />
               desire, he would not make a speech. He felt 
               <br />
               bound to say, however, that so far as he 
               <br />
               could judge from the papers which had been

               published, he conceived we had nothing 
               <br />
               whatever to congratulate ourselves upon 
               <br />
               in the result of the mission to England. 
               <br />

               <br />
               should acquire it; but he must say, so far as 
               <br />
               he could judge from these papers, that our 
               <br />
               case had been most deplorably mismanaged. 
               <br />
               We had now, perhaps, an opportunity of 
               <br />
               getting that Territory; but it was on terms
