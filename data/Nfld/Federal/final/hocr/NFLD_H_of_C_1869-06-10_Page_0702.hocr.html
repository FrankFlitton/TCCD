               Sir John A. Macdonald said if he believed 
               <br />
               Mr. Blake’s amendment carried out the views 
               <br />
               expressed by the hon. gentleman who had just 
               <br />
               sat down he would almost be disposed to 
               <br />
               accept it, but he looked upon it as intended to 
               <br />
               defeat the whole scheme for union with New- 
               <br />
               foundland. The hon. gentleman had himself 
               <br />
               stated that he moved it as an amendment to 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst resolution because, if carried, it 
               <br />
               would alter entirely the basis of the arrange- 
               <br />
               ment. The hon. gentleman said he would 
               <br />
               rather give the $150,000 and not take the 
               <br />
               lands, than give the $150,000 and take the 
               <br />
               lands; but he took care not to place it in his 
               <br />
               amendment, and if the amendment carried, 
               <br />
               and the Government proposed to increase the 
               <br />
               subsidy by $150,000, there would be another 
               <br />
               amendment declaring that any such proposi- 
               <br />
               tion would be an injustice to the other Prov-

               Sir John A. Macdonald was glad to hear 
               <br />
               that the hon. gentleman was in favour of the 
               <br />
               $150,000, but there were others who enter- 
               <br />
               tained different views. They had heard the 
               <br />
               member for Wellington South declare that he 
               <br />
               was not now bound by the agreement of the 
               <br />
               Quebec Conference. It was evident that in 
               <br />
               bringing forward this amendment the member 
               <br />
               for West Durham had been put upon by others 
               <br />
               who were not so sincere in bringing about the 
               <br />
               admission of Newfoundland on these terms. 
               <br />
               Newfoundland was situated differently from 
               <br />
               the other provinces. She had no internal re- 
               <br />
               sources; her wealth was mainly derived from 
               <br />
               the sea; and when these resources failed them 
               <br />
               they had no agricultural wealth to fall back 
               <br />
               upon like the other provinces. Therefore there 
               <br />
               was in this respect a necessity for Newfound-<br />
               land to have some definite and certain source 
               <br />
               of revenue from her crown lands. If the lands 
               <br />
               remained in the possession of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               they had not the means of developing them; 
               <br />
               but if they were handed over to the Dominion 
               <br />
               something could undoubtedly be made out of 
               <br />
               them. A Mr. Bennett owned a mile square of 
               <br />
               land in the region of the copper mines and he 
               <br />
               had refused £250,000 sterling for it, and there 
               <br />
               was positive evidence that at least three other 
               <br />
               square miles were of equal value. Newfound- 
               <br />
               land was not able to open up these lands, but 
               <br />
               the Dominion was in a different position and 
               <br />
               was able to take means to ascertain what the 
               <br />
               wealth of the land and minerals was. The 
               <br />
               Province it would be observed, retained the 
               <br />
               power of determining within a year, whether 
               <br />
               it will relieve us of the payment of this
