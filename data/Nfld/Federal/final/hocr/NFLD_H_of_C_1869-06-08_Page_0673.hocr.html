               the lands and mines of Newfoundland paying 
               <br />
               a certain sum therefor: it was not now open 
               <br />
               to this House to go back from that arrange- 
               <br />
               ment. The reason why this arrangement was 
               <br />
               made was that Newfoundland had no sources 
               <br />
               of local revenue, and it became necessary to 
               <br />
               make special provision in this way for its local 
               <br />
               services. He believed the mineral wealth of 
               <br />
               that Island was very great and only wanted 
               <br />
               the application of capital to be proﬁtably 
               <br />
               developed. Suppose it was possible to drive 
               <br />
               a harder bargain with the gentleman repre- 
               <br />
               senting Newfoundland, he did not think it 
               <br />
               was desirable to do so, as it was very im- 
               <br />
               portant that they should come into the Union

               satisﬁed with the future opening up to them. 
               <br />
               The member for Lambton had spoken of this 
               <br />
               matter as a marriage. If so, if we were about 
               <br />
               to make a matrimonial arrangement with this 
               <br />
               fair bride of the ocean, we should not haggle 
               <br />
               about the pin-money. He regretted to ﬁnd the 
               <br />
               strong Province of Ontario presenting the 
               <br />
               View it had presented tonight. He thought it 
               <br />
               could afford to take a more generous course. 
               <br />
               Gentlemen from all the other Provinces had, 
               <br />
               without hesitation, declared their willingness 
               <br />
               to vote what was necessary to enlarge our
