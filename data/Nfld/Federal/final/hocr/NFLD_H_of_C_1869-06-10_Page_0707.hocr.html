               in the case of Newfoundland. The conclusion, 
               <br />
               therefore, was inevitable, that it would be a 
               <br />
               wrong policy on the part of the Dominion to 
               <br />
               seek to acquire these lands. He was prepared 
               <br />
               to give whatever sum was necessary, on a fair

               calculation, to carry on the Local Government 
               <br />

               assume the responsibility of these lands in 
               <br />

               Mr. Mackenzie said that in 1865 the leader 
               <br />
               of the Government brought down the scheme 
               <br />
               representing it as in the nature of a treaty, 
               <br />
               which must be accepted in its entirety or set 
               <br />
               aside. There were various parts of it which 
               <br />
               he did not like; but, on account of these repre- 
               <br />
               sentations he felt bound to support it as a 
               <br />
               whole. But now this matter came up as a 
               <br />
               substantial proposition, and he considered the 
               <br />
               House was at liberty to deal with it as it 
               <br />
               chose. He repeated that he was willing to 
               <br />
               assume the responsibility of giving whatever 
               <br />
               money was necessary, but he did not wish to 
               <br />
               assume the responsibility of taking the lands. 
               <br />
               He did not anticipate that the revenue would 
               <br />
               be so great as had been represented by the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance. But he was willing to set 
               <br />
               aside all considerations except one. that this 
               <br />
               was a British Colony which it was desirable 
               <br />
               to incorporate into our Union, and with that 
               <br />
               view he was willing to agree to any reason- 
               <br />
               able terms. He desired, however, that these 
               <br />
               terms should be subjected to deliberate exami- 
               <br />
               nation and discussion in this House, and that 
               <br />
               they should be so satisfactory to both parties, 
               <br />
               that no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difficulties</span> should hereafter arise
