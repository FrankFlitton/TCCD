               Ontario at all events would not have accepted 
               <br />
               the Act. The Premier and the Minister of 
               <br />
               Public Works had taken ground to-night as 
               <br />
               to the position we occupied with reference to 
               <br />
               conclusions arrived at by the Quebec Con- 
               <br />
               ference. The Minister of Public Works said it 
               <br />
               would be an act of gross bad faith if we 
               <br />
               should recede to any extent whatever from 
               <br />
               the resolutions of that Conference. That 
               <br />
               ground might be tenable as applied to an act 
               <br />
               already consummated; it would be an act of 
               <br />
               bad faith for any of the Provinces to seek to 
               <br />
               alter any of the terms of Union between the 
               <br />
               Provinces united by the British North Ameri- 
               <br />
               can Act. For this Parliament to take upon 
               <br />
               itself to abrogate any of the articles of Union 
               <br />
               between the four Provinces established by- 
               <br />
               that Act would be to be guilty of gross bad 
               <br />
               faith. It would be to assume duties never 
               <br />
               designed to be committed by the Imperial 
               <br />
               Parliament to this House. But the very thing 
               <br />
               which these hon. gentlemen were representing 
               <br />
               as a departure from good faith by gentlemen 
               <br />
               on his (Mr. Mackenzie’s) side of the House, 
               <br />
               was now being attempted by those hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen themselves in its very worst possible 
               <br />
               aspect. On his side of the House, they only 
               <br />
               proposed to void one of the conditions agreed 
               <br />
               to with reference to a Colony which did not 
               <br />
               choose to accept the conditions then offered 
               <br />
               them; but hon. gentlemen opposite proposed 
               <br />
               to change the conditions on which one of the 
               <br />
               Provinces now had an existence as a member 
               <br />
               of this Confederation, and that not only by 
               <br />
               the authority which created the Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion, but by an Act of this Parliament. (Hear.) 
               <br />
               It did not lie in the mouth of hon. gentlemen, 
               <br />
               who proposed so extraordinary a measure as 
               <br />
               that, to accuse the member for West Durham 
               <br />
               and those who supported him in this matter, 
               <br />
               of being guilty of bad faith. (Hear.) Those 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen, when in London, had agreed 
               <br />
               to granting additional subsidies to the Prov- 
               <br />
               inces, a matter which was not in the Que- 
               <br />
               bec resolutions. They agreed to give Ontario 
               <br />
               an additional subsidy at the rate of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">5 3/4</span> cents 
               <br />
               per head; Quebec 6c; Nova Scotia 10c, and 
               <br />
               New Brunswick 19c per head; and now they 
               <br />
               asked the House to agree to another departure 
               <br />
               from the scheme of the Quebec Conference, 
               <br />
               by giving an additional subsidy to Newfound- 
               <br />
               land of 28c per head; and yet, because hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen on his side thought it would be 
               <br />
               better that the Crown Lands of the Colony 
               <br />
               should be left in the hands of the Local 
               <br />
               Authorities, they were accused of endeavour- 
               <br />
               ing to break up the compact entered into at 
               <br />
               Quebec. Nothing could be more absurd. He 
               <br />
               was quite willing to confer with the repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives of Newfoundland in order to ascer- 
               <br />
               tain from them what was necessary for that
