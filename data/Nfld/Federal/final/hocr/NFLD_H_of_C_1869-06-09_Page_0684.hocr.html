               <br />
               light on this subject. Before discussing the 
               <br />
               clauses of the Bill the Committee resolved to 
               <br />
               come to a decision on one or more leading 
               <br />
               points which permeated the Bill. Among 
               <br />
               these was the question—shall the exception of 
               <br />
               the Province of Quebec from the ruling that 
               <br />
               this law should be applicable to traders and 
               <br />
               non-traders be continued, or shall the law be 
               <br />
               applicable to all the Provinces not excepting 
               <br />
               Quebec? And as the honourable member for 
               <br />
               Peel said, it was never intended to change the 
               <br />
               position of the non-trader from that then pre- 
               <br />
               vailing in Upper Canada. The fact was, that if 
               <br />
               non-traders were to come under the operation 
               <br />
               of the 15th clause the Bill would simply be 
               <br />
               converted into a summary process of forcing a 
               <br />
               man to pay his debts, and such a thing was 
               <br />
               never contemplated by the Committee.

               could not apply in the case of the non-trader.

               If further legislation were needed, let each

               there was no reason for including non-traders

               in the Bill. The creditors do not require the
