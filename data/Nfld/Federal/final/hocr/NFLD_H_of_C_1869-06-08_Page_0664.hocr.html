               minion, and Newfoundland so far, is entitled 
               <br />
               to have an equivalent allowed her. The 
               <br />
               Minister of Militia and the Minister of Fi- 
               <br />
               nance have spoken of the large amount of 
               <br />
               revenue collected in Newfoundland—being 
               <br />
               nearly ﬁve dollars per capita. How much of 
               <br />
               this is collected on breadstuffs that will pay 
               <br />
               nothing after Confederation? Newfoundland 
               <br />
               imports nearly everything she consumes. 
               <br />
               Every thing imported pays a high duty and 
               <br />
               if that intercolonial trade springs up of which 
               <br />
               the Minister of Finance has spoken, the re- 
               <br />
               venue collected there after the union must 
               <br />
               greatly diminish. (Hear, hear.) Now it was 
               <br />
               the bounden duty of the Minister of Fi- 
               <br />
               nance, in coming down to the House to 
               <br />
               show what amount of revenue would be col- 
               <br />
               lected there under the Canadian tariff. He 
               <br />
               has told us Newfoundland imports largely, 
               <br />
               ﬁour, beef, butter and biscuits, which in 
               <br />
               future she will purchase from Ontario; that 
               <br />
               she purchases a large quantity of woolen 
               <br />
               goods, and these she will buy from the Cana- 
               <br />
               dian manufacturers. Well, sir, admit this 
               <br />
               and what follows? Why, that upon a large 
               <br />
               portion of her imports, upon which now a 
               <br />
               duty is paid, no duty in future will be col- 
               <br />
               lected, and by so much the revenue of New- 
               <br />
               foundland is diminished. (Hear, hear.) What 
               <br />
               of that, asks the Minister of Militia, if the 
               <br />
               people of Ontario ﬁnd a market for their 
               <br />
               breadstuﬂs? They can afford to pay. Well, 
               <br />
               sir, I confess this is a new doctrine in political 
               <br />
               economy. There is to be no duty on bread- 
               <br />
               stuffs. If the people of Newfoundland can 
               <br />
               buy ﬂour for less in Boston than in Montreal 
               <br />
               they will buy in Boston. They will buy 
               <br />
               where they can buy cheapest; there is to be 
               <br />
               no restriction. Now, who does that benefit; 
               <br />
               is it not the people of Newfoundland? The 
               <br />
               doctrine of economists is that restrictions on 
               <br />
               trade increases prices to the consumer. The 
               <br />
               removal of such, then, must benefit New- 
               <br />
               foundland. Why then should we, of all the 
               <br />
               world, be compelled to pay ten or ﬁfteen per 
               <br />
               cent, for the privilege of trading? (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) My honorable friend from West Durham 
               <br />
               has conclusively shown that we must pay, un- 
               <br />
               der the proposed system to Newfoundland an 
               <br />
               amount largely in excess of what we receive; 
               <br />
               and as yet nothing has been said to justify 
               <br />
               such a proceeding that will bear a moment’s 
               <br />
               examination. As to the trade in coarse 
               <br />
               woollen goods being diverted to Canada. I be- 
               <br />
               lieve that will prove entirely illusory and for 
               <br />
               reason that I shall not at this moment dis- 
               <br />
               cuss. I shall ask the committee for a short 
               <br />
               time to consider the effect of the ﬁfth reso- 
               <br />
               lution. It is proposed to assume the Crown 
               <br />
