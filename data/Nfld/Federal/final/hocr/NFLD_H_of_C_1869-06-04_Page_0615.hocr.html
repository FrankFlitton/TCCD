               the Whole on the resolutions respecting Prince

               Edward Island. Those resolutions, of course,

               the seaboard at least. The Island was owned 
               <br />
               by some 62 individuals, to whom it was origi-

               Mr. Mackenzie thought the hon. Finance 
               <br />
               Minister ought to have informed the House 
               <br />
               what correspondence there had been with the 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island Government or any one 
               <br />
               else respecting so extraordinary a proposition. 
               <br />
               By whom was the correspondence originated? 
               <br />
               It was very desirable indeed that Prince Ed- 
               <br />
               ward Island should join the Confederation, 
               <br />
               and any reasonable proposition leading to 
               <br />
               that end would receive his cordial assent; but 
               <br />
               it was quite possible that the annexation of 
               <br />
               this Island might be purchased too dearly. In 
               <br />
               its present shape the proposition was just 
               <br />
               another Seignorial Tenure business, and one 
               <br />
               he would have nothing to do with.

               Sir John A. Macdonald said there had been

               no correspondence with the Government, or 
               <br />

               Edward Island into the Union had been fre- 
               <br />
               quently debated. The terms proposed on both 
               <br />

               <br />
               canvassed again when we go down. It was 
               <br />
               clearly worth while for the Government of 
               <br />

               Prince Edward Island, the last fraction of
