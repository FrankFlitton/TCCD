               <br />
               at their present conclusion. As to the sum the 
               <br />
               Dominion would lose, he did not think any- 
               <br />
               thing like what honourable gentlemen oppo- 
               <br />
               site imagined. Calculations carefully made of 
               <br />
               the whole imports of 1867, under the Canadian 
               <br />
               tariff as it stands, but omitting what was 
               <br />
               imported that year from New Brunswick, 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia, Quebec, and Ontario, showed the 
               <br />
               amount to be $663,393.63.

               Mr. Mackenzie wished the details. This was 
               <br />
               an important statement and might have an 
               <br />
               important effect on the House.

               Hon. Mr. Tilley said the statement was not 
               <br />
               made on his authority but on good authority, 
               <br />
               and he would hand in the paper with the 
               <br />
               details. Again it had to be borne in mind that 
               <br />
               previous to Union the tariff of Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               which was lower than that of any of the Prov- 
               <br />
               inces at that time, yielded more in proportion 
               <br />
               than any other Province in the Dominion. If 
               <br />
               that continued to be the case, and if even 
               <br />
               under the higher tariff of Canada it yielded $4 
               <br />
               per head as might be fairly expected, that 
               <br />
               would amount to nearly $600,000. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman argued that under no circumstances 
               <br />
               could the loss be very great, and proceeded to 
               <br />
               look at the question from another point of 
               <br />
               View. Take, he said, the whole of the butter, 
               <br />
               biscuit, and other products of Canada as well 
               <br />
               as her manufactures to a large extent, and 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd that even though large reductions in 
               <br />
               the imports of woollens and leather should 
               <br />
               take place in Newfoundland, there would still 
               <br />
               be left $525,000. If this were the case certainly 
               <br />
               the loss of the Dominion could not be very 
               <br />
               great. Another calculation was this: Apply the 
               <br />
               tariff of last session to the imports of 1867 
               <br />
               and it gives $219,185.48. The inference is that 
               <br />
               after Confederation, inasmuch as there is no 
               <br />
               doubt that they will continue to consume more 
               <br />
               goods than in Canada, we will still be left a 
               <br />
               handsome sum coming into the Treasury 
               <br />
               annually from that Island. The hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man next defended Newfoundland from the 
               <br />
               accusation recently made. He denied that 
               <br />
               Newfoundland was a pauper community and 
               <br />
               showed from her banking returns that not 
               <br />
               only did the masses of the people deposit 
               <br />
               more largely in Banks than was the case in 
               <br />
               the other Provinces of the Dominion, but that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> general condition of the trading commu- 
               <br />
               nity was healthful. During 18 years in business 
               <br />
               in St. John’s, Newfoundland, the Bank of 
               <br />
               British North America never lost a dollar. He 
               <br />
               noticed the fact that almhouses and similar 
               <br />
               institutions were supported by the Legislature, 
               <br />
               but that last year they had abolished all 
               <br />
               grants to able-bodied poor. He also noticed 
               <br />
               the economy in the administration of affairs,
