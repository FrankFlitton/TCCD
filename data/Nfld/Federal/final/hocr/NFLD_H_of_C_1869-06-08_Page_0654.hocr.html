               sought to carry it to a conclusion. On a 
               <br />
               question so important, he should give the 
               <br />
               whole details that were involved in the ar- 
               <br />
               rangement under which it was proposed to 
               <br />
               incorporate the Province of Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               so that members might have an intelligent 
               <br />
               understanding of the whole matter, and 
               <br />
               know What they would probably have to pay 
               <br />
               for Newfoundland, and what they would 
               <br />
               probably derive from it, so that they might 
               <br />
               understand whether the bargain was a fair or 
               <br />
               an unfair one. The Finance Minister answered 
               <br />
               this by saying that they were merely con- 
               <br />
               summating the proposition which was made 
               <br />
               at the Quebec Conference. He (Mr. Blake) 
               <br />
               apprehended that this House could not be held 
               <br />
               as bound by any propositions made at the 
               <br />
               Quebec Conference, which were not then as- 
               <br />
               sented to, because certain terms were then 
               <br />
               laid down of which many members of this 
               <br />
               House might not approve, for the admission 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island, 
               <br />
               and which were not accepted by these 
               <br />
               Colonies. This House was not to be bound 
               <br />
               for all time to come to incorporate Newfound- 
               <br />
               land and Prince Edward Island on these terms. 
               <br />
               This was entirely a new proposition for the 
               <br />
               admission of Newfoundland, and the House 
               <br />
               were entitled to discuss and ascertain the 
               <br />
               justice or injustice of the terms on which it 
               <br />
               was now proposed that it should enter the 
               <br />
               Union. Nor were the terms the same. They 
               <br />
               differed in very important and material 
               <br />
               respects from those offered at the Quebec Con- 
               <br />
               ference. The present aspect of the question 
               <br />
               also differed very materially from its aspect 
               <br />
               at that time. Then it was a question whether 
               <br />
               Confederation could at all be accomplished, 
               <br />
               and the interests of the various Provinces had 
               <br />
               to be consulted so as to get a scheme under 
               <br />
               which the subsidies to the various local Legis- 
               <br />
               latures should be based on some uniform 
               <br />
               principle. As regards Newfoundland, there 
               <br />
               was an exceptional arrangement that she 
               <br />
               should sell her Crown Lands to the Dominion 
               <br />
               and receive a large annual sum for them. A 
               <br />
               reason for that existed then which did not 
               <br />
               exist now. It was necessary in order not to 
               <br />
               interfere with the apparent but delusive sym- 
               <br />
               metry of the plan as to subsidies. That sym- 
               <br />
               metry was destroyed when it was agreed by 
               <br />
               the delegates to give Ô¨Åxed subsidies of varying 
               <br />
               amounts to the four Provinces not in propor- 
               <br />
               tion to their populations. These special sub- 
               <br />
               sidies would amount to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">5 1/2</span> cents per head for 
               <br />
               Ontario, 6 cents for Quebec, 18 cents to Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia, 19 cents to New Brunswick, and the 
               <br />
               special subsidy now proposed to be given to 
               <br />
               Newfoundland would be 28 cents per head 
               <br />
