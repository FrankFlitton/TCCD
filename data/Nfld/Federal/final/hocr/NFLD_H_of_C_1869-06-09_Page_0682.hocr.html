               Hon. Mr. Holton said that unquestionably 
               <br />
               the member for West Durham had pointed 
               <br />
               out the inconsequential character of the sub- 
               <br />
               sequent clauses with this clause. At this stage, 
               <br />
               it would be better if the member having 
               <br />
               charge of the Bill should state his view of 
               <br />
               this matter. His (Mr. Holton’s) understanding 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> that the Bill was to be made applicable

               throughout to non-traders, in the same sense 
               <br />
               and to the same extent as traders.<br />

               Hon. Mr. Abbott did not understand that to 
               <br />
               be the decision of the Committee; and it was 
               <br />
               impossible it could have been their intention. 
               <br />
               Apart from the fact that they passed the 
               <br />
               measure clause by clause, and after the most 
               <br />
               careful consideration framed the measure as 
               <br />
               it stood, it was quite clear that they never 
               <br />
               intended the Bill to apply to non-traders in 
               <br />
               all respects as to traders, for this reason, 
               <br />
               that the exceptions to which the member for 
               <br />
               West Durham referred were peculiar to trad- 
               <br />
               ing, and could not be made to apply to non- 
               <br />
               traders. One of these exceptions is, that if a 
               <br />
               man ceases to meet his liabilities as they 
               <br />
               become due, and does not assign his estate 
               <br />
               within a certain number of days, that he 
               <br />
               should be called on for an assignment. The 
               <br />
               member for Chateauguay himself would be 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst to object to such a provision as that 
               <br />
               being made applicable to the non-trader. The 
               <br />
               trader loses his credit and may be said to 
               <br />
               be insolvent when he stops payment. In 
               <br />
               ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, stoppage 
               <br />
               of payment by a trader indicates that he 
               <br />
               has not enough to pay his debts in full. The 
               <br />
               mere failure of a non-trader to pay a debt 
               <br />
               when it matures does not, to the same extent, 
               <br />
               indicate any such thing. He should not, 
               <br />
               therefore, be made liable to the provisions of 
               <br />
               the Act.
