               drawing a distinction between traders and

               Mr. Ross (Dundas)—If it is desirable that 
               <br />
               there should be an Insolvency Law, he could 
               <br />
               not see why it should be made exceptional in 
               <br />
               its operation. He was prepared to vote to do 
               <br />
               away with the law altogether; but, if we had 
               <br />
               such a law, one class of persons who got in- 
               <br />
               volved ought to have the same opportunity of 
               <br />

               however, of the member for South Oxford did 
               <br />

               Mr. Dufresne said an Insolvency Law was 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exceptional.</span> Every principle of law and justice 
               <br />
               required a man to pay his debts; but ex-

               perience showed that certain exceptions might 
               <br />
               be desirable. In Lower Canada it was consid- 
               <br />
               ered that a trader acted as an agent between 
               <br />
               other parties, and that circumstances which 
               <br />
               he could not control might prevent his meet- 
               <br />
               ing his obligations. Traders occupied an ex- 
               <br />
               ceptional position, and they required such a 
               <br />
               law as this, but the general principle was that 
               <br />
               every man should pay what he owes.
