               stances one of the poorer Colonies of British 
               <br />
               America, she would meet with no ungenerous 
               <br />
               treatment at his hands. But while he said 
               <br />
               this, he must resent the attempt on the part 
               <br />
               of some hon. gentlemen to prevent a free dis- 
               <br />
               cussion and deliberation on the subject in this 
               <br />
               House. The Minister of Public Works has at- 
               <br />
               tacked his hon. friend from Wellington South, 
               <br />
               because that hon. gentleman held himself 
               <br />
               free from any obligations with reference to 
               <br />
               this question in consequence of the course 
               <br />
               taken at the Quebec Conference. He (Mr. 
               <br />
               Mackenzie,) endorsed the language of his hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Wellington South, to its entire ex- 
               <br />
               tent. The terms proposed at the Quebec Con- 
               <br />
               ference not having been then accepted, he 
               <br />
               considered that all parties were free to pro- 
               <br />
               pose new terms. The gentlemen who were now 
               <br />
               so ably representing Newfoundland had not 
               <br />
               considered themselves bound by these terms, 
               <br />
               but had come here with entirely new terms; 
               <br />
               and if so, why should any member of this 
               <br />
               House be held bound by those terms. He had 
               <br />
               been amused to hear the Minister of Public 
               <br />
               Works speak of the inconsistency of the mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Wellington South. Nothing could be 
               <br />
               more grotesque than to hear the Minister of 
               <br />
               Public Works lecturing any gentleman for his 
               <br />
               inconsistency. That hon. gentleman had been 
               <br />
               found delivering opposition opinions on every 
               <br />
               possible subject at various periods in his his- 
               <br />
               tory. (Hear, hear.) He regretted that the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Customs should have imported into the 
               <br />
               discussion matter wholly irrelevant to the 
               <br />
               motion before the chair. He would not follow 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman in his calculations as to 
               <br />
               the Customs further than to say that his 
               <br />
               ﬁgures were utterly incorrect. He was not 
               <br />
               surprised, however, that the Minister of Cus- 
               <br />
               toms’ reason should have made the mistake, 
               <br />
               when last year he made a mistake of nearly 
               <br />
               a million and a half on the probable proceeds 
               <br />
               of the Customs. He supposed his calculations 
               <br />
               as to the approximate income from New- 
               <br />
               foundland would turn out about as correct 
               <br />
               as his calculations as to the Customs last 
               <br />
               year. As regarded the motion before the chair 
               <br />
               he could not conceive anything more incon- 
               <br />
               sistent with the duties and obligations of the 
               <br />
               Dominion Government than that it should 
               <br />
               undertake the management of the public lands 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland. He could not understand 
               <br />
               how the member for Sherbrooke (Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               Galt) could have ventured at the London 
               <br />
               Conference, as he told the House he did, to 
               <br />
               urge that the Act of Union should assign to 
               <br />
               the Dominion the Crown Lands of the various 
               <br />
               Provinces in violation of the terms of the 
               <br />
               Quebec resolutions. He (Mr. Mackenzie) did 
               <br />
               not hesitate to say that if the Quebec arrange-
