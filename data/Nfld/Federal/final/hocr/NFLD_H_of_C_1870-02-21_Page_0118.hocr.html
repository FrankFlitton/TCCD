               whether he would support him. He promised 
               <br />
               him to do so for he thought that he would have 
               <br />
               been a good Governor. He thought now that he 
               <br />
               would have been a good Governor if he could 
               <br />
               have got into the country and could have 
               <br />
               explained to the settlers that the Government 
               <br />
               intended to do them no wrong. There could be 
               <br />
               no doubt that the Scotch and English half- 
               <br />
               breeds did not find fault with what the French 
               <br />
               Canadian half-breeds were doing. It had been 
               <br />
               published in some papers that there was a 
               <br />
               conspiracy against his hon. friend, because a 
               <br />
               French Gouvernor ought to be sent there, and 
               <br />
               that the Territory ought to be a second Quebec. 
               <br />
               He thought that these statements were the 
               <br />
               most wicked untruths that had ever been pub- 
               <br />
               lished. He had promised his friend his support, 
               <br />
               and he should not have been guilty of doing 
               <br />
               anything to give the least appearance of truth 
               <br />
               to such a wicked and mischievous untruth. The 
               <br />
               French Canadians were an impulsive race, and 
               <br />
               he thought it very wrong for a writer or a 
               <br />
               speaker to attempt to raise a disturbance in the 
               <br />
               East as well as in the West. They were French 
               <br />
               Canadians, but they were also British subjects 
               <br />
               (cheers), and were as much British, even if not 
               <br />
               more so, than the British, (cheers). He was a 
               <br />
               pure Frenchman, and he defied them to pro- 
               <br />
               duce a more loyal man. Suppose that he was 
               <br />
               appointed to the Governorship, would his 
               <br />
               being a French Canadian make him unfit for 
               <br />
               that position? (No! no.) Sir G.-E. Cartier then 
               <br />
               contrasted the liberality of the Provinces of 
               <br />
               Ontario and Quebec, and gave a stirring 
               <br />
               description of the loyalty of the old French 
               <br />
               inhabitants of the Province of Quebec. As to 
               <br />
               the inhabitants of the Red River, the French 
               <br />
               had gone there with their fathers, but some 
               <br />
               stupid fanatical papers had said there should 
               <br />
               be no Frenchmen there. At any rate there was 
               <br />
               no intention to send a French Government 
               <br />
               there; but still their paper had no right to 
               <br />
               speak of the French population as they had 
               <br />
               done. The Red River must be a Province like 
               <br />
               Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia, or New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick, but a Province for every race to settle in. 
               <br />
               He thanked God there were in Lower Canada 
               <br />
               250,000 honest English-speaking residents; and 
               <br />
               he and his co-nationalists only regretted that 
               <br />
               there were not double the number. At the last 
               <br />
               census there were 80,000 French Canadians in 
               <br />
               Upper Canada. He hoped at the next census 
               <br />
               there would be 100,000 more (laughter), and he 
               <br />
               was convinced that the Upper Province would 
               <br />
               not be the worse for this increase. The address 
               <br />
               stated that the policy of conciliation would be 
               <br />
               adopted. There was the case of Ireland, con- 
               <br />
               quered hundreds of years ago, and the misgov- 
               <br />
               ernment there was only now about to be 
               <br />
               relieved by Protestant votes. We wanted no 
               <br />
               such state of things hereâ€”no country baptized 
               <br />
               in blood. The House and country ought to be<br />
