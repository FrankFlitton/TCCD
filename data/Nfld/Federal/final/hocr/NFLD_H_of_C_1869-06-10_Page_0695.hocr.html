               Mr. Blake proceeded to say that the func- 
               <br />
               tions which would be left to the Legislature 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland to discharge were almost 
               <br />
               exclusively of a municipal character, and if 
               <br />
               they took away from it the management of 
               <br />
               its lands, he failed to see why they retained 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland the expensive machinery of 
               <br />
               a legislative body. Therefore the policy of the 
               <br />
               Union Act in regard to public lands while 
               <br />
               eminently sound as to all the Provinces, ap- 
               <br />
               peared to him with reference to this Colony 
               <br />
               above and beyond all the other Colonies 
               <br />
               sound, and he thought a misfortune would be 
               <br />
               inﬂicted both on the Dominion and on New- 
               <br />
               foundland, if we took away from that Colony 
               <br />
               the management of its lands and assumed it 
               <br />
               ourselves. He objected, also, that there was 
               <br />
               no necessity for this arrangement. The pro- 
               <br />
               posed barter of the public lands of New- 
               <br />
               foundland for $150,000 a-year, was a sham 
               <br />
               bargain. The Dominion would never reap 
               <br />
               pecuniarily and directly any advantage from 
               <br />
               these mines and minerals. The development 
               <br />
               of the mineral wealth of the Colony would 
               <br />
               promote the prosperity of Newfoundland, and, 
               <br />
               through it, the prosperity of Canada; but to 
               <br />
               attempt to derive a revenue from it, would 
               <br />
               be to strike a ﬂat blow at the prospect of 
               <br />
               mineral development at all. If we did our 
               <br />
               duty by Newfoundland, in properly develop- 
               <br />
               ing her mineral wealth, we could not expect 
               <br />
               to derive a revenue from those lands. Under 
               <br />
               these circumstances, if the choice were be- 
               <br />
               tween our giving $150,000 a year to New- 
               <br />
               foundland and taking her lands, and our 
               <br />
               giving $150,000 a year to Newfoundland and 
               <br />
               leaving her lands, he would unhesitatingly 
               <br />
               vote in favour of the latter of these two pro- 
               <br />
               positions. He believed the prosperity of the 
               <br />
               Colony would be largely enhanced by the 
               <br />
               adoption of the latter alternative, and the 
               <br />
               pecuniary results to Canada, would also be 
               <br />
               largely enhanced by it. He had considered as 
               <br />
               attentively as he could what was the relative 
               <br />
               duty of those proposing this amendment and 
               <br />
               of the Government under those circumstances, 
               <br />
               and it had occurred to him that in proposing 
               <br />
               this amendment. it was not his duty to em- 
               <br />
               barass the negotiations, by preserving what in 
               <br />
               their views had been the alternative terms 
               <br />
               of admission, but that they ought to conﬁne 
               <br />
               themselves to asserting and endeavouring, if 
               <br />
               they could, to induce the House to agree to 
               <br />
