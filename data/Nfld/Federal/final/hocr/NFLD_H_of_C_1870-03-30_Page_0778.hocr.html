               Mr. Mackenzie—Well, you have got it now, 
               <br />
               and I hope you will profit by it. Another thing 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice made a great point of 
               <br />
               was that they were a great people. That they 
               <br />
               had rights and should protect them; but it was 
               <br />
               not a week since they were told that Canada 
               <br />
               was so petty a country that if we were to send 
               <br />
               a delegate to any foreign country they would 
               <br />
               not know where he came from. It suited the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman’s purposes to make them out 
               <br />
               now a powerful country, but another time and 
               <br />
               they were a very weak and contemptible 
               <br />
               people indeed. (Great laughter.) He did not 
               <br />
               consider it necessary to go over the able argu- 
               <br />
               ments of the hon. member for West Durham, 
               <br />
               because not a single one had been referred to 
               <br />
               by the Minister of Justice. He imagined that 
               <br />
               they acted inconsistently in objecting to the 
               <br />
               terms of Newfoundland, because it had been 
               <br />
               adopted at the Quebec Conference. It was un- 
               <br />
               necessary to go over arguments on this point 
               <br />
               brought forward last session. The resolutions 
               <br />
               were agreed to at Quebec on an understanding 
               <br />
               that they were to be accepted at that time, and 
               <br />
               the whole were to be as a treaty, to be either 
               <br />
               wholly accepted, or not. Newfoundland, how- 
               <br />
               ever, refused to accept those terms; but when 
               <br />
               they sent a delegation to this place, he (Mr. 
               <br />
               Mackenzie) felt most anxious that such 
               <br />
               arrangements should be made as would lead to 
               <br />
               her entry. He believed that the proposition 
               <br />
               which they made would have been accepted by 
               <br />
               that people; but the resolutions which the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment insisted on passing, ensured their 
               <br />
               rejection at the polls. The hon. gentleman had 
               <br />
               made one statement—he said that the course 
               <br />
               they proposed was precisely the same, except 
               <br />
               in name, such as if they had proposed to pass 
               <br />
               an Address to Her Majesty, in order that they 
               <br />
               might pay that sum to Nova Scotia. The ground 
               <br />
               they took was that that was a union of the four 
               <br />
               Provinces, and they could not alter the Act of 
               <br />
               Union without the sanction and agreement of 
               <br />
               those four parties to the agreement; that an 
               <br />
               appeal to England should be made, which, if 
               <br />
               favourable, then the Act could be passed; but if 
               <br />
               the Government could alter the 114th section 
               <br />
               of the Act, they could alter any part of it, and 
               <br />
               could, for instance, give a larger representation 
               <br />
               to any of the Provinces in that House by the 
               <br />
               same means.
