               by persons who had an interest in improperly 
               <br />
               working it. So long as creditors took the 
               <br />
               short sighted course of compromising frauds 
               <br />
               so as to get a little more in the pound rather 
               <br />
               than let the frauds go before the Courts, so 
               <br />
               long would any insolvent law which could be 
               <br />
               put on the statute book be abused. If the 
               <br />
               creditor would take the true view and let 
               <br />
               the provisions of the law be carried out with 
               <br />
               reference to frauds, he would ﬁnd those cases 
               <br />
               of fraud would become more and more rare. 
               <br />
               He believed, therefore, the abuse of the law 
               <br />
               was mainly attributable to the neglect and 
               <br />
               blindness of those whose direct interest it 
               <br />
               was to maintain it. But as regarded the 
               <br />
               amendment now before the chair, he must 
               <br />
               say that it did not seem to him that prac- 
               <br />
               tically there was a very large class of cases 
               <br />
               in Which it was proposed to extend the law 
               <br />
               to non-traders. In the ﬁrst place, no voluntary 
               <br />
               assignment was allowed in the case of non- 
               <br />
               traders; in the second place, when they came 
               <br />
               to the provisions as to compulsory liquida- 
               <br />
               tion, the 14th clause laid down certain cases 
               <br />
               in which the law should apply to all cases 
               <br />
               of debtors. These were, if the debtor 
               <br />
               absconded, if there was a fraudulent secretion 
               <br />
               of property, if there was a fraudulent assign- 
               <br />
               ment of property, if there was a procuring of 
               <br />
               property to be taken in execution, with intent 
               <br />
               to defraud, &amp;c.—but simple default, and a 
               <br />
               simple inability to pay, although that ina- 
               <br />
               bility might be established by the return to 
               <br />
               an execution of no goods, was not enough to 
               <br />
               drive the non-trader into compulsory liquida- 
               <br />
               tion.

               according to the law as it had been since 1864, 
               <br />
               that was so. It was only in the cases specified 
               <br />
               in the 14th clause to which he had referred, 
               <br />
               that a non-trader could be put into compul- 
               <br />
               sory liquidation at all. He confessed that it 
               <br />
               appeared to him that the fragmentary appli- 
               <br />
               cation of the law to non-traders was not well 
               <br />
               considered and they would have a grave 
               <br />
               question to deal with, if any hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               proposed to wipe out altogether the distinc- 
               <br />
               tion between traders and non-traders, and 
               <br />
               to give us one law for all as regarded both 
               <br />
               voluntary and compulsory liquidation. That 
               <br />
               however, was not the proposition before the 
               <br />
               House. Now the position was this—that in a 
               <br />
               few cases at the instance of the creditors 
               <br />
               there might be compulsory liquidation in the 
               <br />
               case of the non-traders. In his own Province 
               <br />
               he did not believe that the law as it stood 
               <br />
               would be resorted to by creditors against 
               <br />
               non-traders. In many instances it merely
