               <br />
               agement, and pay $150,000 a year for the 
               <br />
               privilege. This, it is said, was agreed upon 
               <br />
               at the Quebec Convention. Be it so. It is 
               <br />
               not the less a monstrous proposition. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) No one believes the land valuable. 
               <br />
               Why then is this done? Why, sir, to deceive 
               <br />
               the people. To pretend to have received value 
               <br />
               for this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$150,000</span> a year when no value has been 
               <br />
               received. Let gentlemen be manly in this mat- 
               <br />
               ter. Let them have the courage to do openly 
               <br />
               what they propose to do covertly. Let them 
               <br />
               give the true reason for what they do instead 
               <br />
               of using this matter of the Crown Lands, and 
               <br />
               they will not add moral cowardice to other 
               <br />
               wrongs. If the lands of Newfoundland were 
               <br />
               worth the money, it would still be an objec- 
               <br />
               tionable acquisition. Why should we hold and 
               <br />
               control lands in one Province? (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Suppose them ﬁt for settlement what would 
               <br />
               we be obliged to do? Why, sir, we would seek 
               <br />
               to encourage emigration, not to the whole Do- 
               <br />
               minion, but Newfoundland. We would in the 
               <br />
               interest of Newfoundland become the rival of 
               <br />
               all the other Provinces. We would make free 
               <br />
               grants there to actual settlers. We would esta- 
               <br />
               blish a homestead law. We would be at the 
               <br />
               expense of surveying, building roads and con- 
               <br />
               structing bridges, at the expense of the Domin- 
               <br />
               ion, and pay Newfoundland $150,000 a year for 
               <br />
               the privilege? (Cheers.) There are numberless 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difficulties</span> connected with such an arrange- 
               <br />
               ment apart from its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">monetary</span> features that I 
               <br />
               shall at a future stage consider. We are told 
               <br />
               by the honorable President of the Council we 
               <br />
               must take a broad view of the question. It is 
               <br />
               unworthy this great Dominion treat this as 
               <br />
               a matter of money. Sir, I was pleased to hear 
               <br />
               such a patriotic sentiment from the President 
               <br />
               of the Council. I assume, I think I am justiﬁed 
               <br />
               in assuming, that he is about to take a new 
               <br />
               view of the Nova Scotia subsidy. I hope he 
               <br />
               has learned to take a broad view of that ques- 
               <br />
               tion and that he will not ask us to buy her 
               <br />
               good will. (Hear, hear.) I supposed, sir, he had 
               <br />
               importuned the Government for more money; 
               <br />
               that he very nearly had Nova Scotia into 
               <br />
               civil war for more money, that he asked for 
               <br />
               repeal, because Nova Scotia did not get more 
               <br />
               money; that he deserted the Repeal party for 
               <br />
               more money; that he entered the Cabinet for 
               <br />
               more money. (Cheers.) Well, sir, I am pleased 
               <br />
               he deprecates this way of viewing great 
               <br />
               questions of state, and I hope we may 
               <br />
               be permitted to assume this to be a 
               <br />
               withdrawal of Nova Scotia pretensions. (No, 
               <br />
               no from Ministers) I, sir, am ready to deal 
               <br />
               generously with Newfoundland, but I wish to 
               <br />
               deal honestly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> the people of Canada. I 
               <br />
               wish that they shall know the whole truth.
