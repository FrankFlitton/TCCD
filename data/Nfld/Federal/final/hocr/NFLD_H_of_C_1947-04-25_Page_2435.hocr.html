               Mr. ST. LAURENT: I will try to answer 
               <br />
               some of the questions involved in the request 
               <br />
               made by the hon. member. What is being 
               <br />
               done here has two aspects. One is the incor- 
               <br />
               poration of a company which thereby gets the 
               <br />
               right to act as a person; the second is the 
               <br />
               grant to that company of the right to build 
               <br />
               a railway in Canadian territory. Under our 
               <br />
               system no one, neither a company nor an 
               <br />
               individual, can build a railway without a 
               <br />
               charter from the government of Canada if it 
               <br />
               is to be interprovincial or if it is to connect 
               <br />
               Canada with another country, or from a prov- 
               <br />
               ince if the railway is to be entirely within 
               <br />
               the province. This parliament can grant no 
               <br />
               rights to build a railway outside its territory, 
               <br />
               but it can give a company the capacity to 
               <br />
               receive such rights from the appropriate auth- 
               <br />
               ority. That matter came before the privy coun- 
               <br />
               cil several years ago. One was a case con- 
               <br />
               cerning the John Deere Plow Company, and 
               <br />
               the other was a case concerning the Bonanza 
               <br />
               Creek Mining Company. The capacity to 
               <br />
               receive powers can be granted by this parlia- 
               <br />
               ment in creating a corporation, and that is all 
               <br />
               that this parliament can do with respect to 
               <br />
               any portion of the railway that would be out- 
               <br />
               side Canadian territory. It can have the 
               <br />
               capacity to receive a franchise from the sov- 
               <br />
               ereign of the territory outside Canada where 
               <br />
               it may operate. I do not think that would be 
               <br />
               dealing with a foreign government over the 
               <br />
               head of the Canadian government any more 
               <br />
               than it would in the case of a United States 
               <br />
               company that gets a charter here for the 
               <br />
               operation of a subsidiary in Canada. There 
               <br />
               does not appear to be any international con- 
               <br />
               ﬂict here. All states assert the right to give 
               <br />
               companies the capacity to receive powers from 
               <br />
               whosoever may be willing to grant powers to 
               <br />
               them.

               With respect to the port on Ungava bay I 
               <br />
               have no information whatsoever. I do not

               know whether there is a port there or whether 
               <br />
               one can be developed there. But reading the
