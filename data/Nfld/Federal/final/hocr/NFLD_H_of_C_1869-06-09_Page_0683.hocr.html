               Hon. Mr. Gray said that the question before 
               <br />
               the House was not so much what the Com- 
               <br />
               mittee intended to do as what they did do. 
               <br />
               His understanding of the Bill was that 
               <br />
               throughout it referred to non-traders as 
               <br />
               well as traders and he differed altogether 
               <br />
               from the views advanced by the member for 
               <br />
               Brome. If such views were to prevail, better 
               <br />
               Confederation had never taken place. He 
               <br />
               thought that if one question more than an- 
               <br />
               other came within the province of the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion Parliament it was this of bankruptcy 
               <br />
               and insolvency. In the Maritime Provinces at 
               <br />
               present, persons could not be relieved of 
               <br />
               their debts and the result was that persons 
               <br />
               from these Provinces frequently went to Eng- 
               <br />
               land and did business on a small scale for a 
               <br />
               few weeks to bring them within the pro- 
               <br />
               visions of the bankrupt laws, and the credi- 
               <br />
               tors soon found themselves divested of all 
               <br />
               control over the property. In his opinion 
               <br />
               there ought to be a good Insolvency Law for 
               <br />

               Hon. J. H. Cameron said that in Ontario the 
               <br />
               non—trader was liable to voluntary and invol- 
               <br />
               untary assignments, but under the provisions 
               <br />
               of the present Bill the voluntary assignment 
               <br />
               was prevented, while the other remained. His 
               <br />
               impression was that the law was to be exactly 
               <br />
               the same as in Ontario before, except that a 
               <br />
               non-trader could not by his own voluntary 
               <br />
               act go into insolvency. He had not at all sup- 
               <br />
               posed that the effect of the present Bill was 
               <br />
               that any creditor or number of creditors 
               <br />
               could put a non-trader into bankruptcy.
