               their own consent, and there still existed that 
               <br />
               authority without which they could not move;

               <br />
               Imperial Government, his argument was 
               <br />
               extremely worthless. With regard to the high 
               <br />
               opinion expressed of the law officers of the 
               <br />
               Crown, and the respect they were to pay them 
               <br />
               according to the hon. gentleman, it was abso- 
               <br />
               lutely not a week ago that he had sneered at 
               <br />
               men who occupied much higher position in the 
               <br />
               Government of England than the Attorney 
               <br />
               General. He seemed to make them just as it 
               <br />
               suited him, making them great or mean as 
               <br />
               necessity required. (Laughter.) He even called 
               <br />
               the Under Secretary of State, on the receipt of 
               <br />
               some despatches, very destructive to the credit 
               <br />
               of himself as a statesman, “a mere understrap- 
               <br />
               per”; but now they were to bow down to his 
               <br />
               opinions. (Laughter.) Another Minister had 
               <br />
               declared that he would never yield to the opin- 
               <br />
               ion of any English Minister, and perhaps he 
               <br />
               would show the House how far the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice was wrong when he yielded to the 
               <br />
               dictation of the Attorney-General. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) The Minister of Justice said that Mr. 
               <br />
               Blake did not accept the decision of the House 
               <br />
               last year. In so far as that was considered to be 
               <br />
               inevitable they accepted it; but they took their 
               <br />
               ground, not that Nova Scotia was not entitled 
               <br />
               to some consideration of her claims, for they 
               <br />
               supported an amendment that the House 
               <br />
               should go into Committee to consider their 
               <br />
               grievances, but the hon. gentleman took oppo- 
               <br />
               site ground, and the attempt to go into Com- 
               <br />
               mittee failed. The Honourable Secretary of 
               <br />
               State had not had manliness yet to acknowl- 
               <br />
               edge the efforts made by the Opposition on 
               <br />
