               Hon. Mr. Holton said that the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man who had just taken his seat had fallen 
               <br />
               into the fallacy of assuming that this Bill, and 
               <br />
               insolvent laws generally, were contrived in the 
               <br />
               interest of the debtor class. Now the whole 
               <br />
               scope of the present measure was to enable the 
               <br />
               creditors to distribute the estate on some 
               <br />
               equitable principle. Incidentally, and only in- 
               <br />
               cidentally, the debtor class might benefit by 
               <br />
               getting the discharge from liability. That was 
               <br />
               his view of the scope and purport of the law. 
               <br />
               Coming to the application of the measure to 
               <br />
               non-traders, he would say that the creditors 
               <br />
               of non-trades had an equal interest with credi- 
               <br />
               tors of traders in getting at the effects and 
               <br />
               securing a proper distribution of the estate of 
               <br />
               an insolvent debtor. But the Minister of Militia 
               <br />
               argued that the power asked for the retaining 
               <br />
               of non-traders was possessed already in Que- 
               <br />
               bec. He (Mr. Holton) thought it very objec- 
               <br />
               tionable to make an exception of a particular 
               <br />
               Province in any legislation competent for this 
               <br />
               Parliament to enact; and for his part, while he 
               <br />
               desired to see the principle of this Bill applied 
               <br />
               to non-traders, sooner than see an exception 
               <br />
               made by any Province in the matter, he would 
               <br />
               inﬁnitely rather that non traders should be 
               <br />
               excluded from the operation of the Act. The 
               <br />
               object of the Dominion Parliament should be 
               <br />
               to assimilate the laws and not legislate ex- 
               <br />
               ceptionally.

               Mr. Bodwell said that the question arose 
               <br />
               who were traders and who non-traders. If 
               <br />
               every man was a trader, who bought and sold, 
               <br />
               he would like to know what individual in the 
               <br />
               community was not a trader. If a man trading 
               <br />
               in a particular line of business was unfortu- 
               <br />
               nate, and allowed his business to go into the 
               <br />
               Insolvent Court, why should not a trader in 
               <br />
               any other line of business have an equal right? 
               <br />
               Many were engaged in produce dealings, and
