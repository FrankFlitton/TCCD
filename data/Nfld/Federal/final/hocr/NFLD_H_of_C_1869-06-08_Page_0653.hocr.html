               found a population physically as ﬁne as any 
               <br />
               on the Continent. In point of beauty and social 
               <br />
               attractiveness, the women of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               were magnificent, (loud laughter,) many of 
               <br />
               them being equal to two-thirds of a man. (Re-

               newed laughter,) Having dwelt on the sea-

               faring population, this Colony would bring 
               <br />
               to the Dominion some 38,000, and stated that 
               <br />
               this would swell the number of able bodied 
               <br />
               seamen in the Confederacy to 69,000 or 
               <br />
               70,000. The hon. gentleman went on to allude 
               <br />
               to the political celebrities of Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               Men of enlarged mind and true political saga-

               <br />
               her battles where difficulties arose, and he 
               <br />
               hoped to see some of these men in the service 
               <br />
               of the Confederacy. She was a country with 
               <br />
               an interior. All her wealth and industry lay 
               <br />
               on the sea coast; but she had got an interior, 
               <br />
               and you can reach it. You can cross nearly the 
               <br />
               whole island by water. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               spoke of the ﬁne harbours of the island, and 
               <br />
               said in some of the towns, although the in- 
               <br />
               habitants appeared to be few, they were worth 
               <br />
               their thousands of pounds sterling. The cod- 
               <br />
               ﬁshery was one for which they had a hard 
               <br />
               contest, and out of which they made compara- 
               <br />
               tively little; but the seal-ﬁshery was a rich 
               <br />
               one, peculiarly their own, and could not be 
               <br />
               taken from them. In a small town, in which he 
               <br />
               was one day, he met a ﬁne sturdy ﬁsherman 
               <br />
               with a gin-bottle about as big as a clothes 
               <br />
               basket, (loud laughter,) who had got in $10,000 
               <br />
               worth of seals in four weeks. That would show 
               <br />
               the exceeding value of the crop. With another

               Mr. Blake. alluding to the remarks of the 
               <br />
               President of the Council, said it might be 
               <br />
               that the observations from his side of the 
               <br />
               House had been immaterial. It might be that 
               <br />
               they had taken too low and practical a view of 
               <br />
               some of the aspects of the question. He did 
               <br />
               not think, however, that they had done more 
               <br />
               to arrive at the actual position of the facts 
               <br />
               than anything that had been done in that 
               <br />
               direction by the hon. gentleman who had just 
               <br />
               taken his seat. The hon. gentleman had rightly 
               <br />
               said that the inhabitants of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               were not to be coerced into the Union. He 
               <br />
               (Mr. Blake) would say, neither ought they to 
               <br />
               be bribed. (Hear, hear). He did not say 
               <br />
               whether they were being bribed or not: but 
               <br />
               he wanted to get at the facts on which he 
               <br />
               could form a judgment on that subject. He 
               <br />
               did not think the House had been properly 
               <br />
               treated in the mode in which the Minister 
               <br />
               of Finance had introduced the question, and
