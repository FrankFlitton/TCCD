               now returned after a most successful mission 
               <br />
               and the negotiations could be renewed. In the 
               <br />
               meantime he could inform the House that the 
               <br />
               Department of Inland Revenue had been 
               <br />
               most successfully managed by the Post- 
               <br />
               master-General, who attended to these ad-

               ditional arduous duties during the whole of 
               <br />
               the winter, though at great personal loss and 
               <br />
               labour. The interests of the public service in 
               <br />
               this respect had not, therefore, suffered in 
               <br />
               any way. The thing, of course, could not be 
               <br />
               carried on, and it was the intention of the 
               <br />
               Government to ﬁll up the vacancy, and place 
               <br />
               a responsible man at the head of the Depart- 
               <br />
               ment. As to the proportional representation 
               <br />
               of the Provinces in the Cabinet, his honour— 
               <br />
               able friend would remember that it was 
               <br />
               stated by the Government during the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               session that these matters, the formation of 
               <br />
               the Government, division of the ofﬁces, &amp;c., 
               <br />
               were of necessity experimental, and this was 
               <br />
               the case yet. In the event of the absorption 
               <br />
               of the great North-West and Newfoundland 
               <br />
               into the Dominion, new duties and responsi- 
               <br />
               bilities would be involved, and very probably 
               <br />
               a re-adjustment of the different heads of the 
               <br />
               Departments. But he had no doubt that with- 
               <br />
               in the limits of a legitimate opposition, the 
               <br />
               Government would be supported in any ef- 
               <br />
               forts they might make to administer the new 
               <br />
               state of affairs. As to Mr. Howe, he (Sir 
               <br />
               John) hoped the people of Hants would soon 
               <br />
               enable that hon. gentleman to explain his 
               <br />
               own position on the ﬂoor of the House.

               It would be unusual and inconvenient to 
               <br />
               debate at that moment the policy involved in

               the explanations; but there was just one

               did not go on. Having been informed that

               negotiations had been entered into, the House 
               <br />
