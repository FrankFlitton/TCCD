               Hon. Mr. Gray had understood the member 
               <br />
               for West Durham to argue not that this sum of 
               <br />
               $150,000 should not be given to Newfound- 
               <br />
               land, but that her public lands should not be 
               <br />
               taken as an exchange. He (Mr. Gray) did not 
               <br />
               see how hon. members could justify them-<br />
               selves to their constituents if they supported 
               <br />
               such a proposition, and gave Newfoundland 
               <br />
               this exceptional privilege, not extended to the 
               <br />
               other Provinces, of receiving so very large a 
               <br />
               sum without any consideration. The resolution 
               <br />
               left it optional with Newfoundland to retain 
               <br />
               her land. He would prefer that she would, but 
               <br />
               he would rather take her with this encum-<br />
               brance than leave her out of the Union.

               Already there was a low murmuring of dis- 
               <br />
               content at the departure from the conditions 
               <br />
               of union proposed with reference to Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia, and who could tell to what height that 
               <br />
               might grow, if $150,000 a year were to be 
               <br />
               given to Newfoundland, without receiving the 
               <br />
               consideration which was stipulated in the 
               <br />
               resolutions of the Quebec Conference.

               Hon. Mr. Wood thought the important ques- 
               <br />
               tion was this—what sum would be required 
               <br />
               by the Newfoundland Legislature to carry on 
               <br />
               its local service? That sum being once ascer- 
               <br />
               tained, Canada should freely give it. He 
               <br />
               thought it mean and unpatriotic to enter into 
               <br />
               a very minute calculation of dollars and cents. 
               <br />
               He did not think the amount estimated by the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance was too large. He did not 
               <br />
               expect that for some time the revenue we 
               <br />
               would receive from Newfoundland would 
               <br />
               equal the expenditure we incurred on her 
               <br />
               behalf, but by opening a new market to us, 
               <br />
               and by stimulating the industry of the Island, 
               <br />
               and increasing its population, the Union would 
               <br />
               be indirectly of great advantage to the 
               <br />
               Dominion. The only part of the scheme he 
               <br />
               objected to was this—as to public lands, he 
               <br />
               would much prefer that Newfoundland would 
               <br />
               keep her own lands, and with that view he 
               <br />
               would not object to the special subsidy being 
               <br />
               made $185,000 instead of $35,000.
