               Sir John A. Macdonald explained, in reply 
               <br />
               to some remarks of the previous speaker, that 
               <br />
               the three Provinces of Canada, New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick, and Nova Scotia originally met for the 
               <br />
               purpose of making a treaty. The Provinces of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island sent 
               <br />
               delegates simply as spectators—not for the 
               <br />
               purpose of entering into a definite compact. 
               <br />
               The other three Provinces, however, made a 
               <br />
               solemn treaty, as he had stated, with the 
               <br />
               Canadian Parliament, after the Conference at 
               <br />
               Quebec. He was not sure whether Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island was in the same position as 
               <br />
               the other Provinces, but he was certain that 
               <br />
               the delegates of Newfoundland did not con- 
               <br />
               der themselves a party to the treaty. It was 
               <br />
               simply agreed that whenever they choose to 
               <br />
               come in, they should do so on certain terms. 
               <br />
               In 1865 there was a disposition in the island 
               <br />
               to submit the Quebec resolutions at the polls, 
               <br />
               but the hostility to Union in New Brunswick 
               <br />
               and Nova Scotia created the impression that 
               <br />
               the measure would not be accepted by British 
               <br />
               North America. Now, however, it was felt 
               <br />
               that the difficulties in the way of the Con- 
               <br />
               federation were rapidly disappearing, and 
               <br />
               that it was their duty and interest to form 
               <br />
               a part of the Dominion. Under the circum- 
               <br />
               stances he regretted to hear the arguments he 
               <br />
               had heard advanced from the opposite side.
