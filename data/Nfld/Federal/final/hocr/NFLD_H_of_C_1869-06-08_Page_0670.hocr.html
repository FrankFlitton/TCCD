               Hon. Mr. Howe said that Newfoundland 
               <br />
               had hitherto been able to carry on her gov- 
               <br />
               ernment on her own resources, and without 
               <br />
               any help from abroad. Therefore she must 
               <br />
               have considerable capabilities, and he be- 
               <br />
               lieved if she did not join the Confederation, 
               <br />
               she could continue as she had been; but the 
               <br />
               other Provinces wanted her for reasons of 
               <br />
               State. No one would deprecate more than 
               <br />
               himself the old rivalries between East and 
               <br />
               West, and he hoped such a state of things 
               <br />
               would not be perpetuated in the New Do- 
               <br />
               minion. Some twenty millions of dollars were 
               <br />
               about being expended in connection with the 
               <br />
               Intercolonial Railway, and the West would 
               <br />
               have to supply the breadstuffs and other 
               <br />
               provisions required for the labourers on this 
               <br />
               work. Already under Confederation the Low- 
               <br />
               er Provinces had been large purchasers of 
               <br />
               the ﬂour of Ontario, and Newfoundland 
               <br />
               would henceforth do the same. The people 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland would buy the timber of 
               <br />
               Canada, and build ships, and thus engage in 
               <br />
               a new and proﬁtable branch of industry. It 
               <br />
               was hardly worth while now, under the cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances, to bring up such objections as 
               <br />
               he had heard during the debate advanced
