               Mr. Mills regretted that the $150,000 a year 
               <br />
               was to be paid for the land of this Island. 
               <br />
               Even if this item were concurred in, what 
               <br />
               guarantee was there that a further demand 
               <br />
               would not be made next year in lieu of the 
               <br />
               share of Newfoundland in the Intercolonial 
               <br />
               Railway and other great public works of the 
               <br />
               Dominion, from which she derived no direct 
               <br />
               beneﬁt? It was fair, of course, that she should 
               <br />
               get means to enable her to carry on her own 
               <br />
               local Government eﬁîciently, but there was 
               <br />
               no necessity for giving her an extravagant 
               <br />
               amount. For his own part he was most anxious 
               <br />
               to have Newfoundland enter the Dominion, 
               <br />
               but was also anxious that she should do so 
               <br />
               on equitable terms. Let her control her own 
               <br />
               territory, and develop it to the best of her 
               <br />
               own ability. It was for this he contended.

               Mr. D. A. Macdonald said he had not voted 
               <br />
               for the $150,000 when the matter came before 
               <br />
               the Parliament of Canada, or he would be 
               <br />
               bound to vote for it on this occasion. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman had quoted Confederation speeches 
               <br />
               to show the value of Newfoundland to us and 
               <br />
               the great necessity existing for its acquisi-<br />
               tion. But for his part he defied any one to 
               <br />
               show him one word of truth in those speeches. 
               <br />
               (Order, order.) At all events the brilliant 
               <br />
               future drawn out for the country under Con- 
               <br />
               federation was anything but realized or in 
               <br />
               course of realization. As to the land of New- 
               <br />
               foundland, the true course would be to leave 
               <br />
               it with the Colony and give them the $150,-<br />
               000 if necessary.

               Hon. Mr. Dunkin said that under the pres- 
               <br />
               ent circumstances the House was bound to 
               <br />
               carry out the pledge they had given to New- 
               <br />
               foundland in the scheme of Union. Having 
               <br />
               once put our hands to the plough we could 
               <br />
               not look back now, and it was our duty and 
               <br />
               interest to work out the Union as rapidly as 
               <br />
               possible. This confederacy was incomplete 
               <br />
               without Newfoundland and Prince Edward 
               <br />
               Island, and we should offer them the best 
               <br />
               terms we could. We were bound to give them 
               <br />
               what was necessary to enable them to carry 
               <br />
               on there local operations, and he would say 
               <br />
               in all frankness that he did not consider the 
               <br />
               terms now offered, too extravagant. He 
               <br />
               thought though it was not necessary to hold 
               <br />
               the lands, yet the time would probably come 
               <br />
               when the colony would gladly take them 
               <br />
               back. He was of opinion that the lands were 
               <br />
               so much life to the Local Governments; but
