               reasoning but authority for the position he had 
               <br />
               taken, In 1849, under the Baldwin-Lafontaine 
               <br />
               administration, it was a law enacted by the 
               <br />
               Parliament of Canada that in the case of fraud 
               <br />
               and misconduct power was given to the Judge 
               <br />
               in Chambers to imprison any fraudulent 
               <br />
               debtor for a term not exceeding one year, in 
               <br />
               a matter not amounting to $80. This was au- 
               <br />
               thority which ought to be satisfactory to the 
               <br />
               member for West Durham. No offence was 
               <br />
               taken by Lower Canada regarding that law, 
               <br />
               but on the contrary he had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recently</span> got an 
               <br />
               extension of it to make it more rigorous. This

               present measure provides that a party in a 
               <br />
               similar case is to be tried before the Court of 
               <br />
               Queen’s Bench. The present measure was 
               <br />
               therefore an amendment of the old law. The 
               <br />
               term of punishment was extended to 3 years 
               <br />
               under this Act; but the punishment was the 
               <br />
               same and there was the advantage that the

               <br />
               be by a full Court.
