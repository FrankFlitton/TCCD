               tory. The Finance Minister gives detail, ap- 
               <br />
               proximates to some other detail, and then 
               <br />
               asks the House not to discuss the scheme too 
               <br />
               much. He, (Mr. Bodwell), thought it absurd 
               <br />
               to ask the House to go blindly into this scheme 
               <br />
               lest the discussion might effect the scheme 
               <br />
               adversely in Newfoundland. What was the 
               <br />
               meaning of that proposition? Was it that they 
               <br />
               should lend themselves to practice deception 
               <br />
               on the people of Newfoundland in order to 
               <br />
               induce them to enter the Confederation? Such 
               <br />
               a proposition was as monstrous as that by 
               <br />
               which they were called on to give $150,000 a 
               <br />
               year for the land of Newfoundland. From all 
               <br />
               he could gather these lands were of little 
               <br />
               value as mineral lands, and agriculturally 
               <br />
               they were worth little or nothing. The real 
               <br />
               question was, is Newfoundland taking the 
               <br />
               value of its imports, revenue &amp;c, worth to 
               <br />
               the Dominion what it is proposed we should 
               <br />
               give for it? If it is, we ought to accept the 
               <br />
               offer made; if not, we ought to reject it. The 
               <br />
               question was not so much what Newfoundland 
               <br />
               required, but what the Dominion required. 
               <br />
               The land proposition he regarded as especially 
               <br />
               deceptive and absurd. Although he would not 
               <br />
               oppose the resolutions, he felt that insufficient 
               <br />
               explanation had been offered. Before the 
               <br />
               scheme ﬁnally passed, he hoped that more in- 
               <br />
               formation would be given, and the land grant 
               <br />
               would be struck out.

               Sir George E. Cartier said that with the ex-<br />
               ception of $5,000 subsidy, Newfoundland was 
               <br />
               now seeking admission into the Union on 
               <br />
               the terms offered her in the Quebec Confer- 
               <br />
               ence. Hence the question was not in fact one 
               <br />
               susceptible of much discussion. There was a 
               <br />
               bright and dark side to the picture, and cer- 
               <br />
               tainly it could not be said that the Finance 
               <br />
               Minister had altogether pointed out the bright 
               <br />
               side. He (Sir George E. Cartier) would not look 
               <br />
               at the dark side, as spoken of by the member 
               <br />
               for West Durham. That honourable gentle- 
               <br />
               man spoke as if he were not bound by the 
               <br />
               Quebec Scheme, because he had not been in 
               <br />
               Parliament then. He was certainly a prominent 
               <br />
               public man in Ontario then. He was a mem- 
               <br />
               ber of the party led by the Hon. George 
               <br />
               Brown, and still belonged to that party, and 
               <br />
               that honourable gentleman, it was well known, 
               <br />
               had taken a prominent part in the Quebec 
               <br />
               Conference, and wished to unite Newfound- 
               <br />
               land in the way now proposed for that action.

               The member for West Durham was, as a 
               <br />
               member of the party represented by Mr. 
               <br />
               Brown to a certain extent responsible, and 
               <br />
               could not now deny that responsibility. As to 
               <br />
               the falling off of the customs with New-
