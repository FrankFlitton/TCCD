<!-- GL, 2017-09-25, Commented out below as it precedes Debate Day --> 
           <!-- <p>
     12, 1949, and that I had accepted his invi<lb break="no"/>tation. The United States ambassador called 
     <lb/>
     on me yesterday morning to extend the 
     <lb/>
     invitation. I told Mr. Steinhardt I would 
     <lb/>
     naturally be pleased to accept it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The President was kind enough to indicate 
     <lb/>
     that he would like to renew our acquaintance 
     <lb/>
     and to discuss the matters which are of 
     <lb/>
     common interest to our two countries as 
     <lb/>
     neighbours, and also the world situation as 
     <lb/>
     it affects our two countries. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Everyone knows that the friendly personal 
     <lb/>
     relations between the late President Roose<lb break="no"/>velt and our Prime Minister were of inesti<lb break="no"/>mable advantage to this continent and to 
     <lb/>
     the world. President Truman has expressed 
     <lb/>
     the desire, which I fully share, to maintain 
     <lb/>
     these friendly personal relations between the 
     <lb/>
     leaders of the governments of our two 
     <lb/>
     countries. Hon. members will recall that 
     <lb/>
     President Truman visited Ottawa in June, 
     <lb/>
     1947, at the invitation of my predecessor, 
     <lb/>
     and that his Visit was both pleasant and 
     <lb/>
     beneficial. 
     <lb/>

     So that there may be no misunderstanding. I was 
     <lb/>
     dealing with a motion in a certain form. The Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister has indicated his willingness to withdraw 
     <lb/>
     that motion. We come now to another point. There 
     <lb/>
     can be no objection to proceeding with the debate 
     <lb/>
     in the usual way in so far as the mover and 
     <lb/>
     seconder are concerned. but I am unaware of any

     precedent for the leader of the opposition and the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister following immediately afterwards 
     <lb/>
     under such circumstances as we have here. I do 
     <lb/>
     not think that should be suggested. The speech 
     <lb/>
     from the throne has only been presented today. The 
     <lb/>
     debate is on that speech, and it is customary to 
     <lb/>
     afford the leader of the opposition an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     to examine it so that his remarks will deal with it. 
     <lb/>
     I want to make that observation now that the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister has withdrawn the motion. I make the 
     <lb/>
     observation as to my views of the procedure on the

     now move that we proceed forthwith to con<lb break="no"/>sider the speech delivered yesterday by His

     Excellency to both houses of parliament. I 
     <lb/>
     understand that it is in order to make this

     kind of motion to apply to the proceedings of 
     <lb/>
     today only, but I would have no objection to 
     <lb/>
     its applying to the proceedings of the house 
     <lb/>
     until otherwise ordered by the house, if it is 
     <lb/>
     the desire of hon. members that the motion

     be in that form. I have it in the two alterna<lb break="no"/>tive forms:

     that forty-eight hours' notice has not been

     the first form, which would provide for the

     observation of the leader of the opposition

     that since the speech was delivered only

     yesterday it would be unusual to require him

     way about it, and wishes, after the mover and

     the seconder have been heard, to move the 
     <lb/>

     tabled. It includes two additional items 
     <lb/>
     which were not in the first printed copies 
     <lb/>
     distributed to the members this morning. 
     <lb/>
     The second of the additional items is a notice 
     <lb/>
     of motion by the Prime Minister. It reads 
     <lb/>
     as follows:

     On inquiry I found that the copy which 
     <lb/>
     contains the motion I have just read is not 
     <lb/>
     yet on the desks of most hon. members. I 
     <lb/>
     think it would clarify the procedure if we 
     <lb/>
     could be told why one copy of <hi rendition="simple:italic">Votes and Pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings</hi> was delivered and then a subsequent 
     <lb/>
     copy delivered which contains a new and 
     <lb/>
     very important motion.

     the leader of the opposition right away. As. 
     <lb/>
     I announced in the house yesterday afternoon, 
     <lb/>
     I gave notice of this motion, which is the last 
     <lb/>
     item on the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Votes and Proceedings</hi> that the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman has just read, and when I got 
     <lb/>
     the first issue of <hi rendition="simple:italic">Votes and Proceedings</hi> this. 
     <lb/>
     morning I was surprised to find it was not 
     <lb/>
     there. I communicated with the Clerk of the 
     <lb/>
     House, who verified the fact that he had it, 
     <lb/>
     but through some omission it had not gone 
     <lb/>
     to the printer. He told me that it was not 
     <lb/>
     the first time that there had been an over<lb break="no"/>sight of this kind, and that he would see that 
     <lb/>
     the printer had the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Votes and Proceedings</hi> 
     <lb/>
     completed in time for the sitting this after<lb break="no"/>noon. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think I might take this opportunity to say 
     <lb/>
     that I have had representations from hon. 
     <lb/>
     members on both sides of the house, who, in 
     <lb/>
     spite of their realization of the urgency of 
     <lb/>
     proceeding with the Newfoundland terms of 
     <lb/>
     union so that we may have them dealt with 
     <lb/>
     by this parliament and subsequently by the 
     <lb/>
     parliament of the United Kingdom before 
     <lb/>
     March 31, feel they would like to have all 
     <lb/>
     next week devoted to the debate on the 
     <lb/>
     address. When this motion is called tomorrow,

     <lb/>
     for his gracious speech addressed to both

     houses of parliament, the people of the con<lb break="no"/>stituency of Essex West, which I have the 
     <lb/>
     pleasure to represent in this house, are 
     <lb/>
     honoured and privileged to join with 
     <lb/>
     Canadians from the Atlantic to the Pacific in 
     <lb/>
     our tribute of loyalty and affection to His 
     <lb/>
     Majesty, George VI, our king, and his gracious 
     <lb/>
     consort, Queen Elizabeth. We do this, not 
     <lb/>
     with a feeling of subservience or subordina<lb break="no"/>tion, but with the dignity of fidelity and 
     <lb/>
     allegiance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We recognize and admire the attitude of 
     <lb/>
     sincerity which Their Majesties attach to 
     <lb/>
     their high office, their kindliness to the prob<lb break="no"/>lems affecting their millions of subjects, their 
     <lb/>
     thoughtfulness of those afflicted, and the 
     <lb/>
     standard they have set for the world in their 
     <lb/>
     domestic lives by the grace, gentility and 
     <lb/>
     simplicity of their home living. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Canadians in all walks of life have learned 
     <lb/>
     with rejoicing of His Majesty's recent 
     <lb/>
     recovery from a serious physical disorder, and 
     <lb/>
     have breathed a prayer of thanksgiving for 
     <lb/>
     his restoration to health and strength. We 
     <lb/>
     humbly express to him our sympathy in the 
     <lb/>
     discomfort and suffering which he has 
     <lb/>
     endured, but are consoled by the promise that 
     <lb/>
     "the darkest hour precedes the dawn". 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The British commonwealth of nations for 
     <lb/>
     many years has looked, hopefully and expect<lb break="no"/>antly, for word of an heir to the throne. On 
     <lb/>
     November 14, 1948, this long awaited promise 
     <lb/>
     was fulfilled in the birth of "wee Bonnie 
     <lb/>
     Prince Charlie" to Her Royal Highness Prin<lb break="no"/>cess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh. 
     <lb/>
     To the parents of the baby, christened Charles 
     <lb/>
     Philip Arthur George of Edinburgh, we 
     <lb/>
     extend our sincere congratulations. To the 
     <lb/>
     baby, all Canada extends its hope and prayer 
     <lb/>
     for a lifetime of health for himself, happiness 
     <lb/>
     with his family, and success in his relation<lb break="no"/>ship with his loyal subjects.

            <p>
     The year just passed has brought many 
     <lb/>
     changes in our national life and personalities. 
     <lb/>
     The Right Hon. William Lyon Mackenzie 
     <lb/>
     King, who had held office longer than any 
     <lb/>
     other prime minister in the British empire, 
     <lb/>
     retired from his post as Prime Minister and 
     <lb/>
     leader of the Liberal party. Mr. King's 
     <lb/>
     dynamic leadership of the House of Commons, 
     <lb/>
     his unbounded energy in upholding that 
     <lb/>
     which he thought best for his country, and 
     <lb/>
     his unfailing courtesy, thoughtfulness and 
     <lb/>
     kindness, will always be an inspiration to the 
     <lb/>
     members of this house. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     A man of peace, who abhorred war, he led 
     <lb/>
     Canada Victoriously through the bitter storm 
     <lb/>
     and strife of conflict into the calm harbour 
     <lb/>
     of peace and prosperity, with distinction to 
     <lb/>
     himself and with honour to his country. His 
     <lb/>
     career of self-sacrificing service will be a 
     <lb/>
     beacon light to the youth of Canada for 
     <lb/>
     generations yet unborn. His followers will 
     <lb/>
     remember his uncanny insight and perspica<lb break="no"/>city ; the opposition will remember him for 
     <lb/>
     his vigour and tenacity; but the little people 
     <lb/>
     of Canada will remember him as their friend 
     <lb/>
     and champion. History will be very kind to 
     <lb/>
     William Lyon Mackenzie King. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     During the past year the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Neepawa (Mr. Bracken) found it necessary to 
     <lb/>
     retire as leader of the official opposition. 
     <lb/>
     During his term the hon. member endeared 
     <lb/>
     himself to all members of this house, regard<lb break="no"/>less of party affiliations, by his warmth of 
     <lb/>
     friendliness, his vigour of opposition in the 
     <lb/>
     house, and his courtesy and affability outside 
     <lb/>
     the house. We wish him well. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the turning of the pages of the history 
     <lb/>
     of this house, we are now proud to have as 
     <lb/>
     our leader one who is truly a Canadian of 
     <lb/>
     distinctionâ€”Right Hon. Louis Stephen St. 
     <lb/>
     Laurent. Mr. St. Laurent, having heard the 
     <lb/>
     clear call of duty, has rejected personal placid 
     <lb/>
     interests to accept the highest post of service 
     <lb/>
     to his countryâ€”that of Prime Minister. In 
     <lb/>
     this arduous position he will have every 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of displaying to the fullest extent 
     <lb/>
     his widely known powers of conciliation and 
     <lb/>
     sagacity. We on this side of the house are 
     <lb/>
     privileged to serve under his benevolent 
     <lb/>
     direction and admonition. May Canada con<lb break="no"/>tinue to prosper and expand in stature among 
     <lb/>
     the nations of the world during his term of 
     <lb/>
     office. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It has been said that a government is as 
     <lb/>
     strong as its opposition. We are also welcom<lb break="no"/>ing a new leader of the official opposition, 
     <lb/>
     who comes to this chamber with many years 
     <lb/>
     of experience as premier of my own prov<lb break="no"/>ince, the province of Ontario. He has shown 
     <lb/>
     much energy and aggressiveness in his public 
     <lb/>
     career. We trust that his leadership of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition will be vigorous and constructive. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     On the 11th day of December, 1948, an 
     <lb/>
     agreement was entered into by the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     of Canada having the effect of bringing into 
     <lb/>
     the confederation of the Dominion of Canada 
     <lb/>
     the province of Newfoundland, thus uniting 
     <lb/>
     in legislative matters two branches of the 
     <lb/>
     British commonwealth of nations, living side 
     <lb/>
     by side and having similar hopes and ideals. 
     <lb/>
     The people of my constituency join with all 
     <lb/>
     Canada in extending a warm and cordial wel<lb break="no"/>come to Newfoundland, the tenth province of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian family of provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The agreement for union of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     has not come about without having to hurdle 
     <lb/>
     many obstacles; but with two groups of 
     <lb/>
     people, such as Canada and Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     with the same customs, principles, and aspir<lb break="no"/>ations, the union would seem to be natural. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Upon referendum submitted to the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland, the desire to enter into 
     <lb/>
     confederation with Canada was expressed. 
     <lb/>
     Subsequently representatives of Canada and 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland met and determined the 
     <lb/>
     arrangements for the union, which upon 
     <lb/>
     approval of the parliament of Canada will 
     <lb/>
     come into effect on the 3lst day of March 
     <lb/>
     next. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Canada and Newfoundland have much in 
     <lb/>
     common for a union. Both have the same 
     <lb/>
     heritage in freedom of action, speech and 
     <lb/>
     religion. Both have the same political tradi<lb break="no"/>tions. Both have grown to maturity side by 
     <lb/>
     side, and each has been able to observe the 
     <lb/>
     progress of the other. Both have realized 
     <lb/>
     that in a fastâ€”moving world they need one 
     <lb/>
     another for their common defence. Both see 
     <lb/>
     that the greatest good, by way of special 
     <lb/>
     reforms and security, can come to the ordin<lb break="no"/>ary citizen in both places only if united we 
     <lb/>
     stand. We believe we can offer to Newfound<lb break="no"/>land much in the way of trade, but we need 
     <lb/>
     also what Newfoundland has to contribute. 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland has lumber and pulpwood; it 
     <lb/>
     has fish and sea foods. It has vast deposits of 
     <lb/>
     iron ore and other metals. But, more than 
     <lb/>
     anything else, we welcome the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. We realize they are a proud 
     <lb/>
     people, of rugged nature, strong and indus<lb break="no"/>trious, anxious to take their full share of 
     <lb/>
     responsibility, and that they expect their full 
     <lb/>
     share of the gains. We Canadians are proud 
     <lb/>
     to become associated with them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We will undoubtedly encounter differences 
     <lb/>
     of opinion from time to time; but, having 
     <lb/>
     visited each of the nine existing provinces of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, I have observed that, while govern<lb break="no"/>ments may often disagree, the common people 
     <lb/>
     of our dominion have the same high goal 
     <lb/>
     always before themâ€”that of peace, industry, 
     <lb/>
     integrity, and security. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is in this spirit of partnership that we 
     <lb/>
     extend our welcome to the tenth province of 
     <lb/>
          
   
   

            <cb/>

        
     the Dominion of Canada, the province of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. 
            </p>
            

            <p>
     My constituency, that of Essex West, 
     <lb/>
     borders on the Detroit river for approximately 
     <lb/>
     fifteen miles. Discussions on the St. Law<lb break="no"/>rence waterway development are therefore of 
     <lb/>
     vital interest to us, as they should be to all 
     <lb/>
     other parts of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     By our methods of production we in Canada 
     <lb/>
     do not depend upon domestic markets. We 
     <lb/>
     are a trading nation. We export to the four 
     <lb/>
     corners of the world. In fact I believe we 
     <lb/>
     export about one-third of all the goods we 
     <lb/>
     produce. This probably would be much 
     <lb/>
     higher in my own constituency. We are 
     <lb/>
     therefore most anxious to devise ways and 
     <lb/>
     means by which, wherever and whenever 
     <lb/>
     possible, we can reduce the cost of the goods 
     <lb/>
     we produce and at the same time maintain 
     <lb/>
     our high level of living. One of the items 
     <lb/>
     which contribute to the increased price of 
     <lb/>
     our goods in competition with other goods of 
     <lb/>
     a similar nature on the world market is that 
     <lb/>
     of transportation of our goods to the consumer 
     <lb/>
     in the distant land. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Canada has access to 2,400 miles of water<lb break="no"/>ways from Fort William to the Atlantic ocean. 
     <lb/>
     This great waterway, for the most part, is of 
     <lb/>
     deep navigable water with a height of 600 
     <lb/>
     feet of falling energy. This waterway is 
     <lb/>
     similar to a series of saucepans with the spout 
     <lb/>
     of one dropping into the pan below, but with 
     <lb/>
     the spout of the final saucepan corroded with 
     <lb/>
     rocks, timber, and fearâ€”fear of debt and 
     <lb/>
     disaster. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Time passes on. When Jacques Cartier 
     <lb/>
     sailed up the St. Lawrence to claim the 
     <lb/>
     wilderness for France, little did he realize 
     <lb/>
     what he was startingâ€”for this was the first 
     <lb/>
     link in the chain of events which has led to 
     <lb/>
     the struggle to obtain a free outlet to the sea 
     <lb/>
     â€”a freedom from the bonds of nature. 
     <lb/>
     Champlain, La Salle and all the great explor<lb break="no"/>ers have seen the need for this direct water 
     <lb/>
     route from the sea to that great inland 
     <lb/>
     empire of Canada. And now it is hoped the 
     <lb/>
     final removal of the impediment of the ages 
     <lb/>
     will be realized. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Since the days of the early settlers in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, wheelbarrows have become bull<lb break="no"/>dozers; the old buckboard has become the 
     <lb/>
     sleek sedan; the magic lantern, the television 
     <lb/>
     set. The sailing vessel has become the modern 
     <lb/>
     oil burner. And the steamships have grown 
     <lb/>
     from the impressive length of 250 feet and a
