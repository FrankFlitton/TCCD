            <p>
               Mr. Blake rose to move an amendment 
               <lb/>
               having reference to that portion of the reso<lb break="no"/>lution, which applied to the acquisition by 
               <lb/>
               Canada of the public lands of Newfoundland. 
               <lb/>
               He would not wait till that resolution was 
               <lb/>
               moved, considering it material that amend<lb break="no"/>ments should be submitted at once, inasmuch 
               <lb/>
               as if it succeeded it would displace the whole 
               <lb/>
               of the present scheme, which would have to 
               <lb/>
               be re-arranged upon some other basis. He was 
               <lb/>
               opposed to the acquisition by Canada of the 
               <lb/>
               public lands of Newfoundland. He was deci<lb break="no"/>dedly opposed to the loss by Newfoundland 
               <lb/>
               of the public lands. The British North Amer<lb break="no"/>ica Act provided that the public lands of

               each of the Provinces which were by that 
               <lb/>
               Act united should be retained by those prov<lb break="no"/>inces. He believed the policy carried out by

               the Act in that respect was unquestionable.<lb/>

               <lb/>
               and the attempt to manage the lands of the 
               <lb/>
               different Provinces on different principles, 
               <lb/>
               might also prove antagonistic to local feelings. 
               <lb/>
               In the second place, the distance from the 
               <lb/>
               seat of the General Government of the lands 
               <lb/>
               taken under its control, would be so great as 
               <lb/>
               of necessity to weaken the hands stretched 
               <lb/>
               out so far, and to induce a management less 
               <lb/>
               careful and less susceptible of being controlled 
               <lb/>
               by the public opinion of the Provinces, than 
               <lb/>
               would be the management by the Province 
               <lb/>
               itself. In the third place, the distance and the 
               <lb/>
               larger functions of the General Government 
               <lb/>
               would necessarily increase the cost of the 
               <lb/>
               administration of the public lands. And, lastly, 
               <lb/>
               however prosperous the administration might 
               <lb/>
               be, there could be no question that any 
               <lb/>
               attempt by the general Government to reap 
               <lb/>
               a revenue from the public lands of the Prov<lb break="no"/>ince or to apply the fruits of that prosperity 
               <lb/>
               to general or other than Local purposes would 
               <lb/>
               involve a feeling of dissatisfaction in the 
               <lb/>
               Province concerned. These were some thought 
               <lb/>
               not all the reasons which occurred to him 
               <lb/>
               why, from a Canadian point of view, it was 
               <lb/>
               right that the General Government should 
               <lb/>
               abstain from assuming to itself the public 
               <lb/>
               lands of the Provinces. Then as regarded the 
               <lb/>
               Province itself he thought it of great im<lb break="no"/>portance, of exceptionally great importance, 
               <lb/>
               in the case of Newfoundland, that their own 
               <lb/>
               lands should be retained in their own hands, 
               <lb/>
               having regard to the distance of the Province 
               <lb/>
               from the Seat of Government and to the com<lb break="no"/>parative smallness of its representation. Here 
               <lb/>
               it was, to say the least, not at all unlikely 
               <lb/>
               that the policy which, at this distance, might 
               <lb/>
               be adopted with reference to the lands of 
               <lb/>
               Newfoundland, might be distasteful to the 
               <lb/>
               people of that Province. If any chance existed, 
               <lb/>
               and he should be sorry for a moment to cast 
               <lb/>
               a doubt upon the chance of those lands as<lb break="no"/>suming, not from their agricultural qualities, 
               <lb/>
               but from the possible development of their 
               <lb/>
               mineral wealth great additional value, it was 
               <lb/>
               obvious that that value was more likely to 
               <lb/>
               be promoted by local administration on the 
               <lb/>
               spot. The position of the Local Legislature 
               <lb/>
               and the Provincial institutions of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land would, to his mind, be overborne and 
               <lb/>
               almost destroyed if they abstracted from that 
               <lb/>
               Legislature this function. The population of 
               <lb/>
               that Colony was small. It did not largely 
               <lb/>
               exceed the population of the Municipal Cor<lb break="no"/>poration, one of the divisions of which he

               Mr. Blake proceeded to say that the func<lb break="no"/>tions which would be left to the Legislature 
               <lb/>
               of Newfoundland to discharge were almost 
               <lb/>
               exclusively of a municipal character, and if 
               <lb/>
               they took away from it the management of 
               <lb/>
               its lands, he failed to see why they retained 
               <lb/>
               in Newfoundland the expensive machinery of 
               <lb/>
               a legislative body. Therefore the policy of the 
               <lb/>
               Union Act in regard to public lands while 
               <lb/>
               eminently sound as to all the Provinces, ap<lb break="no"/>peared to him with reference to this Colony 
               <lb/>
               above and beyond all the other Colonies 
               <lb/>
               sound, and he thought a misfortune would be 
               <lb/>
               inflicted both on the Dominion and on New<lb break="no"/>foundland, if we took away from that Colony 
               <lb/>
               the management of its lands and assumed it 
               <lb/>
               ourselves. He objected, also, that there was 
               <lb/>
               no necessity for this arrangement. The pro<lb break="no"/>posed barter of the public lands of New<lb break="no"/>foundland for $150,000 a-year, was a sham 
               <lb/>
               bargain. The Dominion would never reap 
               <lb/>
               pecuniarily and directly any advantage from 
               <lb/>
               these mines and minerals. The development 
               <lb/>
               of the mineral wealth of the Colony would 
               <lb/>
               promote the prosperity of Newfoundland, and, 
               <lb/>
               through it, the prosperity of Canada; but to 
               <lb/>
               attempt to derive a revenue from it, would 
               <lb/>
               be to strike a flat blow at the prospect of 
               <lb/>
               mineral development at all. If we did our 
               <lb/>
               duty by Newfoundland, in properly develop<lb break="no"/>ing her mineral wealth, we could not expect 
               <lb/>
               to derive a revenue from those lands. Under 
               <lb/>
               these circumstances, if the choice were be<lb break="no"/>tween our giving $150,000 a year to New<lb break="no"/>foundland and taking her lands, and our 
               <lb/>
               giving $150,000 a year to Newfoundland and 
               <lb/>
               leaving her lands, he would unhesitatingly 
               <lb/>
               vote in favour of the latter of these two pro<lb break="no"/>positions. He believed the prosperity of the 
               <lb/>
               Colony would be largely enhanced by the 
               <lb/>
               adoption of the latter alternative, and the 
               <lb/>
               pecuniary results to Canada, would also be 
               <lb/>
               largely enhanced by it. He had considered as 
               <lb/>
               attentively as he could what was the relative

               their views had been the alternative terms

               should affirm this view, of entering into such 
               <lb/>
               negotiations as would result in bringing down 
               <lb/>

               the following amendment: “That by the

               British North America Act of 1867, it is in 
               <lb/>
               effect provided that each of the Provinces by

               that Act united, should retain its public lands; 
               <lb/>
               that the public lands of Newfoundland pro<lb break="no"/>posed to be purchased by Canada at the price

               of $150,000 a year, or $3,000,000, do not pay 
               <lb/>
               the expenses of management; that the public

               lands may be managed more efficiently, eco<lb break="no"/>nomically and satisfactorily by the Province

               in which they are situated than by Canada;

               that there is no good reason for a departure

            <p>
               Hon. Mr. Tilley agreed that by the provi<lb break="no"/>sions of the British North America Act each 
               <lb/>
               Province controlled its own public domain, 
               <lb/>
               but he was speaking in the presence of mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the conferences of Quebec and Lon<lb break="no"/>don, who knew as well as he did that the 
               <lb/>
               proposition was made that the management 
               <lb/>
               and control of public lands should be vested 
               <lb/>
               in the Dominion. It was urged at great length, 
               <lb/>
               cogent reasons were advanced at the con<lb break="no"/>ference at London especially that the public 
               <lb/>
               lands should not be in the hands of the Local 
               <lb/>
               Governments. The General Government 
               <lb/>
               having control of emigration, &amp;c., it was felt 
               <lb/>
               that in order to give effect to such schemes 
               <lb/>
               as they might propose, and to secure uniform<lb break="no"/>ity of system, that the public domain should 
               <lb/>
               be administered by the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, that they could manage it more judi<lb break="no"/>ciously and wisely than the local Govern<lb break="no"/>ments. The majority decided that the land 
               <lb/>
               should remain, as far as the four Provinces 
               <lb/>
               were concerned, in the hands of the Local 
               <lb/>
               Legislature. But it was not so with New<lb break="no"/>foundland. In the case of that Province, they 
               <lb/>
               themselves suggested that their lands should 
               <lb/>
               be placed in the hands of the Dominion Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment.<lb/>

               settling wild lands, emigration, and with re<lb break="no"/>gard to the resources of the Dominion, that it 
               <lb/>
               was in the public interest that all Canada 
               <lb/>
               lands should be placed in the hands of the 
               <lb/>
               Dominion. But the Constitution had settled 
               <lb/>
               this otherwise in the case of the Provinces in 
               <lb/>
               Confederation. With reference to the nature 
               <lb/>
               of the agreement, he desired to say a word or 
               <lb/>
               two. He desired to state why he thought Par<lb break="no"/>liament should assent to this proposition, and 
               <lb/>
               why the people of Newfoundland had a right 
               <lb/>
               to expect that it should not be rejected. The 
               <lb/>
               arrangements made at Quebec were subse<lb break="no"/>quently aflirmed and confirmed by the Domi<lb break="no"/>nion. In the first place the arrangements then 
               <lb/>
               made differed little from the general prin<lb break="no"/>ciples contained in the London resolutions 
               <lb/>
               respecting the other Provinces. The proposi<lb break="no"/>tion that $150,000 should be paid for the land 
               <lb/>
               of Newfoundland was assented to by an over<lb break="no"/>whelming majority of the Parliament of 
               <lb/>
               Canada.

               Hon. Mr. Holton—We had never said the

               London resolutions. 
               <lb/>

            <p>
               Hon. Mr. Tilley—We had them in the Act 
               <lb/>
               of Parliament subsequently affirmed. It was 
               <lb/>
               aflirmed not only by the Canadian Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, but by people of New Brunswick at 
               <lb/>
               the polls, and subsequently by the Legislature 
               <lb/>
               of Nova Scotia. Having shown that the prin<lb break="no"/>ciples of the London Conference were en<lb break="no"/>dorsed throughout the Dominion by the lead<lb break="no"/>ing members of the Conference, all but one 
               <lb/>
               having been elected at the general election, 
               <lb/>
               the honourable gentleman went on to regret 
               <lb/>
               that the followers of Hon. Mr. Brown, a lead<lb break="no"/>ing member of the Conference, had not taken 
               <lb/>
               the view of this question which he had, and 
               <lb/>
               would doubtless have done. In his Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion speeches, and the articles which he had 
               <lb/>
               written with his own hand, no doubt that 
               <lb/>
               honourable gentleman had strongly urged the 
               <lb/>
               advantages of having Newfoundland in the 
               <lb/>
               Union on the terms of the Quebec Conference. 
               <lb/>
               That the sum proposed to be paid to New<lb break="no"/>foundland was not regarded by them as a 
               <lb/>
               bribe, or as offering extraordinary induce<lb break="no"/>ments to them to enter Confederation, was 
               <lb/>
               evidenced by their taking four years to arrive

               at their present conclusion. As to the sum the 
               <lb/>
               Dominion would lose, he did not think any<lb break="no"/>thing like what honourable gentlemen oppo<lb break="no"/>site imagined. Calculations carefully made of 
               <lb/>
               the whole imports of 1867, under the Canadian 
               <lb/>
               tariff as it stands, but omitting what was 
               <lb/>
               imported that year from New Brunswick, 
               <lb/>
               Nova Scotia, Quebec, and Ontario, showed the 
               <lb/>
               amount to be $663,393.63. 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. Mackenzie wished the details. This was 
               <lb/>
               an important statement and might have an 
               <lb/>
               important effect on the House. 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Hon. Mr. Tilley said the statement was not 
               <lb/>
               made on his authority but on good authority, 
               <lb/>
               and he would hand in the paper with the 
               <lb/>
               details. Again it had to be borne in mind that 
               <lb/>
               previous to Union the tariff of Newfoundland, 
               <lb/>
               which was lower than that of any of the Prov<lb break="no"/>inces at that time, yielded more in proportion 
               <lb/>
               than any other Province in the Dominion. If 
               <lb/>
               that continued to be the case, and if even 
               <lb/>
               under the higher tariff of Canada it yielded $4 
               <lb/>
               per head as might be fairly expected, that 
               <lb/>
               would amount to nearly $600,000. The hon. 
               <lb/>
               gentleman argued that under no circumstances 
               <lb/>
               could the loss be very great, and proceeded to 
               <lb/>
               look at the question from another point of 
               <lb/>
               View. Take, he said, the whole of the butter, 
               <lb/>
               biscuit, and other products of Canada as well 
               <lb/>
               as her manufactures to a large extent, and 
               <lb/>
               we find that even though large reductions in 
               <lb/>
               the imports of woollens and leather should 
               <lb/>
               take place in Newfoundland, there would still 
               <lb/>
               be left $525,000. If this were the case certainly 
               <lb/>
               the loss of the Dominion could not be very 
               <lb/>
               great. Another calculation was this: Apply the 
               <lb/>
               tariff of last session to the imports of 1867 
               <lb/>
               and it gives $219,185.48. The inference is that 
               <lb/>
               after Confederation, inasmuch as there is no 
               <lb/>
               doubt that they will continue to consume more 
               <lb/>
               goods than in Canada, we will still be left a 
               <lb/>
               handsome sum coming into the Treasury 
               <lb/>
               annually from that Island. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man next defended Newfoundland from the 
               <lb/>
               accusation recently made. He denied that 
               <lb/>
               Newfoundland was a pauper community and 
               <lb/>
               showed from her banking returns that not 
               <lb/>
               only did the masses of the people deposit 
               <lb/>
               more largely in Banks than was the case in 
               <lb/>
               the other Provinces of the Dominion, but that 
               <lb/>
               the general condition of the trading commu<lb break="no"/>nity was healthful. During 18 years in business 
               <lb/>
               in St. John’s, Newfoundland, the Bank of 
               <lb/>
               British North America never lost a dollar. He 
               <lb/>
               noticed the fact that almhouses and similar 
               <lb/>
               institutions were supported by the Legislature, 
               <lb/>
               but that last year they had abolished all 
               <lb/>
               grants to able-bodied poor. He also noticed

               the economy in the administration of affairs,

               <lb/>
               of Newfoundland must be an immense acces<lb break="no"/>sion to the Union. He wished he had the

               power and eloquence of the Hon. Mr. Brown 
               <lb/>
               when expatiating on this subject. (Hear, hear.) 
               <lb/>
               If that honourable gentleman were on the 
               <lb/>
               floor of the House today, he would take larger, 
               <lb/>
               more liberal, and more able views of this

               question than were taken by honourable 
               <lb/>
               gentlemen usually following him. The Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of Customs having deprecated viewing 
               <lb/>
               this question from a practical point of view, 
               <lb/>
               proceeded to take credit to the representa<lb break="no"/>tives of New Brunswick for having to a man 
               <lb/>
               voted for the acquisition of the North-West 
               <lb/>
               Territory. They did not stop to ask the ques<lb break="no"/>tion: What had they in that North-West Terri<lb break="no"/>tory to contribute to us? but though not di<lb break="no"/>rectly interested, they felt that the Dominion 
               <lb/>
               at large would be benefitted, and cheerfully 
               <lb/>
               voted for this great land purchase. As to the 
               <lb/>
               proposition now before the House, it only 
               <lb/>
               carried out a portion of the same great scheme 
               <lb/>
               of Union. He hoped hon. gentlemen from all 
               <lb/>

            <p>
               Hon. Mr. Galt was strongly in favour of 
               <lb/>
               continuing the work of Union and consolida<lb break="no"/>tion so happily begun on this continent. The 
               <lb/>
               present terms offered by Newfoundland, 
               <lb/>
               should, he urged, be accepted, as they were 
               <lb/>
               substantially those adopted by the Quebec 
               <lb/>
               Conference, and subsequently by the Parlia<lb break="no"/>ments of Canada, and New Brunswick, and 
               <lb/>
               Nova Scotia, and they were terms not un<lb break="no"/>reasonable or unjust in any respect whatever. 
               <lb/>
               He took issue with the member for West Dur<lb break="no"/>ham in his proposition that the land ought to 
               <lb/>
               be in the hands of the Local Governments. He 
               <lb/>
               believed the public domain ought to be under 
               <lb/>
               the control of the Dominion. It ought to be at 
               <lb/>
               the disposal of the only Legislature which 
               <lb/>
               could have a uniform policy on emigration 
               <lb/>
               and settlement. The hon. gentleman argued, 
               <lb/>
               too, that if the mineral lands were placed at 
               <lb/>
               the disposal of the Dominion they would en<lb break="no"/>deavour to extract from them their $150,000 a 
               <lb/>
               year, and the industry of Newfoundland 
               <lb/>
               would be depressed. Precisely the contrary re<lb break="no"/>sult would in his (Mr. Galt’s) opinion follow. 
               <lb/>
               If the lands were left in the hands of the 
               <lb/>
               Local Government they had to depend on 
               <lb/>
               them for the means of local administration. It 
               <lb/>
               was clear that no liberal policy would be in

               who endorsed the Quebec resolutions should 
               <lb/>
               always abide by them. Under what circum<lb break="no"/>stances were these resolutions adopted? 
               <lb/>
               Under the statement that the resolutions must 
               <lb/>
               be adopted in their entirety or not at all. But 
               <lb/>
               already the Government themselves had vio<lb break="no"/>lated that compact in London and subse<lb break="no"/>quently, and it was absurd to endeavour to 
               <lb/>
               force hon. gentlemen to cling to it, merely be<lb break="no"/>cause it suited the occupants of the Treasury 
               <lb/>
               Benches. He would vote for the amendment, 
               <lb/>
               believing this land purchase to be one which 
               <lb/>
               the country would not sustain. At the same 
               <lb/>
               time, he was not at all desirous to throw any 
               <lb/>
               obstacle in the way of Newfoundland coming 
               <lb/>
               into the Union. He hoped to see that Union 
               <lb/>
               speedily and satisfactorily completed.

               Hon. Mr. McDougall considered that the 
               <lb/>
               amendment proposed by his hon. friend was 
               <lb/>
               contrary in principle to the votes that gentle<lb break="no"/>man had heretofore given. He thought the 
               <lb/>
               hon. gentleman who had last spoken was not 
               <lb/>
               acting consistently with his former Union 
               <lb/>
               principles, because the terms to which he ob<lb break="no"/>jected were essentially the same as those for 
               <lb/>
               which he had formerly voted. If his hon. 
               <lb/>
               friends opposite were really sincere in their 
               <lb/>
               professions of a desire for Union they should 
               <lb/>
               not take objection to the terms agreed to by 
               <lb/>
               the Quebec Conference. It was true that the 
               <lb/>
               lands of Newfoundland were not so valuable 
               <lb/>
               as those of the Northwest territory, but if we 
               <lb/>
               were to complete the work of Confederation 
               <lb/>
               such a consideration should have no weight. 
               <lb/>
               He would ask the hon. member for Wellington 
               <lb/>
               South if the principle he had laid down was 
               <lb/>
               ever followed in the County Council. The op<lb break="no"/>posite principle was almost invariably fol<lb break="no"/>lowed, and the more productive parts of a 
               <lb/>
               county were called on to assist in the develop<lb break="no"/>ment of the less productive parts. This prin<lb break="no"/>ciple should be applied to the development of 
               <lb/>
               the Dominion if we ever were to become a 
               <lb/>

               Hon. Mr. Anglin said that it was quite pos<lb break="no"/>sible that in the Quebec Conference the reso<lb break="no"/>lution to give the £30,000 was adopted as a

               <lb/>
               assume all the lands, he never heard of it be<lb break="no"/>fore. It would have been contrary to the 
               <lb/>
               understanding generally arrived at, and it was 
               <lb/>
               well there had been no enactment. He had, it

               was true, taken a different line in this debate 
               <lb/>
               from that used by him in his speeches in New 
               <lb/>
               Brunswick, but this was owing to his not hav<lb break="no"/>ing accepted the situation of the period al<lb break="no"/>luded to. Since he had occupied it these argu<lb break="no"/>ments had all been taken out of his mouth.

            <p>
               Hon. Mr. Gray had understood the member 
               <lb/>
               for West Durham to argue not that this sum of 
               <lb/>
               $150,000 should not be given to Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, but that her public lands should not be 
               <lb/>
               taken as an exchange. He (Mr. Gray) did not 
               <lb/>
               see how hon. members could justify them<lb break="no"/>selves to their constituents if they supported 
               <lb/>
               such a proposition, and gave Newfoundland 
               <lb/>
               this exceptional privilege, not extended to the 
               <lb/>
               other Provinces, of receiving so very large a 
               <lb/>
               sum without any consideration. The resolution 
               <lb/>
               left it optional with Newfoundland to retain 
               <lb/>
               her land. He would prefer that she would, but 
               <lb/>
               he would rather take her with this encum<lb break="no"/>brance than leave her out of the Union. 
               <lb/>
               Already there was a low murmuring of dis<lb break="no"/>content at the departure from the conditions 
               <lb/>
               of union proposed with reference to Nova 
               <lb/>
               Scotia, and who could tell to what height that 
               <lb/>
               might grow, if $150,000 a year were to be 
               <lb/>
               given to Newfoundland, without receiving the 
               <lb/>
               consideration which was stipulated in the 
               <lb/>
               resolutions of the Quebec Conference.

            <p>
               Hon. Mr. Wood thought the important ques<lb break="no"/>tion was this—what sum would be required 
               <lb/>
               by the Newfoundland Legislature to carry on 
               <lb/>
               its local service? That sum being once ascer<lb break="no"/>tained, Canada should freely give it. He 
               <lb/>
               thought it mean and unpatriotic to enter into 
               <lb/>
               a very minute calculation of dollars and cents. 
               <lb/>
               He did not think the amount estimated by the 
               <lb/>
               Minister of Finance was too large. He did not 
               <lb/>
               expect that for some time the revenue we 
               <lb/>
               would receive from Newfoundland would 
               <lb/>
               equal the expenditure we incurred on her 
               <lb/>
               behalf, but by opening a new market to us, 
               <lb/>
               and by stimulating the industry of the Island, 
               <lb/>
               and increasing its population, the Union would 
               <lb/>
               be indirectly of great advantage to the 
               <lb/>
               Dominion. The only part of the scheme he 
               <lb/>
               objected to was this—as to public lands, he 
               <lb/>
               would much prefer that Newfoundland would 
               <lb/>
               keep her own lands, and with that view he 
               <lb/>
               would not object to the special subsidy being

               Sir John A. Macdonald said if he believed 
               <lb/>
               Mr. Blake’s amendment carried out the views 
               <lb/>
               expressed by the hon. gentleman who had just 
               <lb/>
               sat down he would almost be disposed to 
               <lb/>
               accept it, but he looked upon it as intended to 
               <lb/>
               defeat the whole scheme for union with New<lb break="no"/>foundland. The hon. gentleman had himself 
               <lb/>
               stated that he moved it as an amendment to 
               <lb/>
               the first resolution because, if carried, it 
               <lb/>
               would alter entirely the basis of the arrange<lb break="no"/>ment. The hon. gentleman said he would 
               <lb/>
               rather give the $150,000 and not take the 
               <lb/>
               lands, than give the $150,000 and take the 
               <lb/>
               lands; but he took care not to place it in his 
               <lb/>
               amendment, and if the amendment carried, 
               <lb/>
               and the Government proposed to increase the 
               <lb/>
               subsidy by $150,000, there would be another 
               <lb/>
               amendment declaring that any such proposi<lb break="no"/>tion would be an injustice to the other Prov<lb break="no"/>inces.

               Mr. Blake said he did not have it in con<lb break="no"/>templation to move any other amendment, nor 
               <lb/>
               was he aware that any hon. gentlemen on his

               side had any such intention.

               Sir John A. Macdonald was glad to hear 
               <lb/>
               that the hon. gentleman was in favour of the 
               <lb/>
               $150,000, but there were others who enter<lb break="no"/>tained different views. They had heard the 
               <lb/>
               member for Wellington South declare that he 
               <lb/>
               was not now bound by the agreement of the 
               <lb/>
               Quebec Conference. It was evident that in 
               <lb/>
               bringing forward this amendment the member 
               <lb/>
               for West Durham had been put upon by others 
               <lb/>
               who were not so sincere in bringing about the 
               <lb/>
               admission of Newfoundland on these terms. 
               <lb/>
               Newfoundland was situated differently from 
               <lb/>
               the other provinces. She had no internal re<lb break="no"/>sources; her wealth was mainly derived from 
               <lb/>
               the sea; and when these resources failed them 
               <lb/>
               they had no agricultural wealth to fall back 
               <lb/>
               upon like the other provinces. Therefore there 
               <lb/>
               was in this respect a necessity for Newfound<lb break="no"/>land to have some definite and certain source 
               <lb/>
               of revenue from her crown lands. If the lands 
               <lb/>
               remained in the possession of Newfoundland 
               <lb/>
               they had not the means of developing them; 
               <lb/>
               but if they were handed over to the Dominion 
               <lb/>
               something could undoubtedly be made out of 
               <lb/>
               them. A Mr. Bennett owned a mile square of 
               <lb/>
               land in the region of the copper mines and he 
               <lb/>
               had refused £250,000 sterling for it, and there 
               <lb/>
               was positive evidence that at least three other 
               <lb/>
               square miles were of equal value. Newfound<lb break="no"/>land was not able to open up these lands, but 
               <lb/>
               the Dominion was in a different position and 
               <lb/>
               was able to take means to ascertain what the 
               <lb/>
               wealth of the land and minerals was. The 
               <lb/>
               Province it would be observed, retained the 
               <lb/>
               power of determining within a year, whether 
               <lb/>
               it will relieve us of the payment of this

               Mr. Blake—You cannot after, in the agree<lb break="no"/>ment of Union, you assume their management. 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Sir John A. Macdonald then argued there 
               <lb/>
               was the consideration of national policy. New<lb break="no"/>foundland possessed the key to our front door. 
               <lb/>
               It might be considered chimerical, but he be<lb break="no"/>lieved there was something in the report of 
               <lb/>
               Mr. Sandford Fleming in reference to the 
               <lb/>
               shortest highway between this continent and 
               <lb/>
               Europe. He believed that the time would 
               <lb/>
               come, in our day, when the route across New<lb break="no"/>foundland would become the great highway of 
               <lb/>
               passenger traffic. He would repeat that if his 
               <lb/>
               hon. friend really wished, as he professed, to 
               <lb/>
               give the Crown lands to Newfoundland, and 
               <lb/>
               also the $150,000, then he should move a dis<lb break="no"/>tinct resolution to that effect. The only effect 
               <lb/>
               of his present amendment was to disturb the 
               <lb/>
               basis of the entire arrangement, and probably 
               <lb/>
               postpone the admission of Newfoundland into 
               <lb/>
               the Dominion for an indefinite period.

               Sir John A. Macdonald intimated that the

               <lb/>

               Mr. Mackenzie resumed the debate on the 
               <lb/>
               Newfoundland Resolutions. He said if he 
               <lb/>
               thought the amendment was susceptible of

               the interpretation given to it by the Premier, 
               <lb/>
               he most certainly should not vote for it. He 
               <lb/>
               was desirous of accomplishing the Union be<lb break="no"/>tween Newfoundland and the present Con<lb break="no"/>federated Provinces on as early a day, and on 
               <lb/>
               as just principles as possible. As a fruit of

               hoped to continue so to the last, and although

               Newfoundland was one of the smaller, and

               treatment at his hands. But while he said 
               <lb/>
               this, he must resent the attempt on the part 
               <lb/>
               of some hon. gentlemen to prevent a free dis<lb break="no"/>cussion and deliberation on the subject in this 
               <lb/>
               House. The Minister of Public Works has at<lb break="no"/>tacked his hon. friend from Wellington South, 
               <lb/>
               because that hon. gentleman held himself 
               <lb/>
               free from any obligations with reference to 
               <lb/>
               this question in consequence of the course 
               <lb/>
               taken at the Quebec Conference. He (Mr. 
               <lb/>
               Mackenzie,) endorsed the language of his hon. 
               <lb/>
               friend from Wellington South, to its entire ex<lb break="no"/>tent. The terms proposed at the Quebec Con<lb break="no"/>ference not having been then accepted, he 
               <lb/>
               considered that all parties were free to pro<lb break="no"/>pose new terms. The gentlemen who were now 
               <lb/>
               so ably representing Newfoundland had not 
               <lb/>
               considered themselves bound by these terms, 
               <lb/>
               but had come here with entirely new terms; 
               <lb/>
               and if so, why should any member of this 
               <lb/>
               House be held bound by those terms. He had 
               <lb/>
               been amused to hear the Minister of Public 
               <lb/>
               Works speak of the inconsistency of the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Wellington South. Nothing could be 
               <lb/>
               more grotesque than to hear the Minister of 
               <lb/>
               Public Works lecturing any gentleman for his 
               <lb/>
               inconsistency. That hon. gentleman had been 
               <lb/>
               found delivering opposition opinions on every 
               <lb/>
               possible subject at various periods in his his<lb break="no"/>tory. (Hear, hear.) He regretted that the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Customs should have imported into the 
               <lb/>
               discussion matter wholly irrelevant to the 
               <lb/>
               motion before the chair. He would not follow 
               <lb/>
               the hon. gentleman in his calculations as to 
               <lb/>
               the Customs further than to say that his 
               <lb/>
               figures were utterly incorrect. He was not 
               <lb/>
               surprised, however, that the Minister of Cus<lb break="no"/>toms’ reason should have made the mistake, 
               <lb/>
               when last year he made a mistake of nearly 
               <lb/>
               a million and a half on the probable proceeds 
               <lb/>
               of the Customs. He supposed his calculations 
               <lb/>
               as to the approximate income from New<lb break="no"/>foundland would turn out about as correct 
               <lb/>
               as his calculations as to the Customs last 
               <lb/>
               year. As regarded the motion before the chair 
               <lb/>
               he could not conceive anything more incon<lb break="no"/>sistent with the duties and obligations of the

               Dominion Government than that it should 
               <lb/>
               undertake the management of the public lands 
               <lb/>
               of Newfoundland. He could not understand 
               <lb/>
               how the member for Sherbrooke (Hon. Mr.

               Ontario at all events would not have accepted

               the Act. The Premier and the Minister of

               Public Works had taken ground to-night as

               conclusions arrived at by the Quebec Con<lb break="no"/>ference. The Minister of Public Works said it

               would be an act of gross bad faith if we

               already consummated; it would be an act of

               that Act would be to be guilty of gross bad

               which these hon. gentlemen were representing 
               <lb/>

               aspect. On his side of the House, they only

               proposed to void one of the conditions agreed

               It did not lie in the mouth of hon. gentlemen,

               New Brunswick 19c per head; and now they

               asked the House to agree to another departure

               gentlemen on his side thought it would be

               better that the Crown Lands of the Colony

               West territory there were at present no con<lb break="no"/>stituted authorities as there were in New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and it would not be pretended 
               <lb/>
               that after a Government was established in 
               <lb/>
               the North West, we would administer its 
               <lb/>
               lands from Ottawa. But if the Dominion as<lb break="no"/>sumed the public lands of Newfoundland we 
               <lb/>
               would have a land office established here 
               <lb/>
               requiring a special department for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose. At present these were administered very 
               <lb/>
               economically. The Surveyor-General received 
               <lb/>
               £400 sterling, and the extra expense was 
               <lb/>
               $6,000. According to these resolutions the

               Mr. Mackenzie said he had already shown

               there was no analogy between the two cases. 
               <lb/>
               Comparing the former management of the

               Customs in New Brunswick, of the post 
               <lb/>
               office in Nova Scotia, and various other 
               <lb/>
               branches, he found that everything which 
               <lb/>
               came under the management of this Govern<lb break="no"/>ment was conducted on an extravagant scale, 
               <lb/>
               and under any Government it would be im<lb break="no"/>possible to manage her public lands situated 
               <lb/>
               2,000 miles away as efficiently and economic<lb break="no"/>ally as they could be managed on the spot.

               Some stress has been laid on the value of the

               <lb/>
               where any Government had made money out 
               <lb/>
               of its mineral lands? The Treasurer of Ontario 
               <lb/>
               had stated that in the fall of 1867 he thought 
               <lb/>
               money could be made by the Government out 
               <lb/>
               of the mineral lands on Lake Superior, which 
               <lb/>
               were apparently far richer than those of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, but he had since found out his 
               <lb/>
               mistake. The Ontario Government had found 
               <lb/>
               that in attempting to make money out of their 
               <lb/>
               mineral lands they only succeeded in prevent<lb break="no"/>ing miners from going in, and so it would be

               in the case of Newfoundland. The conclusion,

               therefore, was inevitable, that it would be a

               <lb/>
               seek to acquire these lands. He was prepared

               Mr. Mackenzie said that in 1865 the leader 
               <lb/>
               of the Government brought down the scheme 
               <lb/>
               representing it as in the nature of a treaty, 
               <lb/>
               which must be accepted in its entirety or set 
               <lb/>
               aside. There were various parts of it which 
               <lb/>
               he did not like; but, on account of these repre<lb break="no"/>sentations he felt bound to support it as a 
               <lb/>
               whole. But now this matter came up as a 
               <lb/>
               substantial proposition, and he considered the 
               <lb/>
               House was at liberty to deal with it as it 
               <lb/>
               chose. He repeated that he was willing to 
               <lb/>
               assume the responsibility of giving whatever 
               <lb/>
               money was necessary, but he did not wish to 
               <lb/>
               assume the responsibility of taking the lands. 
               <lb/>
               He did not anticipate that the revenue would 
               <lb/>
               be so great as had been represented by the 
               <lb/>
               Minister of Finance. But he was willing to set 
               <lb/>
               aside all considerations except one. that this 
               <lb/>
               was a British Colony which it was desirable 
               <lb/>
               to incorporate into our Union, and with that 
               <lb/>
               view he was willing to agree to any reason<lb break="no"/>able terms. He desired, however, that these 
               <lb/>
               terms should be subjected to deliberate exami<lb break="no"/>nation and discussion in this House, and that 
               <lb/>
               they should be so satisfactory to both parties, 
               <lb/>
               that no difficulties should hereafter arise 
               <lb/>
               similar to those which had arisen with ref<lb break="no"/>erence to Nova Scotia. (Hear, hear.)

               Sir John A. Macdonald said when he spoke

               of the arrangements at the Quebec Confer<lb break="no"/>ence, he alluded to the Provinces of Canada,

               Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. It was not 
               <lb/>
               so with reference to Newfoundland. The del<lb break="no"/>egates from that Colony, not being charged

               with the power of entering into such a treaty,

               guarded themselves against incurring any such

               Sir John A. Macdonald thought the hon. 
               <lb/>
               gentleman was mistaken. Newfoundland, as 
               <lb/>
               regarded the resolutions of the Quebec Con<lb break="no"/>ference, was on the same footing as British 
               <lb/>
               Columbia at the Union in 1865, the New 
               <lb/>
               Brunswick Government having been defeated 
               <lb/>
               on the question, and the feeling being against 
               <lb/>
               it in Nova Scotia, the Newfoundland Govern<lb break="no"/>ment did not choose to submit Confederation 
               <lb/>
               to the people. Now, however, when they saw 
               <lb/>
               that Confederation was a fact, they came pro<lb break="no"/>posing to enter the Union on the terms of the 
               <lb/>
               Quebec Conference, one of which was that 
               <lb/>
               the Dominion should pay $150,000 to get the 
               <lb/>
               public lands in return. If this were refused 
               <lb/>
               they would go back with a charge against us 
               <lb/>
               of bad faith, and tell their people that we 
               <lb/>
               would not abide by the terms of the Quebec 
               <lb/>

               Hon. Mr. Holton said this was the first time

               they had heard from the Minister of Justice 
               <lb/>
               the statement that the Quebec resolutions 
               <lb/>
               were not as binding in the nature of a treaty 
               <lb/>
               on Newfoundland as on any of the other Prov<lb break="no"/>inces, and they heard it now simply because

               Hon. Mr. Holton said the scheme of Con<lb break="no"/>federation had been rejected by Newfound<lb break="no"/>land at the election in 1865, yet it was now 
               <lb/>
               proposed again to submit it to the people and 
               <lb/>
               thus defeat what had been declared unconsti<lb break="no"/>tutional as regards the other Provinces. The

               Minister of Justice had alluded to the course

               taken by the member for West Durham to 
               <lb/>
               moving this amendment, as if he were unwil<lb break="no"/>lingly playing into the hands of those who 
               <lb/>
               had opposed Confederation. This allusion 
               <lb/>
               made it necessary for him (Mr. Holton) to say, 
               <lb/>
               with reference to Confederation, that he had 
               <lb/>
               not been opposed to the Union of these 
               <lb/>
               Colonies on federal principles, but had opposed 
               <lb/>
               the scheme as immature; and many difficulties 
               <lb/>
               which had occurred in working it had shown

               the validity of the objections he had taken to

               it on that ground. Confederation, however, 
               <lb/>
               was carried. The Union of Colonies was the

               <lb/>
               purpose of making a treaty. The Provinces of 
               <lb/>
               Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island sent 
               <lb/>
               delegates simply as spectators—not for the 
               <lb/>
               purpose of entering into a definite compact. 
               <lb/>
               The other three Provinces, however, made a 
               <lb/>
               solemn treaty, as he had stated, with the 
               <lb/>
               Canadian Parliament, after the Conference at 
               <lb/>
               Quebec. He was not sure whether Prince 
               <lb/>
               Edward Island was in the same position as 
               <lb/>
               the other Provinces, but he was certain that 
               <lb/>
               the delegates of Newfoundland did not con- 
               <lb break="yes"/>
               der themselves a party to the treaty. It was 
               <lb/>
               simply agreed that whenever they choose to 
               <lb/>
               come in, they should do so on certain terms. 
               <lb/>
               In 1865 there was a disposition in the island 
               <lb/>
               to submit the Quebec resolutions at the polls, 
               <lb/>
               but the hostility to Union in New Brunswick 
               <lb/>
               and Nova Scotia created the impression that 
               <lb/>
               the measure would not be accepted by British 
               <lb/>
               North America. Now, however, it was felt 
               <lb/>
               that the difficulties in the way of the Con<lb break="no"/>federation were rapidly disappearing, and 
               <lb/>
               that it was their duty and interest to form 
               <lb/>
               a part of the Dominion. Under the circum<lb break="no"/>stances he regretted to hear the arguments he 
               <lb/>
               had heard advanced from the opposite side. 
               <lb/>

            <p>
               Hon. Mr. Rose said in reality the honourable 
               <lb/>
               gentleman opposite admitted the desirability 
               <lb/>
               of having Newfoundland in the Union, and 
               <lb/>
               there was no cavilling at the terms proposed, 
               <lb/>
               except in Newfoundland, as a separate Col<lb break="no"/>ony had something to say in the bargain, 
               <lb/>
               and what she had said through her Legislature 
               <lb/>
               and delegation was this, that she would enter 
               <lb/>
               Confederation on the terms of the Quebec 
               <lb/>
               resolutions.

            <p>
               Mr. Mackenzie said no, she wanted $150,000 
               <lb/>
               for her land. 
               <lb/>

            <p>
               Hon. Mr. Rose said that was the case; but 
               <lb/>
               the difference was very slight. Being agreed 
               <lb/>
               that the terms are not unreasonable, why 
               <lb/>
               cavil at these small details. To show the value 
               <lb/>
               of Newfoundland to the Confederation, and

               the importance of acquiring it, the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man quoted largely from the remarks of the 
               <lb/>
               Hon. George Brown and Mr. Mackenzie 
               <lb/>

            <p>
               Mr. Mills regretted that the $150,000 a year 
               <lb/>
               was to be paid for the land of this Island. 
               <lb/>
               Even if this item were concurred in, what 
               <lb/>
               guarantee was there that a further demand 
               <lb/>
               would not be made next year in lieu of the 
               <lb/>
               share of Newfoundland in the Intercolonial 
               <lb/>
               Railway and other great public works of the 
               <lb/>
               Dominion, from which she derived no direct 
               <lb/>
               benefit? It was fair, of course, that she should 
               <lb/>
               get means to enable her to carry on her own 
               <lb/>
               local Government efiîciently, but there was 
               <lb/>
               no necessity for giving her an extravagant 
               <lb/>
               amount. For his own part he was most anxious 
               <lb/>
               to have Newfoundland enter the Dominion, 
               <lb/>
               but was also anxious that she should do so 
               <lb/>
               on equitable terms. Let her control her own 
               <lb/>
               territory, and develop it to the best of her 
               <lb/>
               own ability. It was for this he contended. 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. D. A. Macdonald said he had not voted 
               <lb/>
               for the $150,000 when the matter came before 
               <lb/>
               the Parliament of Canada, or he would be 
               <lb/>
               bound to vote for it on this occasion. The hon. 
               <lb/>
               gentleman had quoted Confederation speeches 
               <lb/>
               to show the value of Newfoundland to us and 
               <lb/>
               the great necessity existing for its acquisi<lb break="no"/>tion. But for his part he defied any one to 
               <lb/>
               show him one word of truth in those speeches. 
               <lb/>
               (Order, order.) At all events the brilliant 
               <lb/>
               future drawn out for the country under Con<lb break="no"/>federation was anything but realized or in 
               <lb/>
               course of realization. As to the land of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, the true course would be to leave 
               <lb/>
               it with the Colony and give them the $150,<lb break="no"/>000 if necessary.

            <p>
               Hon. Mr. Dunkin said that under the pres<lb break="no"/>ent circumstances the House was bound to 
               <lb/>
               carry out the pledge they had given to New<lb break="no"/>foundland in the scheme of Union. Having 
               <lb/>
               once put our hands to the plough we could 
               <lb/>
               not look back now, and it was our duty and 
               <lb/>
               interest to work out the Union as rapidly as 
               <lb/>
               possible. This confederacy was incomplete 
               <lb/>
               without Newfoundland and Prince Edward 
               <lb/>
               Island, and we should offer them the best 
               <lb/>
               terms we could. We were bound to give them 
               <lb/>
               what was necessary to enable them to carry 
               <lb/>
               on there local operations, and he would say 
               <lb/>
               in all frankness that he did not consider the 
               <lb/>
               terms now offered, too extravagant. He 
               <lb/>
               thought though it was not necessary to hold 
               <lb/>
               the lands, yet the time would probably come 
               <lb/>
               when the colony would gladly take them 
               <lb/>
               back. He was of opinion that the lands were 
               <lb/>
               so much life to the Local Governments; but 
               <lb/>

               at present Newfoundland was in an excep<lb break="no"/>tional position, and should therefore be treat<lb break="no"/>ed accordingly to her peculiar wants. He did 
               <lb/>
               not think that the Dominion was running 
               <lb/>
               any risk in trying the experiment, for the 
               <lb/>
               present at all events.

            <p>
               Mr. Scatcherd said that he believed it was 
               <lb/>
               now necessary to carry out this Confederation 
               <lb/>
               faithfully, and not to consider matters in a 
               <lb/>
               niggard spirit. He considered it his duty, as 
               <lb/>
               a representative of the people, to vote for the 
               <lb/>
               resolutions, though he had, on a previous 
               <lb/>
               occasion, taken a position hostile to the Union. 
               <lb/>
               He was more hopeful that night of the future 
               <lb/>
               of the Confederation than he had ever been 
               <lb/>
               before.

               Mr. T. R. Ferguson was more hopeful to<lb break="no"/>night than he had ever been on the subject 
               <lb/>
               of Confederation. He was glad to find hon.

               gentlemen on all sides agreed as to the ne<lb break="no"/>cessity for completing this other link in the 
               <lb/>
               scheme of Confederation, the only objection 
               <lb/>
               offered being to land terms, and those ob<lb break="no"/>jecting to this $150,000 a year, what was 
               <lb/>
               their cause? A most extraordinary one. It 
               <lb/>
               seemed to him they scrupled to give this 
               <lb/>
               amount and take the land, but offered to give 
               <lb/>
               $150,000 and give back the land at the same 
               <lb/>
               time. This was a specimen of the economy 
               <lb/>
               these hon. gentlemen wanted to practice. It 
               <lb/>
               was a pity their old leader, the Hon. Mr. 
               <lb/>
               Brown, was not as had been said on the floor

               Mr. Mackenzie strongly objected to the 
               <lb/>
               grant of $35,000 as a departure from the

               <lb/>

               Mr. Blake also objected to the resolution.

               On the 6th, which provided that before

               entering the Union, Newfoundland might re<lb break="no"/>serve to itself all the lands and rights con<lb break="no"/>veyed to the General Government, and that

               in that care Canada shall be relieved of the

               Hon. Mr. Wood moved in amendment that

               the resolution be referred back to amend it

               The Speaker ruled the amendment out of

               On the 8th Mr. Le Vesconte moved that the

               resolution be referred back in order to strike 
               <lb/>
               out the words “As well as the present duty

               on coal entering the said harbour,” and also 
               <lb/>
               the words “Such duties on coal.” His object 
               <lb/>
               was to prevent the imposition of a duty on 
               <lb/>
               coal.

            <p>
               Mr. Le Vesconte spoke against the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion. Suppose it were necessary to make a 
               <lb/>
               large expenditure for improving the harbours 
               <lb/>
               in Newfoundland or any of the Provinces the

               dominant Province of Ontario might choose to 
               <lb/>
               impose a certain duty on some articles coming 
               <lb/>
               into these ports, while enacting at the same 
               <lb/>
               time that flour and other articles sent from 
               <lb/>
               Ontario, be exempt from duty. 
               <lb/>

            <p>
               Mr. Killam said that the present duty on 
               <lb/>
               coal was, in his opinion, a Customs duty. Even 
               <lb/>
               if it were not, what right had the Government 
               <lb/>
               of Newfoundland to impose an exceptional tax 
               <lb/>
               on one particular article, and not on another.<lb/>

               Mr. Blake argued that the imposition in this 
               <lb/>
               case was not in substance or form a harbour 
               <lb/>
               duty, and therefore did not come within the

               Mr. Mackenzie said he had intended at this

               stage to move an amendment, but as it was so 
               <lb/>
               late, it might perhaps be more convenient to 
               <lb/>
               defer it now, and move it at the concurrence.

               The House went into Committee, Hon. Mr.

            <p>
               Hon. Mr. Rose said the object of the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions was principally the admission of Prince 
               <lb/>
               Edward Island into the Union. After the 
               <lb/>
               address which had just been passed, it was 
               <lb/>
               evident that the Union would be very incom<lb break="no"/>plete without Prince Edward Island. It had a 
               <lb/>
               low tariff and there would be great temptation 
               <lb/>
               to send in goods from that Island to the other 
               <lb/>
               Provinces. Its geographical position also was 
               <lb/>
               such that the Dominion would be very incom<lb break="no"/>plete without it. Another very important 
               <lb/>
               reason why it should be admitted had refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the fisheries. The House was aware of 
               <lb/>
               the extreme value of the fisheries belonging to 
               <lb/>
               Prince Edward Island: and it was known that 
               <lb/>
               no permanent arrangement could be made as 
               <lb/>
               to the fisheries unless Prince Edward Island 
               <lb/>
               were a party to it. Prince Edward Island had 
               <lb/>
               very little debt. The principal part of it had 
               <lb/>
               been contracted in the purchase of estates 
               <lb/>
               from persons who held them under grants 
               <lb/>
               from the Crown of England on terms which 
               <lb/>
               had very materially retarded the settlement of 
               <lb/>
               the Island. The hon. gentleman went on to 
               <lb/>
               explain somewhat minutely the position of the 
               <lb/>
               land question in Prince Edward Island. He 
               <lb/>
               then explained that as the tariff was low, and 
               <lb/>
               the debt comparatively small, it had been 
               <lb/>
