               the abode of myriads of thriving and indus<lb break="no"/>trious immigrants. The terms of the dele<lb break="no"/>gates from Newfoundland, and which it may

               importance, seeing that the good will of the

               you have adopted the precautions of timely

               and well-considered liberality in order to sat<lb break="no"/>isfy reasonable demands, and conciliate attach<lb break="no"/>ment in Nova Scotia. The Acts rendering 
               <lb/>
               the Criminal Law uniform will insure an ex<lb break="no"/>act and equal procedure, and cannot fail to 
               <lb/>
               be conducive in the highest degree to the

               supplies you have granted for the public ser<lb break="no"/>vice. Though the revenue accruing from im<lb break="no"/>port duties has not reached the expected

               standard, I rejoice to think that a vigilant 
               <lb/>
               supervision of the public expenditure has ob<lb break="no"/>viated the necessity of imposing any fresh
