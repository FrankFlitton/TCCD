            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GREE1">Mr. Howard C. Green</persName> (Vancouver South): 
     <lb/>
     I should like to direct a question to the Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of Reconstruction and Supply. Central 
     <lb/>
     Mortgage and Housing Corporation is carry<lb break="no"/>ing out a building project in Vancouver, 
     <lb/>
     known as the Fraserview project. Apparently 
     <lb/>
     the corporation has expropriated the property 
     <lb/>
     of certain residents who already live in this 
     <lb/>
     particular district. Over the week end I have 
     <lb/>
     received complaints about bulldozers tearing 
     <lb/>
     up gardens without warning, and other alleged 
     <lb/>
     high-handed procedure on the part of the 
     <lb/>
     corporation. There would seem to be undue 
    

            <cb/>
          

     interference with the present residents. Can 
     <lb/>
     the minister make a statement on this ques— 
     <lb/>
     tion? If not. will he have an immediate 
     <lb/>
     investigation made? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WINT3">Hon. Robert H. Winters</persName> (Minister of Recon<lb break="no"/>struction and Supply): The hon. member was 
     <lb/>
     good enough to give me notice of his question, 
     <lb/>
     and I have looked into the matter briefly. 
     <lb/>
     The Fraserview project is in accordance with 
     <lb/>
     an agreement between the city of Vancouver 
     <lb/>
     and the Central Mortgage and Housing Cor<lb break="no"/>poration. The development is a veterans' 
     <lb/>
     rental project involving some 300 acres of 
     <lb/>
     land immediately west of the Fraser golf club. 
     <lb/>
     Most of this land was owned by the city of 
     <lb/>
     Vancouver as tax sale land, but some parcels 
     <lb/>
     are owned by individuals. It was considered 
     <lb/>
     desirable to replan the area. For this reason, 
     <lb/>
     possession of all the land was required. Expro<lb break="no"/>priation has taken place in respect to both 
     <lb/>
     privately-owned vacant land and privately- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     owned buildings. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The planning has been arranged so that, 
     <lb/>
     as far as possible, existing buildings will 
     <lb/>
     remain undisturbed. A number of houses 
     <lb/>
     may have to be moved, although by arrange<lb break="no"/>ment of the planning it is hoped to keep this 
     <lb/>
     number to a minimum. The situation has 
     <lb/>
     been explained to individual owners in the 
     <lb/>
     area, and every effort is being made to cause 
     <lb/>
     as little inconvenience as possible. An official 
     <lb/>
     of the corporation is devoting his whole time 
     <lb/>
     to dealing with individual owners. The 
     <lb/>
     vacant land is now being cleared so that an 
     <lb/>
     early start may be made upon the 1,200 
     <lb/>
     houses for veterans. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GREE1">Mr. Green</persName>: Will the minister have a further 
     <lb/>
     investigation made to see if there is not some 
     <lb/>
     way in which those who already live there 
     <lb/>
     can be protected against interference with 
     <lb/>
     their property? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WINT3">Mr. Winters</persName>: I shall be glad to do that. As 
     <lb/>
     I pointed out, an official of the corporation 
     <lb/>
     already is working, on a full-time basis, with 
     <lb/>
     individual owners.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Right Hon. L. S. St. Laurent</persName> (Prime Minis<lb break="no"/>ter): Mr. Speaker, I think all hon. members 
     <lb/>
     will be of the view that the measure with 
     <lb/>
     which the house is now called upon to deal 
     <lb/>
     is of an epoch-making character. This fifth 
     <lb/>
     session of the twentieth parliament has the 
     <lb/>
     historic task of considering the addition to 
     <lb/>
     Canada of the last segment in the original 
     <lb/>
     plan of the fathers of confederation. The 
     <lb/>
     bill to follow the resolution will ask parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to give approval to the terms of union 
     <lb/>
     with Newfoundland which were signed in 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa on the 11th of December last. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Of course this is not the first time that the 
     <lb/>
     project of the fathers of confederation has 
     <lb/>
     received serious attention from the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     parliament and the Canadian public. It is 
     <lb/>
     well known to us all that two of the original 
     <lb/>
     members of the Quebec conference in 1864 
     <lb/>
     were from Newfoundland. They participated 
     <lb/>
     in the resolution which ultimately proved to 
     <lb/>
     be the basis upon which the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act was drafted, submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     parliament of the United Kingdom, and

     passed, though in a good many respects in a 
     <lb/>
     form which departed rather substantially 
     <lb/>
     from the terms of the original resolution. 
     <lb/>
     Nevertheless Newfoundland was not repre<lb break="no"/>sented at the conference at Westminster when 
     <lb/>
     the draft of the British North America Act 
     <lb/>
     was being considered by the conferees and 
     <lb/>
     the law officers of the parliament of the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Provision was made, as all hon. members 
     <lb/>
     know, for the entry of Newfoundland on the 
     <lb/>
     same terms as were made for the entry of 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island. Prince Edward Island 
     <lb/>
     did enter the confederation, but not New<lb break="no"/>foundland. In 1869 there was an election in 
     <lb/>
     which the proponents of confederation with 
     <lb/>
     Canada were decisively defeated. The matter 
     <lb/>
     was dropped and remained quiescent for a 
     <lb/>
     long period of years. In 1895 it was brought 
     <lb/>
     up again. Serious financial difficulties had 
     <lb/>
     been facing the government of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land. One of its commercial banks was 
     <lb/>
     forced to suspend its payments. At that time 
     <lb/>
     there were negotiations with the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government looking to union, but it proved 
     <lb/>
     to be impossible to agree upon tentative 
     <lb/>
     terms that the participants in the negotia<lb break="no"/>tions would undertake to recommend to their 
     <lb/>
     respective parliaments. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     During the first war, Newfoundland, as we 
     <lb/>
     all know, made a magnificent contribution to 
     <lb/>
     the cause of the allies. Concurrently with 
     <lb/>
     the activity resulting from this contribution 
     <lb/>
     to the war a certain amount of prosperity 
     <lb/>
     came to the island. However, the world-wide 
     <lb/>
     depression of the early thirties again created 
     <lb/>
     a serious situation for the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, who depend so largely upon world 
     <lb/>
     trade for their prosperity. An investigation 
     <lb/>
     was made by a commission appointed, at the 
     <lb/>
     request of the government of Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     by the government of the United Kingdom. 
     <lb/>
     The commission recommended that the con<lb break="no"/>stitution of the island be suspended and that 
     <lb/>
     the government of the United Kingdom make 
     <lb/>
     itself financially responsible for the obliga<lb break="no"/>tions of the government of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     It was also recommended that the government 
     <lb/>
     be replaced by a commission of government, 
     <lb/>
     made up of a governor appointed by the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom and six commissioners ap<lb break="no"/>pointed by the dominions office, three of 
     <lb/>
     whom were to be chosen from residents of 
     <lb/>
     the United Kingdom and three from resid<lb break="no"/>ents of the island. It was also provided that 
     <lb/>
     when the financial difficulties had been over<lb break="no"/>come the constitution might be restored, but 
     <lb/>
     nothing was done about that during the 
     <lb/>
     period of the war. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the second world war the Newfound<lb break="no"/>landers repeated their most generous contri<lb break="no"/>bution to the cause of the allied nations. The 
     <lb/>
     activities carried on in the island, and the 
     <lb/>
     amount of money that had to be spent to 

            <cb/>
         

     make the island the outpost of defence of 
     <lb/>
     the North American continent and the jump<lb break="no"/>ing-off place for convoys to Europe brought 
     <lb/>
     about a situation of unparalleled prosperity. 
     <lb/>
     The commission of government was able to 
     <lb/>
     increase materially the public services pro<lb break="no"/>vided by the government, and in addition to 
     <lb/>
     accumulate a surplus of some $70 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Following the cessation of hostilities, to 
     <lb/>
     ascertain the wishes of the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland a national convention was called to 
     <lb/>
     consider the future form of the government 
     <lb/>
     of the island. Forty-five elected representa<lb break="no"/>tives met in a national convention early in 
     <lb/>
     1946, considered the economy of the island, 
     <lb/>
     its financial position, and dispatched delegates 
     <lb/>
     to interview the British government as to 
     <lb/>
     what that government's intention might be 
     <lb/>
     with respect to the future of the island. The 
     <lb/>
     convention also considered the dispatch of 
     <lb/>
     delegates to Washington to see what arrange<lb break="no"/>ments might be possible with the government 
     <lb/>
     of the United States of America, but decided 
     <lb/>
     against it. The convention sent an important 
     <lb/>
     delegation to Canada to discuss with us the 
     <lb/>
     possibility of bringing about the completion 
     <lb/>
     of the original scheme of the fathers of con<lb break="no"/>federation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The delegation arrived here early in June, 
     <lb/>
     1947. It was headed by Mr. F. G. Bradley, 
     <lb/>
     and the other delegates were Mr. T. G. W. 
     <lb/>
     Ashbourne, Mr. Charles H. Ballam, Rev. Lester 
     <lb/>
     L. Burry, Mr. P. W. Crummey, Mr. G. F. Hig<lb break="no"/>gins, K.C., and Mr. J. R. Smallwood. Explora<lb break="no"/>tory talks and investigations with a com<lb break="no"/>mittee appointed by the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment extended into September, 1947. As a 
     <lb/>
     result of those studies and discussions the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government prepared a statement 
     <lb/>
     of terms believed to constitute a fair and 
     <lb/>
     equitable basis for union. This statement was 
     <lb/>
     forwarded to the governor of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     by the then prime minister, with a covering 
     <lb/>
     letter. It set forth the terms the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     government would be prepared to recommend 
     <lb/>
     to this parliament if the people of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land decided they really wanted to become 
     <lb/>
     partners in our union on substantially such 
     <lb/>
     terms. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     These terms were placed before the 
     <lb/>
     national convention in Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     were discussed at great length. The national 
     <lb/>
     convention passed a resolution to the effect 
     <lb/>
     that there be submitted, in a referendum to 
     <lb/>
     the people, two questions as to the future 
     <lb/>
     form of government: (1) the restoration of 
     <lb/>
     responsible government, and (2) a continuation 
     <lb/>
     of the commission of government. There was 
     <lb/>
     a motion before the national convention to 
     <lb/>
     include on the ballot a third question: whe<lb break="no"/>ther or not the people wished union with Can<lb break="no"/>ada on substantially the terms expressed in 
     <lb/>
     the statement which had been submitted. This

     The government of the United Kingdom,

     This first referendum took place on June 3, 
     <lb/>
     1948. Out of a total of 176,297 registered 
     <lb/>
     voters on the list, 155,777 votes were cast. 
     <lb/>
     For responsible government there were 
     <lb/>
     69,400 votes cast, or 44-55 per cent; for con<lb break="no"/>federation, 64,066 or 41-13 per cent; for the 
     <lb/>
     continuation of the commission government, 
     <lb/>
     22,311 or 14-32 per cent. As there was no 
     <lb/>
     over-all majority, and as had been announced 
     <lb/>
     before the referendum took place, a second 
     <lb/>
     referendum was arranged to decide between 
     <lb/>
     the two forms which had received the larger 
     <lb/>
     number of votes, namely, the restoration of 
     <lb/>
     responsible government or confederation with 
     <lb/>
     Canada. The second referendum took place 
     <lb/>
     on July 22, 1948. At that time 6,000 fewer 
     <lb/>
     votes were cast than in the first referendum. 
     <lb/>
     The total number of votes cast at the second 
     <lb/>
     referendum was 149,657. Of this number, 
     <lb/>
     71,334 or 47.66 per cent were for the restora<lb break="no"/>tion of responsible government and 78,323 or 
     <lb/>
     52-34 per cent were for confederation with 
     <lb/>
     Canada, a majority for confederation with 
     <lb/>
     Canada of 6,989 or 4.68 per cent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In this second referendum, confederation 
     <lb/>
     received a majority in eighteen out of the 
     <lb/>
     twenty-five electoral districts from which 
  

            <cb/>
        
     
     
     members had formerly been elected to the 
     <lb/>
     legislature of Newfoundland. Following the 
     <lb/>
     announcement of the result of that vote, 
     <lb/>
     Right Hon. W. L. Mackenzie King, then Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister, stated that the result of the referen<lb break="no"/>dum was clear, and beyond all possibility of 
     <lb/>
     misunderstanding an expression of opinion of 
     <lb/>
     the people of Newfoundland for confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, and that he believed the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada would welcome the result. Mr. King

     Following that letter, the government of

     <lb/>
     to Ottawa to negotiate the final terms under 
     <lb/>
     which the entry of Newfoundland might be 
     <lb/>
     brought about. The delegation was headed 
     <lb/>
     by Hon. A. J. Walsh, K.C.—now Sir A. J.

     Walsh, K.C.—commissioner of justice and

     Mr. J. R. Smallwood who had been members

     Mr. J. B. McEvoy, KC. and Mr. Gordon A.

     and ended with the signing of terms of an 
     <lb/>
     agreement on December 11, 1948. Copies of

     the terms have been distributed to hon.

     in which hon. members I think will find

     practically all the pertinent information that

     was before the representatives of the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian government and the delegation from

     Newfoundland. On examining it, I noted

     that there was one omission which is not

     substantial but which I regret, and which I

     When we met in the senate chamber on

     I should like to ask those who are to sign the

     agreement between Canada and Newfoundland if

     they would use the inkstand which has been placed 
     <lb/>
     on the table for the purpose. Perhaps I might ex<lb break="no"/>plain why this request is being made. The inkstand

     R. A. C. Kane, V.D., who inherited it from his

     1864 by the original fathers of confederation, and 
     <lb/>
     was subsequently presented to Tache. who presided

     There are still certain stages required to

     complete this matter of the entry of New<lb break="no"/>foundland into confederation as a tenth prov<lb break="no"/>ince. The target date has been set as March 
     <lb/>
     31, and the agreement requires that to come 
     <lb/>
     into effect it must first of all receive the 
     <lb/>
     approval of the Canadian parliament and of 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland government, and must 
     <lb/>
     also be confirmed by action of the parliament

     of the United Kingdom.

            </p>

            <p>
     As hon. members know, in order that there 
     <lb/>
     may be passed by the parliament of the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom any law affecting Canada, 
     <lb/>
     it must be stated in the preamble that it is 
  

            <cb/>
            

     done with the acquiescence and at the request 
     <lb/>
     of the houses of the Canadian parliament. 
     <lb/>
     That is one of the express provisions of the 
     <lb/>
     Statute of Westminster. In order to finish 
     <lb/>
     the work that is being done to bring about 
     <lb/>
     this completion of the original scheme of 
     <lb/>
     confederation, it will be necessary that there 
     <lb/>
     be passed by the parliament of Canada a 
     <lb/>
     statute ratifying the terms of the agreement 
     <lb/>
     and that they be also ratified by the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Newfoundland, and that they be 
     <lb/>
     confirmed by a statute of the United Kingdom. 
     <lb/>
     All this must be done before March 31 
     <lb/>
     because the terms of agreement are condi<lb break="no"/>tional. The words used in section 50 are as 
     <lb/>
     follows:

     These terms are agreed to subject to their being

     That is the condition upon which these

            <p>
     The passage of an act of the parliament of

     the United Kingdom will require joint

     addresses of this house, and of the other

     place, to His Majesty, asking him to submit 
     <lb/>
     to the parliament of the United Kingdom the 
     <lb/>
     appropriate legislation. I would imagine that 
     <lb/>
     this house will wish to consider very care<lb break="no"/>fully, and perhaps debate at some length, the 
     <lb/>
     terms of union of Newfoundland with Canada. 
     <lb/>
     However, if this parliament comes to the con<lb break="no"/>clusion that these terms should be approved 
     <lb/>
     by a statute of the Canadian parliament, the 
     <lb/>
     adoption of the addresses to His Majesty the 
     <lb/>
     King will become a mere formality, because 
     <lb/>
     the matter is already covered by the terms 
     <lb/>
     of union, which by that time will have 
     <lb/>
     received the sanction of the parliament of 
     <lb/>
     Canada by a Canadian statute. Therefore I 
     <lb/>
     would hope that there would not need to be 
     <lb/>
     much debate upon the joint address. After 
     <lb/>
     the parliament of Canada has come to the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion, as I hope it will, that these terms 
     <lb/>
     of union should be accepted, there will also 
     <lb/>
     be required—but it need not, in my view, 
     <lb/>
     give us very much concern at the present 
     <lb/>
     time—to be passed before March 31 a bill 
     <lb/>
     making changes in language in the general 
     <lb/>
     Canadian statutes which will be appropriate 
     <lb/>
     and which will after the union be designed 
     <lb/>
     to apply to Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The terms of the union provide that the 
     <lb/>
     legislation of Newfoundland will remain in 
     <lb/>
     effect until it is repealed or modified by the 
     <lb/>
     appropriate body having jurisdiction under 
     <lb/>
     the division of powers provided for in the

     British North America Act, and that the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian legislation will come into effect 
     <lb/>
     upon dates to be fixed by proclamation of His 
     <lb/>
     Excellency the governor in council. That was 
     <lb/>
     requested by the delegation from Newfound<lb break="no"/>land because they said it would be incon<lb break="no"/>venient to have the whole body of statute law 
     <lb/>
     of Canada come into force at one given 
     <lb/>
     moment. Nothing can be done to bring that 
     <lb/>
     body of law into force until the union has 
     <lb/>
     become effective the last minute of March 
     <lb/>
     31, 1949. They felt that there should be a 
     <lb/>
     proclamation immediately bringing a certain 
     <lb/>
     portion of these laws into effect, but that 
     <lb/>
     there were others for which preparation for 
     <lb/>
     proper administration would have to be made, 
     <lb/>
     and that it would be desirable to provide 
     <lb/>
     that they might be gradually brought into 
     <lb/>
     effect as the proper administrative machinery 
     <lb/>
     had been set up to enable them to be fol<lb break="no"/>lowed and carried out. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Perhaps the question may arise as to why 
     <lb/>
     it is necessary to have a statute passed by the 
     <lb/>
     parliament of the United Kingdom to confirm 
     <lb/>
     the entry of Newfoundland into Canada. 
     <lb/>
     There are two reasons for that. One is that 
     <lb/>
     this does in fact, though it may not in form, 
     <lb/>
     amount to an amendment to, or a derogation 
     <lb/>
     from, the terms of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act in so far as Canada is concerned. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Hon. members will recall that under section 
     <lb/>
     146 of the British North America Act it was 
     <lb/>
     provided that Newfoundland might be 
     <lb/>
     admitted into the confederation upon joint 
     <lb/>
     addresses of the houses of parliament of 
     <lb/>
     Canada and of Newfoundland by order made 
     <lb/>
     by, then Her Majesty, on the advice of her 
     <lb/>
     council of the United Kingdom. This time 
     <lb/>
     it was not possible to comply, even if it had 
     <lb/>
     been desirable to do so, with the exact terms 
     <lb/>
     of the procedure set out in section 146, 
     <lb/>
     because there were no houses of parliament 
     <lb/>
     of the colony of Newfoundland; and secondly, 
     <lb/>
     it might not have been desirable to have that 
     <lb/>
     procedure resorted to because, since the enact<lb break="no"/>ment of the Statute of Westminster and as a 
     <lb/>
     consequence of constitutional developments, 
     <lb/>
     His Majesty, on the advice of his ministers 
     <lb/>
     responsible to the parliament of the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom, no longer exercises the prerogatives 
     <lb/>
     of the crown over Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     His Majesty now, by reason of the situation 
     <lb/>
     or development which brought about the 
     <lb/>
     Statute of Westminster, and which is regis<lb break="no"/>tered in the terms of the Statute of West<lb break="no"/>minster, exercises the royal prerogative in 
     <lb/>
     respect of Canadian affairs upon, and only 
     <lb/>
     upon, the advice of his ministers responsible 
     <lb/>
     to this parliament. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The second reason is that at the present 
     <lb/>
     time the government of the United Kingdom, 
     <lb/>
     responsible to the parliament of the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom, still has the ultimate responsibility 
     <lb/>
     for the affairs of the colony of Newfoundland. 
 

            <cb/>

And though it might be thought that Canada, 
     <lb/>on the decision of its own parliament, should 
     <lb/>be entitled to add to its territory, and though 
     <lb/>under the Statute of Westminster the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada has the same rights, recog<lb break="no"/>nized internationally, to make laws having 
     <lb/>extraterritorial effect as has the parliament 
     <lb/>of the United Kingdom, a law of the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada would hardly reach out and 
     <lb/>gather in a territory that was subject to the 
     <lb/>legislative and administrative jurisdiction of 
     <lb/>another autonomous nation. And whatever 
     <lb/>may be the fine points of technical procedure 
     <lb/>in that regard, the relations between Canada 
     <lb/>and the United Kingdom are not such that 
     <lb/>anything which would appear so discourteous 
     <lb/>would be considered on either side. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     It was felt therefore that the most expedi<lb break="no"/>tious procedure might be to follow the pre<lb break="no"/>cedent which had been established when 
     <lb/>
     changes were made with respect to natural 
     <lb/>
     resources in the possession of the western 
     <lb/>
     provinces. There the entry of the western 
     <lb/>
     provinces into confederation had been accom<lb break="no"/>plished in accordance with the terms of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act. However, it was 
     <lb/>
     found that when it became advisable to 
     <lb/>
     modify those terms, their modification would 
     <lb/>
     constitute a derogation from the express pro<lb break="no"/>visions of the British North America Act. In 
     <lb/>
     order to bring that modification about in such 
     <lb/>
     a manner as to leave no doubt in any mind 
     <lb/>
     that it was done in a form beyond successful 
     <lb/>
     contestation before the courts, agreements 
     <lb/>
     were made between the government of Can<lb break="no"/>ada and the governments of each of the 
     <lb/>
     western provinces. The agreements contained 
     <lb/>
     clauses very similar to this section 50 which 
     <lb/>
     I have read to the house. Those agreements 
     <lb/>
     were to be subject to the approval of the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian parliament and the approval of the 
     <lb/>
     legislature of the province concerned, and 
     <lb/>
     confirmed by an act of the United Kingdom. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     That was the procedure adopted at that 
     <lb/>
     time. It is a procedure which operated in a 
     <lb/>
     manner that no one has been tempted in any 
     <lb/>
     way to test. It is a procedure which requires 
     <lb/>
     short bills, in the case of the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     parliament, expressing, more or less, only that 
     <lb/>
     the terms of agreement of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     with Canada annexed to the bill as a schedule 
     <lb/>
     are ratified and, with respect to the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of the United Kingdom, that those terms 
     <lb/>
     shall be a schedule to the act which will 
     <lb/>
     be introduced before the parliament of the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom, if and when this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment sees fit to proceed further with the 
     <lb/>
     matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The result will be that everything con<lb break="no"/>tained in the terms of union will have the 
     <lb/>
     effect of law for all the Canadian people, 
     <lb/>
     those who now constitute the inhabitants of 
     <lb/>
     the nine present provinces and those who, by 
 

            <pb n="288" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-02-07_Page_0288.jpg"/>

virtue of that confirmation, will become the 
     <lb/>Canadians of the tenth Canadian province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not think I should attempt at this time 
     <lb/>
     to deal with the terms of union. They will 
     <lb/>
     have to be dealt with at some length, I am 
     <lb/>
     sure, by hon. members. Perhaps however 
     <lb/>
     I may be permitted to refer in a general way 
     <lb/>
     to some aspects of the problems we had to 
     <lb/>
     consider. We found at the outset that those 
     <lb/>
     problems were perhaps even more complex 
     <lb/>
     than the ones with which the fathers of con<lb break="no"/>federation had to deal in 1867, and in the 
     <lb/>
     months which preceded the adoption of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The colonies represented at the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     conference in 1864 were similar in their 
     <lb/>
     development, and similar in their financial 
     <lb/>
     and tax structure. It required no great 
     <lb/>
     change to divide powers which were prac<lb break="no"/>tically the same in all the colonies which 
     <lb/>
     were coming together—that is, to divide them 
     <lb/>
     between the central authority, which would 
     <lb/>
     exercise one portion, and the provincial 
     <lb/>
     legislatures which would have jurisdiction 
     <lb/>
     over the other. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But between Canada and Newfoundland in 
     <lb/>
     1948 there were great differences in the 
     <lb/>
     system of taxation and in the administrative 
     <lb/>
     structure. Those differences had to be har<lb break="no"/>monized with the existing fundamental basis 
     <lb/>
     of our constitution, the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act. And I may say that there have been 
     <lb/>
     no substantial departures from the provisions 
     <lb/>
     of the British North America Act. There has 
     <lb/>
     been one in connection with education. In 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act provision is 
     <lb/>
     made for certain guarantees for denomina<lb break="no"/>tional schools. But the sanction of those 
     <lb/>
     guarantees is an appeal to the governor in 
     <lb/>
     council, if anything is done in violation of 
     <lb/>
     them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The experience of the years has been that 
     <lb/>
     an appeal to the governor in council over 
     <lb/>
     matters which become highly controversial, 
     <lb/>
     when they involve the religious beliefs of 
     <lb/>
     honest people of diverging views about the 
     <lb/>
     way they should worship their Maker, is not 
     <lb/>
     an effective safeguard. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With respect to this agreement the delega<lb break="no"/>tion from Newfoundland was told that of 
     <lb/>
     course we did not pretend to exercise or to 
     <lb/>
     ask for any control over their school system. 
     <lb/>
     We had none; and we were not going to make 
     <lb/>
     it a condition of their entry into Canada that 
     <lb/>
     they should give us some control in the 
     <lb/>
     central authority as to their education. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The situation was not the same as it was 
     <lb/>
     when new provinces were created out of the 
     <lb/>
     territories. When the new provinces were 
     <lb/>
     created out of the territories this parliament 
     <lb/>
     had legislative control over the educational 
     <lb/>
     system, and it was turning over that legis<lb break="no"/>,lative control to the new bodies. It was felt 


            <cb/>


     to be fitting at that time that it should 
     <lb/>
     retain some portion of that control to ensure 
     <lb/>
     respect for the constitutional safeguards 
     <lb/>
     which were being written into the constitu<lb break="no"/>tions of those new provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     But with respect to Newfoundland, they 
     <lb/>
     had at the time of the negotiations, and they 
     <lb/>
     have today in their legislative body, full and 
     <lb/>
     exclusive control over their educational sys<lb break="no"/>tem. But we said to them, "If, for the satis<lb break="no"/>faction of your own people, you do wish to 
     <lb/>
     have constitutional safeguards written into 
     <lb/>
     the terms of union, we will be quite prepared 
     <lb/>
     to consider those you will suggest." The 
     <lb/>
     treatment they suggested was constitutional 
     <lb/>
     safeguards, but constitutional safeguards the 
     <lb/>
     application of which will be left to the courts 
     <lb/>
     of justice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is provided that the legislature will have 
     <lb/>
     exclusive control over all educational matters, 
     <lb/>
     but must not make any laws that would 
     <lb/>
     prejudice what is described in the terms of 
     <lb/>
     union as the rights of the denominations 
     <lb/>
     which comprise the people of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     The legislature has no power to do anything 
     <lb/>
     prejudicial. Review will be a matter for 
     <lb/>
     the courts. If there ever should be an attempt 
     <lb/>
     by the legislature to do anything that would 
     <lb/>
     contravene the terms of the union it will 
     <lb/>
     not be a matter of appeal to His Excellency 
     <lb/>
     the governor in council. It will be a 
     <lb/>
     matter for resort to the courts of justice 
     <lb/>
     of the island of Newfoundland in the first 
     <lb/>
     instance, and then to the ordinary courts 
     <lb/>
     administering the laws of the country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The other departure had to do with oleo<lb break="no"/>margarine. In Newfoundland the dairy indus<lb break="no"/>try is very small, and over the years the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland have been using oleo<lb break="no"/>margarine produced from raw materials 
     <lb/>
     available in their own economy. At the 
     <lb/>
     time of the negotiations the Supreme Court 
     <lb/>
     of Canada had not decided that this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment has no juridiction to deal with 
     <lb/>
     oleomargarine in the form set out in the 
     <lb/>
     Dairy Industry Act. We agreed that there 
     <lb/>
     would not be any attempt by this parliament 
     <lb/>
     to prevent the people of Newfoundland from 
     <lb/>
     continuing to use oleomargarine, because 
     <lb/>
     they are not in a position to get the article 
     <lb/>
     which many of us regard as more desirable, 
     <lb/>
     butter produced by the dairy industry. But 
     <lb/>
     it was also provided that, unless and until 
     <lb/>
     the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine 
     <lb/>
     ceases to be prohibited in the other parts 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, they would not ship any of their 
     <lb/>
     oleomargarine into the other provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Perhaps we would not have felt it was 
     <lb/>
     necessary to talk about that problem at all 
     <lb/>
     if the judgment of the supreme court had 
     <lb/>
     been available at the time negotiations were 
     <lb/>
     proceeding. There was a feeling that it was 
     <lb/>
     somewhat undesirable to have this special 


            <pb n="289" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-02-07_Page_0289.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">FEBRUARY 7, 1949</fw>

     situation with respect to Newfoundland, but 
     <lb/>
     after all I think the completion of the scheme 
     <lb/>
     of confederation is of more concern to the 
     <lb/>
     general Canadian public than is the question 
     <lb/>
     of determining whether Mr. John Jones or 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Tom Allen, residing in one of the villages 
     <lb/>
     or towns of Newfoundland, shall have the 
     <lb/>
     right to use oleomargarine instead of having 
     <lb/>
     to use butter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think those are the only departures from 
     <lb/>
     the general scheme, because in a general 
     <lb/>
     way it was the desire of those people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland who favoured entry into 
     <lb/>
     Canada to become Canadian citizens, subject 
     <lb/>
     to the same laws and entitled to the same 
     <lb/>
     great privileges that are the heritage of 
     <lb/>
     Canadian citizens of the nine other provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I come now to the matter of financial terms. 
     <lb/>
     That was a tough one. The people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland did not want to become a province 
     <lb/>
     of Canada under conditions which would not 
     <lb/>
     make it reasonably probable that they could 
     <lb/>
     carry on successfully, and participate in the 
     <lb/>
     advantages which appertain to Canadians 
     <lb/>
     generally. We on our side wanted to provide 
     <lb/>
     financial terms which would make it reason<lb break="no"/>ably probable, if not certain, that the addition 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland to the economy of Canada 
     <lb/>
     would ultimately prove to be beneficial to both 
     <lb/>
     partners, to the older Canadians and to the 
     <lb/>
     newer arrivals. It was found, after more 
     <lb/>
     precise and careful study of the administra<lb break="no"/>tive problems that would be faced by the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the province of Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     that the terms suggested in the offer submit<lb break="no"/>ted in October, 1947, would not be sufficient 
     <lb/>
     at the start to enable the provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ment to provide for its people on a basis com<lb break="no"/>parable to that which is provided by the other 
     <lb/>
     Canadian provinces. It was felt there had to 
     <lb/>
     be quite substantial provisional grants, extend<lb break="no"/>ing over a period of twelve years on a dim<lb break="no"/>inishing scale, to bridge the transition from 
     <lb/>
     the present economy of the island to the kind 
     <lb/>
     of economy which would make it possible for 
     <lb/>
     the provincial government to provide the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland with substantially 
     <lb/>
     the services that are provided for the rest of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian people by their provincial gov<lb break="no"/>ernments, without resorting to a burden of 
     <lb/>
     taxation heavier, having regard to capacity 
     <lb/>
     to pay, than that which bears upon the people 
     <lb/>
     of the maritime region. The section of the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian economy generally described as 
     <lb/>
     the maritimes was felt to be the one which 
     <lb/>
     would be most nearly comparable to the 
     <lb/>
     situation which would be apt to develop in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. It was felt that for a transi<lb break="no"/>tional term the government of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     had to be provided with sufficient funds to 
     <lb/>
     establish and develop services comparable to 
     <lb/>
     those available to the people of the maritime 


            <cb/>


     region, and that it had to be able to do so 
     <lb/>
     without imposing upon the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland a burden of taxation heavier than 
     <lb/>
     that prevailing in the maritime region. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     After long negotiations it proved possible, 
     <lb/>
     I think, to arrive at the scheme which is set 
     <lb/>
     out in the terms of union, and which is apt to 
     <lb/>
     achieve that result. Human foresight, how<lb break="no"/>ever, is never as good as hindsight. It was 
     <lb/>
     also provided that within eight years from 
     <lb/>
     the coming into force of the terms of union 
     <lb/>
     a commission would be set up to examine the 
     <lb/>
     situation anew, and to report as to whether 
     <lb/>
     or not the terms provided are working satis<lb break="no"/>factorily and are sufficient to bring about the 
     <lb/>
     object of equalizing the lot of the people of 
     <lb/>
     the new province with that of the people of 
     <lb/>
     the older provinces. There is no undertaking 
     <lb/>
     to implement any terms of recommendation 
     <lb/>
     that may be made at that time by a royal 
     <lb/>
     commission. It was felt by the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     delegation, and by the representatives of the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government, that this was some<lb break="no"/>thing that was being entered into in a spirit 
     <lb/>
     of fairness on both sides, and that it was not 
     <lb/>
     necessary to make binding stipulations about 
     <lb/>
     what would happen with respect to the report 
     <lb/>
     of a royal commission. It was felt if there 
     <lb/>
     was an investigation and a report by a com<lb break="no"/>mission, in which the public at that time 
     <lb/>
     would have confidence, the legislators of that 
     <lb/>
     day could well be trusted to do what would 
     <lb/>
     prove to be right in order to make this 
     <lb/>
     enlarged nation a united nation continuing on 
     <lb/>
     its path of progress toward its great destiny. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     At the time many people in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     felt that the government of the United King<lb break="no"/>dom should have proceeded in some other 
     <lb/>
     way; should have at once restored responsible 
     <lb/>
     government and left it to a responsible gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to discuss and negotiate a possible 
     <lb/>
     union with Canada. The government of the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom chose to call together a 
     <lb/>
     national convention of elected representa<lb break="no"/>tives, to have them advise in respect of the 
     <lb/>
     future form of government. After that com<lb break="no"/>mission had made its investigation the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the United Kingdom decided to 
     <lb/>
     submit directly to the public of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land the question whether they wished to 
     <lb/>
     have responsible government restored or 
     <lb/>
     whether they wished to join us in our march 
     <lb/>
     toward the future. The people of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, by a substantial majority, decided that 
     <lb/>
     instead of having responsible government 
     <lb/>
     restored they wished to have confederation 
     <lb/>
     with Canada immediately implemented. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As far as we were concerned, of course, it 
     <lb/>
     was not our business. All we had to do— 
     <lb/>
     and I think we did that with the most scrup<lb break="no"/>ulous care—was say that we would be glad 
     <lb/>
     to have them join with us, but that it was 
  

            <pb n="290" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-02-07_Page_0290.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">290</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">Newfoundland</hi></fw> <fw type="running">HOUSE OF COMMONS</fw>
         


     something which was their concern, and that 
     <lb/>
     if they decided they wished to become Cana<lb break="no"/>dians we would be glad to welcome them and 
     <lb/>
     to extend just as fair terms as we could hope 
     <lb/>
     to have ratified and confirmed by a Cana<lb break="no"/>dian parliament animated by the same senti<lb break="no"/>ments. And it was in that spirit that the 
     <lb/>
     negotiations were carried on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     From what I have been able to read in the 
     <lb/>
     press since the agreement was signed, there 
     <lb/>
     appears to be almost complete unanimity on 
     <lb/>
     the part of the Canadian public that this was 
     <lb/>
     a good arrangement to make, and that it is 
     <lb/>
     a good thing in this year 1949 to complete the 
     <lb/>
     original project envisaged by the fathers of 
     <lb/>
     confederation in 1864. From what I have 
     <lb/>
     seen of the editorial comment in the news<lb break="no"/>papers of the island, there are still those who 
     <lb/>
     would prefer to have had responsible gov<lb break="no"/>ernment re-established and the terms of con<lb break="no"/>federation discussed by and through that 
     <lb/>
     responsible government. In the referendum 
     <lb/>
     the majority decided otherwise, however; 
     <lb/>
     and even among the objectors I think there 
     <lb/>
     are now large numbers who feel there has 
     <lb/>
     been a sincere attempt to make a fair pro<lb break="no"/>posal, and that confederation with Canada 
     <lb/>
     has been made inevitable both by the 
     <lb/>
     Almighty in the distribution of the lands and 
     <lb/>
     waters of this northern half of the North 
     <lb/>
     American continent, and by the historic de<lb break="no"/>velopment of the people who have inhabited 
     <lb/>
     these two parts. They are not strangers to 
     <lb/>
     each other. They come from the same stocks. 
     <lb/>
     They have developed under the same system 
     <lb/>
     of responsible government, of love of indivi<lb break="no"/>dual freedom, of respect for the human being 
     <lb/>
     as more important than the state. They have 
     <lb/>
     developed in the view that the state exists 
     <lb/>
     for the individual, and not the individual for 
     <lb/>
     the state. It is my hope that this arrangement 
     <lb/>
     will commend itself to the Canadian parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, to the vast majority of the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     people and also to the vast majority of the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland. We are here now 
     <lb/>
     considering a matter of great moment. In 
     <lb/>
     the last two wars we realized how close we 
     <lb/>
     were to each other and how close we had to 
     <lb/>
     be in order to survive. In this troubled world 
     <lb/>
     I think we, both in Newfoundland and in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, feel that in this way our risks are 
     <lb/>
     more apt to be successfully met and any 
     <lb/>
     dangers overcome than was possible even 
     <lb/>
     with the non-constitutional union of spirits 
     <lb/>
     and hearts that united us during the last two 
     <lb/>
     wars. I earnestly hope it will be the view 
     <lb/>
     of this house that this union of Canada and 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland is desirable in the interests 
     <lb/>
     of the people of these two lands, and as a 
     <lb/>
     lesson to the whole world of what can be 
     <lb/>
     accomplished by men of good will. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   

            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DREW2">Mr. George A. Drew</persName> (Leader of the Oppo<lb break="no"/>sition): Mr. Speaker, following the remarks of 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister (Mr. St. Laurent) it is not 
     <lb/>
     my intention today to deal with the terms 
     <lb/>
     of the agreement in any detail, because the 
     <lb/>
     agreement will be under discussion when the 
     <lb/>
     bill is before the house. I shall simply discuss 
     <lb/>
     the resolution before us, which will have the 
     <lb/>
     effect of bringing before hon. members the 
     <lb/>
     bill the government intends to introduce. For 
     <lb/>
     this reason I shall defer any comments I 
     <lb/>
     might make about certain references made 
     <lb/>
     by the Prime Minister to some features of 
     <lb/>
     the agreement, which to me suggest that care<lb break="no"/>ful consideration should be given to its full 
     <lb/>
     effect. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Perhaps I might go so far as to suggest 
     <lb/>
     that, before the bill is formally introduced 
     <lb/>
     and the agreement accompanying it is placed 
     <lb/>
     before the house, the government give con<lb break="no"/>sideration to the desirability of removing 
     <lb/>
     the section in regard to oleomargarine, for 
     <lb/>
     reasons which have nothing to do with the 
     <lb/>
     use of oleomargarine itself. The Prime Minis<lb break="no"/>ter said the completion of confederation is 
     <lb/>
     more important than the question whether 
     <lb/>
     or not Tom Jones in Newfoundland is to eat 
     <lb/>
     oleomargarine. The balance of importance 
     <lb/>
     unquestionably is in accordance with what 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister said; but there is a very 
     <lb/>
     important question that may be involved in 
     <lb/>
     the inclusion of that section, to which I think 
     <lb/>
     the government should give some attention 
     <lb/>
     before we are asked to discuss it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is true that the section to which I refer 
     <lb/>
     was included in the draft terms of agree<lb break="no"/>ment before the Supreme Court of Canada 
     <lb/>
     had reached its decision as to the constitu<lb break="no"/>tional authority of the Canadian parliament 
     <lb/>
     to deal with restrictions on the use of oleo<lb break="no"/>margarine. The provision that the manu<lb break="no"/>facture of oleomargarine should be continued 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland related to the fact that 
     <lb/>
     already it was being manufactured there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am not concerned with the circumstances 
     <lb/>
     which led to the inclusion of this provision. 
     <lb/>
     What I am concerned with is that a principle 
     <lb/>
     is put forward which, if accepted, might 
     <lb/>
     apply with equal force to other matters of 
     <lb/>
     trade and commerce, and with serious con<lb break="no"/>sequences. It suggests that it is an acceptable 
     <lb/>
     principle to create trade barriers between 
     <lb/>
     provinces of Canada. Serious consideration 
     <lb/>
     should be given by the government and by 
     <lb/>
     the house to the principle involved in the 
     <lb/>
     acceptance of this provision of the agreement, 
     <lb/>
     even though the Supreme Court of Canada 
     <lb/>
     by its decision may to some extent have 
     <lb/>
     made this discussion academic, 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is one other interesting provision in 
     <lb/>
     the agreement which should not be dis<lb break="no"/>regarded by some of those who have found 


            <pb n="291" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-02-07_Page_0291.jpg"/>

     occasion to avail themselves of the absence 
     <lb/>
     of any similar limitation upon their dis<lb break="no"/>cretion. The Prime Minister referred to the 
     <lb/>
     terms of the agreement which relate to finan<lb break="no"/>cial arrangements. Without going into them 
     <lb/>
     in detail now, I wish to point out another 
     <lb/>
     question of principle which is important. 
     <lb/>
     Having placed before the appointed repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of Newfoundland certain proposals 
     <lb/>
     in regard to a tax agreement, the following 
     <lb/>
     provision is then included: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The subsequent entry into a tax agreement by the 
     <lb/>
     government of Canada with any other province will 
     <lb/>
     not entitle the government of the province of New<lb break="no"/>foundland to any alteration in the terms of its 
     <lb/>
     agreement. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     The present Minister of Justice (Mr. Gar<lb break="no"/>son), while he was premier of Manitoba, the 
     <lb/>
     premier of New Brunswick and other prem<lb break="no"/>iers who succeeded in obtaining adjustments 
     <lb/>
     when other adjustments were made, would 
     <lb/>
     have felt themselves greatly injured if they 
     <lb/>
     had been subject to any such limitation as 
     <lb/>
     this. It seems unusual that the only province, 
     <lb/>
     among those accepting agreements in respect 
     <lb/>
     to the payment of subsidies in return for tax<lb break="no"/>ing powers, to have any limitation placed 
     <lb/>
     upon its subsequent right to ask for readjust<lb break="no"/>ment should be the new province of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, to which we should be extending 
     <lb/>
     every courtesy and offering every encourage<lb break="no"/>ment. These, however, are details, but I 
     <lb/>
     suggest they are worthy of consideration and 
     <lb/>
     will be given consideration when we are dis<lb break="no"/>cussing the precise terms of the agreement.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     As has already been pointed out by the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister, the union of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     with Canada will represent the fulfilment of 
     <lb/>
     the great and challenging vision of those who 
     <lb/>
     met in Charlottetown on September 1, 1864, 
     <lb/>
     in the hope of bringing together the whole of 
     <lb/>
     British North America as one united nation. 
     <lb/>
     It will give reality to the dream of Sir John 
     <lb/>
     A. Macdonald, whose proposals to Newfound<lb break="no"/>land for confederation were not first made at 
     <lb/>
     the time of the Charlottetown conference but 
     <lb/>
     were in fact put forward to Newfoundland in 
     <lb/>
     1858. It is well to remember the significance 
     <lb/>
     of the fact that these proposals which were 
     <lb/>
     put forward to Newfoundland in 1858 brought 
     <lb/>
     the first favourable official response to his 
     <lb/>
     contention that steps should then be taken to 
     <lb/>
     create a federal union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     When I had the privilege of visiting the 
     <lb/>
     confederation chamber in Charlottetown not 
     <lb/>
     long ago, I was greatly impressed, as I am 
     <lb/>
     sure all other members were who have visited 
     <lb/>
     that beautiful room, by these words on the 
     <lb/>
     memorial tablet which commemorates that 
     <lb/>
     historic meeting. On the tablet are these 
     <lb/>
     words: "They builded better than they knew." 
     <lb/>
     They built so well that we are seeing before 
     <lb/>
     us the fulfilment of the vision of those who 
   

            <cb/>
 

     sat there in 1864 and pictured this great 
     <lb/>
     union of free people embracing all the terri<lb break="no"/>tory then known as British North America 
     <lb/>
     and extending from the Atlantic to the 
     <lb/>
     Pacific. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Macdonald, Cartier, and those associated 
     <lb/>
     with them, were disappointed that Newfound<lb break="no"/>land did not become part of Canada in 1867, 
     <lb/>
     but they never despaired of ultimate success. 
     <lb/>
     Macdonald's renewed proposals of 1888 gave 
     <lb/>
     convincing evidence of the continuing hope 
     <lb/>
     that Newfoundland would join with the rest 
     <lb/>
     of Canada. Again in 1895, as has already been 
     <lb/>
     pointed out, another attempt was made to 
     <lb/>
     find a satisfactory basis for union, but again 
     <lb/>
     without success. It is not without interest to 
     <lb/>
     note that on these earlier occasions the 
     <lb/>
     renewed discussions related to the difficult 
     <lb/>
     financial conditions in Newfoundland. The 
     <lb/>
     present discussions, on the contrary, have 
     <lb/>
     taken place in a period of greater prosperity 
     <lb/>
     than has ever before been experienced in the 
     <lb/>
     island's history. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     From those earlier days up to the time 
     <lb/>
     of the discussions which have led to the 
     <lb/>
     agreement which will be before us for con<lb break="no"/>sideration, there has been a continuing hope 
     <lb/>
     in the minds of a great many people in New<lb break="no"/>foundland and Canada that the vision of the 
     <lb/>
     fathers of confederation of one great nation 
     <lb/>
     from sea to sea would ultimately be fulfilled. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The motion now before the house calls for 
     <lb/>
     a decision whether the bill to bring about 
     <lb/>
     the union of Newfoundland with Canada is 
     <lb/>
     to be introduced. In fact that is the only 
     <lb/>
     issue before us in this motion. Speaking on 
     <lb/>
     behalf of all the members of the Progressive 
     <lb/>
     Conservative party in this house, and with 
     <lb/>
     their unanimous support, I wish to welcome, 
     <lb/>
     personally and on their behalf, the introduc<lb break="no"/>tion of such measures as will complete this 
     <lb/>
     union upon terms satisfactory to the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland and the people of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     It is neither appropriate nor possible at this 
     <lb/>
     stage to discuss any details of the procedure, 
     <lb/>
     because we are still to be told what the 
     <lb/>
     provisions of the bill will be and the course 
     <lb/>
     which is to be followed in the discussion. 
     <lb/>
     We are now simply discussing a resolution 
     <lb/>
     which, in effect, asks us to express our 
     <lb/>
     opinion as to whether or not this house should 
     <lb/>
     proceed to deal with such legislation as may 
     <lb/>
     be required to bring about the effective union 
     <lb/>
     of the sister dominions of Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     Canada. On that simple question it is diffi<lb break="no"/>cult to believe there can be any division of 
     <lb/>
     opinion, and I join in expressing the hope 
     <lb/>
     that the proposal for union, made by Sir 
     <lb/>
     John Macdonald so long ago, may soon be<lb break="no"/>come a reality. I trust that in the years 
     <lb/>
     ahead the people of Newfoundland will be 
     <lb/>
     given every reason to have, in ever-increas<lb break="no"/>ing measure, confidence in and good will

     towards those with whom they will be asso<lb break="no"/>ciated within the boundaries of one great 
     <lb/>
     nation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Newfoundland has a great and unique 
     <lb/>
     history. It was the first part of the area of 
     <lb/>
     North America to be discovered. While other 
     <lb/>
     explorers were taking back to Europe reports 
     <lb/>
     about and later actual cargoes of gold from 
     <lb/>
     the newly discovered Americas, John Cabot, 
     <lb/>
     who discovered the island in 1497, carried 
     <lb/>
     back to England and to Europe, not tales of 
     <lb/>
     gold but tales of immense shoals of fish off 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland banks, which revealed a 
     <lb/>
     new form of wealth. That wealth challenged 
     <lb/>
     the adventurous of those days, and it has con<lb break="no"/>tinued to be the main concern of those who 
     <lb/>
     have settled and built Newfoundland during 
     <lb/>
     the past three hundred years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Great new industries have been built to use 
     <lb/>
     the forest resources of the island and now, in 
     <lb/>
     recent years, Newfoundland has added to its 
     <lb/>
     many achievements that of becoming one of 
     <lb/>
     the most important centres of international 
     <lb/>
     air travel in the world. It is a fascinating 
     <lb/>
     picture, one to arouse and to stimulate the 
     <lb/>
     imagination of every young Canadian as well 
     <lb/>
     as of every young Newfoundlander, to see 
     <lb/>
     the movement, from every part of the world, 
     <lb/>
     of people whose paths cross at Gander or at 
     <lb/>
     Goose Bay. I recall seeing only a few months 
     <lb/>
     ago, at the great airport of Gander, one plane 
     <lb/>
     which had just arrived from India on its way 
     <lb/>
     to New York and another from New York 
     <lb/>
     putting down just afterwards on its way to 
     <lb/>
     the Mediterranean. There were also passen<lb break="no"/>gers who were already there from planes 
     <lb/>
     moving both ways between Britain and the 
     <lb/>
     United States and between Britain and 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and also between this continent and 
     <lb/>
     France and Italy. It is one of the most 
     <lb/>
     challenging pictures of the immense changes 
     <lb/>
     which have taken place within these past few 
     <lb/>
     years, and it gives the youth of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land and of Canada as a whole some sug<lb break="no"/>gestion of what the expanding use of air 
     <lb/>
     transportation means to this country in the 
     <lb/>
     years ahead. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mining also has long been an important 
     <lb/>
     industry on the island, and there is every 
     <lb/>
     reason to hope that further exploration and 
     <lb/>
     development, which undoubtedly will be 
     <lb/>
     greatly stepped up with the new associations 
     <lb/>
     that will be formed, will greatly increase the 
     <lb/>
     value of these resources in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     itself as well as in Labrador. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Newfoundland we know today is the 
     <lb/>
     result of the hard work and the fortitude of 
     <lb/>
     a great people who have at all times retained 
     <lb/>
     the highest standards of personal integrity 
     <lb/>
     and public service as well as those simple 
     <lb/>
     virtues of thrift and hard work which are 
     <lb/>
     today perhaps more important than they ever 
     <lb/>
     were before. With improving transportation 


            <cb/>
        

     facilities, more and more Canadians have 
     <lb/>
     come in contact with the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland and know how justifiably proud 
     <lb/>
     the people of that island are of what they 
     <lb/>
     have accomplished, often under great diffi<lb break="no"/>culties. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Not only have our contacts with Newfound<lb break="no"/>land been extremely close during the long 
     <lb/>
     years of peace, but in the years of war there 
     <lb/>
     was an increasingly close relationship which 
     <lb/>
     laid the firm foundation of admiration and 
     <lb/>
     respect upon which has been built a widening 
     <lb/>
     confidence, in Newfoundland and in Canada, 
     <lb/>
     in the advantages of confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In two world wars the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland wrote some of the greatest pages 
     <lb/>
     in their long island history, and I should 
     <lb/>
     like to refer to that contribution because it 
     <lb/>
     has a direct bearing on the subject we have 
     <lb/>
     under consideration today. In 1914 New<lb break="no"/>foundland had the distinction of being the 
     <lb/>
     first of the dominions to commit itself to 
     <lb/>
     that vast struggle for freedom which ultim<lb break="no"/>ately enveloped the whole world. On August 
     <lb/>
     4, the very day on which war was declared, 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders who had voluntarily joined 
     <lb/>
     the royal naval reserve were called to the 
     <lb/>
     colours. On August 7, only three days after the 
     <lb/>
     outbreak of war, the Legion of Frontiersmen, 
     <lb/>
     the only military unit then organized in New<lb break="no"/>foundland, volunteered for overseas service; 
     <lb/>
     and that unit became the base of a wider 
     <lb/>
     enlistment which ultimately took the form of 
     <lb/>
     the Royal Newfoundland regiment. On Octo<lb break="no"/>ber 4, 1914—a day that will be recalled by 
     <lb/>
     many hon. members of this house—the first 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland contingent sailed on the s.s. 
     <lb/>
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Florizel</hi> from St. John's to join the first con<lb break="no"/>tingent of the Canadian expeditionary force 
     <lb/>
     off the island of St. Pierre. I happen to know 
     <lb/>
     that there are in this chamber those who will 
     <lb/>
     recall that significant union of forces when 
     <lb/>
     the s.s. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Florizel</hi> joined the other ships which 
     <lb/>
     were then lying at anchor. On arrival in 
     <lb/>
     England the Newfoundland contingent was 
     <lb/>
     brigaded with the first Canadian division on 
     <lb/>
     Salisbury plain. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In August, 1915, the Royal Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     regiment, as it had then become, sailed from 
     <lb/>
     England for Egypt and joined the 29th 
     <lb/>
     imperial division, landing at Suvla bay in 
     <lb/>
     the Gallipoli peninsula on September 20, and 
     <lb/>
     it took part in the terrific battles which fol<lb break="no"/>lowed at that time, when we who were then 
     <lb/>
     opposed to them learned to respect the fight<lb break="no"/>ing powers of the people of Turkey, as others 
     <lb/>
     fortunately have come to respect them today. 
     <lb/>
     After the historic evacuation of Gallipoli, this 
     <lb/>
     regiment was transferred to France and on 
     <lb/>
     July 1, 1916, fought at Beaumont Hamel in 
     <lb/>
     the tremendous battle of the Somme. On that 
     <lb/>
     occasion the Royal Newfoundland regiment 
     <lb/>
     was engaged in one of the really Homeric 


            <pb n="293" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-02-07_Page_0293.jpg"/>

     battles of history. It took part in one of the 
     <lb/>
     most desperate and tragic attacks of the 
     <lb/>
     whole war. Seven hundred and forty officers 
     <lb/>
     and men went over the top that morning to 
     <lb/>
     attack that key position in the enemy 
     <lb/>
     defences, and they suffered 684 casualties. 
     <lb/>
     Of this action, Sir Douglas Haig said in his 
     <lb/>
     dispatches: 
     <lb/>

     May I say, Mr. Speaker, that it is with 
     <lb/>
     people such as those who wrote that imperish<lb break="no"/>able page of history that we now join hands 
     <lb/>
     in the great enterprises of peace. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Royal Newfoundland regiment had one 
     <lb/>
     of the finest records in the whole war. When 
     <lb/>
     it was demobilized in St. John's on November 
     <lb/>
     25, 1918, 5,046 officers and men had passed 
     <lb/>
     through the ranks of that one unit, whose 
     <lb/>
     establishment in the ordinary course of 
     <lb/>
     events would be only approximately one 
     <lb/>
     thousand men. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Thousands of Newfoundlanders also served 
     <lb/>
     with great courage and distinction in the 
     <lb/>
     army, the navy and the air force units of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, Britain and the United States. All 
     <lb/>
     who saw them in action or learned of their 
     <lb/>
     achievements knew the stout hearts and great 
     <lb/>
     spirit of these splendid people who are about 
     <lb/>
     to unite with us in confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the second world war the association 
     <lb/>
     between Newfoundland and Canada was very 
     <lb/>
     much closer. The changing character of 
     <lb/>
     global warfare placed Newfoundland in a 
     <lb/>
     central position in that great struggle. Its 
     <lb/>
     strategic importance was highlighted in the 
     <lb/>
     early days of the war when Churchill and 
     <lb/>
     Roosevelt, with their military and official 
     <lb/>
     staifs, met in one of its many bays to draft 
     <lb/>
     and sign the Atlantic charter which pledged 
     <lb/>
     the people of the commonwealth and the 
     <lb/>
     United States to join forces in restoring free<lb break="no"/>dom to the people of Europe who had been 
     <lb/>
     engulfed in the flood of nazi power. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With the increasing role of long-range 
     <lb/>
     bombers and aircraft of all kinds, Newfound<lb break="no"/>land became a focal point in the efforts of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, Great Britain and the United States 
     <lb/>
     through the years which followed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     During the whole of the war, Newfound<lb break="no"/>landers served side by side with Canadians 
     <lb/>
     in different parts of the world and also in 
     <lb/>
     their own country. Because of the threat to 
     <lb/>
     the Atlantic coast by German submarines and 
     <lb/>
     aircraft, it was necessary to provide for the 
     <lb/>
     actual defence of Newfoundland as a very 
     <lb/>
     real contingency which might be faced. For 
     <lb/>
     that reason many Canadians served in New<lb break="no"/>foundland throughout the war. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the spring of 1940, the Black Watch of 

<cb/>

     Montreal were dispatched to Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     to protect the great airport at Gander, which 
     <lb/>
     was then being expanded as an operational 
     <lb/>
     base for the Royal Canadian Air Force and 
     <lb/>
     the air-ferrying services of Canada, Britain 
     <lb/>
     and the United States—the United States, of 
     <lb/>
     course, indirectly at that time. Because our 
     <lb/>
     common interests had become so closely 
     <lb/>
     linked, the defence forces in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     were brought under the Canadian Atlantic 
     <lb/>
     command in 1940. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Canadian coast defence batteries and anti<lb break="no"/>aircraft units were stationed at the airports 
     <lb/>
     at Gander, Goose Bay, Torbay and also at the 
     <lb/>
     loading piers at Conception bay, the mines on 
     <lb/>
     Bell island, as well as the fuel tanks and 
     <lb/>
     docks at Lewisporte and Botwood. A New<lb break="no"/>foundland coast defence battery manned the 
     <lb/>
     defences at Bell island while Canadian bat<lb break="no"/>teries were stationed at St. John's. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I mention this to indicate the close military 
     <lb/>
     association which existed between the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland and Canada under the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Atlantic command. In due course 
     <lb/>
     the Queen's Own Rifles of Toronto relieved 
     <lb/>
     the Black Watch at Gander and, as the war 
     <lb/>
     progressed and increased in intensity, units 
     <lb/>
     from every part of Canada were moved to 
     <lb/>
     different points in the island. These included 
     <lb/>
     the Chaudiere regiment, the Royal rifles, 
     <lb/>
     the Edmonton fusiliers, the New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
     rangers, and other well known regiments. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Royal Canadian Air Force operated 
     <lb/>
     bases at Botwood, Torbay, Gander and Goose 
     <lb/>
     Bay. Thousands of our young men and 
     <lb/>
     women served in these units at these various 
     <lb/>
     bases. Extensive communication systems 
     <lb/>
     were also set up under Atlantic command 
     <lb/>
     signals. Other Canadian services included 
     <lb/>
     the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps, the 
     <lb/>
     ordnance corps, medical depots and other 
     <lb/>
     special units. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In addition to those who served in their 
     <lb/>
     own units, many Newfoundlanders served 
     <lb/>
     in the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal 
     <lb/>
     Navy. They also served in all branches of 
     <lb/>
     the Royal Canadian Air Force, including the 
     <lb/>
     women's division. Those with Canadian units 
     <lb/>
     wore the Newfoundland badge on their 
     <lb/>
     shoulders and won friendship and respect 
     <lb/>
     from all with whom they served in every 
     <lb/>
     part of the world. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Because of these many contacts, thousands 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundlanders trained and served in 
     <lb/>
     Canada while thousands of our own young 
     <lb/>
     men and women saw service and made warm 
     <lb/>
     friendships in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have mentioned these details at some 
     <lb/>
     length because that history of the participa<lb break="no"/>tion of Newfoundlanders in two wars, and 
     <lb/>
     particularly that association between the 
     <lb/>
     young men and women of Canada and 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland in the second world war, 


            <pb n="294" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-02-07_Page_0294.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">294</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">Newfoundland</hi></fw> <fw type="running">HOUSE OF COMMONS</fw>
 
 

     convey an impression of how close our natural 
     <lb/>
     friendship really is, and undoubtedly greatly 
     <lb/>
     increased support in both Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     Canada for this idea of union, which has 
     <lb/>
     been before us for so many years. These 
     <lb/>
     young men and women, the very finest of 
     <lb/>
     our youth, were our ambassadors in this great 
     <lb/>
     cause; and no nation ever had better 
     <lb/>
     ambassadors than we had. Their efforts on 
     <lb/>
     our behalf, whether or not intentionally 
     <lb/>
     carried out for that purpose, have had much 
     <lb/>
     to do with what we have under consideration 
     <lb/>
     today. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The spirit of unity and wholehearted co<lb break="no"/>operation between Newfoundlanders and 
     <lb/>
     Canadians, which was so apparent at the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian army, naval and air bases established 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland during the war, offers a 
     <lb/>
     happy augury of the spirit of understanding 
     <lb/>
     and good will which can be established 
     <lb/>
     between the peoples of these two dominions 
     <lb/>
     when we become part of one nation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have touched only briefly on the many 
     <lb/>
     reasons why Canadians will welcome New<lb break="no"/>foundland into confederation, as was intended 
     <lb/>
     under the original provisions of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act. But it would be folly 
     <lb/>
     for us to disregard the criticism which has 
     <lb/>
     been directed to the methods which have 
     <lb/>
     been employed in bringing this about. It is 
     <lb/>
     not only in Newfoundland that very severe 
     <lb/>
     criticism has been directed against the way 
     <lb/>
     in which this has been done. Many New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders who are in favour of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, and strongly in favour, have been insist<lb break="no"/>ent that legislative authority should be 
     <lb/>
     restored to the people of Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     that elected representatives of such a legis<lb break="no"/>lative body should negotiate any terms which 
     <lb/>
     are to bring Newfoundland within confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. They contend that the commission of 
     <lb/>
     government, appointed by the government of 
     <lb/>
     the United Kingdom, has no right to negotiate 
     <lb/>
     such terms either directly or through 
     <lb/>
     appointed representatives. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Newfoundland is not a colony. Newfound<lb break="no"/>land was accorded the full status of a domin<lb break="no"/>ion in the Statute of Westminster. It is 
     <lb/>
     argued, and in many cases argued with much 
     <lb/>
     bitterness, that it is inconsistent with 
     <lb/>
     democratic practices that any group short of 
     <lb/>
     the representatives of a fully constituted 
     <lb/>
     legislative assembly should be empowered to 
     <lb/>
     decide the terms under which Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     will join Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     How strong that criticism is outside of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, as well as within its boundaries, is 
     <lb/>
     shown by a letter published recently in the 
     <lb/>
     Manchester <hi rendition="simple:italic">Guardian</hi> from Mr. Thomas 
     <lb/>
     Lodge, who was one of the first members of 
     <lb/>
     the commission of government appointed in 
     <lb/>
     1934. Denouncing in the most vigorous 
  

            <cb/>
         

     terms the procedure followed, Mr. Lodge 
     <lb/>
     describes the whole transaction as an 
     <lb/>
     "unholy deal." And those are his words, not 
     <lb/>
     mine. The same attitude is reflected in the 
     <lb/>
     press and in many public statements in New<lb break="no"/>foundland. There is also much public criti<lb break="no"/>cism of the procedure in Canada, so far as 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland is concerned, and the method 
     <lb/>
     which has been followed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     When the Prime Minister (Mr. St. Laurent) 
     <lb/>
     met the Newfoundland delegation appointed 
     <lb/>
     to discuss the terms of union, he said to them, 
     <lb/>
     "One thing is sure, the objective itself is 
     <lb/>
     more important that the approach." It seems 
     <lb/>
     to me that the approach is very important. 
     <lb/>
     It is essential that the union of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     with Canada be something much more than a 
     <lb/>
     mere legal union. It is essential that the 
     <lb/>
     union be one which appeals now, and will 
     <lb/>
     appeal in the years ahead, to the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland and to the people of Canada 
     <lb/>
     as something which united them in spirit and 
     <lb/>
     in friendship even more than it did in statu<lb break="no"/>tory form. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have no way of knowing what discus<lb break="no"/>sions took place between the government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada and the government of the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom or the appointed representatives of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. We do know that there is 
     <lb/>
     widespread discontent and dissatisfaction, and 
     <lb/>
     that this will not contribute to the spirit of 
     <lb/>
     harmony and good will which should be the 
     <lb/>
     main consideration of all those who welcome 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland as a part of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It must however be remembered that in 
     <lb/>
     the house we are called upon only to deal 
     <lb/>
     with the steps which Canada will take to 
     <lb/>
     bring about confederation. Except for any 
     <lb/>
     action by the Canadian government which 
     <lb/>
     has not been disclosed and is therefore not 
     <lb/>
     known to the members of the house, the pro<lb break="no"/>cedure so far as Newfoundland is concerned 
     <lb/>
     is one which affects the people of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land in their direct relationship with the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the United Kingdom. We may well 
     <lb/>
     regret that appropriate steps were not taken 
     <lb/>
     to assure that there would be no cause for 
     <lb/>
     any widespread feeling of bitterness or dis<lb break="no"/>satisfaction, but it is not for us to tell the 
     <lb/>
     people of our sister dominion what course 
     <lb/>
     they should follow in their own dealings or 
     <lb/>
     in their dealings with the government of the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I hope I shall be forgiven for indicating that 
     <lb/>
     I have some personal sentimental feelings 
     <lb/>
     toward the transaction we have under con<lb break="no"/>sideration. It happens that my father's 
     <lb/>
     mother was born in a fishing village in New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and that as a young boy I was 
     <lb/>
     constantly impressed with the stories of the 
     <lb/>
     hardy life of those fine people who lived by 
    

            <pb n="295" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-02-07_Page_0295.jpg"/>

     their daily efforts, chiefly from their ships at 
     <lb/>
     sea. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I was imbued in my early youth with the 
     <lb/>
     feeling of justifiable pride which those born 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland have in their great tradi<lb break="no"/>tions and the great background of that island. 
     <lb/>
     Knowing even by that indirect contact, as 
     <lb/>
     well as by more direct contacts in later years, 
     <lb/>
     something of the feeling of the greatness of 
     <lb/>
     their own island's history and all it stands for, 
     <lb/>
     I hope that everything possible will be done 
     <lb/>
     to avoid the discontent and misunderstanding 
     <lb/>
     which does exist, and which is reflected in 
     <lb/>
     the press and in public speeches being made 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland and elsewhere today. For 
     <lb/>
     we want to see the splendid people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland joining Canada in a spirit of real 
     <lb/>
     satisfaction and friendship and with a cer<lb break="no"/>tainty that it is to the interests and advantage 
     <lb/>
     of all of them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This is an historic occasion. The proceed<lb break="no"/>ings which carry into effect the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     this resolution will of necessity be debated 
     <lb/>
     in detail, and there will be discussions in rela<lb break="no"/>tion to those details. But in regard to the 
     <lb/>
     principle of carrying into effect the vision of 
     <lb/>
     those great men who met at Charlottetown in 
     <lb/>
     1864, I find it difficult to believe that there 
     <lb/>
     can be any difference of view anywhere in 
     <lb/>
     the house as to the hope that this will be car<lb break="no"/>ried out to the complete satisfaction of the 
     <lb/>
     people both of Newfoundland and of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For the reasons I have indicated, we will 
     <lb/>
     support the resolution before the house. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:COLD1">Mr. M. J. Coldwell</persName> (Rosetown-Biggar): Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, this is not the stage at which to 
     <lb/>
     discuss any of the details of the agreement 
     <lb/>
     and therefore I do not propose to do so. May 
     <lb/>
     I say at once that members of the C.C.F. 
     <lb/>
     throughout Canada join with other people 
     <lb/>
     in welcoming into confederation the island 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When in 1867 the fathers of confederation 
     <lb/>
     succeeded in uniting this great land which 
     <lb/>
     we call Canada, Newfoundland remained 
     <lb/>
     aloof. Now, after eighty years, what we may 
     <lb/>
     term the oldest British colony in North 
     <lb/>
     America joins this great undertaking, the 
     <lb/>
     nation of which we are a part. I say there<lb break="no"/>fore there can be no wonder when, in dis<lb break="no"/>cussing the resolution, we are filled with a 
     <lb/>
     sense of its historic importance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Newfoundland, by reason of her strategic 
     <lb/>
     position, to which reference has been made 
     <lb/>
     this afternoon, her wealth and, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     most of all, the sterling qualities of her 
     <lb/>
     people, is indeed a welcome addition to the 
     <lb/>
     country in which we live. She, may I add, 
     <lb/>
     has resources which have never been ade<lb break="no"/>quately and thoroughly surveyed, and about 
     <lb/>
     which in many instances very little is known. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Her people are descended principally from 
  

            <cb/>


     those hardy seafaring folk who crossed the 
     <lb/>
     stormy Atlantic in little cockleshells of boats 
     <lb/>
     from places like Bristol, Bideford, Plymouth, 
     <lb/>
     fishing villages along the Devon and Cornish 
     <lb/>
     coasts, and from places on the shores of 
     <lb/>
     Brittany, Normandy and Scotland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If I might interject a personal note: In 
     <lb/>
     the district where I was born, in the county 
     <lb/>
     of Devonshire, our parish registers record 
     <lb/>
     how in the late seventeenth and eighteenth 
     <lb/>
     century fisherfolk who crossed the Atlantic 
     <lb/>
     paid their church tithes after having returned 
     <lb/>
     from fishing expeditions on the grand banks. 
     <lb/>
     When they came back, this great reservoir 
     <lb/>
     of new food for a hungry continent of 
     <lb/>
     Europe was more valuable to the people of 
     <lb/>
     Europe than all the treasures Sir Walter 
     <lb/>
     Raleigh hoped to find farther south. It was 
     <lb/>
     his brother adventurer, Sir Humphrey Gil<lb break="no"/>bert, who concentrated upon Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     I believe it was Francis Bacon who said that 
     <lb/>
     the fisheries of Newfoundland were more 
     <lb/>
     valuable to posterity than all the mines of 
     <lb/>
     Peru. I believe that is true. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     So the beginnings of Newfoundland were 
     <lb/>
     laid by hardy fisherfolk who, perhaps, had 
     <lb/>
     no thought of settling so far across the stormy 
     <lb/>
     ocean. But it was the wealth of fish which 
     <lb/>
     laid the foundation of Newfoundland, just 
     <lb/>
     as it may be said that the fur trade laid the 
     <lb/>
     foundation of New France. And just as in 
     <lb/>
     the seventeenth century Canada was typi<lb break="no"/>cally French in its origins, characteristics 
     <lb/>
     and customs, so it may be said that New<lb break="no"/>foundland is typically British in its origins, 
     <lb/>
     in its customs, and in its general outlook 
     <lb/>
     upon life. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     So that once again, within this North 
     <lb/>
     American confederation we call Canada, the 
     <lb/>
     two great races who have laid the foundations 
     <lb/>
     of this country, together with the many 
     <lb/>
     hundreds of thousands who have come to us 
     <lb/>
     from many lands and who, too, have made 
     <lb/>
     their contribution, are engaged today in lay<lb break="no"/>ing the foundations of a Canada greater than 
     <lb/>
     we have known, making it a nation stretch<lb break="no"/>ing at last in every sense from sea to sea. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But just as the gentlemen adventurers into 
     <lb/>
     Hudson bay tried to keep the settlers out of 
     <lb/>
     what was then known as Rupert's Land and 
     <lb/>
     is now the Northwest Territories, Manitoba, 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan and Alberta, so the fish-dealing 
     <lb/>
     merchants of the west of England tried to 
     <lb/>
     keep settlers from landing and taking root in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. They wanted to keep the 
     <lb/>
     harbours and coves for the curing of fish, 
     <lb/>
     and to add to their own profits thereby. But 
     <lb/>
     settlers came, and in spite of the gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     adventurers they remained and they fought 
     <lb/>
     their way through. I mention this because 
     <lb/>
     I think it tells us something of the type of 
     <lb/>
     people and their background, and indicates 
  

            <pb n="296" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-02-07_Page_0296.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">296</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">Newfoundland</hi></fw> <fw type="running">HOUSE OF COMMONS</fw>
            
         

     clearly the sturdy stock from which they 
     <lb/>
     sprang, and their determination to see things 
     <lb/>
     through. The settlers had to fight repressive 
     <lb/>
     laws, and literally they were under a star 
     <lb/>
     chamber jurisdiction. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Just before I came into the house I looked 
     <lb/>
     up a reference to this repression in our his<lb break="no"/>tory. In 1633, in the reign of Charles I, the 
     <lb/>
     star chamber laid down a number of rules by 
     <lb/>
     which the people of Newfoundland were to 
     <lb/>
     live, and they were repressive indeed. Then 
     <lb/>
     in 1660, in the reign of Charles II, the pre<lb break="no"/>amble was altered and confirmed. Let me 
     <lb/>
     read you a paragraph from it: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     <lb/>

            <p>
     I can recollect no similar provision touch<lb break="no"/>ing any other British colony, or indeed any 
     <lb/>
     other colony elsewhere. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In 1832, if I may take a jump, representa<lb break="no"/>tive government was granted by the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of the United Kingdom, but it was not 
     <lb/>
     responsible government. True, it was repre<lb break="no"/>sentative government, but the governor and 
     <lb/>
     the executive were not responsible to the 
     <lb/>
     legislature. A few years later there was great 
     <lb/>
     friction in the colony, and the British gov<lb break="no"/>ernment was asked to intervene. They did 
     <lb/>
     so, and the constitution, such as it was, was 
     <lb/>
     suspended for a time. It was not until 1855 
     <lb/>
     that the country followed Canada in obtain<lb break="no"/>ing responsible government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not propose to traverse the checkered 
     <lb/>
     story of the island's political and economic 
     <lb/>
     history up to 1931. That was done in part 
     <lb/>
     this afternoon by the Prime Minister (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     St. Laurent), and to a certain extent by the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition (Mr. Drew). In 1931, 
     <lb/>
     when the. loss of markets and world-wide 
     <lb/>
     depression brought into bold relief the des<lb break="no"/>perate financial plight of the island and the 
     <lb/>
     terrible suffering among its people, some<lb break="no"/>thing had to be done. In response to appeals 
     <lb/>
     from the people of Newfoundland a royal 
     <lb/>
     commission was set up under Lord Amulree. 
     <lb/>
     I am not going into the details of its report. 
     <lb/>
     I am going to say, however, that I have read 
     <lb/>
     very carefully the report of that royal com<lb break="no"/>mission, which I think was published in 1934, 
     <lb/>
     and I was shocked at the conditions which 
     <lb/>
     were revealed in it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As we have heard this afternoon, the 
     <lb/>
     result was the suspension of the constitution 
     <lb/>
     again, and the setting up of a commission 
     <lb/>
     government, which was also described this 
     <lb/>
     afternoon. That is where the matter rests 
     <lb/>
     today. I agree with the Prime Minister and 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition that what we are 
     <lb/>
     about to consider is an agreement into which 
     <lb/>
     Canada is entering, and it is our duty to see 
     <lb/>
     to it that that agreement is in the best inter<lb break="no"/>
       

            <cb/>
         

     ests of Canada. It is none of our business to 
     <lb/>
     discuss other matters in relation to it. It is 
     <lb/>
     the business of the government of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, which at the moment is the government 
     <lb/>
     of the United Kingdom, to protect the inter<lb break="no"/>ests of the people of Newfoundland both in the 
     <lb/>
     agreement and in the manner of its making. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Having said that, Mr. Speaker, I want to 
     <lb/>
     say that I hope and trust that the agreement 
     <lb/>
     when consummated will prove mutually satis<lb break="no"/>factory and advantageous to Canada and 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. Therefore our first duty is to 
     <lb/>
     see that the terms of the agreement we are 
     <lb/>
     about to discuss are fair and satisfactory to 
     <lb/>
     our own country. As I say, I hope that as 
     <lb/>
     time passes both countries will find the agree<lb break="no"/>ment satisfactory and mutually advantageous. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think another matter we have got to be 
     <lb/>
     clear about is that we are not taking into 
     <lb/>
     confederation the stricken country of 1931. I 
     <lb/>
     believe it was the Prime Minister who said 
     <lb/>
     this afternoon that a financial surplus has 
     <lb/>
     been piled up, and that the country is now 
     <lb/>
     relatively prosperous. It has accumulated a 
     <lb/>
     substantial surplus. Indeed, the reason why 
     <lb/>
     we are discussing this problem at the present 
     <lb/>
     time is that it has emerged from the slough 
     <lb/>
     of despond which afflicted it in the hungry 
     <lb/>
     thirties.

     In September, 1944, the hon. member for

     Cape Breton South (Mr. Gillis), the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Melfort (Mr. Wright), and I 
     <lb/>
     attended a conference of the British common<lb break="no"/>wealth labour, co-operative and socialist par<lb break="no"/>ties held in London. We had the opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of meeting Lord Ammon and of hearing from 
     <lb/>
     him quite a long and interesting report. He 
     <lb/>
     had been appointed in 1943 by the coalition 
     <lb/>
     government to head a good-will mission to 
     <lb/>
     inquire into the situation as it then existed on 
     <lb/>
     the island of Newfoundland. The mission 
     <lb/>
     visited every part of the island and held 
     <lb/>
     discussions with representative people of all 
     <lb/>
     types, from the fishing people along the coves 
     <lb/>
     and coasts to the people of the towns and in 
     <lb/>
     the city of St. John's, on economic conditions, 
     <lb/>
     the political future of the island, and all those 
     <lb/>
     matters which are very much under discus<lb break="no"/>sion today. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Subsequently the Fabian society published 
     <lb/>
     a pamphlet much along the lines of the 
     <lb/>
     address which Lord Ammon made, and which 
     <lb/>
     I, and my hon. friends who attended the con<lb break="no"/>ference with me, heard. I want to quote from 
     <lb/>
     it a few words which express his appraisal of 
     <lb/>
     the people of Newfoundland. He said:

            <p>
     I thought that was worth putting on the 
     <lb/>
     record this afternoon. The leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition (Mr. Drew) has spoken at length 
     <lb/>
     in regard to their war record, and I think we 
     <lb/>
     all appreciate what the island did during the 
     <lb/>
     war. But Lord Ammon also found that con<lb break="no"/>ditions on the island were deplorable. He 
     <lb/>
     noted that the people depended for their 
     <lb/>
     livelihood mainly on fish, timber and the land, 
     <lb/>
     with fishing quite the predominant industry. 
     <lb/>
     He said that much of the poverty was due to 
     <lb/>
     the long-established methods pursued by the 
     <lb/>
     old-style salt and dried cod industry, in which 
     <lb/>
     the fishermen went from one debt sheet to 
     <lb/>
     another through the operation of what is 
     <lb/>
     known as the truck system, now illegal in the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom and in many other places. 
     <lb/>
     On this his comment was interesting, and 
     <lb/>
     again I want to quote it: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     The uncrowned kings of the settlements are the 
     <lb/>
     "planters" or outport merchants, who supply the 
     <lb/>
     fishermen, buy their fish and in their own lights act 
     <lb/>
     as "guides, philosophers and friends" to the settle<lb break="no"/>ments. All of them take heavy risks in advancing 
     <lb/>
     money on the probable out-turn of the fishery. If 
     <lb/>
     it fails, they fail heavily; if it prospers, they prosper.

     Many are honest men who have helped hundreds of

     <lb/>
     none seems willing to help the fishermen out of 
     <lb/>
     the net of debt in which they are constantly en<lb break="no"/>meshed; and all hold surprising views on the profit

     He also noted something else; that wherever 
     <lb/>
     co-operatives had been established—and the 
     <lb/>
     establishment of co-operatives has proceeded 
     <lb/>
     apace, very largely under the leadership of 
     <lb/>
     the university of St. Francois Xavier in Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia—or where the fisherfolk received cash 
     <lb/>
     for their product, the condition of the whole 
     <lb/>
     community had greatly improved.

     As I said before, at this stage it is not 
     <lb/>
     proper to discuss any of the fifty sections, 
     <lb/>
     and I do not propose to do so. That will 
     <lb/>
     come when we are discussing the legislation. 
     <lb/>
     However, I do want to say something about 
     <lb/>
     the necessity of our working together in an 
     <lb/>
     effort to develop the material resources of 
     <lb/>
     the island for the purpose of raising the 
     <lb/>
     standards of living and preventing further 
     <lb/>
     exploitation by monopolistic and selfish inter<lb break="no"/>ests, from which the masses of the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland have suffered from the very 
     <lb/>
     beginning. We should consider Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     and Labrador as part of the whole maritime 
     <lb/>
     region, which incidentally is a region that 
     <lb/>
     cries aloud for a new deal. We believe the 
     <lb/>
     federal authority, of course in co-operation 
     <lb/>
     with the provinces, of which now Newfound<lb break="no"/>


            <cb/>


     land will be one, should institute a policy to 
     <lb/>
     encourage the location of industry and invest<lb break="no"/>ment so that the whole maritime region will 
     <lb/>
     be protected from further exploitation by 
     <lb/>
     powerful interests with head offices in central 
     <lb/>
     Canada or elsewhere. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The other day we heard a great deal about 
     <lb/>
     the centralization of government. In my 
     <lb/>
     opinion the real danger of the loss of pro<lb break="no"/>vincial independence, yes, of individual inde<lb break="no"/>pendence, is not in the dominion-provincial 
     <lb/>
     tax arrangements made by this parliament 
     <lb/>
     with seven of the provinces, but in the con<lb break="no"/>centration of financial and economic power in 
     <lb/>
     the hands of a few wealthy individuals or 
     <lb/>
     corporations in one or two of the provinces 
     <lb/>
     of Canada. Not many months ago the present 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition, then premier of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, stated that 52 per cent of all indus<lb break="no"/>trial and military production during the war 
     <lb/>
     came from Ontario. Granted, that was a fine 
     <lb/>
     record for the managers and workers in indus<lb break="no"/>try in this province, a record of which they 
     <lb/>
     can be very proud. But is it not an indication 
     <lb/>
     of the tremendous concentration of industry 
     <lb/>
     in one province, if the hon. gentleman's figure 
     <lb/>
     is right, especially since the bulk of the 
     <lb/>
     remainder of Canadian industry, 48 per cent, 
     <lb/>
     is concentrated in one other province? It is 
     <lb/>
     all very well to argue that Canada has grown 
     <lb/>
     strong because the provinces control certain 
     <lb/>
     resources which make for national strength; 
     <lb/>
     but to say, as the leader of the opposition did 
     <lb/>
     on January 28, that—

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

            <p>
     —is unfortunately simply not in accord<lb break="no"/>ance with the facts. The fallacy of that 
     <lb/>
     statement is that some provinces are weak, 
     <lb/>
     not because they signed tax agreements but 
     <lb/>
     because of the concentration of industry, 
     <lb/>
     wealth and power in a steadily diminishing 
     <lb/>
     number of corporations located in a few 
     <lb/>
     places, and mainly in two provinces. Yet it 
     <lb/>
     should be noted that the masses of the people 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario by and large are no better off than 
     <lb/>
     the masses of the people in the other prov<lb break="no"/>inces of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We welcome Newfoundland, then, on 
     <lb/>
     another count; because it will tend to 
     <lb/>
     strengthen the position of the maritime prov<lb break="no"/>inces and the other "have not" provinces, 
     <lb/>
     and to highlight their problems. Indeed, the 
     <lb/>
     addition of another "have not" province will 
     <lb/>
     assist all the other provinces similarly situ<lb break="no"/>ated. If I may once more use the phraseology 
     <lb/>
     of the leader of the opposition the other day, 
     <lb/>
     this will help provide further checks and 
     <lb/>
     balances, not only against over-centralization 
     <lb/>
     of power in this parliament but against over- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     centralization of financial and economic 
     <lb/>
     power anywhere in Canada. Indeed, in my

     opinion the tax agreements represent the only 
     <lb/>
     attempt yet made in Canada to decentralize 
     <lb/>
     this vast power in our country by effecting 
     <lb/>
     some redistribution of public revenue among 
     <lb/>
     them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     But more than a policy of financial decen<lb break="no"/>tralization is essential. Already since the 
     <lb/>
     war we have seen serious unemployment 
     <lb/>
     affecting Halifax, Trenton, Cape Breton, and 
     <lb/>
     other maritime industrial centres. When the 
     <lb/>
     closing of the Trenton steel works and its 
     <lb/>
     removal to Montreal was being investigated, 
     <lb/>
     the president of Dosco defended it on the 
     <lb/>
     ground that to continue or expand the 
     <lb/>
     industry in Trenton would be uneconomical. 
     <lb/>
     Well, it is all very well to say, as the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition said, that— 
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>
     —the great developments that have taken place in

     the nine provinces have very largely been the result

     governments in each of those provinces.

            </p></quote>

            <p>
     But the function of the national government

     surely must be to give wise guidance to the 
     <lb/>
     national economy, so that all parts of the 
     <lb/>
     country may share in the development of our 
     <lb/>
     resources and the benefits derived therefrom. 
     <lb/>
     In other words, this parliament should have 
     <lb/>
     a positive economic policy for all Canada. 
     <lb/>
     What is needed is a national policy to provide 
     <lb/>
     the maritimes, now including Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     with the means to supply opportunities for 
     <lb/>
     maritime youth in the maritime region, just as 
     <lb/>
     we should have a policy to provide oppor<lb break="no"/>tunities for prairie youth in the prairie region 
     <lb/>
     and for Pacific youth in the Pacific region. 
     <lb/>
     The centralization trend, economically and 
     <lb/>
     financially, can be reversed only by the 
     <lb/>
     national government, which must have both 
     <lb/>
     the financial resources and the power to 
     <lb/>
     achieve a positive development program. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I suggest to the house that we might find 
     <lb/>
     some inspiration in what has been done in the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom since the war to reverse a 
     <lb/>
     similar trend and to assist the depressed areas 
     <lb/>
     of England, Scotland and Wales. Indeed it is 
     <lb/>
     not only socialist theory but economic neces<lb break="no"/>sity which has caused the Labour government 
     <lb/>
     to nationalize some facilities and to propose 
     <lb/>
     the nationalization of some others, including 
     <lb/>
     the steel industry. By controlling the bank<lb break="no"/>ing and credit policies of the Bank of England 
     <lb/>
     and by directing national investment, as well 
     <lb/>
     as using its power of granting priorities on 
     <lb/>
     things in short supply, since the war the 
     <lb/>
     British government has encouraged the build<lb break="no"/>ing of more than seven hundred new and 
     <lb/>
     important factories, more than four hundred 
     <lb/>
     of which have been built in depressed areas. 
     <lb/>
     Last evening I was talking over the telephone 
     <lb/>
     with a gentleman, not a resident of Canada 
     <lb/>
     but from New York, who has just spent six 
     <lb/>
     months in Britain; and he told me that the 
     <lb/>
     transformation in the depressed areas was 


            <cb/>
      

     nothing short of miraculous. He mentioned 
     <lb/>
     particularly conditions in Cumberland, where 
     <lb/>
     before the war some thirty to forty per cent 
     <lb/>
     of the people were continuously idle and 
     <lb/>
     unemployed. He went on to say that within 
     <lb/>
     a month or two that area will have a shortage 
     <lb/>
     of labour. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Some delegates to the parliamentary con<lb break="no"/>ference last September and October visited 
     <lb/>
     South Wales, for example. I was not one of 
     <lb/>
     that party, but they told of the tremendous 
     <lb/>
     industrial expansion and mounting level of 
     <lb/>
     employment in that depressed area, where for 
     <lb/>
     years before the war misery, poverty and 
     <lb/>
     unemployment dominated the countryside. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The effect of this is also improved housing, 
     <lb/>
     improved health and a tremendous drop in 
     <lb/>
     the death rate, particularly the infant mor<lb break="no"/>tality rate. Taking as an illustration the 
     <lb/>
     northern city of  Jarrow, which Ellen Wilkin<lb break="no"/>son once described as the city that was 
     <lb/>
     murdered, in 1934 the infant mortality rate 
     <lb/>
     was 95·82 per thousand, far above the 
     <lb/>
     national average of 61·92. Last year, because 
     <lb/>
     of the relocation of industry and employment, 
     <lb/>
     it fell below the national average, to 39·68 
     <lb/>
     per thousand. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Side by side with the decentralization of 
     <lb/>
     industry, requiring for our own country, 
     <lb/>
     incidentally, a program of housing, the ex<lb break="no"/>penditures on ill-health will drop sharply. 
     <lb/>
     The effects of malnutrition and overcrowding 
     <lb/>
     are minimized or largely prevented when 
     <lb/>
     you have industry, employment and all that 
     <lb/>
     goes with it. I say, then, that the entry of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland into confederation should be 
     <lb/>
     an occasion when this parliament should be 
     <lb/>
     considering policies that will give new hope 
     <lb/>
     to the maritime area. The problems of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland are similar to those of the 
     <lb/>
     maritime areas; transportation, economic de<lb break="no"/>velopment and the marketing of products. 
     <lb/>
     I say this is a challenge presented to this 
     <lb/>
     parliament at the present time, a challenge to 
     <lb/>
     adopt a really imaginative national policy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is my contention that no single province, 
     <lb/>
     no matter how rich, can alone undertake this 
     <lb/>
     kind of thing successfully, for it requires a 
     <lb/>
     careful survey of the primary products and 
     <lb/>
     resources of the country so that a decision 
     <lb/>
     can be reached as to the types of industry 
     <lb/>
     which should be located in the several areas 
     <lb/>
     that are under-industrialized or depressed. 
     <lb/>
     Then, of course, an intelligent national plan 
     <lb/>
     for the utilization of our resources is required. 
     <lb/>
     Along with that a conservation policy should 
     <lb/>
     be formulated, adopted and indeed put into 
     <lb/>
     effect. I know that, when Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     comes into this confederation, Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     as well as our other provinces will need a 
     <lb/>
     policy of that description for the conserva<lb break="no"/>tion and intelligent use of resources. Along 
     <lb/>
     with that should go a national transportation 
     <lb/>
     policy which would serve the nation instead

     of emphasizing the discrimination in facilities 
     <lb/>
     and rates which now exists. All this would 
     <lb/>
     have a great psychological and material effect, 
     <lb/>
     not only on the maritimes but on the whole 
     <lb/>
     country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When I was speaking last week on the 
     <lb/>
     address, I noted that there are difficulties 
     <lb/>
     ahead, difficulties which have been obscured, 
     <lb/>
     postponed or minimized because of the post<lb break="no"/>war demands and the European recovery 
     <lb/>
     program. Our whole economy is, indeed, very 
     <lb/>
     vulnerable. An imaginative plan for the 
     <lb/>
     development of Canadian resources, including 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, in the interests of all parts of 
     <lb/>
     Canada and particularly in the interests of 
     <lb/>
     the depressed or potentially depressed parts 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, should be formulated and begun. 
     <lb/>
     As I have said before, I think that is a 
     <lb/>
     challenge to this house and an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     which the entry of Newfoundland into con<lb break="no"/>federation brings forcibly before us. So far 
     <lb/>
     as we in this party are concerned, we are 
     <lb/>
     prepared to co-operate in accepting that chal<lb break="no"/>lenge and trying to do something effective 
     <lb/>
     about it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Is there any other reason, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     except that of the economic policy of the 
     <lb/>
     financial and industrial monopolies which 
     <lb/>
     have located in the central Canadian prov<lb break="no"/>inces, why the prophecy of Sir Leonard Tilley 
     <lb/>
     should so long have remained unfulfilled at 
     <lb/>
     least in part? Speaking in this house in 1879 
     <lb/>
     Sir Leonard Tilley said this: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     I am not, I think, over-sanguine when I say the 
     <lb/>
     day is not far distant when the population in the 
     <lb/>
     western country will be greater than in Canada 
     <lb/>
     and when the maritime provinces with their coal, 
     <lb/>iron and water power will be the manufacturing<lb/>centre for this vast dominion.<lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     Perhaps he was over-optimistic so far as 
     <lb/>
     the maritimes and the western part of the 
     <lb/>
     country are concerned. But, in large part, 
     <lb/>
     the vision should have materialized, because 
     <lb/>
     the resources are there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Those of us who can look back on the war 
     <lb/>
     years can remember a discussion before the 
     <lb/>
     war expenditures committee of this house 
     <lb/>
     when the late member for Vancouver- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Burrard, Mr. McGeer, the present member 
     <lb/>
     for New Westminster (Mr. Reid), the present 
     <lb/>
     member for Victoria (Mr. Mayhew), myself 
     <lb/>
     and others urged there should be some decen<lb break="no"/>tralization of the steel industry. We urged 
     <lb/>
     that if at all possible steel should be pro<lb break="no"/>duced where the plates were being used, and 
     <lb/>
     that the valuable deposits of coal and iron 
     <lb/>
     on Vancouver island might form the basis 
     <lb/>
     of a Pacific coast steel industry to supply 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia shipyards. We were told 
     <lb/>
     categorically by the steel controller of that 
     <lb/>
     day that no such development would be per<lb break="no"/>mitted because the steel industry was already 
     <lb/>
     well located; and, when the war was over, 
     <lb/>
     expanded production might be an embarrass<lb break="no"/>
 

            <cb/>

ment to the steel industry as established 
     <lb/>owing to a falling-off of demand or the import 
     <lb/>of foreign steel. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     While Sir Leonard Tilley may have been 
     <lb/>
     too enthusiastic in his vision, yet there are 
     <lb/>
     no reasons, other than those I have given, 
     <lb/>
     why industry should be centralized or why 
     <lb/>
     it should become concentrated more and 
     <lb/>
     more, not only in one or two provinces, not 
     <lb/>
     only under the control of one or two cor<lb break="no"/>porations and individuals, but under the 
     <lb/>
     control of industries which have become 
     <lb/>
     monopolistic in their character and in their 
     <lb/>
     methods. To my mind, at least, the partial 
     <lb/>
     fulfilment  of this vision of Sir Leonard 
     <lb/>
     Tilley lies largely in the hands of the 
     <lb/>
     present members of this House of Commons. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Newfoundland will come into confedera<lb break="no"/>tion with her great resources, many of them 
     <lb/>
     unsurveyed and many of them unknown. 
     <lb/>
     Not long ago, I read a statement by a Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic prelate who had spent many years 
     <lb/>
     on the island, Monsignor Sears, who spoke 
     <lb/>
     of the fine agricultural possibilities in western 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. Again, the problem of con<lb break="no"/>servation enters because that is where lum<lb break="no"/>ber is being cut. If we are going to have 
     <lb/>
     agriculture, as we are finding out in many 
     <lb/>
     parts of our country, we have to conserve our 
     <lb/>
     trees or reforest the slopes when they are 
     <lb/>
     denuded. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am very glad that this resolution gives us 
     <lb/>
     an opportunity of thinking not only of the 
     <lb/>
     great historic event of the entry of New<lb break="no"/>foundland into confederation, but also of her 
     <lb/>
     sterling people with their interesting history, 
     <lb/>
     people who have fought against great odds 
     <lb/>
     in the past and are fighting against them 
     <lb/>
     now. They will add much to our Canadian 
     <lb/>
     nation. It offers us too the opportunity to 
     <lb/>
     think not only of the future of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     but of the future of the maritime region, and 
     <lb/>
     indeed of that of all of Canada, and to 
     <lb/>
     impress upon us that we must do our part 
     <lb/>
     in the building of a far greater nation than 
     <lb/>
     even the fathers of confederation visualized 
     <lb/>
     when they planned complete confederation 
     <lb/>
     of the scattered colonies over eighty years 
     <lb/>
     ago.

     <persName ref="pers:LOW1">Mr. Solon E. Low</persName> (Peace River): Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, it is not my purpose to take a great 
     <lb/>
     deal of time this afternoon, because I feel 
     <lb/>
     that the ground has been quite adequately 
     <lb/>
     and well covered by the speakers who have 
     <lb/>
     already taken part in this debate. I feel, 
     <lb/>
     however, that we would be remiss in our 
     <lb/>
     duties and responsibilities if at this time we 
     <lb/>
     did not say something to indicate that we too, 
     <lb/>
     in our great movement across Canada, sup<lb break="no"/>port the principle of this resolution without 
     <lb/>
     any qualification. The social credit movement 
     <lb/>
     rejoices that the process of confederation,

     which started more than eighty-five years

     ago, seems now to be entering its final stages. 
     <lb/>
     We join in welcoming Newfoundland into the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian community of provinces, the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of Canada. To her, if she should 
     <lb/>
     choose to ratify the agreement which will be 
     <lb/>
     brought before us in due course, we extend 
     <lb/>
     the warmest possible welcome. At the same 
     <lb/>
     time we express the sincere hope that divine 
     <lb/>
     Providence will set His seal upon the greater 
     <lb/>
     Canada to the end that she may go forward 
     <lb/>
     and realize fully her great destiny. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I hope that the terms of agreement between 
     <lb/>
     our two countries, as finally approved, will 
     <lb/>
     be so satisfactory to both the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada and the people of Newfoundland that 
     <lb/>
     it will stand unchallenged for many years 
     <lb/>
     to come. I confess, though, that I have felt 
     <lb/>
     some misgiving arising out of the fact that, 
     <lb/>
     when the second referendum took place on 
     <lb/>
     July 22, 1948, only 44 per cent of the elec<lb break="no"/>torate voted for confederation. It is true, I 
     <lb/>
     admit, that, of those who voted, a majority 
     <lb/>
     voted for union. I do not suggest at all that 
     <lb/>
     anyone was at fault except the electors 
     <lb/>
     themselves, in that they did not get out to 
     <lb/>
     the polls. I believe, however, that we all could 
     <lb/>
     have felt more secure and happier about the 
     <lb/>
     result if sufficient interest had been taken by 
     <lb/>
     all the electorate in Newfoundland so that, 
     <lb/>
     when the vote took place, there would have 
     <lb/>
     been an undoubted, over-all majority of the 
     <lb/>
     electors supporting union. I hope of course 
     <lb/>
     that the great majority of the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland will eventually come to understand 
     <lb/>
     and appreciate the step that is being taken 
     <lb/>
     and that they will eventually give to it their 
     <lb/>
     wholehearted support. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Much has been said this afternoon about 
     <lb/>
     the people of Newfoundland and about their 
     <lb/>
     great country. Thus far all the speakers have 
     <lb/>
     extolled the virtues of Newfoundlanders, and 
     <lb/>
     quite rightly so. I share in the admiration 
     <lb/>
     that has been expressed for this great people 
     <lb/>
     and for what they have accomplished under, 
     <lb/>
     as we all understand, great difficulties. If the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders confederate with us, they 
     <lb/>
     will definitely enrich the sum total of the 
     <lb/>
     qualities of the people of greater Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Their spiritual, moral, physical and cultural 
     <lb/>
     qualities are certainly no less than our own. 
     <lb/>
     We know of course that their country 
     <lb/>
     possesses resources and strategic values of 
     <lb/>
     great importance. We appreciate all of these; 
     <lb/>
     nevertheless the advantage will not be all on 
     <lb/>
     one side. Let me say that if we are fortunate 
     <lb/>
     enough to have Newfoundland join with 
     <lb/>
     Canada, Canada will gain much. At the same 
     <lb/>
     time, let me say that Newfoundland also will 
     <lb/>
     gain much. We have here the greatest coun<lb break="no"/>try on the face of the earth, and I say that 
     <lb/>
     in full realization of the magnitude of the 
     <lb/>
     statement I am making. I believe, and have 
     <lb/>
     always believed, that Canada has a great 


            <cb/>
          

     destiny. I believe that in the years to come 
     <lb/>
     Canada will prove to be the real bulwark of 
     <lb/>
     the whole of America, not only materially, but 
     <lb/>
     spiritually and morally as well. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have always appreciated the fact that 
     <lb/>
     Canada is the one part of America that retains 
     <lb/>
     by statute observance of the Sabbath day. 
     <lb/>
     That fact gives to our country a moral 
     <lb/>
     strength which cannot be found in any other 
     <lb/>
     part of America. It may not be appreciated 
     <lb/>
     now, but I am strongly hoping that certain 
     <lb/>
     forces in our country, who today are moving 
     <lb/>
     to repeal that statute and to throw open the 
     <lb/>
     Sabbath day to the same activities that take 
     <lb/>
     place on week days, will forget their aims 
     <lb/>
     and objectives and join with us in maintain<lb break="no"/>ing in this country the Sabbath day as it 
     <lb/>
     should be. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When Newfoundland comes in, if she 
     <lb/>
     chooses to approve this agreement, I express 
     <lb/>
     the hope that she too will join with us in try<lb break="no"/>ing to defend what we consider to be one of 
     <lb/>
     the fundamental strengths of our great coun<lb break="no"/>try. We have in Canada, in my opinion, a 
     <lb/>
     people second to none anywhere in the world. 
     <lb/>
     We have a country which, if properly devel<lb break="no"/>oped on sound economic lines, can yield to its 
     <lb/>
     people a standard of living unequalled in any 
     <lb/>
     part of the world. We also have in our 
     <lb/>
     country, and it is a fact we all appreciate, a 
     <lb/>
     forward-looking people who, though they are 
     <lb/>
     sometimes given to inertia, when they are 
     <lb/>
     moved gather momentum and in due course, 
     <lb/>
     I think, find the right path and do what is 
     <lb/>
     right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I say these things for the reason that I do 
     <lb/>
     not want it said at any time that, on this his<lb break="no"/>toric occasion, we did not point out to our 
     <lb/>
     friends from Newfoundland who may join 
     <lb/>
     with us, as we hope they will, that they are 
     <lb/>
     fortunate in the opportunity that confedera<lb break="no"/>tion offers to them, just as we are fortunate 
     <lb/>
     in having them join with us. When our coun<lb break="no"/>try, in very fact, reaches from sea to sea, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, let us express the hope that, from 
     <lb/>
     one end of that greater Canada to the other, 
     <lb/>
     our people will join hands and march for<lb break="no"/>ward determined to make this country the 
     <lb/>
     finest place in the world in which to live; to 
     <lb/>
     build the happiest people it is possible to find 
     <lb/>
     anywhere on the face of the earth; and indeed 
     <lb/>
     to build here for the western hemisphere a 
     <lb/>
     real bulwark, spiritual, material and moral. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CLAX1">Hon. Brooke Claxton</persName> (Minister of National 
     <lb/>
     Defence): The speakers who have preceded 
     <lb/>
     me have all referred in the most fitting and 
     <lb/>
     eloquent terms to the importance that the 
     <lb/>
     entry of Newfoundland will have in the con<lb break="no"/>summation of the dream, the work and the 
     <lb/>
     achievements of confederation. One news<lb break="no"/>paper said that this is one of the great 
     <lb/>
     historic developments of the year. This, sir, 


            <pb n="301" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-02-07_Page_0301.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">FEBRUARY 7, 1949</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">Newfoundland</hi></fw> <fw type="num">301</fw>


        

     will have been one of the great historic 
     <lb/>
     developments of any year in the history of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. And what is more, its importance 
     <lb/>
     transcends even our own national interests 
     <lb/>
     and our own national hopes, because this is 
     <lb/>
     one of the few occasions in recent years on 
     <lb/>
     which it is possible to speak of union rather 
     <lb/>
     than disunion, of construction rather than 
     <lb/>
     destruction. And when we see, as we have 
     <lb/>
     seen around the world, disunion, revolution 
     <lb/>
     and disorder, it is a great forward step that 
     <lb/>
     we in Canada and our neighbour Newfound<lb break="no"/>land should be able to point to this as a 
     <lb/>
     constructive achievement in the completion 
     <lb/>
     of confederation. But further, too, it is 
     <lb/>
     significant that this union should be coming 
     <lb/>
     at a time when we are looking forward to 
     <lb/>
     the consummation of a pact—also a union— 
     <lb/>
     of north Atlantic nations in the proposed 
     <lb/>
     north Atlantic security pact. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     It is something more than a coincidence 
     <lb/>
     that these two great events in the history of 
     <lb/>
     our country should be brought about at the 
     <lb/>
     same time and for reasons which contribute 
     <lb/>
     one to the other. We can point to this work 
     <lb/>
     of union, this work of good will, this work 
     <lb/>
     of construction. The only other kinds of 
     <lb/>
     unions that have been consummated in recent 
     <lb/>
     years are unions whereby country after 
     <lb/>
     country has been brought under the domi<lb break="no"/>nation of the soviet union by coercion, by 
     <lb/>
     force and by revolution. Our union today is 
     <lb/>
     being brought about by co-operation of men 
     <lb/>
     of good will, of men who have the same 
     <lb/>
     traditions, the same historical background, 
     <lb/>
     the same racial origin, and who also, as long 
     <lb/>
     as there has been any knowledge of North 
     <lb/>
     America in Europe, have lived on this con<lb break="no"/>tinent beside each other. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     It is interesting, too, that we should consider 
     <lb/>
     this proposal against the background of 
     <lb/>
     the act of confederation itself; for union 
     <lb/>
     will be the final achievement of what was 
     <lb/>
     begun in 1867. Confederation was brought 
     <lb/>
     into being in consequence of the discussions 
     <lb/>
     between the representatives of the various 
     <lb/>
     colonies in British North America, begun at 
     <lb/>
     Charlottetown in 1864 and continued at 
     <lb/>
     Halifax, Saint John and Fredericton, and 
     <lb/>
     then carried on again at Quebec with repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives there from the colony of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. It is greatly to be regretted 
     <lb/>
     that it was not possible at that time to con<lb break="no"/>summate this union. But it was possible there 
     <lb/>
     to make the beginning of the great nation of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and so we saw added to the original 
     <lb/>
     group under the provisions of section 146 of 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act or other legis<lb break="no"/>lation Manitoba in 1870, British Columbia in 
     <lb/>
     1871, Prince Edward Island in 1873 and 
     <lb/>
     Alberta and Saskatchewan in 1905. They 
   

            <cb/>


     formed the original nine, and we are now 
     <lb/>
     completing this union of the colonies of 
     <lb/>
     British North America of 1867 to form the 
     <lb/>
     nation of Canada of 1949. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The Prime Minister (Mr. St. Laurent) 
     <lb/>
     referred to some of the differences in the 
     <lb/>
     nature of the problem that faced the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of the governments of Canada and 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland when we sat down in 1947 
     <lb/>
     and again in 1948 to discuss the terms 
     <lb/>
     together. Just imagine how conditions have 
     <lb/>
     changed since 1905. This brings into focus the 
     <lb/>
     new factors that have to be determined, the 
     <lb/>
     additional complexities and the new and 
     <lb/>
     greatly extended functions of government. In 
     <lb/>
     1905 there was no social security, there were 
     <lb/>
     no old age pensions or pensions for the blind, 
     <lb/>
     there was no unemployment insurance, there 
     <lb/>
     were no family allowances and there was no 
     <lb/>
     veterans charter. On the material side there 
     <lb/>
     was no civil aviation and there was no broad<lb break="no"/>casting, nor was there any income tax. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     These matters that I have mentioned repre<lb break="no"/>sent the immense change that has taken place 
     <lb/>
     in the functions and in the scope of govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but they also show an immense increase 
     <lb/>
     in the complexity of the subjects that had 
     <lb/>
     to be dealt with in the discussions with repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives, first of the convention, and then 
     <lb/>
     of the government of Newfoundland. These 
     <lb/>
     discussions started, as has been said by the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister, in 1947 when representatives 
     <lb/>
     of the cabinet met for several months with 
     <lb/>
     a committee representing the convention. In 
     <lb/>
     consequence of that discussion a proposal was 
     <lb/>
     produced headed "Proposed arrangement for 
     <lb/>
     the entry of Newfoundland into confedera<lb break="no"/>tion". The subheading is very important. 
     <lb/>
     It reads as follows: "Terms believed to con<lb break="no"/>stitute a fair and equitable basis for union 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland with Canada should the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland decide to enter into 
     <lb/>
     confederation." It is dated October 29, 1947. 
     <lb/>
     By a letter dated the same day it was for<lb break="no"/>warded to His Excellency, Sir Gordon Mac<lb break="no"/>donald, K.C.M.G., governor of Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     by the then Prime Minister of Canada, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     W. L. Mackenzie King. These terms for 
     <lb/>
     proposed arrangements had been worked out 
     <lb/>
     by the committee representing the convention 
     <lb/>
     under the chairmanship of Mr. F. G. Bradley, 
     <lb/>
     K.C., and by the Canadian government under 
     <lb/>
     the then Prime Minister, Mr. Mackenzie King. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     These terms were made available to the 
     <lb/>
     governor and the government of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land and then they were tabled in the house 
     <lb/>
     and released to the press. The terms were 
     <lb/>
     before the people of Newfoundland when on 
     <lb/>
     the second referendum they decided to enter 
     <lb/>
     confederation. I would submit that those who 
     <lb/>
     have some difficulty over the fact that the 
     <lb/>
     terms of union have been negotiated with

     representatives of the government of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, rather than with those appointed 
     <lb/>
     to represent a responsible government in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, must take into account the 
     <lb/>
     fact that first it was the British government 
     <lb/>
     which decided to put the question as to 
     <lb/>
     whether they wished to enter confederation 
     <lb/>
     on the plebiscite which was put before the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland; and, secondly, that 
     <lb/>
     at the time, when a majority of the people 
     <lb/>
     answered yes, they had these terms before 
     <lb/>
     them, and those terms had been explained by 
     <lb/>
     representatives of the people, including the 
     <lb/>
     members of the convention who had sent 
     <lb/>
     representatives to discuss the terms here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That having been done, I submit this gov<lb break="no"/>ernment had no choice but to proceed to meet 
     <lb/>
     the representatives of the government of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. Once there was a plebiscite 
     <lb/>
     on whether or not Newfoundland should enter 
     <lb/>
     confederation, once the people with the terms 
     <lb/>
     before them had decided in favour of enter<lb break="no"/>ing confederation, then this government could 
     <lb/>
     not do other than express its willingness to 
     <lb/>
     entertain negotiations and to discuss the terms 
     <lb/>
     of union with the representatives of the New<lb break="no"/>foundland government. It really is as simple 
     <lb/>
     as that. Once the British government had 
     <lb/>
     allowed the question of joining confederation 
     <lb/>
     to be put before the people, then this gov<lb break="no"/>ernment had no choice whatsoever in the sub<lb break="no"/>sequent course it followed. In consequence, 
     <lb/>
     the government of Newfoundland, acting 
     <lb/>
     through the commission of government, 
     <lb/>
     appointed the seven gentlemen, whose names 
     <lb/>
     were given by the Prime Minister (Mr. St. 
     <lb/>
     Laurent), to come here to enter into negotia<lb break="no"/>tions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     They arrived and were met; and I should 
     <lb/>
     like to tell the house something of the course 
     <lb/>
     of those negotiations. We recognize that this 
     <lb/>
     is an historic occasion, and it may be useful 
     <lb/>
     for our own people, yes, and perhaps for 
     <lb/>
     future generations, to have a note placed on 
     <lb/>
     Hansard as to the way in which negotiations 
     <lb/>
     were carried on. As a member of the cabinet 
     <lb/>
     committee, I had something to do with those 
     <lb/>
     negotiations and as deputy chairman, when 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister could not attend, it was 
     <lb/>
     my responsibility to preside at the conference, 
     <lb/>
     and to do a good deal of the work of pre<lb break="no"/>paration and discussion at all stages. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     My experience in conferences includes the 
     <lb/>
     dominion-provincial conferences of 1941, 1945 
     <lb/>
     and 1946, and conferences with representa<lb break="no"/>tives of the provinces dealing with different 
     <lb/>
     matters at different times, as well as confer<lb break="no"/>ences with other nations dealing with various 
     <lb/>
     aspects of international affairs. Thus far, no 
     <lb/>
     conference at which it has been my privilege 
     <lb/>
     to represent the government or the country 
     <lb/>
     has been conducted with closer attention to 
     <lb/>
     the sole interests and welfare of the people 


            <cb/>


     concerned—in this instance, the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada and the people of Newfoundland than 
     <lb/>
     was this conference. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I should like to pay tribute to the delega<lb break="no"/>tion representing Newfoundland, under the 
     <lb/>
     chairmanship of a most distinguished lawyer, 
     <lb/>
     citizen and statesman, in the person of Sir 
     <lb/>
     Albert J. Walsh, K.C. As chairman of the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland delegation he showed great 
     <lb/>
     capacity—and tenacity, too—in explaining the 
     <lb/>
     position and rights of the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. He put forward those views he 
     <lb/>
     felt it his duty to express, and did so with 
     <lb/>
     a courtesy and fairness as well as a frank<lb break="no"/>ness which inspired the whole proceedings. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     That was the atmosphere in which the work 
     <lb/>
     was carried on. There was no bickering; 
     <lb/>
     there was no backbiting; there were no 
     <lb/>
     recriminations; there were no leaks, either 
     <lb/>
     accidental or inspired; there were no occa<lb break="no"/>sions when there was a lack of frankness; 
     <lb/>
     there were no charges. There was the steady 
     <lb/>
     and competent effort by well-meaning people 
     <lb/>
     to see if they could not arrive at a fair and 
     <lb/>
     equitable basis upon which our two countries 
     <lb/>
     could enter into union and partnership. 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:CLAX1">Mr. Claxton</persName>: The conference began to

     meet on the 6th of October of last year, and 
     <lb/>
     was continuously in session until the terms 
     <lb/>
     of union were settled. The conference had 
     <lb/>
     its final plenary session in the Senate cham<lb break="no"/>ber, as it did its opening session, on the 11th 
     <lb/>
     December. Thus some two months were 
     <lb/>
     occupied in arriving at the terms. In addition 
     <lb/>
     to the plenary sessions of the conference, a 
     <lb/>
     number of subcommittees were set up. They 
     <lb/>
     are enumerated on page 81 of the report and 
     <lb/>
     documents which the Secretary of State for 
     <lb/>
     External Affairs (Mr. Pearson) tabled today. 
     <lb/>
     They included subcommittees on drafting, 
     <lb/>
     finance, fisheries, transport and veterans

     <lb/>
     the procedure that might be adopted in mak<lb break="no"/>ing a submission to the parliament at West<lb break="no"/>minster. Altogether the subcommittee on 
     <lb/>
     drafting produced not less than fourteen 
     <lb/>
     drafts of the terms of union after they had 
     <lb/>
     begun to be submitted to the plenary confer<lb break="no"/>ence, and also a number before. This work,

     the more than two months from the 6th Octo<lb break="no"/>ber until the 11th December of last year. 
     <lb/>
     On the llth December the terms of union 
     <lb/>
     were signed by representatives of Canada

            <p>
     In addition, a number of points had been 
     <lb/>
     raised by the Newfoundland delegation in the 
     <lb/>
     course of the proceedings. Many of these 
     <lb/>
     were put in the form of written questions, 
     <lb/>
     and others were raised from time to time 
     <lb/>
     throughout the deliberations. It was decided 
     <lb/>
     in the end that they should be dealt with in 
     <lb/>
     a document accompanying the terms of union 
     <lb/>
     and headed, "Statements on questions raised 
     <lb/>
     by the Newfoundland delegation during the 
     <lb/>
     negotiations for the union of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     with Canada." These were transmitted by 
     <lb/>
    the Right Hon. Louis S. St. Laurent as Prime  
     <lb/>Minister of Canada in a letter dated De<lb break="no"/>cember 11, 1948, addressed to Mr. Walsh,

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     During the course of our negotiations covering 
     <lb/>
     the final terms and arrangements for the union of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland with Canada, a number of questions 
     <lb/>
     concerning government policy were raised by your 
     <lb/>
     delegation and answered by the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment. In addition a number of temporary admini<lb break="no"/>strative arrangements were settled in order to facili<lb break="no"/>tate the union.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     It would not seem fitting to include in formal 
     <lb/>
     terms of union matters of this kind, since they are 
     <lb/>
     scarcely of a constitutional nature. I am therefore 
     <lb/>
     sending you the enclosed memorandum covering 
     <lb/>
     these various items. While these will not form part 
     <lb/>
     of the terms of union, they contain statements of 
     <lb/>
     the policy and intentions of this government if union 
     <lb/>
     is made effective by the approval of the parliament 
     <lb/>
     of Canada and the government of Newfoundland,

     raised by the Newfoundland delegation were

     forwarded to the Newfoundland delegation

     various points that they cover.

            <p>
     I am sure hon. members will realize that 
     <lb/>
     this result was made possible by the assist<lb break="no"/>ance of very competent officials. Both the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland delegation and the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     representatives were fortunate in that respect. 
     <lb/>
     On the Canadian side a number of officials 
     <lb/>
     participated, representing every department, 
     <lb/>
     agency and activity of the government. I 
     <lb/>
     should like to refer particularly to the work 
     <lb/>
     done by our high commissioner in New<lb break="no"/>foundland, Mr. J. Scott Macdonald, who was 
     <lb/>
     succeeded at the time of these negotiations by 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. Charles J. Burchell, K.C., who 
     <lb/>
     returned to Newfoundland for the purpose, 
     <lb/>
     and who assisted in the discussions by secur<lb break="no"/>ing information for the government, and also 
     <lb/>
     by facilitating the Newfoundland government 
     <lb/>
     in obtaining information about the situation 
   
            <cb/>
     
in Canada. Through this instrumentality and 
     <lb/>also through other officials such as Mr. J. R. 
     <lb/>Baldwin, who was secretary of the conference 
     <lb/>and of the Canadian delegation, and Mr. R. A. 
     <lb/>MacKay of the Department of External 
     <lb/>Affairs, there was the freest possible inter<lb break="no"/>change of information, and at every stage the 
     <lb/>work was facilitated in consequence of the 
     <lb/>public spirited service of these officials. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Prime Minister (Mr. St. Laurent), the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition (Mr. Drew), the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Rosetown-Biggar (Mr. Coldwell), and 
     <lb/>
     also the member for Peace River (Mr. Low), 
     <lb/>
     in their speeches this afternoon, referred to 
     <lb/>
     the character and the characteristics of the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland. Our experience 
     <lb/>
     during these negotiations extending over a 
     <lb/>
     period of a year and a half completely con<lb break="no"/>firms everything that has been said in praise 
     <lb/>
     of the people of Newfoundland. Our exper<lb break="no"/>ience could not have been better. It is also 
     <lb/>
     confirmed by the experience of the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     soldiers, sailors, and airmen who served in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland during the war. The Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister and the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     referred to the great part played by New<lb break="no"/>foundland in the first as well as in the second 
     <lb/>
     world war. It appears that in the first war 
     <lb/>
     a total of more than ten thousand residents 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland served in their own forces 
     <lb/>
     and in the forces of Great Britain, Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and the other allied countries. In the second 
     <lb/>
     world war a total of more than ten thousand 
     <lb/>
     served overseas, and in addition some 1,500 
     <lb/>
     men and 600 women served in the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     armed forces. Altogether a total of some<lb break="no"/>thing like 13,000 saw service of one kind or 
     <lb/>
     another. In his book "The Canadian Army, 
     <lb/>
     1939-1945" Colonel C. P. Stacey, director of 
     <lb/>
     history, has this to say at page 43:

     and doubtless are still on the wing, of that loud 
     <lb/>
     and smoky room where ships' crests and bells and 
     <lb/>
     trophies hung thick on every wall.

     It is true to say that, in the hearts of the 
     <lb/>
     officers and men of our navy and our mer<lb break="no"/>chant marine, St. John's occupied as large 
     <lb/>
     a place as any Canadian port. It was 
     <lb/>
     regarded as the home port of a large part of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian fleet. On this account, as well 
     <lb/>
     as the others that have been mentioned, we 
     <lb/>
     shall be especially glad to welcome New<lb break="no"/>foundland into confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But this story of working together in our 
     <lb/>
     common defence is not a recent one. It is 
     <lb/>
     reported that five companies of the New<lb break="no"/>foundland regiment were sent to Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada during the war of 1812; and I am 
     <lb/>
     glad indeed that, in the terms of union, refer<lb break="no"/>ence is expressly made in paragraph 44 to 
     <lb/>
     defence establishments, as follows: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Canada will provide for the maintenance in the

     <persName ref="pers:CLAX1">Mr. Claxton</persName>: That is what I was referring 
     <lb/>
     to. Mr. Speaker, Newfoundland forms part 
     <lb/>
     of the geographical pattern and formation of 
     <lb/>
     North America. This island with a popula<lb break="no"/>tion of 330,000 has an area of 42,000 square 
     <lb/>
     miles, larger than Ireland and amounting to 
     <lb/>
     84 per cent of the combined area of the mari<lb break="no"/>time provinces. But in addition Labrador, 
     <lb/>
     which since 1927 has been found to form part 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland, has an area of another 
     <lb/>
     110,000 square miles. Newfoundland is situ<lb break="no"/>ated at the mouth of the gulf of the St. 
     <lb/>
     Lawrence; and those of us who have come 
     <lb/>
     home from abroad, on coming within sight of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland going through the strait of 
     <lb/>
     Belle Isle, have felt that if we were not at 
     <lb/>
     home, at least we were getting close to it. It 


            <cb/>
        

     will be a source of the greatest possible satis<lb break="no"/>faction to us in the future if, when we reach 
     <lb/>
     the island on the way home, we really can 
     <lb/>
     feel that this is part of our home, our native 
     <lb/>
     land. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then, sir, the resources of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     have been referred to. They have great fish<lb break="no"/>eries. They have two great pulp and paper 
     <lb/>
     plants, one of them, Bowater's, being the 
     <lb/>
     largest paper mill in the world. There are 
     <lb/>
     seventy—five firms constituting secondary 
     <lb/>
     industries, with some 3,500 employees; and 
     <lb/>
     in addition to the iron ore mines of Belle Isle 
     <lb/>
     there are various other mineral deposits. Our 
     <lb/>
     belief is that, properly explored and devel<lb break="no"/>oped, these resources of Newfoundland will 
     <lb/>
     soon establish the soundest possible economic 
     <lb/>
     as well as historical, racial and geographic 
     <lb/>
     reasons for union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Our conviction is that it is in the interests 
     <lb/>
     of both countries that we should join together. 
     <lb/>
     Common experience is that generally speaking 
     <lb/>
     a marriage between fairly mature adults is 
     <lb/>
     likely to be successful, because they have 
     <lb/>
     gained something in the way of tolerance and 
     <lb/>
     understanding. Our hope is that that under<lb break="no"/>standing will help us over the difficult times, 
     <lb/>
     because there will be difficult times, in work<lb break="no"/>ing out the terms of our union. On the basis 
     <lb/>
     of our separate experiences, we will be able 
     <lb/>
     to build a better common life than either 
     <lb/>
     of us can separately. There is every reason 
     <lb/>
     for our supporting this measure. I am sure 
     <lb/>
     it will be a matter for the utmost gratifica<lb break="no"/>tion to the people of Newfoundland, as well 
     <lb/>
     as to the people of Canada, that the debate 
     <lb/>
     on this subject should have been carried on 
     <lb/>
     in a way which recognizes to the full that this 
     <lb/>
     is an important occasion in the life of Canada.

     At the time of confederation, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     D'Arcy McGee, who then represented part of 
     <lb/>
     the constituency I have the honour to repre<lb break="no"/>sent, said this:

     The leader of this group this afternoon 
     <lb/>
     mentioned some of the common problems 
     <lb/>
     we must face along with the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. The people in Newfoundland will 
     <lb/>
     be a long distance from Ottawa. They will 
     <lb/>
     experience the difficulties which others, who 
     <lb/>
     are also a long distance from central Canada, 
     <lb/>
     have experienced since confederation. I 
     <lb/>
     believe this parliament must be very sure the 
     <lb/>
     acquisition of Newfoundland should not be 
     <lb/>
     regarded as a new empire to be exploited by 
     <lb/>
     vested interests.

            <p>
     I should like to discuss this evening a prob<lb break="no"/>lem which so far has not received very much 
     <lb/>
     consideration during this debate, namely, the 
     <lb/>
     point of view of the 71,334 or the 47·66 per 
     <lb/>
     cent of the people in Newfoundland who 
     <lb/>
     voted for responsible government. Very 
     <lb/>
     frankly, I admit I cannot pose as a competent 
     <lb/>
     authority on Newfoundland's history or prob<lb break="no"/>lems. I did, however, spend a week in New<lb break="no"/>foundland in December. It was something of 
     <lb/>
     a shock to me to find so much bitterness there 
     <lb/>
     over the question of confederation. This 
     <lb/>
     is a problem which the rest of us in Canada 
     <lb/>
     would do well to consider carefully. I 
     <lb/>
     realize it is not primarily a Canadian prob<lb break="no"/>lem, but we must face the fact that 47·66 per 
     <lb/>
     cent of the people voted for responsible gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. Here is a minority coming into 
     <lb/>
     confederation feeling that they have real 
     <lb/>
     grievances. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I should like to take a little time tonight to 
     <lb/>
     present a point of view which I found in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. I might say I was rather 
     <lb/>
     surprised to find that Newfoundland is so 
     <lb/>
     isolated from Canada. I happened to be 
     <lb/>
     there the day after the terms of union were 
     <lb/>
     signed. The following day, when the by- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     election was held in the constituency of 
     <lb/>
     Digby-Annapolis-Kings, I was curious to 
     <lb/>
     ascertain the outcome of the elections, and I 
     <lb/>
     checked with the only radio system there, as 
     <lb/>
     well as with the newspapers, to find out what 
     <lb/>
     word there was from Canada. I was told that 
     <lb/>
     news from Canada had to reach Newfound<lb break="no"/>land via London and the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland would not expect to hear any news 
     <lb/>
     of the by-election on the radio until the fol<lb break="no"/>
       
            <cb/>
  
lowing day. It was a matter of surprise that 
     <lb/>we had not had Canadian Press service in 
     <lb/>Newfoundland during these years. You will 
     <lb/>recall, too, that during the years we in 
     <lb/>Canada have had very little information con<lb break="no"/>cerning events in Newfoundland. . 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If I had not spent that week in Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, I would have allowed this resolution to 
     <lb/>
     pass without raising the point I plan to dis<lb break="no"/>cuss with the members of the house tonight. 
     <lb/>
     I should like to remind you that, as has 
     <lb/>
     already been pointed out, Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     played a very active part in world war I. 
     <lb/>
     They added to their national debt to the 
     <lb/>
     extent of over $50 million and then, in the 
     <lb/>
     years following the war, found themselves in 
     <lb/>
     a difficult financial position. In 1931, New<lb break="no"/>foundland appealed to the British govern<lb break="no"/>ment for financial assistance, but was not 
     <lb/>
     satisfied with the terms offered by the British. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In 1933, Newfoundland consented to the 
     <lb/>
     setting-up of the Newfoundland royal com<lb break="no"/>mission, better known as the Amulree com<lb break="no"/>mission. The king's warrant sets out the 
     <lb/>
     objective of this commission.

     The recommendations of the commission

     are well known, but it might be mentioned 
     <lb/>
     that, in producing the papers relating to the

     report of the royal commission, it was pointed

     out that:

     oldest colony in the British empire were to default

     their members to transact the business of the 
     <lb/>
     country. As I stated, it was clearly set forth 
     <lb/>
     in 1933 and 1934 that this was a temporary 
     <lb/>
     arrangement and that, when the economic

     <lb/>
     for commonwealth affairs, and he was asked 
     <lb/>
     this question: If three forms of government 
     <lb/>
     were recommended to be put on the ballot by 
     <lb/>
     the convention, would all three go on? His 
     <lb/>
     reply was:

            <p>
     If a substantial majority of the convention said

     As was mentioned this afternoon, there was 
     <lb/>
     a proposal that, in addition to putting on the 
     <lb/>
     ballot the question of the continuation of 
     <lb/>
     commission government and the question of 
     <lb/>
     restoring responsible government, public 
     <lb/>
     opinion should be tested on the question of 
     <lb/>
     confederation with Canada. That proposal 
     <lb/>
     was defeated, 29 to 16. I have been inter<lb break="no"/>ested in reading the information which was 
     <lb/>
     tabled this afternoon by the Secretary of 
     <lb/>
     State for External Affairs (Mr. Pearson). At 
     <lb/>
     page 10 of the document I find the following: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The national convention, before concluding its 
     <lb/>
     sessions, resolved by unanimous vote to recommend 
     <lb/>
     that two questions, restoration of responsible gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and continuation of commission of govern<lb break="no"/>ment, should be included on the referendum ballot; 
     <lb/>
     but by a vote of 29 to 16 declined to recommend that 
     <lb/>
     confederation with Canada should also be included. 
     <lb/>
     The United Kingdom government concluded, how<lb break="no"/>
     

            <cb/>
        

     ever, that "it would not be right that the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland should be deprived of an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of considering the issue at the referendum." since 
     <lb/>
     the terms offered by the Canadian government had 
     <lb/>
     been the result of long discussions with a body of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders elected to the convention . . .

            <p>
     Then later on in this report, at page 71, 
     <lb/>
     there is a copy of a letter from the common<lb break="no"/>wealth relations oiiice discussing this ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and I am not at all convinced by the 
     <lb/>
     reasoning. Mr. Noel-Baker, in paragraph 4, 
     <lb/>
     says: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     His Majesty's government in the United Kingdom 
     <lb/>
     appreciate that there has been a feeling amongst 
     <lb/>
     some members of the convention that the entry of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland into a confederation with Canada 
     <lb/>
     should only be arranged after direct negotiations 
     <lb/>
     between a local responsible government and the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government. The terms offered by the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government represent, however, the result 
     <lb/>
     of long discussions with a body of Newfoundlanders 
     <lb/>
     who were elected to the convention, and the issues 
     <lb/>
     involved appear to have been sufficiently clarified 
     <lb/>
     to enable the people of Newfoundland to express an 
     <lb/>
     opinion as to whether confederation with Canada 
     <lb/>
     would commend itself to them. In these circum<lb break="no"/>stances, and having regard to the number of mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the convention who supported the inclusion 
     <lb/>
     of confederation with Canada in the ballot paper, 
     <lb/>
     His Majesty's government have come to the con<lb break="no"/>clusion that it would not be right that the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland should be deprived of an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of considering the issue at the referendum 
     <lb/>
     and they have, therefore, decided that confedera<lb break="no"/>tion with Canada should be included as a third 
     <lb/>
     choice on the referendum paper.

            <p>
     I think it is unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, in 
     <lb/>
     view of the clear decision in the first vote of 
     <lb/>
     29 to 16, and later on after a unanimous vote 
     <lb/>
     by the convention, that the British govern<lb break="no"/>ment decided to disregard the considered 
     <lb/>
     opinion of the convention. I submit that this 
     <lb/>
     is a grievance that will be remembered in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland for a great many years. As 
     <lb/>
     an impartial observer, I cannot see any good 
     <lb/>
     reason why the people of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     should not have had the first opportunity to 
     <lb/>
     decide whether or not they wanted a continua<lb break="no"/>tion of the commission government or wanted 
     <lb/>
     to have responsible government. I refer to 
     <lb/>
     the large number, 71,334, who voted for 
     <lb/>
     responsible government as compared with 
     <lb/>
     78,323 who voted for confederation. I am well 
     <lb/>
     aware of the argument that in the first 
     <lb/>
     referendum there was quite a small vote for 
     <lb/>
     the continuation of the commission govern<lb break="no"/>ment namely 22,311. But let me remind you, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, that of those voting, the largest 
     <lb/>
     number voted for responsible government. 
     <lb/>
     There were 69,400 votes for responsible 
     <lb/>
     government and 64,066 for confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     In the interval between the two votes, a 
     <lb/>
     great deal of propaganda was put out by 
     <lb/>
     those who wanted responsible government 
     <lb/>
     and by those who wanted confederation. 
     <lb/>
     When I was in Newfoundland I was given a 
     <lb/>
     copy of a "memorandum to the common<lb break="no"/>
          

            <pb n="307" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-02-07_Page_0307.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">FEBRUARY 7, 1949</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">Newfoundland</hi></fw> <fw type="num">307</fw> 
 

     wealth prime ministers now assembled in con<lb break="no"/>ference in London from the responsible 
     <lb/>
     government league of Newfoundland". I am 
     <lb/>
     sure a great many members of parliament 
     <lb/>
     have received copies of this memorandum. It 
     <lb/>
     draws attention to the fact that, after the 
     <lb/>
     decision had been reached by the most 
     <lb/>
     democratic process that the people had had 
     <lb/>
     for many years, those who were in the minor<lb break="no"/>ity used the publicly-owned radio there to 
     <lb/>
     get signatures to a petition and to get tele<lb break="no"/>grams sent into the British government to 
     <lb/>
     the extent of some 50,000. On the other hand, 
     <lb/>
     the responsible government people point out 
     <lb/>
     that while they wanted to present their point 
     <lb/>
     of view in connection with appealing their 
     <lb/>
     case to the British parliament, they have 
     <lb/>
     been denied access to the radio, and that they 
     <lb/>
     have not been given the same advantages as 
     <lb/>
     have those who were supporting confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. The charge was made in this brief that 
     <lb/>
     large sums of money came from outside New<lb break="no"/>foundland to influence the voting in connec<lb break="no"/>tion with these plebiscites. These are 
     <lb/>
     extremely serious charges, and I think that 
     <lb/>
     the people of Canada are entitled to informa<lb break="no"/>tion as to whether the charges are well 
     <lb/>
     founded or not. I think the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment should profit by the experiences we 
     <lb/>
     had in Canada following the signing of 
     <lb/>
     confederation in 1867. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For years we have had regional problems 
     <lb/>
     in Canada as a result of the tactics used in 
     <lb/>
     bringing about confederation. If in connec<lb break="no"/>tion with bringing about confederation 
     <lb/>
     between Newfoundland and Canada there 
     <lb/>
     have been practices which should not be 
     <lb/>
     approved, the people of Canada should have 
     <lb/>
     full particulars. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In summing up their grievances, the 
     <lb/>
     responsible government league mentioned 
     <lb/>
     that in 1876 letters patent were granted. 
     <lb/>
     These were suspended in 1934 on the recom<lb break="no"/>mendations of the royal commission of 1933, 
     <lb/>
     when a firm undertaking was given that this 
     <lb/>
     was a temporary arrangement and that even<lb break="no"/>tually, when economic conditions improved, 
     <lb/>
     responsible government would be restored. I 
     <lb/>
     do not accuse the Canadian government of 
     <lb/>
     being guilty in connection with these griev<lb break="no"/>ances. But our representatives who were 
     <lb/>
     negotiating should have gone out of their way 
     <lb/>
     to see that this commitment was fulfilled if 
     <lb/>
     at all possible. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The British North America Act of 1867 sets 
     <lb/>
     out specifically that the people of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land have rights which should be respected. 
     <lb/>
     Section 146 of that act reads as follows:

     It is clear to me that this important pro<lb break="no"/>vision of the British North America Act is 
     <lb/>
     being disregarded in the negotiations which 
     <lb/>
     are taking place, because the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland have not been able to express 
     <lb/>
     themselves through a representative legisla<lb break="no"/>ture, and those who have negotiated for them 
     <lb/>
     have not been elected by the people and are 
     <lb/>
     not responsible to them. As far as we are 
     <lb/>
     concerned, we should have been more anxious 
     <lb/>
     that this provision of the British North Amer<lb break="no"/>ica Act should be given some attention by 
     <lb/>
     the British government and by the nego<lb break="no"/>tiating members of the representatives from 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     In their representations the responsible 
     <lb/>
     government league point out that while a 
     <lb/>
     majority of 7,000 was secured in support of 
     <lb/>
     confederation, some members of the commis<lb break="no"/>sion government ignored their obligations and 
     <lb/>
     duties by participating in this controversial 
     <lb/>
     question, and they pointed out, that when the 
     <lb/>
     people in Newfoundland did vote on the ques<lb break="no"/>tion, the terms that were proposed to them 
     <lb/>
     were later found to be unsatisfactory. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     If the negotiations could have been carried 
     <lb/>
     on by the elected representatives of the people 
     <lb/>
     after they had full information on the 
     <lb/>
     problems that were being discussed we would 
     <lb/>
     not have had that dissatisfaction. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     When I was in Newfoundland on Decem<lb break="no"/>ber 20 my attention was drawn to a telegram 
     <lb/>
     which was posted in the post office in Grand 
     <lb/>
     Falls, a notice asking people to fill in their 
     <lb/>
     application forms for family allowances. I 
     <lb/>
     was later sent a form. At that time a great 
     <lb/>
     many people in Newfoundland were unwill<lb break="no"/>ing to accept the fact that Newfoundland was 
     <lb/>
     to be a part of Canada. They said to me: 
     <lb/>
     "By what authority are you Canadians com<lb break="no"/>ing into Newfoundland and distributing your 
     <lb/>
     propaganda?" A good deal was said about 
     <lb/>
     what family allowances were going to mean 
     <lb/>
     to Newfoundland, but while they were taking 
     <lb/>
     their case to the courts they thought it was 
     <lb/>
     quite unfair that Canadian family allowance 
     <lb/>
     forms should be circulated through the mail 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland, further aggravating the 
     <lb/>
     problem. I am aware of the justification for 
     <lb/>
     this conduct. We had given a commitment 
     <lb/>
     to make family allowances payable after 
     <lb/>
     March 31, but some consideration should 
     <lb/>
     have been given to the feelings of the 71,000 
     <lb/>
     people who felt that circulating the family 
     <lb/>
     allowance forms and literature was dis<lb break="no"/>regarding their constitutional rights while 
     <lb/>
     they were trying to get the British govern<lb break="no"/>ment to reverse the decision or trying to 
     <lb/>
     carry their case to the highest possible 
     <lb/>
     tribunal.

            <p>
     In conclusion, I should like to plead with 
     <lb/>
     hon. members in all sections of the house to 
     <lb/>
     face up to the fact that here is a minority 
     <lb/>
     problem that will embarrass us for some con<lb break="no"/>siderable time. I am familiar with the com<lb break="no"/>ment made by a great many that in this 
     <lb/>
     point of view I am expressing the case of the 
     <lb/>
     wealthy people in the Avalon peninsula. I 
     <lb/>
     need not tell the house that my contacts were 
     <lb/>
     not with the millionaires in St. John's. I 
     <lb/>
     tried to find a fairly good cross section of 
     <lb/>
     opinion in Newfoundland, and we must try 
     <lb/>
     to recognize that an injustice has been done 
     <lb/>
     in the methods which have been adopted in 
     <lb/>
     the negotiations. I do not suggest for a 
     <lb/>
     moment that all the wrong is on one side and 
     <lb/>
     all the right on the other. I do not propose 
     <lb/>
     to take sides in what is really a Newfound<lb break="no"/>land domestic problem, but it does vitally 
     <lb/>
     affect Canada and it is the duty of all hon. 
     <lb/>
     members to admit frankly that there is a 
     <lb/>
     problem there and that together we must try 
     <lb/>
     to solve it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have no doubt that eventually the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland will be happy members of 
     <lb/>
     our larger Canadian family. I agree with the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of National Defence (Mr. Claxton), 
     <lb/>
     who suggested that marriages which take 
     <lb/>
     place between mature adults can result in a 
     <lb/>
     happy future for the participating parties. 
     <lb/>
     There are also adjustments which have to be 
     <lb/>
     made by people who marry late in life. The 
     <lb/>
     negotiating parties should have full informa<lb break="no"/>tion regarding all the details which have 
     <lb/>
     occurred in connection with the arrangements 
     <lb/>
     leading up to the marriage. I should like to 
     <lb/>
     express the hope that people in all parts of 
     <lb/>
     Canada will co-operate with our friends from 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, who will become a part of 
     <lb/>
     the country, and that we shall see to it that 
     <lb/>
     we can all work to establish a better Canada 
     <lb/>
     than we have ever known before.

     form an agreement and an alliance to go into 
     <lb/>
     confederation with Newfoundland. But the 
     <lb/>
     sad fact about this whole arrangement is that 
     <lb/>
     no similar legislature in Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     elected by the people, ever had any oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity to discuss this matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     In a few weeks, if this measure becomes 
     <lb/>
     law, the parliament of Great Britain will 
     <lb/>
     similarly be deciding the fate of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land on the basis of an agreement of con<lb break="no"/>federation between it and Canada. I say 
     <lb/>
     there is a very serious lack here, when the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland are denied that 
     <lb/>
     right. Surely they are the people more con<lb break="no"/>cerned than any others. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Definitely, there should be an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     for the people of Newfoundland, through a 
     <lb/>
     legislative body democratically elected by' the 
     <lb/>
     people of that country, to take the terms of 
     <lb/>
     the agreement, place them before their repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives, have those elected representatives 
     <lb/>
     discuss the matter and decide it in a proper 
     <lb/>
     democratic way, as should be done by a real 
     <lb/>
     parliament. Surely this should be done in 
     <lb/>
     any country among the democracies of the 
     <lb/>
     British commonwealth of nations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     But what have the people of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     had? They have had no responsible legisla<lb break="no"/>ture for a number of years. A commission 
     <lb/>
     has been governing that country since 1934, 
     <lb/>
     I believe. This commission carried on its 
     <lb/>
     work, and suddenly it was decided that a 
     <lb/>
     convention should be held. Under the author<lb break="no"/>ity of the British government they sat in con<lb break="no"/>vention. In that convention there were some 
     <lb/>
     forty-five representatives who, under their 
     <lb/>
     terms of reference, were instructed, I believe, 
     <lb/>
     only to investigate the matter and make 
     <lb/>
     recommendations. But instead of that, they 
     <lb/>
     have gone ahead with some kind of referen<lb break="no"/>dum—a referendum which has not given a 
     <lb/>
     very large or clear majority. Even those 
     <lb/>
     people who voted for confederation did not 
     <lb/>
     represent one-half of the voters on the voters' 
     <lb/>
     list, though, it is true, they represent 52 per 
     <lb/>
     cent of the people who voted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But what did they vote for? Did they vote 
     <lb/>
     for some agreement? No; the agreement was 
     <lb/>
     brought into being after the vote.

     <lb/>
     the right of a people in a democratic country, 
     <lb/>
     through their legislature, to have some say 
     <lb/>
     about the terms of an agreement which they 
     <lb/>
     are to enter into. That, it seems to me, is 
     <lb/>
     not right, and Canada's parliament should not 
     <lb/>
     be a party to an agreement under which such 
     <lb/>
     fundamental, basic, democratic rights are 
     <lb/>
     denied to a people who some day will be wel<lb break="no"/>comed, as I know they will be, if they decide 
     <lb/>
     to come in. Let Newfoundland feel that we 
     <lb/>
     have stood here and fought for her demo<lb break="no"/>cratic rights. Let her feel that we welcome 
     <lb/>
     her as a sister in a great dominion. Let her 
     <lb/>
     be convinced of our belief that fundamentally 
     <lb/>
     her people should have the full and proper 
     <lb/>
     democratic right, the basic right, to some say 
     <lb/>
     as to whether or not they accept the terms of 
     <lb/>
     agreement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I hope I have made our position clear. We 
     <lb/>
     certainly would welcome Newfoundland, if 
     <lb/>
     she could come in. I think we could do it 
     <lb/>
     more wholeheartedly if we felt that all the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland and of Labrador had 
     <lb/>
     had a proper democratic part in making the 
     <lb/>
     decision and in drawing up the agreement.

     <persName ref="pers:GILL2">Mr. Clarence Gillis</persName> (Cape Breton South): 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, I did not intend to take part in 
     <lb/>
     this debate, because I thought this afternoon 
     <lb/>
     that the hon. member for Rosetown-Biggar 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Coldwell) stated very clearly the case for 
     <lb/>
     members of this group. But after listening 
     <lb/>
     to the last two speeches I have felt that mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the House of Commons, or the public 
     <lb/>
     generally, may think that there is a division 
     <lb/>
     in this group over the entry of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     into confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROWE2">Mr. Rowe</persName>: Better have a caucus. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GILL2">Mr. Gillis</persName>: Such is not the case. This after<lb break="no"/>noon the Prime Minister (Mr. St. Laurent), 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition (Mr. Drew) and 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Rosetown-Biggar did an 
     <lb/>
     excellent job in placing the facts of the mat<lb break="no"/>ter before the house. Moreover, they gave, I 
     <lb/>
     believe, a comprehensive historical back<lb break="no"/>ground, and the reasons why Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     should enter confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I rise at this time to say that I know some<lb break="no"/>thing about Newfoundland and its problems. 
     <lb/>
     From where I have made my home for a good 
     <lb/>
     many years it is only ninety-six miles across 
    

            <cb/>

the gulf. I have known many Newfound<lb break="no"/>landers, and there are perhaps more of them 
     <lb/>in my constituency than in any other con<lb break="no"/>stituency in Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACN2">Mr. MacNicol</persName>: There are over a thousand 
     <lb/>
     in mine. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GILL2">Mr. Gillis</persName>: I believe the step now being 
     <lb/>
     taken to bring Newfoundland into confedera<lb break="no"/>tion is one which should have been taken 
     <lb/>
     many years ago. My understanding is that 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundlanders are now being emancipated 
     <lb/>
     from a small group of fish merchants who 
     <lb/>
     have exploited them for the past three hun<lb break="no"/>dred years. As I said before, this is a step 
     <lb/>
     in the right direction. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let me now say something which has not 
     <lb/>
     been said before. For many years the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland were allowed to enter 
     <lb/>
     Canada freely and to take employment here. 
     <lb/>
     During the winter months when they were 
     <lb/>
     not able to fish—and that is about the only 
     <lb/>
     industry on the island—hundreds of New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders would come to Cape Breton 
     <lb/>
     island to work in the coal mines. They 
     <lb/>
     would find employment there during the 
     <lb/>
     winter months, and then return to their fish<lb break="no"/>ing industry when the season opened. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Since about 1931 that has not been permit<lb break="no"/>ted. The coal mining regulations in Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia were amended so as to preclude them 
     <lb/>
     from going into the mines and taking employ<lb break="no"/>ment as coal miners. Consequently our 
     <lb/>
     immigration laws were amended so as to 
     <lb/>
     prohibit the entry of Newfoundlanders into 
     <lb/>
     Canada. They were treated almost as Euro<lb break="no"/>peans, or others coming from foreign 
     <lb/>
     countries. I thought that was a great dis<lb break="no"/>service to the people in my part of the 
     <lb/>
     country because, as has been suggested by one 
     <lb/>
     hon. member, they are good workers and good 
     <lb/>
     citizens. Not many of them are to be found 
     <lb/>
     on relief, and they can turn their hand to 
     <lb/>
     almost anything. They have had to develop 
     <lb/>
     that technique because of the conditions under 
     <lb/>
     which they have lived in their own country. 
     <lb/>
     They had to be jacks of all trades. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Having said that, let me add that I am not 
     <lb/>
     quarreling with what happened in New<lb break="no"/>foundland. I believe that those who argue 
     <lb/>
     along the lines of responsible government 
     <lb/>
     are dealing with a misnomer. It is not 
     <lb/>
     responsible government they are looking for, 
     <lb/>
     because that is exactly what they are getting 
     <lb/>
     now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GIBS2">Mr. Gibson</persName> (Comox-Alberni): They never 
     <lb/>
     had it before. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GILL2">Mr. Gillis</persName>: Arguments were made for the 
     <lb/>
     setting-up of a national government, and 
     <lb/>
     remaining out of confederation. In the last 
     <lb/>
     fifty years they have had governments of that 
   

            <pb n="310" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-02-07_Page_0310.jpg"/>
           <fw type="num">310</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">Newfoundland</hi></fw> <fw type="running">HOUSE OF COMMONS</fw>


     kind which have failed twice. In each case 
     <lb/>
     when the national government failed they 
     <lb/>
     had to turn to Great Britain for a commission 
     <lb/>
     government to administer the affairs of the 
     <lb/>
     island. Having failed twice with that kind 
     <lb/>
     of thing, I think it is unreasonable to ask the 
     <lb/>
     people of Newfoundland to go back to it. If 
     <lb/>
     it is responsible government they are looking 
     <lb/>
     for, in my opinion they are getting responsible 
     <lb/>
     government now for the first time in the 
     <lb/>
     history of the island. Two votes were taken, 
     <lb/>
     and after they were taken there was still a 
     <lb/>
     majority of approximately 7,000 in favour of 
     <lb/>
     entering confederation. I do not think any<lb break="no"/>one can say that is undemocratic, because the 
     <lb/>
     whole population of the island is only equal 
     <lb/>
     to about three constituencies. After a lot of 
     <lb/>
     propaganda and educational work two votes 
     <lb/>
     were taken, and the majority of the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland who voted said they wanted 
     <lb/>
     to come into confederation with Canada. I 
     <lb/>
     think that is democratic. I think the pro<lb break="no"/>cesses employed in elections in Canada were 
     <lb/>
     followed in Newfoundland. The argument 
     <lb/>
     has been raised, what are you going to do 
     <lb/>
     about the 71,000 people who voted the other 
     <lb/>
     way? I should like to ask any member of the 
     <lb/>
     house, what are you going to do with the 
     <lb/>
     large number of people in your own riding 
     <lb/>
     who voted against you in the election? 
     <lb/>
     Whether they like you or not, they accept you 
     <lb/>
     as their representative. That is exactly the 
     <lb/>
     situation in Newfoundland. There was a 45 
     <lb/>
     per cent vote in favour of union. Under the 
     <lb/>
     circumstances, where the use of the franchise 
     <lb/>
     had been out of the hands of the people of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland since 1934, and where very 
     <lb/>
     little educational work had been done in the 
     <lb/>
     matter of the ballot, to get a 45 per cent vote 
     <lb/>
     in favour in a vote taken under the conditions 
     <lb/>
     that existed reflects a good deal of credit on 
     <lb/>
     the people who turned out to vote. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not see any reason to quarrel with 
     <lb/>
     that. As I see it, it is our duty now not to 
     <lb/>
     confuse the matter any further by raising 
     <lb/>
     those arguments which arise from sectarian 
     <lb/>
     sources. On this question I have seen certain 
     <lb/>
     briefs which have come from Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     and which I would be ashamed to introduce 
     <lb/>
     in this house. It is a straight sectarian appeal 
     <lb/>
     that is being made to the people of Canada 
     <lb/>
     and to the members of this House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons in order to offset what, in my opinion, 
     <lb/>
     was a democratic vote of the people of New<lb break="no"/>foundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I live close to them and have worked with 
     <lb/>
     many of them. I know the disabilities which 
     <lb/>
     handicap them at the present time; but I 
     <lb/>
     believe that, if we handle the matter sen<lb break="no"/>sibly and do not fan the flames any more 
     <lb/>
     than they have been fanned, if we put this 
     <lb/>
     agreement into effect, install good administra<lb break="no"/>
 

            <cb/>
         

     tive machinery, have members from New<lb break="no"/>foundland in this House of Commons, and 
     <lb/>
     let the people of Newfoundland set up their 
     <lb/>
     own provincial government, the union will 
     <lb/>
     be successful. That is responsible govern<lb break="no"/>ment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In my opinion they are being fooled, by a 
     <lb/>
     lot of propaganda they are getting now, into 
     <lb/>
     the belief that they are going to be dictated 
     <lb/>
     to and legislated for by Ottawa. The reverse 
     <lb/>
     is true. They will have their own govern<lb break="no"/>ment similar to our provincial governments. 
     <lb/>
     They will work out their own problems in 
     <lb/>
     the provincial field. They will have their 
     <lb/>
     members in this national forum to carry their 
     <lb/>
     message further. They will benefit from 
     <lb/>
     much of the social legislation for which we 
     <lb/>
     have had to fight over the years. I am in 
     <lb/>
     favour of this agreement and I think it 
     <lb/>
     should be carried into effect. I intend to go 
     <lb/>
     to Newfoundland and say what I am saying 
     <lb/>
     here tonight, only a lot more so. I got up on 
     <lb/>
     the spur of the moment because I felt I had 
     <lb/>
     to say these things in view of what was 
     <lb/>
     said by the last two speakers.

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:GARS1">Mr. Garson</persName>: The statement in connection 
     <lb/>
     with this resolution must necessarily be an 
     <lb/>
     extremely short one. As hon. members 
     <lb/>
     know, there are on the federal statute books 
     <lb/>
     of Canada a number of statutes which refer 
     <lb/>
     to the various provinces of Canada by name. 
     <lb/>
     They have to do with a variety of subjects. 
     <lb/>
     The only purpose of the bill, to which this 
     <lb/>
     resolution is the introduction, is to amend 
     <lb/>
     those various statutes by inserting the word 
     <lb/>
     "Newfoundland" in the appropriate places in 
     <lb/>
     order to make all of those statutes now upon 
     <lb/>
     the books apply to Newfoundland in the same 
     <lb/>
     way as they do to every other province of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. When the bill goes into committee 
     <lb/>
     anyone who is interested may follow, section 
     <lb/>
     by section, the explanations which are given 
     <lb/>
     opposite, and tie them in, but all of these 
     <lb/>
     provisions without exception are what lawyers 
     <lb/>
     term consequential in that they arise out 
     <lb/>
     of the fact, and as a consequence, of New<lb break="no"/>foundland being brought into confederation. 
     <lb/>
     They are the amending provisions that have 
     <lb/>
     to be made in a number of federal statutes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMIT8">Mr. A. L. Smith</persName> (Calgary West): I am not 
     <lb/>
     attempting to speak on this, but I should like 
     <lb/>
     to learn from the Minister of Justice (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Garson) what method has been adopted. Have 
     <lb/>
     you gone through all the statutes of Canada 
     <lb/>
     with a view to finding the particular ones 
     <lb/>
     that need to be amended, or will your bill 
     <lb/>
     be in somewhat general terms, saying that 
     <lb/>
     where so and so is mentioned it shall be 
     <lb/>
     deemed to include Newfoundland? I am 
     <lb/>
     merely asking for information. For example, 
     <lb/>
     I can think of a number of places in the 
     <lb/>
     criminal code where there are specific provi<lb break="no"/>sions relating to certain provinces which do 
     <lb/>
     not apply to other provinces. Will the bill 
     <lb/>
     when we get it, with the explanations, call 
     <lb/>
     attention to the individual statutes to which 
     <lb/>
     the bill may have reference, so that we can 
     <lb/>
     understand it without doing a great deal of 
     <lb/>
     research on our own? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GARS1">Mr. Garson</persName>: The answer is yes, that it will 
     <lb/>
     call attention to the specific statutes. The bill 
     <lb/>
     will contain a number of sections, and each 
     <lb/>
     section will refer to some section of an exist<lb break="no"/>ing statute which will be amended. It will not 
     <lb/>
     be just a general statement of a rather 
     <lb/>
     indefinite character. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Motion agreed to and the house went into 
     <lb/>
     committee, Mr. Golding in the chair. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Resolution reported, read the second time 
     <lb/>
     and concurred in. Mr. Garson thereupon 
     <lb/>
     moved for leave to introduce Bill No. 12, to 
     <lb/>
     amend the statute law. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Right Hon. L. S. St. Laurent</persName> (Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister): I may say it is not the intention 
     <lb/>
     to ask the house to proceed with this bill 
     <lb/>
     until we have made substantial progress with 
  

            <cb/>
   
the other one. The last section of the bill 
     <lb/>will provide that it would come into force 
     <lb/>on March 31, 1949, and would not be sanc<lb break="no"/>tioned unless and until the previous bill 
     <lb/>approving the terms of union with Newfound<lb break="no"/>land had been sanctioned. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GRAY2">Mr. Graydon</persName>: Then may I ask the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister when it is intended to move the 
     <lb/>
     second reading of the first bill introduced 
     <lb/>
     tonight? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: It is hoped to go on tomor<lb break="no"/>row with the second reading of the first bill 
     <lb/>
     and to allow this bill to stand until the sense 
     <lb/>
     of the house has been taken on the first one. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Motion agreed to and bill read the first 
     <lb/>
     time.

     <emph>CONTINUATION OF CERTAIN ORDERS AND

     Hon. Stuart S. Garson (Minister of Justice) 
     <lb/>
     moved that the house go into committee to 
     <lb/>
     consider the following resolution: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     That it is expedient to introduce a measure to 
     <lb/>
     provide for the continuation of certain orders and 
     <lb/>
     regulations of the governor in council for a limited 
     <lb/>
     period during the national emergency arising out of 
     <lb/>
     the war. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. M. J. Coldwell (Rosetown-Biggar): 
     <lb/>
     Before you leave the chair, Mr. Speaker, may 
     <lb/>
     I say just a word about this, because I think 
     <lb/>
     it is one of the most important measures con<lb break="no"/>templated for this session. At the present 
     <lb/>
     time the cost of living has reached an all- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     time high. Though there was a slight reduc<lb break="no"/>tion a month ago, the latest report from the 
     <lb/>
     bureau of statistics indicates that the cost of 
     <lb/>
     living has now reached the highest figure in 
     <lb/>
     our history. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It seems to me the government needs to 
     <lb/>
     consider this because of the effect it is hav<lb break="no"/>ing on all the people of Canada. If we look 
     <lb/>
     at the price index for 1945, when the war 
     <lb/>
     ended, and compare the figures with the 
     <lb/>
     present index, we find an increase that is 
     <lb/>
     phenomenal. The cost of living index in 
     <lb/>
     August, 1945, stood at 119·6. It has now 
     <lb/>
     risen to 159·6. That is a tremendous increase 
     <lb/>
     since the removal of controls; and the effect, 
     <lb/>
     of course, is really disastrous on people with 
     <lb/>
     small and fixed incomes, such as veterans 
     <lb/>
     and other pensioners, or people whose wages 
     <lb/>
     or salary have not gone up to any extent. 
     <lb/>
     It seems to me this is a matter with which 
     <lb/>
     the house should grapple this session. I have 
     <lb/>
     noticed that in the United States, for example, 
     <lb/>
     where the increase has been greater than here 
     <lb/>
     and the cost of living figure is higher, in his 
     <lb/>
     message to congress President Truman 
     <lb/>
     indicated the necessity of doing something 
     <lb/>
     about the restoration of controls if the cost 
     <lb/>
     of living did not come down. And I would 
     <lb/>
