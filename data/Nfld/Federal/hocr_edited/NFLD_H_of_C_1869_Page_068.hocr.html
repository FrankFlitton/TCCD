               In the Ô¨Årst place, if the public lands of various 
               <br />
               Provinces were under the control of the 
               <br />
               General Government, a General Government 
               <br />
               might not suit the wishes of each Province; 
               <br />
               and the attempt to manage the lands of the 
               <br />
               different Provinces on different principles, 
               <br />
               might also prove antagonistic to local feelings. 
               <br />
               In the second place, the distance from the 
               <br />
               seat of the General Government of the lands 
               <br />
               taken under its control, would be so great as 
               <br />
               of necessity to weaken the hands stretched 
               <br />
               out so far, and to induce a management less 
               <br />
               careful and less susceptible of being controlled 
               <br />
               by the public opinion of the Provinces, than 
               <br />
               would be the management by the Province 
               <br />
               itself. In the third place, the distance and the 
               <br />
               larger functions of the General Government 
               <br />
               would necessarily increase the cost of the 
               <br />
               administration of the public lands. And, lastly, 
               <br />
               however prosperous the administration might 
               <br />
               be, there could be no question that any 
               <br />
               attempt by the general Government to reap 
               <br />
               a revenue from the public lands of the Prov- 
               <br />
               ince or to apply the fruits of that prosperity 
               <br />
               to general or other than Local purposes would 
               <br />
               involve a feeling of dissatisfaction in the 
               <br />
               Province concerned. These were some thought 
               <br />
               not all the reasons which occurred to him 
               <br />
               why, from a Canadian point of view, it was 
               <br />
               right that the General Government should 
               <br />
               abstain from assuming to itself the public 
               <br />
               lands of the Provinces. Then as regarded the 
               <br />
               Province itself he thought it of great im- 
               <br />
               portance, of exceptionally great importance, 
               <br />
               in the case of Newfoundland, that their own 
               <br />
               lands should be retained in their own hands, 
               <br />
               having regard to the distance of the Province 
               <br />
               from the Seat of Government and to the com- 
               <br />
               parative smallness of its representation. Here 
               <br />
               it was, to say the least, not at all unlikely 
               <br />
               that the policy which, at this distance, might 
               <br />
               be adopted with reference to the lands of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, might be distasteful to the 
               <br />
               people of that Province. If any chance existed, 
               <br />
               and he should be sorry for a moment to cast 
               <br />
               a doubt upon the chance of those lands as- 
               <br />
               suming, not from their agricultural qualities, 
               <br />
               but from the possible development of their 
               <br />
               mineral wealth great additional value, it was 
               <br />
               obvious that that value was more likely to 
               <br />
               be promoted by local administration on the 
               <br />
               spot. The position of the Local Legislature 
               <br />
               and the Provincial institutions of Newfound- 
               <br />
               land would, to his mind, be overborne and 
               <br />
               almost destroyed if they abstracted from that 
               <br />
               Legislature this function. The population of 
               <br />
               that Colony was small. It did not largely 
               <br />
               exceed the population of the Municipal Cor- 
               <br />
               poration, one of the divisions of which he 
               <br />
               represented in this House. The municipality 
               <br />
               of Northumberland and Durham had a popu-
