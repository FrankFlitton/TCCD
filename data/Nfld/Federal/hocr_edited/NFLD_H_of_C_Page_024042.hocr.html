               (Hear, hear.) Well, sir, it is not at all sur-<br />
               prising if to attain this end, and to correct 
               <br />
               what she believed to be great abuses, her

               is an accomplished fact. Ontario has control

               terms proposed in the Quebec Convention, 
               <br />
               no longer exist. (Hear, hear.) We are as 
               <br />
               terms proposed in the Quebec Convention, 
               <br />
               little trammelled as were the delegates at that 
               <br />
               Convention; and we are bound by every 
               <br />
               consideration of public duty to consider the 
               <br />
               terms submitted to us upon their merits. The 
               <br />
               gentlemen who formed the Quebec Con- 
               <br />
               vention had long been connected with public 
               <br />
               affairs. They were no doubt able men; but 
               <br />
               they had been connected with a system of 
               <br />
               Government very different from the one they 
               <br />
               proposed to adopt. I am doing them no in- 
               <br />
               justice when I say that although they may 
               <br />
               have had some general knowledge of the 
               <br />
               external features of the federal system, they 
               <br />
               were totally unacquainted with its internal 
               <br />
               organization and with many of its vital 
               <br />
               principles; they were not aware of all the 
               <br />
               changes and modifications the new system 
               <br />
               necessitated in the old. (Hear, hear.) This 
               <br />
               is abundantly verified in the anomalies and 
               <br />
               contradictions in our system. Already our 
               <br />
               short experience has brought many defects 
               <br />
               under our observation, and it appears to me 
               <br />
               it would be the height of folly to throw 
               <br />
               away the experience we have acquired, abdi- 
               <br />
               cate the right to judge for ourselves, and ad- 
               <br />
               here without a pretence of reason to what was 
               <br />
               done in great haste, under great pressure, ﬁve 
               <br />
               or six years ago. (Hear, hear.) The terms pro- 
               <br />
               posed in these resolutions is a proposal that 
               <br />
               Newfoundland shall come in with a debt of 
               <br />
               $6,500,000 with the chance of having her 
               <br />
               general subsidy increased from $104,000 to 
               <br />
               $320,000 a year. If Ontario were allowed 
               <br />
               the same amount instead of coming into the 
               <br />
               Confederation with a debt of $35,000,000 she 
               <br />
               would enter with a debt of $100,000,000. 
               <br />
               Now, sir, I do not propose we should deal 
               <br />
               niggardly with Newfoundland. I admit she 
               <br />
               is entitled to a much larger amount than the 
               <br />
               Provinces now in the Dominion. In addition 
               <br />
               to the debt with which the Provinces now in 
               <br />
               the Dominion entered it a debt has been in- 
               <br />
               curred on behalf of the Intercolonial Railroad, 
               <br />
               and the faith of the Dominion is pledged to 
               <br />
               the enlargement and deepening of the canals. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) The cost of these works must 
               <br />
               be considered a part of the debt of the Do-
