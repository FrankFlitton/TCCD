               use the name of the Queen to carry their 
               <br />
               point, they would stigmatize as traitors all 
               <br />
               who opposed them, and after carrying their

               point in England, would probably come back 
               <br />
               with high-sounding titles. (Laughter.) It is as 
               <br />
               true as if the Prophet Jeremiah had uttered 
               <br />
               it. (Roars of laughter.) The Hon. Premier of 
               <br />
               Ontario had lately been canonized as a saint 
               <br />
               —whether he deserved that title or not, in 
               <br />
               the prediction he had read, that gentleman 
               <br />
               had certainly proved himself a true prophet. 
               <br />
               (Laughter.) A great deal had been said about 
               <br />
               Confederation allaying sectional difficulties, 
               <br />
               but he feared these difficulties were being 
               <br />
               extended. There was, in some quarters, too 
               <br />
               strong a liking for the loaves and ﬁshes—too 
               <br />
               strong a desire to bring in the grab game. 
               <br />
               (Laughter.) The cow which gave the milk 
               <br />
               would be often sought for. The Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice knew which Province was the cow. 
               <br />
               He would soon know who were the suckers. 
               <br />
               (Much laughter.) The speaker then said he 
               <br />
               would not give the Member for Cornwall all 
               <br />
               the credit, but would quote from another 
               <br />
               speech made when Confederation was before 
               <br />
               the Canadian Parliament—that was his own. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear) This quotation showed the 
               <br />
               speaker had opposed Confederation at that 
               <br />
               time because they had no right to change 
               <br />
               the Constitution, because he wanted the ques- 
               <br />
               tion referred to the people, because it dis-<br />
               carded an Elective Legislative Council, and 
               <br />
               because he believed it would not heal our 
               <br />
               sectional difficulties. He thought he then 
               <br />
               struck the nail on the head, and that the 
               <br />
               heavy expenditure entailed upon the country 
               <br />
               would not be made up by corresponding 
               <br />
               advantages. He feared Ontario would suffer 
               <br />
               just as new partners were taken in, and that 
               <br />
               that Province would not have one but several 
               <br />
               small Provinces clinging to her skirts. Mr. 
               <br />
               Rymal resumed his seat admidst applause.

               Mr. Blake replied to some of the remarks 
               <br />
               made during the debate. He said that the 
               <br />
               Finance Minister declined to say what the 
               <br />
               result of this arrangement would be on the 
               <br />
               income of the country. Although the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman might quite possibly come to a 
               <br />
               conclusion, the hon. gentleman had not dealt 
               <br />
               with that question, simply because he was 
               <br />
               afraid the result would be too alarming. 
               <br />
               There could, indeed, be no doubt but the 
               <br />
               statement of the member for Westmorland 
               <br />
               was the correct one, and that was that the 
               <br />
               Colony would cost us a quarter of a million. 
               <br />
               At present and for years past the Colony did 
               <br />
               not pay its expenses. Clearly it would be less 
               <br />
               able to meet an enlarged expenditure, and 
               <br />
               hence there must be a reduction in these ex- 
               <br />
               penses. He maintained that in the present
