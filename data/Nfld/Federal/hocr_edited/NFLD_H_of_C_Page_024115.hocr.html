               Mr. Masson said if no part of the sum was to 
               <br />
               be employed for military purposes there could 
               <br />
               be no objection to accepting his amendment. 
               <br />
               The intention of the Government was to send a 
               <br />
               military force. He had twice offered his ser- 
               <br />
               vices against the Fenians, but he could not 
               <br />
               permit the Government to go and raise an 
               <br />
               army to take possession of a country with 
               <br />
               which they had nothing to do. The people of 
               <br />
               the North-West ought to be put on the same 
               <br />
               terms as the people of Newfoundland or Prince 
               <br />
               Edward's Island. They had no idea of compell- 
               <br />
               ing those Provinces to enter the Union by force 
               <br />
               of arms; and a different rule ought not to be 
               <br />
               followed in the case of the North-West. If they 
               <br />
               sent a soldier to that Territory there would be 
               <br />
               a war of Catholics and Protestants. (No, no.) 
               <br />
               There would be a war between nation and 
               <br />
               nation, and race and race. (No, no.) And the 
               <br />
               first shot that would be fired there would lose 
               <br />
               us the Territory. (No.) He was well convinced 
               <br />
               of that. He spoke from conviction, and a sense 
               <br />
               of duty he owed to his constituency. He 
               <br />
               thought that a peaceful policy would settle all 
               <br />
               difficulties with less expense and greater satis-

               <br />
               satisfactory to no part of the country, for he 
               <br />
               did not believe that there would be a single

               further than Mr. Masson had gone in his 
               <br />
               speech. He stated that if this vote did not go for
