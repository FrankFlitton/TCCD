               Hon. Mr. Rose said the hon. gentleman was 
               <br />
               mistaken. These amounts did not come under 
               <br />
               the Consolidated Revenue of the country. The 
               <br />
               question then came to be how much of the 
               <br />
               revenue we would lose, although the House 
               <br />
               would hardly agree with his hon. friend that it 
               <br />
               was altogether loss if the revenue were dimin- 
               <br />
               ished in consequence of our furnishing New— 
               <br />
               foundland with $2,000,000 or $3,000,000 worth 
               <br />
               of our manufactures, our butter, cheese, ﬂour, 
               <br />
               oatmeal, peas, &amp;c., which would go in free of 
               <br />
               duty. What we might directly lose in revenue 
               <br />
               would be more than made up to us by the ex-<br />
               pansion of our trade, and our ﬁnding an addi-<br />
               tional market for our surplus products. He 
               <br />
               did not think, however, that the revenue 
               <br />
               would fall from $600,000 to $300,000, as 
               <br />
               alleged by the member for Westmorland. 
               <br />
               That could not well be when the rates of 
               <br />
               duty would be higher on cottons, woollens, 
               <br />
               rum, gin, whiskey, brandy, sugar, molasses, 
               <br />
               tobacco, etc. On tea, also, there was a small 
               <br />
               difference on certain kinds. From the most 
               <br />
               careful estimates he had been able to obtain, 
               <br />
               he believed that for some years to come they 
               <br />
               might expect to receive $500,000 in the way 
               <br />
               of revenue. Coming to what we would have to 
               <br />
               pay on account of Newfoundland, he con- 
               <br />
               sidered the member for West Durham rather 
               <br />
               over-estimated the amount when he placed it 
               <br />
               at $637,000. The following were the ﬁgures 
               <br />
               which he (Mr. Rose) had before him. New- 
               <br />
               foundland would receive, 1st Interest on the 
               <br />
