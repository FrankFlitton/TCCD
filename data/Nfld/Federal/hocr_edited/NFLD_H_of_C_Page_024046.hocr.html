               $748,000 in the ﬁfth year. But this was not 
               <br />
               all they were defrauded of. On the 5th year

               the people not receiving subsidy in Ontario 
               <br />

               whilst at the same time it would take several 
               <br />
               years to get rid of New Brunswick, and as 
               <br />
               for the Newfoundlanders, we would never, 
               <br />
               in this world, get rid of them. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Laughter.)</span> His 
               <br />
               hon. friend, the Minister of War, had often 
               <br />
               spoken of the different elements which would 
               <br />
               make Canada a great nation—the commercial, 
               <br />
               agricultural and maritime. He had laid great 
               <br />
               stress on the latter element. But he (Mr. R.) 
               <br />
               did not believe from the way things were 
               <br />
               being managed, that the Dominion was about 
               <br />
               to become the ﬁrst power in the world; he did 
               <br />
               not think they were about to play the most 
               <br />
               prominent part among nations. (Laughter) 
               <br />
               He was opposed to the resolution before the 
               <br />
               Chair, because we were asked to pay for 
               <br />
               Newfoundland an extravagant price. It would 
               <br />
               not pay us to admit that Province on such 
               <br />
               terms when our ﬁnances were in their present 
               <br />
               condition. The Finance Minister had to 
               <br />
               request that no grants should be asked by 
               <br />
               Ontario members from the Government, the 
               <br />
               exchequer was so empty, and although he 
               <br />
               liked our Eastern allies, he was not prepared 
               <br />
               to allow them more than terms of equality. 
               <br />
               As an Upper Canadian he was not willing 
               <br />
               that the interests of that section should be 
               <br />
               sacrificed. There was the Intercolonial Rail- 
               <br />
               way; of the thirty millions required to build 
               <br />
               that lien, Ontario would pay one half itself, 
               <br />
               yet not one solitary dollar would be spent 
               <br />
               within 400 miles of its border. (Hear, hear.) 
               <br />
               Now, we were asked to give $150,000 a year, 
               <br />
               for all time to come, for the lands of New- 
               <br />
               foundland, which sum was equal to an expen-<br />
               diture of $3,000,000 for them. The Government 
               <br />
               which could make such a proposition to the 
               <br />
               House did not, he considered, possess an 
               <br />
               undue share of modesty. (Laughter and ap- 
               <br />
               plause.) He thought the great leader of Upper 
               <br />
               Canada (Sir John A. Macdonald) had forgotten 
               <br />
               his duty at the Quebec Conference on this 
               <br />
