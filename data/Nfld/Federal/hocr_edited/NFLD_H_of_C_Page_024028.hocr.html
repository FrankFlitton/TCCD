               Canada. There was, he believed, very little 
               <br />
               doubt, that instead of this miserable moiety we 
               <br />
               got, the whole of this large trade might be 
               <br />
               ours. To show how much more was consumed 
               <br />
               by Newfoundland, in comparison with the 
               <br />
               other Provinces, he would state that in the lat- 
               <br />
               ter the imports ranged from about $20 to $30 
               <br />

               <br />
               $42.07 per head. (Hear, hear.) He would now 
               <br />
               say a word or two as to the mineral wealth 
               <br />
               of the Colony. Its development had increased 
               <br />
               only recently. Only two mines were yet open, 
               <br />
               in which 500 men were employed, who, with 
               <br />
               their families, made a population of over a 
               <br />
               thousand souls settled in a country, where 
               <br />
               four years ago only three or four families were 
               <br />
