               perfecting arrangements which would have 
               <br />
               an inﬂuence on the condition of all the Prov- 
               <br />
               inces for many generations. Mr. Mackenzie 
               <br />
               then reverted to the pernicious system in- 
               <br />
               augurated by this Government, in allowing 
               <br />
               officeholders to retain their seats in the House 
               <br />
               without even requiring them to go before 
               <br />
               their constituents for re—election. He said they 
               <br />
               might just as well admit Judges and other 
               <br />
               such functionaries as the Arbitrator between 
               <br />
               the Provinces and the Intercolonial Railroad 
               <br />
               Commissioners. He had heard that another 
               <br />
               member of the House was to be appointed a 
               <br />
               Commissioner for codifying the laws; but he 
               <br />
               sincerely trusted that if such a step had been 
               <br />
               intended it would be reconsidered. Such a 
               <br />
               policy was in the highest degree destructive 
               <br />
               of public morality, and would gradually de- 
               <br />
               stroy in the public mind that respect which 
               <br />
               ought to exist for the Legislature of the 
               <br />
               country. There was another point to which 
               <br />
               he would allude before sitting down. The 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice professed to have con— 
               <br />
               structed this Government on the Coalition 
               <br />
               principle. They had been told by the Minister 
               <br />
               of Public Works and the late Minister of 
               <br />
               Inland Revenue that it was solely because it 
               <br />
               was a Coalition Government that they had 
               <br />
               entered it—that it was solely because such a 
               <br />
               Government was necessary in order to the 
               <br />
               right conducting of our affairs, and in order 
               <br />
               to sustain some hon. gentlemen in the Lower 
               <br />
               Province who had taken ofﬁce, that they had 
               <br />
               consented to enter it. Those hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               also claim that the three Reformers from On- 
               <br />
               tario, and the others from the Lower Prov- 
               <br />
               inces, would be able to counterpoise the 
               <br />
               Conservative element, or at least to equal it. 
               <br />
               Well, if it was necessary that the Province 
               <br />
               of Ontario should have three representatives 
               <br />
               from the Reform ranks in the Cabinet, how 
               <br />
               must it have suffered when there was only 
               <br />
               one such representative, and that one absent 
               <br />
               from the country for the last six months, 
               <br />
               allowing the Conservative element to run 
               <br />
               riot in the organization of the militia, the 
               <br />
               management of the Intercolonial and every- 
               <br />
               thing else. (Hear, hear.) The Minister of 
               <br />
               Customs belonged originally to the Reform 
               <br />
               party, and perhaps it might be said that the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman had been suﬂicient for the 
               <br />
               interests of that party in the Cabinet, in the 
               <br />
               absence of his colleague; but if the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman yielded as easily on every matter 
               <br />
               that concerned the party he professed to rep- 
               <br />
               resent as he seemed to have yielded with 
               <br />
               reference to the Intercolonial route, the pro- 
               <br />
               tection given by him amounted to very little. 
               <br />
               The result had shown that he (Mr. Mac- 
               <br />
               kenzie) was right in the prophecy he 
               <br />
               ventured to make when the Coalition was<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><br />
