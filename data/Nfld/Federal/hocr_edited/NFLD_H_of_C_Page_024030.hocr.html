               Hon. Mr. Smith said that having accepted 
               <br />
               the situation he would not oppose the resolu- 
               <br />
               tions, but he thought he could show that this 
               <br />
               bargain was very one-sided. The Customs 
               <br />
               revenue would in all probability fall far short 
               <br />
               of that of any previous year. It was estimat- 
               <br />
               ed in 1868 at $468,000. Under the Union 
               <br />
               what would be the result? The duty on ﬂour, 
               <br />
               which realized upwards of $69,000 to New- 
               <br />
               foundland would of course be lost, as it 
               <br />
               would not be imposed. Nor would that on 
               <br />
               other articles, amounting in all to upwards 
               <br />
               of $114,000. Deducting this amount, let us 
               <br />
               see what we get and what we will give. We 
               <br />
               will not probably get more than $300,000 
               <br />
               from the Customs, and we will pay interest 
               <br />
               on their debt, $3,500,000—$175,000; and their 
               <br />
               debt, it had to be remembered, differed from 
               <br />
               that of the other Provinces. Theirs arose in 
               <br />
               the construction of public works which were 
               <br />
               handed over to the Dominion. Then we have 
               <br />
               to pay $150,000 for Crown lands which were 
               <br />
               worth nothing, Last year the revenue from 
               <br />
               these was $2,600, whereas the cost was $6,000. 
               <br />
               Yet here we gravely propose to pay $150,000 
               <br />
               a year rent, and manage them besides. Then 
               <br />
               the 80c per head, amounting to $104,000; 
               <br />
               subsidy $350,000; steamboat communication
