               a very satisfactory way so far as the Dominion 
               <br />
               is concerned in this way. It is due in a great

               <br />

               <br />
               a small rate of interest. The aggregate amount 
               <br />
               due was $651,000, of which $450,000 was due 
               <br />
               the Government. The greater amount of this 
               <br />
               is due to 1,385 depositors; of whom 640 were 
               <br />

               <br />
               was mainly 3 per cent. The debt of the colony 
               <br />
