               was not free from political bias and he could 
               <br />
               give them a means of accomplishing that 
               <br />
               object. He also argued that revisions that could 
               <br />
               take effect after the framing of the list would 
               <br />
               prevent all Government interference with the 
               <br />
               lists, but that was no reason why they should 
               <br />
               pass a defective law and he hoped that they 
               <br />
               would never have such a primary list. For the 
               <br />
               sake of uniformity they were to initiate what 
               <br />
               was called a policy of concession, but what he 
               <br />
               termed a policy of sacrifices; and the result 
               <br />
               would be that every Province would have a 
               <br />
               franchise which they did not like. (Hear.) 
               <br />
               They were each asked to sacrifice themselves 
               <br />
               in order that there might be a common sacri- 
               <br />
               fice. (Laughter.) The question was whether 
               <br />
               they should look at the franchise on the ground 
               <br />
               of Confederation of the four Provinces already 
               <br />
               in union or to the accomplishment of the grand 
               <br />
               design first held before their eyes, and for the 
               <br />
               accomplishment of which the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               formed his Government and went to the people 
               <br />
               upon, and on the necessity of the realizations 
               <br />
               of which he based the question of the con- 
               <br />
               tinued existence of his Government. They were 
               <br />
               told by the hon. gentleman that the admission 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland was not a matter of years, 
               <br />
               but of weeks and months; but if it was true, as 
               <br />
               it had been asserted, and facts seemed to justi- 
               <br />
               fy the statement, that a very large majority of 
               <br />
               the people of Newfoundland would, by that 
               <br />
               law, be disfranchised—by adopting that princi- 
               <br />
               ple of uniformity, one of two questions would 
               <br />
               have to be decided—either that Newfoundland 
               <br />
               would not enter into the Union, or that an 
               <br />
               exception must be made in her favour. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen opposite would not like to see 
               <br />
               Newfoundland stay out; but they could not 
               <br />
               expect the voters there to accept a system by 
               <br />
               which they were depriving themselves of all 
               <br />
               power in the Dominion. They must therefore 
               <br />
               be prepared to make an exception in that case. 
               <br />
               But would the Minister of Justice make an 
               <br />
               exception in the case of Algoma, the greater 
               <br />
               proportion of whose constituents would be dis- 
               <br />
               franchised by that Bill. (Hear, hear.) Therefore 
               <br />
               if uniformity were to be decreed it must be 
               <br />
               decreed for all. The Government presented to 
               <br />
               the Confederation party in Newfoundland the 
               <br />
               difficulty of meeting their opponents on the 
               <br />
               question of disfranchisement. The people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland would not vote away their 
               <br />
               political rights, and if he were a resident of 
               <br />
               that Island he would be one of those who 
               <br />
               would not vote away his political rights, which 
               <br />
               would be the case if that Bill became law. Then 
               <br />
               there was the Red River question. How would 
               <br />
               the people of that country look at the question 
               <br />
               of uniformity, and how would the people of 
               <br />
               British Columbia regard it? Gentlemen oppo- 
               <br />
               site inflicted many a serious blow at the fabric 
               <br />
               of Confederation; but none would prove great-
