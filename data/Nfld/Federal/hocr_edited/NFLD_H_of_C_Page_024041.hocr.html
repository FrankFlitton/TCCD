               it did take place, what then? Simply that 
               <br />
               what we would lose in customs our manu- 
               <br />
               facturers must gain. So it would be with the 
               <br />
               excise. The fact was that as Newfoundland 
               <br />
               went ahead and increased in population so 
               <br />
               would we. Our wealth must instantly grow 
               <br />
               with this addition, but even if we did lose 
               <br />
               $100,000 or so a year, what was that with

               the results which might be expected from 
               <br />
               the acquisition of an island in so important

               Mr. Olivei- was strongly in favour of com- 
               <br />
               pleting the Confederation of the British North 
               <br />
               American Provinces; but he thought too much 
               <br />
               was being paid for this acquisition of ter-<br />
               ritory. It was clearly shewn that for the priv- 
               <br />
               ilege of annexing it we would have to pay 
               <br />
               from $110,000 to $200,000 a year, part of which 
               <br />
               was occasioned by a ridiculous land purchase. 
               <br />
               If that land was good it were better by far 
               <br />
               that the people of Newfoundland should keep 
               <br />
               it themselves, and if it were bad it certainly 
               <br />
               could be of no use to the Dominion; and it 
               <br />
               would be good policy to leave it with the Is- 
               <br />
               landers to manage and give them a subsidy.

               Mr. Mills.—We have been told by the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice that these resolutions are 
               <br />
               intended to give effect to the terms agreed 
               <br />
               upon at the Quebec Conference; that we are 
               <br />
               pledged to the resolutions of that Conven- 
               <br />
               tion, and that we are not at liberty to enquire 
               <br />
               into the fairness of the terms. I, sir, en- 
               <br />
               tirely repudiate any such doctrine. The 
               <br />
               Legislature and delegates of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               have repudiated it. They rejected the Que-<br />
               bec scheme. They refused at the time to 
               <br />
               accept the union upon the terms agreed upon 
               <br />
               by the delegates at Quebec. Their Legisla-<br />
               ture recently proposed other terms, and the 
               <br />
               resolutions now before the committee propose 
               <br />
               other terms. (Hear, hear.) Let me ask min- 
               <br />
               isters how they can for a moment pretend 
               <br />
               to argue that we are tied hand and foot to 
               <br />
               the terms of the Quebec Convention, while 
               <br />
               they and the Newfoundland delegates have 
               <br />
               in the interest of Newfoundland ventured to 
               <br />
               propose something more? (Hear, hear.) What 
               <br />
               are the facts? It is well known that the 
               <br />
               demand for Confederation grew out of sec- 
               <br />
               tional difficulties in the Government of 
               <br />
               Canada; that Upper Canada demanded con- 
               <br />
               stitutional changes to prevent the imposi- 
               <br />
               tion of local laws against the wishes of 
               <br />
               a majority of her representatives; to prevent 
               <br />
               a wasteful expenditure of public monies;
