               Mr. Blake thought there could be no doubt 
               <br />
               as to the power of this Parliament to legis- 
               <br />
               late With regard to nonâ€”traders, as well as 
               <br />
               traders, the Union Act giving it exclusive 
               <br />
               jurisdiction over both bankruptcy and insol- 
               <br />
               vency. It was known that in England bank- 
               <br />
               ruptcy was the term technically applied to 
               <br />
               the case of traders, and insolvency the term 
               <br />
               applied to the case of non-traders; and he 
               <br />
               could not conceive why the two terms should 
               <br />
               have been used unless it were intended that 
               <br />
               this Parliament might declare that non- 
               <br />
               traders as well as traders might be dis- 
               <br />
               charged from their liabilities under certain 
               <br />
               restrictions. As regarded the policy of ex- 
               <br />
               tending the law to non-traders, that was a 
               <br />
               different matter. If the interests of the other 
               <br />
               Provinces demanded that there should be a 
               <br />
               general insolvent law, as distinguished from 
               <br />
               a bankrupt law, all that could be said against 
               <br />
               it in Quebec was that there was an equal 
               <br />
               distribution in the case of non-traders. He 
               <br />
               did not think that should be a sufficient<br />
               objection to their applying a general system 
               <br />
               to the whole country. It would require to be 
               <br />
               an objection founded on some inconvenience 
               <br />
               in Quebec Which should induce them not to 
               <br />
               apply the system to the whole country, unless 
               <br />
               there were very strong and powerful reasons 
               <br />
               overbearing that inconvenience. What was the 
               <br />
               object of a bankrupt or insolvent law at all? 
               <br />
               Was it in the interest of the debtor, in the 
               <br />
               interest of the creditor, in their joint interest, 
               <br />
               or in the interest of he community at large? 
               <br />
               He apprehended it was not solely in the inter- 
               <br />
               est of the debtor or the creditor, but rather 
               <br />
               that it was in the public interest such a law 
               <br />
               should be established, and that in certain 
               <br />
               cases there should be a machinery for the 
               <br />
               speedy discussion and realization of the estate 
               <br />
               of a person unable to meet his obligations, 
               <br />
               and of relieving such person from further 
               <br />
               liabilities when his whole estate had been 
               <br />
               realized. Whether the public interest then 
               <br />
               demanded in this country and in our state 
               <br />
               of circumstances that that arrangement 
               <br />
               should be extended to non-trader, was, he 
               <br />
               thought, practically the question that we had 
               <br />
               before us. While he was willing to agree 
               <br />
               that the operation of our insolvent law in the 
               <br />
               past had been such as to render that law to 
               <br />
               a large extent unpopular, he apprehended a 
               <br />
               great many of the objections which had been 
               <br />
               taken to it were due, not to the law, but to 
               <br />
               the lax mode in which it had been worked 
               <br />
