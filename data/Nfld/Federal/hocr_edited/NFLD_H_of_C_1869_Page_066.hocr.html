               the Dominion. He objected to such absolute 
               <br />
               Irvine-Democratic rule. It was a doctrine 
               <br />
               which would not suit any Province. Much 
               <br />
               wiser was it to keep to the views of the Minis- 
               <br />
               ter of Justice, and not force on any Province, 
               <br />

               <br />
               saw good reason for the arrangement pro-

               posed; as there were matters to be decided

               more equitably decide, than twelve men selec- 
               <br />
