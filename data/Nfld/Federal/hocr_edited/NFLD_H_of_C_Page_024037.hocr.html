               Hon. Mr. Rose said the Dominion undertook

               to pay interest on that debt, be the rate

               higher now; but he really thought that on an 
               <br />
               item of this kind they need not have much 
               <br />
               discussion. The were merely carrying out the 
               <br />
               principle which entered into the arrange- 
               <br />
               ments with all the Provinces that the Domin- 
               <br />
               ion should pay the actual interest on the 
               <br />
               existing debt to a certain amount, and ﬁve per

               cent on the balance required to make up 
               <br />
               what was considered a fair proportion of the 
               <br />
               debt. Well, he had stated the payments at 
               <br />
               $614,000, and the probable revenue at $500,- 
               <br />
               000. He did not say that they would make 
               <br />
               up the whole difference out of the Crown 
               <br />
               lands and mines, but he thought they might 
               <br />
               reasonably expect some proﬁts from them 
               <br />
               directly, and very large indirect proﬁts from 
               <br />
               the development of the mines. But be that 
               <br />
               as it might, an important question to be con- 
               <br />
               sidered was how Newfoundland stood with 
               <br />
               reference to this arrangement. He took it 
               <br />
               for granted no one would desire Newfound- 
               <br />
               land to come in except on terms which would 
               <br />
               enable her to work satisfactorily in the Union, 
               <br />
               and he believed he could show that the sums 
               <br />
               she would receive from the Dominion would 
               <br />
               be no more than were necessary to enable 
               <br />
               her to provide for her local services. The 
               <br />
               member for Westmorland estimated that the 
               <br />
               local services would require $300,000. He (Mr. 
               <br />
               Rose) considered that by a fair and liberal 
               <br />
               estimate $400,000 would be necessary, and, 
               <br />
               as he had shown, $400,000 would be provided.
