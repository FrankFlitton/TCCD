               It is not by dishonest concealment that we can 
               <br />
               retain their respect. At the end of this cen-

               <br />

               <br />
               ceive less than 30 cents. Newfoundland judges 
               <br />
               and Newfoundland custom house ofﬁcers are 
               <br />
               receiving less than ours. As soon as they enter 
               <br />
               the Union they will demand an increase. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) The Union to be lasting must be

               Hon. Mr. Langevin addressed the House in

               Mr. Rymal said, that in considering these 
               <br />
               resolutions, it might be well to glance back at 
               <br />
               the past, and when he remembered all that 
               <br />
               had been predicted of Confederation, he was 
               <br />
               forced to conclude that it was not proving all 
               <br />
               that its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ardent</span> admirers had expected. Indeed, 
               <br />
               he feared that the worst predictions made 
               <br />
               by those who then opposed it, would be ful- 
               <br />
               ﬁlled. The House should therefore be careful 
               <br />
               as to the admission of new Provinces, like 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, into the Union; they would be 
               <br />
               new partners in the ﬁrm, and it would be 
               <br />
               well to scan closely what they will bring in 
               <br />
               as assets, and what they will take out. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) The British America Act placed 
               <br />
               the subsidies to be paid to Ontario and Que- 
               <br />
               bec at 80c. per head for all time to come, but 
               <br />
               the amount to be paid Nova Scotia and New 
               <br />
               Brunswick was to augment until their popu- 
               <br />
               lation increased to 400,000 souls; and besides 
               <br />
               all this the special subsidies gave 5c. per 
               <br />
               head to Ontario, 6c. Quebec, 18c. Nova Scotia, 
               <br />
               44c. to New Brunswick, and now the spe- 
               <br />
               cial subsidy to Newfoundland would be 
               <br />
               about 30c. per head! (Hear, hear.) This was 
               <br />
               a very unequal arrangement, and it might be 
               <br />
               well to enquire what Ontario loses under this 
               <br />
               system. The subsidy to Nova Scotia would go 
               <br />
               on increasing for 9 years, which time would 
               <br />
               elapse before her population amounted to 
               <br />
               400,000; that of New Brunswick would aug- 
               <br />
               ment for 15 years, and he believed the sun 
               <br />
               would never rise on the day that Newfound- 
               <br />
               land would reach a population of 400,000.— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Laughter.)</span> He then showed that, counting 
               <br />
               the increase in the population of Ontario, for 
               <br />
               which no subsidy is allowed, that Province 
               <br />
               lost the ﬁrst year of Confederation, $416,000, 
               <br />
               will lose during the second year, $499,000, 
               <br />
               and so on until the amount would swell to 
               <br />
