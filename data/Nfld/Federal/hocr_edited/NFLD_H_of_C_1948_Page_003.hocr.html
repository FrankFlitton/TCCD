               In reading that question it came to my mind 
               <br />
               that if the delegates of Newfoundland thought 
               <br />
               it advisable to ask it, it was surely because 
               <br />
               they were far from being convinced that the 
               <br />
               matter had been ﬁnally settled by the report 
               <br />
               of the privy council; otherwise I cannot 
               <br />
               imagine that they would have asked such a 
               <br />
               question. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I was also very much surprised to read in 
               <br />
               the proposed arrangements submitted to the 
               <br />
               government of Newfoundland by the Prime

               The province of Newfoundland will include

               And one may further notice that such 
               <br />
               statement comes right at the beginning of the 
               <br />
               proposed arrangements, as if it was one of 
               <br />
               the most important questions to be decided. 
               <br />
               We can surely infer, from the special care 
               <br />
               and the particular <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consideration</span> given to 
               <br />
               that matter relating to the boundary between 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec and Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               that it has never been settled before, and 
               <br />
               that the interested parties are willing to take 
               <br />
               advantage of the entry into confederation of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland to settle the matter ﬁnally. But 
               <br />
               my contention is that the Canadian govern- 
               <br />
               ment has not the right, has not the legal 
               <br />
               power, to dispose of a territory belonging to 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec; and I will go as 
               <br />
               far as to say that even if there was an&nbsp; agree- 
               <br />
               ment between Newfoundland and Canada to 
               <br />
               that eﬂect, it would be ultra vires of the 
               <br />
               powers of the government, and the problem 
               <br />
               itself <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> not be solved. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Since the Canadian government rely upon 
               <br />
               what they call the award of the judicial com- 
               <br />
               mittee of the privy council for the purpose of 
               <br />
               admitting the rights of Newfoundland over 
               <br />
               the Labrador territory, I will endeavour, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, to explain and to prove that nothing

               <br />
               back as far as 1763 and see what were the
