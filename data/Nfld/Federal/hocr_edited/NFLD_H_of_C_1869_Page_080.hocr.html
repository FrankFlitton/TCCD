               <br />
               consummated on such terms, that the people 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland should be in a position to 
               <br />

               position of this House that they should be

               discussing what these terms of union should 
               <br />
               be. The Minister of Public Works and the 
               <br />
               Premier said they were surprised that the 
               <br />
               member for West Durham should object to 
               <br />
               our acquiring the public lands of Newfound- 
               <br />
               land, after voting for the acquisition of lands 
               <br />
               in the North West territory. There was no 
               <br />
               analogy between the two cases. In the North 
               <br />
               West territory there were at present no con- 
               <br />
               stituted authorities as there were in New- 
               <br />
               foundland, and it would not be pretended 
               <br />
               that after a Government was established in 
               <br />
               the North West, we would administer its 
               <br />
               lands from Ottawa. But if the Dominion as- 
               <br />
               sumed the public lands of Newfoundland we 
               <br />
               would have a land ofﬁce established here 
               <br />
               requiring a special department for the pur- 
               <br />
               pose. At present these were administered very 
               <br />
               economically. The Surveyor-General received 
               <br />
               £400 sterling, and the extra expense was 
               <br />
               $6,000. According to these resolutions the 
               <br />
               Surveyor General and his staff would be 
               <br />
               under the control of one of the Departments 
               <br />
               at Ottawa.

               there was no analogy between the two cases.

               branches, he found that everything which

               came under the management of this Govern- 
               <br />

               Some stress has been laid on the value of the 
               <br />
               mineral lands, but could an instance be shown 
               <br />
               where any Government had made money out 
               <br />
               of its mineral lands? The Treasurer of Ontario 
               <br />
               had stated that in the fall of 1867 he thought 
               <br />
               money could be made by the Government out 
               <br />
               of the mineral lands on Lake Superior, which 
               <br />
               were apparently far richer than those of New- 
               <br />
               foundland, but he had since found out his 
               <br />
               mistake. The Ontario Government had found 
               <br />
               that in attempting to make money out of their 
               <br />
               mineral lands they only succeeded in prevent- 
               <br />
               ing miners from going in, and so it would be
