               Mr. Mackenzie said there was one other

               tion had been called to that subject. The 
               <br />
               ofﬁce of Secretary of State had been created 
               <br />
               because the necessity was felt for having a 
               <br />
               channel of communication between the Do- 
               <br />
               minion and Provincial Governments. It was 
               <br />
               deemed desirable that the numerous ques- 
               <br />
               tions which it was supposed would arise in 
               <br />
               this way should be disposed of by some one 
               <br />
               Minister. On the commencement of the new 
               <br />
               order of things, however, it was found that 
               <br />
               until the relative positions of the Provincial

               <br />
               portion of the subjects which would be or-

               dinarily assigned to the charge of the Sec— 
               <br />
               retary of State, had to be disposed of by the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice. So many questions arose 
               <br />
               in constitutional law and kindred topics, that 
               <br />
               he, as Minister of Justice, had been obliged 
               <br />
               to direct his attention to them. Therefore a 
               <br />
               great deal of the work which would even— 
               <br />
               tually fall on some such ofﬁcer as the Secre- 
               <br />
               tary of State, devolved at present on the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice. All correspondence be-

               tween the Provinces and the Dominion of 
               <br />
               course was conducted by the Secretary of 
               <br />
               State. For the present it was proposed that 
               <br />
               things should remain as they were, because 
               <br />
               it was clear that if there was any necessity 
               <br />
               for the ofﬁces, before the extension of the 
               <br />
               Dominion boundary, that necessity would be 
               <br />
               greatly increased the moment Newfoundland 
               <br />
               and the North West became part of the Do- 
               <br />
               minion. As he had stated before, the distribu- 
               <br />
               tion of ofﬁces and power was of necessity to 
               <br />
               a great extent experimental in the Dominion. 
               <br />
               From the mover of the Address they had 
               <br />
               heard what the Government would be ex- 
               <br />
               pected to do if they assumed the control of 
               <br />
               the North-West. The subjects then alluded 
               <br />
               to as having to be dealt with were numerous
