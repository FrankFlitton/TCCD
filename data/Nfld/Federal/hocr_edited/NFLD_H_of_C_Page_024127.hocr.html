               the Canadian government, with the consent

               In the year 1912, by chapter 45 of 2 George 
               <br />
               V, the parliament of Canada decided to extend 
               <br />
               once more the territory of the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec together with the territories of Mani-

               <br />
               45 it was enacted that the new boundaries of 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec would include what 
               <br />
               was called at the time Ungava territory; and 
               <br />
               it was clearly established that the new 
               <br />
               boundaries would include the territory north 
               <br />

               As we have just seen, the two Canadian

               statutes giving expressly to the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec the territory claimed by Newfound- 
               <br />

               <br />
               say, at a time when the imperial government 
               <br />
               had the right to disallow any act passed by 
               <br />

               the Canadian government. Therefore, these 
               <br />
               two statutes, having never been disallowed, 
               <br />
               must have their full force and value. It has 
               <br />
               been contended that they were ultra vires,

               but if such had been the case, why is it that 
               <br />
               the government of Newfoundland did not 
               <br />
               ask the British government to disallow them? 
               <br />
               We must therefore conclude that they were 
               <br />
               tacitly conﬁrmed by the British government 
               <br />
               and tacitly accepted by the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               government. That is the reason why I said 
               <br />
               at the outset that the territory known as 
               <br />
               Labrador peninsula belongs to the province 
               <br />

               In 1920, after discussions had been started

               <br />

               A ﬁrst memorandum of agreement between 
               <br />
               Canada and Newfoundland was signed on 
               <br />
               November 11, 1920, but it was later amended 
               <br />
               and replaced by a new agreement dated 
               <br />
               November 20, 1922. We must notice here that 
               <br />
               by this agreement the two political parties 
               <br />
               which existed at the time—the Conservative 
               <br />
               and Liberal parties—did not hesitate to violate, 
               <br />
               one after the other, the principle enacted in 
               <br />
               the British North America Act of 1871. Every-

               <br />
               1922 we had a Liberal government. In fact 
               <br />
               on behalf of the Canadian government the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst agreement was signed in 1920 by Mr. 
               <br />
               Charles J. Doherty, and the second one in 
               <br />
               1922, on behalf of the same government, was 
               <br />
