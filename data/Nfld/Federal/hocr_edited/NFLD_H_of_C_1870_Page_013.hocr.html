               give back to Nova Scotia what she had spent 
               <br />
               since the Quebec Conference. Thank God the 
               <br />
               Dominion was rich enough to be honest. Gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen opposite did not always adhere to the 
               <br />
               Quebec Resolutions. Last session when the 
               <br />
               resolutions respecting Newfoundland were 
               <br />
               before the House, although it was provided by 
               <br />
               these Quebec Resolutions that the Dominion 
               <br />
               should buy up all the Crown Lands, gentlemen 
               <br />
               on the opposition benches supported an amend- 
               <br />
               ment against that arrangement respecting 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. They did not think the Quebec 
               <br />
               Resolutions were so sacred that they could not 
               <br />
               be amended. How did the Parliament of the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom treat Ireland after 1800? 
               <br />
               Every one of the arrangements entered into 
               <br />
               respecting revenue, had since been altered, as 
               <br />
               he showed by the report of the special commit- 
               <br />
               tee appointed to investigate the matter. It was 
               <br />
               well known with what difficulty the Union 
               <br />
               had been carried, and yet the arrangements 
               <br />
               were altered shortly after. That this Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment had acted wisely and justly was evi- 
               <br />
               denced by the decision of the Imperial Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment as well as by the altered tone of the 
               <br />
               representatives of Nova Scotia in dealing with 
               <br />
               general interests and entering heartily into 
               <br />
               their consideration, even although many would 
               <br />
               still be anxious to be separated. But they 
               <br />
               would all confess they had been treated justly 
               <br />
               here. All had heard of the struggles of nations 
               <br />
               for liberty; and of English patriots not fearing 
               <br />
               to wade through blood and war. They saw how 
               <br />
               the Colonial system had grown up from a 
               <br />
               bureaucracy to responsible Government, won 
               <br />
               by persistent exertions. But history was silent 
               <br />
               on any case but this, where a people said they 
               <br />
               had too much liberty and were not fit to be 
               <br />
               trusted with their own money, like the lunatic, 
               <br />
               feeling the fit coming on him, asking to be 
               <br />
               manacled. A people which considers itself a 
               <br />
               nation which some thought fit to walk alone, 
               <br />
               they asserted was not fit to spend its own 
               <br />
               money. That was what was said by the hon. 
               <br />
               member for West Durham. When Fox said that 
               <br />
               the Prince of Wales was Regent by Right 
               <br />
               Divine, Pitt said, “Then marry him.” They 
               <br />
               could not unwhig the mover for bringing for- 
               <br />
               ward a motion to deprive the people of their 
               <br />
               liberty, which might have been expected from 
               <br />
               an old Tory like himself, (laughter). Had he 
               <br />
               brought forward such a motion, how many 
               <br />
               stones would have been thrown at his head. He 
               <br />
               held that he and his friends were the expo- 
               <br />
               nents of the wishes of the people, and would 
               <br />
               maintain their liberty. Then, of what use was 
               <br />
               the motion? The mover says that the alteration 
               <br />
               would have been obtained by an Address to the 
               <br />
               Imperial Parliament. It would not, therefore, 
               <br />
               prevent all the log-rolling, and all they would 
               <br />
               obtain by this was a mess of pottage. The 
               <br />
               Imperial Parliament had handed over all power
