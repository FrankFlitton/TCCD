               of the population. If fair to Newfoundland let 
               <br />
               a much larger sum than even 28c per head be 
               <br />
               given, as special subsidy, but he objected to 
               <br />
               its being given under the guise of a sham 
               <br />
               bargain, to buy lands which we did not want, 
               <br />
               which, to the Newfoundland Government it- 
               <br />
               self, were a source of annual expenditure 
               <br />
               instead of income, and would be still more so 
               <br />
               when managed from this distance. The argu- 
               <br />
               ment of necessity was used by the President 
               <br />
               of the Council. That hon. gentleman said it 
               <br />
               was absolutely necessary we should have 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, and the logical result of that 
               <br />
               would be, as necessity had no law, that we 
               <br />
               would have to take her own terms, whatever 
               <br />
               they might be. He (Mr. Blake) apprehended 
               <br />
               that if there was any necessity in the case, 
               <br />
               it was just as necessary for Newfoundland to 
               <br />
               have her fortunes united to the Dominion as 
               <br />
               it was for the Dominion to get Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               He considered it not necessary, but of high 
               <br />
               consequence to the future of the Dominion 
               <br />
               that Newfoundland should be brought into the 
               <br />
               Union; yet not however of so high conse- 
               <br />
               quence as that we should agree to unreason- 
               <br />
               able demands, if unreasonable demands should 
               <br />
               be made; of not so high consequence as that 
               <br />
               we could not afford to wait until reasonable 
               <br />
               propositions should be submitted. He did not 
               <br />
               say that these demands were unreasonable. He 
               <br />
               was simply pointing out that it was their 
               <br />
               duty to ascertain whether they were reason- 
               <br />
               able or not, before acceding to them. The 
               <br />
               following ﬁgures showed what he understood 
               <br />
               would have to be paid annually by the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion for Newfoundland:—Subsidy, at 80c 
               <br />
               per head on a population of 130,000, $104,000; 
               <br />
               special subsidy, $35,000; Interest on debt at 
               <br />
               5.23 per cent, $73,220; Five per cent allowed 
               <br />
               on the balance, by which the debt fell short 
               <br />
               of the proposition of the other Provinces, 
               <br />
               $110,505; annual payment for Crown Lands, 
               <br />
               $150,000. These sums amounted to $472,725, 
               <br />
               all cash payments. Besides these, there were 
               <br />
               the charges for the services which the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion performed ordinarily, and which it 
               <br />
               would have to perform <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               amounting, he estimated, to $165,000, which, 
               <br />
               added to the other sum, made a total of 
               <br />
               $637,725 per annum. He thought it might 
               <br />
               safely be said that the charge to the Dominion 
               <br />
               on account of Newfoundland would be be- 
               <br />
               tween $600,000 and $650,000. Now from any 
               <br />
               statements he had seen as to the revenue he 
               <br />
               did not anticipate that Newfoundland after 
               <br />
               she entered the Union would produce an 
               <br />
               amount of revenue in any way approaching to 
               <br />
               $600,000. A considerable proportion of the 
               <br />
               goods on which duty was now paid Would be 
               <br />
               supplied from the other Provinces, and though
