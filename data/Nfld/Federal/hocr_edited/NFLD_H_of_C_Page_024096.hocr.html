               Mr. Blake replied to the Minister of Militia, 
               <br />
               and contended that it was eminently proper 
               <br />
               that, from the very outset, any action by the 
               <br />
               Dominion Government, looking in the direc- 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tures</span> their control over property and civil 
               <br />
               rights, should be carefully discussed. He con- 
               <br />
               sidered sound policy was against this Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment assuming control over these laws; ﬁrst 
               <br />
               because it would be against the proper work- 
               <br />
               ing of the Federal system, and second because 
               <br />
               it would give this Parliament control over the 
               <br />
               laws of Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia, with which one-third of its members— 
               <br />
               those from Quebec—had no concern. Such a 
               <br />
               policy, he believed, was wrong; and even from 
               <br />
               the point of view of those who thought other- 
               <br />
               wise, it must be regarded as premature, look- 
               <br />
               ing to the position of Nova Scotia and to the 
               <br />
               coming in of Newfoundland. Moreover, with- 
               <br />
               out the concurrence of the Local Legislatures, 
               <br />
               the money spent on this object would be 
               <br />
               thrown away; and that concurrence he did 
               <br />
               not believe would be given. As regarded, at 
               <br />
               least, his own Province, his voice would be 
               <br />
               raised against such concurrence.

               Sir John A. Macdonald said it was possible 
               <br />
               that Ontario, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick 
               <br />
               might never have precisely the same laws, but 
               <br />
               it was, at least, desirable that they should 
               <br />
               have an opportunity of obtaining uniformity 
               <br />
               of their laws. There had been a gradual diver- 
               <br />
               gence of the laws in those Provinces, and it 
               <br />
               was of importance to their well-being that that 
               <br />
               divergence should be done away with. The 
               <br />
               most likely way to accomplish that was to 
               <br />
               have a Commission of experts familiar with 
               <br />
               the laws of the various Provinces, to report a 
               <br />
               body of laws which the Provinces might either 
               <br />
               accept or reject. The member for Durham said 
               <br />
               this movement was premature, because New- 
               <br />
               foundland was not yet in the Union. That 
               <br />
               Province had been very careful to maintain its 
               <br />
               Civil Law, the law of England. The whole of 
               <br />
               its own laws in that department might be con- 
               <br />
               tained in a very thin volume. There would be 
               <br />
               little difficulty, therefore, as regarded that 
               <br />
               Province. No one Province could afford to pay 
               <br />
               the expense of such a commission as this, and 
               <br />
               if it did a Provincial commission would look 
               <br />
               at the consolidation of the law from a Provin- 
               <br />
               cial point of view. He was surprised that the 
               <br />
               member for Durham should oppose this or 
               <br />
               should not desire a uniform system of laws 
               <br />
               over all the Provinces. It was of importance 
               <br />
               that the members of the bar of one Province 
               <br />
               should be in a position to go to the bar of an-<br />
