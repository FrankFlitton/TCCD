               minion. This would give a law on which all 
               <br />
               were agreed—a measure for the relief of 
               <br />
               traders and traders only. There was a good 
               <br />
               deal of force in the argument advanced by 
               <br />
               the member for South Oxford that the law 
               <br />
               should be general, but lest the bill should 
               <br />
               not become law this session it was best to 
               <br />
               modify it by making it applicable to traders 
               <br />
               only. Next session, on a fair representation

               <br />
               tended so as to meet their case. (Hear, hear.)

               Hon. John Sandﬁeld Macdonald said there 
               <br />
               should be some provision for punishing par-<br />
               ties who did not make an assignment when 
               <br />
               they ought to do so, and he read a letter 
               <br />
               from a distinguished Judge, who expressed 
               <br />
               his concurrence in the views he (Mr. Sand-

               ﬁeld Macdonald) had expressed at the second 
               <br />
               reading of the Bill as to the outrageously

               easy manner in which fraudulent debtors 
               <br />
               were allowed to whitewash themselves, and 
               <br />
               said that for the last twenty-ﬁve years our 
               <br />
               laws had been far too much in favour of the 
               <br />
               debtor, rather than of the creditor. In Eng-

               <br />
               was considered a very clever fellow, and the 
               <br />
               law gave him every facility. He contended 
               <br />
               that some other machinery should be pro-

               Hon. Mr. Abbott pointed out that it would
