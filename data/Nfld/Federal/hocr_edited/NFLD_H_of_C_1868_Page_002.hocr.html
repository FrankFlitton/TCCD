giving the vote he had done the other day, <br />
but the remarks of the honourable member <br />
were rather ungracious, coming from a gen- <br />
tleman who introduced his last resolution <br />
well knowing, from the fate of the ﬁrst, that <br />
the information asked for would not be <br />
granted, and who, because he could not get <br />
all, would take none. <br />

by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the honourable</span> member for
Chateauguay, <br />
to which allusion had been made, was one <br />
suggested by the member of South Lennox, <br />
and spoken favourably of by the members for <br />
Renfrew and South Ontario. One of these <br />
gentlemen having suggested the motion to the <br />
member for Chateauguay with whom they <br />
had been in accord in bank sentiments, noth- <br />
ing was more natural than that honourable <br />
gentleman should make the motion, and he <br />
(Mr. Mackenzie) confessed, however, that he <br />
was never more astonished in his life than to <br />
see one member after another member stand <br />
up and vote against this very motion. (Hear <br />
and laughter). <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Cartwright was free to acknowledge he
<br />
did suggest the motion, but he bowed to the <br />
judgment of the Minister of Justice in the <br />
matter, who had desired that compliance with <br />
the resolution would be adverse to the public <br />
interest. <br />

<br />
taken for granted that the Government were <br />
at a great disadvantage in consequence of <br />
their arrangement with the Bank of Mont- <br />
real. He wished to bear his testimony to the <br />
fair dealing of that institution towards the <br />
Government. In circumstances of very con- <br />
siderable ﬁnancial difﬁculty the Government <br />
had received assistance from the Bank of <br />
Montreal, the absence of which would per- <br />
haps have proved exceedingly embarrassing to <br />
the Ministry of the day. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. Mr. Holton hoped, as every informa- <br />
tion was to be given, that the correspondence <br />
on this subject, which he had asked for, <br />
would be forthcoming. He had no hesitation <br />

useful public servant—now it would become <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. John S. Macdonald said the statement
<br />
of the member for Chateauguay regarding <br />
the Bank of Montreal was not warranted. He <br />
protested against this continued harping <br />
against the Bank of Montreal. The fact was <br />
that the bank was patronized by the Gov— <br />
ernment because it had helped them cheerful- <br />
ly and materially in times of need, and was <br />
besides by far the best managed institution of <br />
that time in the Dominion. Let the member <br />
for Chateauguay attack the Government and <br />
let the servant of the Government alone. It <br />
was unfair to attack the Bank of Montreal <br />
when the gentlemen of the Treasury Benches <br />
were the really responsible parties. <br />
