               <br />
               the United States, in 1863 and 1864, and also

               arising out of the threatened Fenian invasion

               <br />
               object in giving this notice was to afford the

               States in liquidation of the Alabama claims.

               He thought that was a question which should

               be discussed in this House, and he had
