               <br />
               what special terms and conditions ought to be

               jurisdiction of the Government of this coun- 
               <br />

               <br />
               view, the Union Act declaring that the 
               <br />
               North-West Territory might be handed over 
               <br />
               to the jurisdiction of Canada on such terms 
               <br />
               and conditions as should expressed in the 
               <br />
               address of the two Houses of Parliament. The 
               <br />
               Government assumed that, in pursuance of 
               <br />
               that Act, what they had to do was to ascer- 
               <br />
               tain for themselves the terms and conditions 
               <br />
               on which they would accept the Territory, 
               <br />
               and having got the assent of both Houses to 
               <br />
               these terms, they forwarded the address to 
               <br />
               the Home Government, and now awaited 
               <br />
               their answer. An honourable gentleman op- 
               <br />
               posite thought this Government was censura- 
               <br />
               ble, because no answer was yet received. 
               <br />
               Surely they were not to settle both sides of 
               <br />
               the contract. If the Imperial Government and 
               <br />
               Parliament had other terms and conditions to 
               <br />
               propose, we would have to pronounce upon 
               <br />
               them when presented to us. As regarded the 
               <br />
               delay, they hoped and expected that probably 
               <br />
               the next mail would bring the answer of the 
               <br />
               Imperial Government. The House knew that 
               <br />
               in England the Premier had retired, and 
               <br />
               another had taken his place, and necessarily 
               <br />
               delays and changes of policy would occur. 
               <br />
               This might account for some of the delay in 
               <br />
               answering the address, which he confessed he 
               <br />
               very much regretted. He did think there were 
               <br />
               high reasons of State why this question 
               <br />
               should be settled at the earliest moment; he 
               <br />
               thought so still, and he must say there had 
               <br />
               been no failure of duty on the part of this 
               <br />
               Government in urging the matter. As regard- 
               <br />
               ed what he had said during the last election, 
               <br />
               one could not be expected to stand by all the 
               <br />
               pictures of imagination which might be 
               <br />
               drawn during the heat of an election contest. 
               <br />
               (Laughter). He would say, however, that in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland there were several gentlemen 
               <br />
               occupying prominent positions, who took part 
               <br />
               in the negotiations of 1864, and who were 
               <br />
               still anxious that that Colony should enter 
               <br />
               the Union. It was well known what views 
               <br />
               were expressed by the Governor of New-

               the newspapers of the last few weeks showed

               British Columbia, at a public meeting presid-

               ed over by the Mayor of Victoria, resolutions 
               <br />

               <br />
               thought, therefore, he had been justiﬁed in

               <br />
               the other Colonies, that the Union would soon 
               <br />
               be extended. Delays had occurred, but he 
               <br />
               believed that in a short time we would have 
               <br />
               formal proceedings, which would be a basis 
               <br />
               for action, and the extension of the Union, 
               <br />
