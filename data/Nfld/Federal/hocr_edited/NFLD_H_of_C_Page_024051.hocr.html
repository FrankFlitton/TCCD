               he did not see that the country would benefit 
               <br />
               one farthing from the abolition of the duty 
               <br />
               on ﬂour in Newfoundland; but, as had been 
               <br />
               stated, the reverse. (Hear, hear.) Hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen seemed to take it for granted that On- 
               <br />
               tario and Quebec were at a loss for a market. 
               <br />
               Such he would assure them was not the case. 
               <br />
               In grain, what they needed a market for was 
               <br />
               coarse grains, and these were precisely the 
               <br />
               articles not wanted in Newfoundland. Again, 
               <br />
               the Finance Minister argued that our woollen 
               <br />
               manufacturers would get a market in this 
               <br />
               island, but his (Mr. Mackenzie’s) impression 
               <br />
               was that the bulk of these goods would be 
               <br />
               put on the market by those having an in-<br />
               terest in a return cargo from England. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman indicated that on concur- 
               <br />
               rence he would indicate his views on some 
               <br />
               matters connected with the resolutions, which 
               <br />
               he would not touch till then. At present he 
               <br />
               would merely say that, so far as he could 
               <br />
               do so conscientiously, he would aid in ac- 
               <br />
               complishing the Union, but hold himself as a 
               <br />
               free agent in that matter, allowing himself 
               <br />
               to be bound by no conditions whatever. 
               <br />
               Having replied at some length to the mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Westmorland, and argued that New 
               <br />
               Brunswick had no reason for complaint as 
               <br />

               man closed by expressing his regret that, in 
               <br />
               debating this subject, the House had not been 
               <br />

               of the great scheme which originated at the

               member for West Durham, when that hon.

               <br />
               the Quebec Conference with regard to New-

               action of the Conference was endorsed by the
