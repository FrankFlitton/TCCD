               ed franchise extended to that Province; for, 
               <br />
               under its operation, you would not poll 8,000 
               <br />
               votes outside of St. John’s and Harbour Grace. 
               <br />
               The simultaneous polling Act was first intro- 
               <br />
               duced in Nova Scotia by the present Judge in 
               <br />
               Equity, and its operation has proved a great 
               <br />
               blessing to us in preserving peace and order, 
               <br />
               and preventing riots and bloodshed in many 
               <br />
               counties where political feeling ran high. 
               <br />
               Taking this great blessing away from us will 
               <br />
               be doing us a great injury, and one that is 
               <br />
               calculated to restore trouble and confusion, 
               <br />
               when all this would be avoided by permitting 
               <br />
               us to retain this beneficial feature in the Act 
               <br />
               refused. If the Government will not extend 
               <br />
               this Act to all parts of the Dominion, I hope 
               <br />
               they will allow it still to be retained in Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia. The hon. member from St. John stated 
               <br />
               what a loss it would be to England if the 
               <br />
               present Prime Minister would have lost his 
               <br />
               election; but, suppose that he was to be 
               <br />
               removed by death, would not the Government 
               <br />
               of England go on the same as ever, and would 
               <br />
               not the country prosper as if he never had 
               <br />
               existed? Suppose that the member from St. 
               <br />
               John would be defeated at the next election—a 
               <br />
               calamity we would all have to deplore—but if 
               <br />
               such a thing could be possible, what then but 
               <br />
               that the people of St. John would have 
               <br />
               returned another member—certainly not one 
               <br />
               possessing as much eloquence or as much mili- 
               <br />
               tary experience—but possessing more indepen- 
               <br />
               dence than the present member. Great men 
               <br />
               change sides, and are removed; and many think 
               <br />
               that if some of the members of the present 
               <br />
               Government were cast aside that better men 
               <br />
               would replace them; but one thing certain is, 
               <br />
               that the prosperity of the country would not be 
               <br />
               retarded, should some of them at any time lose 
               <br />
               their seats at an election.
