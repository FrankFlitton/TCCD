               Hon. Mr. Rose said the object of the resolu- 
               <br />
               tions was principally the admission of Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island into the Union. After the 
               <br />
               address which had just been passed, it was 
               <br />
               evident that the Union would be very incom- 
               <br />
               plete without Prince Edward Island. It had a 
               <br />
               low tariff and there would be great temptation 
               <br />
               to send in goods from that Island to the other 
               <br />
               Provinces. Its geographical position also was 
               <br />
               such that the Dominion would be very incom- 
               <br />
               plete without it. Another very important 
               <br />
               reason why it should be admitted had refer- 
               <br />
               ence to the ﬁsheries. The House was aware of 
               <br />
               the extreme value of the ﬁsheries belonging to 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island: and it was known that 
               <br />
               no permanent arrangement could be made as 
               <br />
               to the ﬁsheries unless Prince Edward Island 
               <br />
               were a party to it. Prince Edward Island had 
               <br />
               very little debt. The principal part of it had 
               <br />
               been contracted in the purchase of estates 
               <br />
               from persons who held them under grants 
               <br />
               from the Crown of England on terms which 
               <br />
               had very materially retarded the settlement of 
               <br />
               the Island. The hon. gentleman went on to 
               <br />
               explain somewhat minutely the position of the 
               <br />
               land question in Prince Edward Island. He 
               <br />
               then explained that as the tariff was low, and 
               <br />
               the debt comparatively small, it had been
