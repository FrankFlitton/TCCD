               hear.) These living millions are stilts, and we 
               <br />
               are vain enough to think we can stand on 
               <br />
               them. In 1790, the United States commenced 
               <br />
               with a total population of 3,900,000 souls, but 
               <br />
               they had, it is true, no gigantic native neigh- 
               <br />
               bours on their ﬂanks; still they had the 
               <br />
               power of England on this side, of Spain in the 
               <br />
               Floridas, and of France in Louisiana. They 
               <br />
               began modestly and moderately, and they 
               <br />
               have advanced by degrees, in their “new 
               <br />
               nationality”. I ask the honourable gentleman 
               <br />
               this question—if he does not look forward to 
               <br />
               a new nationality here, in these Provinces, to 
               <br />
               what does he look forward? Surely he must 
               <br />
               see that a population which increased in sixty 
               <br />
               years, a hundred fold, cannot be reckoned 
               <br />
               upon as a stationary quantity? With some 
               <br />
               nations the best ambition is to keep what 
               <br />
               they have got; but these are nations of ﬁxed 
               <br />
               population and full boundaries. Extending as 
               <br />
               we are in space—increasing in num- 
               <br />
               ber—improving in intercourse—we cannot 
               <br />
               stand still politically, even if we tried. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) But the honourable member and his 
               <br />
               followers seem to have some confused notion 
               <br />
               in their heads, that a new nation cannot exist 
               <br />
               within the Empire, consistently with the 
               <br />
               Imperial connection. Sir, I don’t know where 
               <br />
               they got such a notion, but it is a very 
               <br />
               childish one, and contrary to all experience. 
               <br />
               The Federal principle is precisely adopted to 
               <br />
               meet a difﬁculty of that kind, and has for 
               <br />
               many centuries met it successfully. In the 
               <br />
               German Empire there never was any difﬁcul- 
               <br />
               ty as to the simple existence of separate 
               <br />
               nationalities and kingdoms; in the Spanish 
               <br />
               Empire, so long as its sovereigns respected 
               <br />
               the rights and liberties of the component 
               <br />
               parts, there was no difﬁculty of holding 
               <br />
               together the kingdoms of the Netherlands, of 
               <br />
               Aragon, and Naples; in the Austrian Empire, 
               <br />
               when the rights of the ancient kingdom of 
               <br />
               Hungary were respected the kingdom was in 
               <br />
               fact, the mainstay of the Empire. In our own 
               <br />
               day, we have in Hindostan an Empire within 
               <br />
               an Empire, so constituted expressly on the 
               <br />
               ground of strengthening the Imperial connec- 
               <br />
               tion by the wisest statesmen, our contem- 
               <br />
               poraries. So far, therefore, as to that childish 
               <br />
               and foolish notion of incompatibility. But the 
               <br />
               honourable member will not allow, that even 
               <br />
               With our four millions, we have men enough 
               <br />
               to start in the onerous career of a new 
               <br />
               nationality. What amount of population does 
               <br />
               he suppose then to be necessary to such a 
               <br />
               start? For colonies, as colonies, to get togeth- 
               <br />
               er and keep together, four millions of inhabi- 
               <br />
               tants is no small achievement, and if we have 
               <br />
               not increased more largely by immigration of

               <br />
               Germany, or even of Britain, knew anything 
               <br />
               of Canada, up to the other day? In those 
               <br />
               hives of human labour, they knew only one 
               <br />
               country—America—and One seaport—New

               the aspect of Empire, make them a power 
               <br />
               and a name, and the reputation and credit of 
               <br />
               the Dominion will be our best immigration 
               <br />
               agents abroad. (Hear, hear.) As to our inabili- 
               <br />
               ty to stand alone, with the numbers we have, 
               <br />
               I beg to observe, sir, that in my opinion, it 
               <br />
               depends very much on our unanimity or 
               <br />
               division. No power on earth can take forci- 
               <br />
               ble possession of this country, if we are united 
               <br />
               as one man, in its defence. (Applause.) No 
               <br />
               population that can be stirred up against us, 
               <br />
               can put a hostile four millions, face to face 
               <br />
               with us on our own soil. If every man, 
               <br />
               woman and child in Canada, is imbued with 
               <br />
               the spirit which enabled Switzerland to hold 
               <br />
               her own against the Austrian Empire, and 
               <br />
               Spain in her decline to cast out Napoleon in 
               <br />
               his vigour, we will be safe enough, within our 
               <br />
               rivers and rapids in summer, and our snowed 
               <br />
               up roads and freezing skies in winter. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) We complain sometimes of our rigorous 
               <br />
               winters, but there is this compensation at 
               <br />
               least, that no invading force that bivouacked 
               <br />
               out for one genuine Canadian night, would 
               <br />
               ever answer to the call of the long roll again. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) My own views on the subject of 
               <br />
               defence are pretty well known, and when my 
               <br />
               honourable friend (Mr. Cartier) brings down 
               <br />
               his measure, if the House desires to hear 
               <br />
               them, I shall be happy to meet its wishes: but 
               <br />
               I will now only say this, that I hope to see 
               <br />
               the military spirit of our population en- 
               <br />
               couraged in every way; that I hope to see 
               <br />
               riﬂe matches and tournaments become as 
               <br />
               familiar municipal institutions as town meet- 
               <br />
               ings, of county agricultural fairs. (Applause.) 
               <br />
               I cannot, for one, agree that the best way to 
               <br />
               make ourselves respected abroad, to secure 
               <br />
               impunity from attack, is to depreciate the 
               <br />
               sources of our strength; but rather to rely 
               <br />
               upon and make the most of what Lord Bacon, 
               <br />
               in his “true greatness of Britain,” considers a 
               <br />
               main element of a nation’s strength, “its
