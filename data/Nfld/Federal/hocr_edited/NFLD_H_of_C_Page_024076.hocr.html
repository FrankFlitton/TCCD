               Hon. Mr. Tilley—One of the reasons, he 
               <br />
               did not hesitate to say, was that there might 
               <br />
               be a ﬁxed sum for local matters which they 
               <br />
               could not be sure of, if the lands were under 
               <br />
               their control and management; and, now that 
               <br />
               this proposition had come from Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               he did not hesitate to say, from his experience, 
               <br />
               from the difficulties we had with reference to 
               <br />
               settling wild lands, emigration, and with re- 
               <br />
               gard to the resources of the Dominion, that it 
               <br />
               was in the public interest that all Canada 
               <br />
               lands should be placed in the hands of the 
               <br />
               Dominion. But the Constitution had settled 
               <br />
               this otherwise in the case of the Provinces in 
               <br />
               Confederation. With reference to the nature 
               <br />
               of the agreement, he desired to say a word or 
               <br />
               two. He desired to state why he thought Par- 
               <br />
               liament should assent to this proposition, and 
               <br />
               why the people of Newfoundland had a right 
               <br />
               to expect that it should not be rejected. The 
               <br />
               arrangements made at Quebec were subse- 
               <br />
               quently aﬂirmed and conﬁrmed by the Domi- 
               <br />
               nion. In the ﬁrst place the arrangements then 
               <br />
               made differed little from the general prin-<br />
               ciples contained in the London resolutions 
               <br />
               respecting the other Provinces. The proposi-<br />
               tion that $150,000 should be paid for the land 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland was assented to by an over- 
               <br />
               whelming majority of the Parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada.

               Hon. Mr. Holton—We had never said the

               Hon. Mr. Tilley—We had them in the Act 
               <br />
               of Parliament subsequently affirmed. It was 
               <br />
               aﬂirmed not only by the Canadian Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment, but by people of New Brunswick at 
               <br />
               the polls, and subsequently by the Legislature 
               <br />
               of Nova Scotia. Having shown that the prin- 
               <br />
               ciples of the London Conference were en- 
               <br />

               ing members of the Conference, all but one 
               <br />
               having been elected at the general election, 
               <br />
               the honourable gentleman went on to regret 
               <br />
               that the followers of Hon. Mr. Brown, a lead-<br />
               ing member of the Conference, had not taken 
               <br />
               the view of this question which he had, and 
               <br />
               would doubtless have done. In his Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion speeches, and the articles which he had 
               <br />
               written with his own hand, no doubt that 
               <br />
               honourable gentleman had strongly urged the 
               <br />
               advantages of having Newfoundland in the 
               <br />
               Union on the terms of the Quebec Conference. 
               <br />
               That the sum proposed to be paid to New- 
               <br />
               foundland was not regarded by them as a 
               <br />
               bribe, or as offering extraordinary induce- 
               <br />
               ments to them to enter Confederation, was 
               <br />
               evidenced by their taking four years to arrive
