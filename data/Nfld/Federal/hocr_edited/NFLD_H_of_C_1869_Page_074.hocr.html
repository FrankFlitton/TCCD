               he had done against this land purchase by the

               Government, appeared to have altogether for-

               gotten his vote the other night with reference 
               <br />
               to the North-West Territory. There was a land 
               <br />
               purchase in a country situated twice as far off 
               <br />
               as Newfoundland, and twenty times as large.

               Mr. Stirton objected to the doctrine that all 
               <br />
               who endorsed the Quebec resolutions should 
               <br />
               always abide by them. Under what circum- 
               <br />
               stances were these resolutions adopted? 
               <br />
               Under the statement that the resolutions must 
               <br />
               be adopted in their entirety or not at all. But 
               <br />
               already the Government themselves had vio- 
               <br />
               lated that compact in London and subse- 
               <br />
               quently, and it was absurd to endeavour to 
               <br />
               force hon. gentlemen to cling to it, merely be- 
               <br />
               cause it suited the occupants of the Treasury 
               <br />
               Benches. He would vote for the amendment, 
               <br />
               believing this land purchase to be one which 
               <br />
               the country would not sustain. At the same 
               <br />
               time, he was not at all desirous to throw any 
               <br />
               obstacle in the way of Newfoundland coming 
               <br />
               into the Union. He hoped to see that Union 
               <br />
               speedily and satisfactorily completed.

               Hon. Mr. McDougall considered that the 
               <br />
               amendment proposed by his hon. friend was 
               <br />
               contrary in principle to the votes that gentle- 
               <br />
               man had heretofore given. He thought the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman who had last spoken was not 
               <br />
               acting consistently with his former Union 
               <br />
               principles, because the terms to which he ob- 
               <br />
               jected were essentially the same as those for 
               <br />
               which he had formerly voted. If his hon. 
               <br />
               friends opposite were really sincere in their 
               <br />
               professions of a desire for Union they should 
               <br />
               not take objection to the terms agreed to by 
               <br />
               the Quebec Conference. It was true that the 
               <br />
               lands of Newfoundland were not so valuable 
               <br />
               as those of the Northwest territory, but if we 
               <br />
               were to complete the work of Confederation 
               <br />
               such a consideration should have no weight. 
               <br />
               He would ask the hon. member for Wellington 
               <br />
               South if the principle he had laid down was 
               <br />
               ever followed in the County Council. The op- 
               <br />
               posite principle was almost invariably fol- 
               <br />
               lowed, and the more productive parts of a 
               <br />
               county were called on to assist in the develop- 
               <br />
               ment of the less productive parts. This prin- 
               <br />
               ciple should be applied to the development of 
               <br />
               the Dominion if we ever were to become a 
               <br />
               great and united Confederacy.
