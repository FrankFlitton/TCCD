               many points in a measure of compromise; but 
               <br />
               the question of the ballot was one which was 
               <br />
               very popular in New Brunswick, and the re-

               moval of which would be regarded as a great 
               <br />

               consent to allow the ballot to be still enjoyed

               <br />

               New Brunswick to continue to enjoy what they 
               <br />
               considered a great boon. In other points the

               people of New Brunswick would yield their

               Mr. Ross (Victoria, N.S.)—During the eight 
               <br />
               years that I had the honour of a seat in the 
               <br />
               Parliament of Nova Scotia, I had no desire to 
               <br />
               be considered anything more than one of its 
               <br />
               silent members, and here also, I have no desire 
               <br />
               to take up the time by imposing my ideas on 
               <br />
               the attention of the House, but the franchise of 
               <br />
               the country is a matter in which we are all 
               <br />
               interested, and I would like to say a little on 
               <br />
               that subject. I have examined carefully the 
               <br />
               Franchise Act now before the House, and find 
               <br />
               that at least one-fourth of my constituency will 
               <br />
               be disfranchised by it, and that will apply to 
               <br />
               the whole Province of Nova Scotia. I was 
               <br />
               pleased to find the Minister of Justice state 
               <br />
               that he had no doubt but the Bill would be 
               <br />
               largely amended in committee; and I hope it 
               <br />
               will be cut up, dissected and disembowelled, so 
               <br />
               that when it passed its various stages very 
               <br />
               little more than the name would be left. The 
               <br />
               present franchise has worked well in Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia, and there is no desire to have it 
               <br />
               changed. If, then, the Government desire to 
               <br />
               have the franchise under their own control, all 
               <br />
               that they have to do is to appoint their own 
               <br />
               officers to prepare the rolls, and then they will 
               <br />
               have all the guards necessary to have every- 
               <br />
               thing they require. In this progressive age, 
               <br />
               when Conservative England is extending the 
               <br />
               franchise in all parts of the Empire, will it be 
               <br />
               said that in her name have been curtailed the 
               <br />
               responsibilities and privileges already con- 
               <br />
               ferred on the people? Once you confer the fran- 
               <br />
               chise on a people, taking it away again will be 
               <br />
               considered and resented as a grievance. It is 
               <br />
               quite evident that the Government have aban- 
               <br />
               doned all hope of having Newfoundland 
               <br />
               brought into this Union, or to have the intend-
