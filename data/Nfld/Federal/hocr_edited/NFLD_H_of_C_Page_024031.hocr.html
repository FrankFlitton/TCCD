               <br />
               more than they are accustomed to have for 
               <br />
               their customary local wants. These matters 
               <br />
               ought to be carefully considered, for, as he 
               <br />
               viewed it, while we were extending the area 
               <br />
               of the Dominion, we were weakening our 
               <br />
               strength, and it might unfortunately turn out 
               <br />
               that Newfoundland, instead of being a source 
               <br />
               of strength, would be a source of weakness.

               Hon. Mr. Howe said he had no doubt that 
               <br />
               Canada, for her own purposes, had formed 
               <br />
               this Confederacy. She had taken step after 
               <br />
               step with a view to this consolidation, and in 
               <br />
               that view the acquisition of Newfoundland was 
               <br />
               a matter of prime importance. We were en- 
               <br />
               larging our responsibilty: we had stretched it 
               <br />
               westward until we hardly knew its limits, and 
               <br />
               now must stretch it east as far as Newfound- 
               <br />
               land. At all events, Newfoundland to us is a 
               <br />
               necessity. We may throw oﬁ the great West, 
               <br />
               but we cannot throw oﬁ Newfoundland. It lies 
               <br />
               in the very chops of the channel, as it were; 
               <br />
               is at the entrance of our New Dominion, and 
               <br />
               to every man looking to the consolidation of 
               <br />
               the Dominion he would say, Newfoundland 
               <br />
               is a necessity. Newfoundland is worth having 
               <br />
               for her own value and importance; and her 
               <br />
               higher political importance, in looking at the 
               <br />
               future, could not be over-rated. The ﬁve North 
               <br />
               American Colonies had all their trials and 
               <br />
               tribulations in the past, but Newfoundland 
               <br />
               had more than her share. Now she knocked 
               <br />
               at the door of Confederation for admittance; 
               <br />
               she was not coerced, but wanted to come in 
               <br />
               constitutionally, and for that reason he sym- 
               <br />
               pathized in her application. She is the oldest 
               <br />
               Colony on the Continent, was discovered ﬁrst, 
               <br />
               and occupied ﬁrst. The honourable gentleman 
               <br />
               proceeded to allude to two or three delightful 
               <br />
               summers which he spent in that Colony, and 
               <br />
               said what he then saw made him more willing 
               <br />
               to admit this people into the Confederacy. In 
               <br />
               their towns he had found as educated, reﬁned,

               and wealthy a people as any on the main land,
