               Mr. Mackenzie said he was glad to con- 
               <br />
               gratulate the House on adding another to the 
               <br />
               Confederated Provinces. He thought it to the 
               <br />
               advantage of all the Provinces that the Union 
               <br />
               should be consummated at as early a day as 
               <br />
               possible, based on such terms as would not 
               <br />
               occasion heart-burnings hereafter, and he 
               <br />
               could not but congratulate the House and the 
               <br />
               President of the Council himself in being in 
               <br />
               the right way. Some of the arguments ad- 
               <br />
               vanced required a little attention, and to 
               <br />
               these he would address himself for a few 
               <br />
               moments. The Minister of Militia seemed to 
               <br />
               think that the resolutions of the Quebec Con- 
               <br />
               ference were binding for all time to come, 
               <br />
               and that there should be no departure from 
               <br />
               them. He (Mr. Mackenzie) was quite will- 
               <br />
               ing to coincide in that argument if the hon- 
               <br />
               ourable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> made these resolutions 
               <br />
               binding all round. (Hear, hear.) While de- 
               <br />
               manding that he should be placed in the 
               <br />
               position of obeying strictly these resolutions, 
               <br />
               the Minister of Militia was himself disobey- 
               <br />
               ing them by the very resolutions before the 
               <br />
               House. (Hear, and cheers.) There could be 
               <br />
               nothing more illogical than the honourable 
               <br />
               gentleman’s proposition. Did he imagine that 
               <br />
               honourable gentlemen were merely to accept 
               <br />
               the dicta of the Ministry of the day, and that 
               <br />
               every argument was to be put down by a 
               <br />
               reference to something which happened years 
               <br />
               ago. (Hear.) He could assure the Minister 
               <br />
               of Militia that he would take what course he 
               <br />
               thought best with those Quebec resolutions. 
               <br />
               (Hear.) Some fallacious arguments had been 
               <br />
               advanced during the debate to which the 
               <br />
               honourable gentleman (Mr. Mackenzie) next 
               <br />
               drew attention. It had been urged that the 
               <br />
               market to be opened in this island would be 
               <br />
               a great benefit to Ontario. He was not dis- 
               <br />
               posed to underrate the advantages to the 
               <br />
               Provinces or the Dominion arising from the 
               <br />
               opening of this market; but he might say 
               <br />
               that he did not anticipate that the result of 
               <br />
               the Union would be to advance the interests 
               <br />
               of the agricultural portion of the Dominion 
               <br />
               one whit; but rather the contrary. Again, 
               <br />
               Canada affords but a poor market for New- 
               <br />
               foundland produce, which either goes to Eu- 
               <br />
               rope or South America, or the United States. 
               <br />
               So far as the ﬂour argument was concerned,
