               objection to that Act? He did not under-

               stand that it was said a Provincial Legisla-

               contravened a great object of public policy 
               <br />
               by putting Judges in the position of serving 
               <br />

               Sir John A. Macdonald said those who were 
               <br />
               in favour of Confederation would vote against 
               <br />
               the amendment. (Loud cries of No, No). It 
               <br />
               was well that the veil should be removed 
               <br />
               and the position exactly understood. It was 
               <br />
               well that the member for Lambton, by second- 
               <br />
               ing this amendment, had at last revealed his 
               <br />
               true position as an enemy to Confederation. 
               <br />
               (Cries of No, No, and ironical cheers.) That 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman had claimed to be a friend 
               <br />
               of Confederation and had made all kinds of 
               <br />
               professions on the subject. But when he found 
               <br />
               the key-stone of Confederation was about to 
               <br />
               be put in its place, without which all other 
               <br />
               efforts were useless, the hon. gentleman for 
               <br />
               party considerations, negated all his pre- 
               <br />
               vious professions. Rather than see Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion carried out by the present Government, 
               <br />
               to which he was opposed, he would insidious- 
               <br />
               ly, if not openly, oppose it. (No, No.) The ob- 
               <br />
               ject of Confederation was to bring all British 
               <br />
               North America into one Union. We were now 
               <br />
               incorporating the North-West, we were about 
               <br />
               to admit Newfoundland. All that remained 
               <br />
               was this measure to pacify Nova Scotia and 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen opposite were found opposing 
               <br />
               it. If the gentlemen opposite were successful, 
               <br />
               then there would be a jubilee among anti- 
               <br />
               Unionists, and such classes in Nova Scotia, 
               <br />
               throughout Canada, and outside of the Domi- 
               <br />
               nion as well. Let them reconcile Nova Scotia 
               <br />
               —the very keystone of the Dominion. The 
               <br />
               people of that Province at ﬁrst refused to 
               <br />
               come into the Union, but now were about to 
               <br />
               be reconciled.<br />
