               would there be done for nothing. The Com-

               missioners also recommended that any change 
               <br />
               should be carried out by means of a conven-

               <br />
               should enter, and suggested a number of 
               <br />
               matters, such as the remitting of coin which

               <br />
               that it was now the impression, both in 
               <br />
               France and the United States, that the recom— 
               <br />
               mendation of the English Commissioners had 
               <br />
               much merit in them, if they should not wholly 
               <br />
               be accepted, and the English sovereign adopted 
               <br />
               as the standard. This would cause very little 
               <br />
               inconvenience to these countries, for the 
               <br />
               pound sterling had been practically the 
               <br />
               standard throughout the world up to the time 
               <br />
               of the French Revolution, and in the United 
               <br />
               States during the suspension of specie pay— 
               <br />
               ments, it was of little consequence what 
               <br />
               particular coin was taken as the standard, 
               <br />
               whereas the investigations of the Commis- 
               <br />
               sioners had shewn that the world at large 
               <br />
               would be more inconvenienced by changing 
               <br />
               from the English sovereign than the United 
               <br />
               States by a change from their ﬁve dollar piece, 
               <br />
               or France by assimilating her 25 franc piece 
               <br />
               to the sovereign. Under these circumstances 
               <br />
               he thought we should submit a little longer to 
               <br />
               the inconvenience arising from the diﬁerence 
               <br />
               of currency in these Provinces. He supposed 
               <br />
               his hon. friends from Nova Scotia would not 
               <br />

               <br />
               change the Nova Scotia currency, by assimi- 
               <br />
               lating it to ours, and then have to go back 
               <br />
               again to their present system in the event of 
               <br />
