               Mr. Mackenzie, before the Minister of Fi- 
               <br />
               nance proceeded to offer any remarks on his 
               <br />
               resolutions, wished to know whether he was 
               <br />
               prepared to lay before the House information 
               <br />
               as to the statistics of Newfoundland, which 
               <br />
               it was necessary the House should possess be- 
               <br />
               fore it could intelligently consider the resolu- 
               <br />
               tions. It was impossible for any but a very 
               <br />
               few of the members to obtain this information 
               <br />
               for themselves. He had gone to the Library 
               <br />
               to-day and found that almost every volume 
               <br />
               relating to the statistics of Newfoundland had 
               <br />
               been taken away by parties connected with 
               <br />
               the Government.

               Hon. Mr. Rose said. that very full statistics 
               <br />
               as to Newfoundland had been submitted to 
               <br />
               the Quebec Conference, and little change had 
               <br />
               taken place since in the relative status of 
               <br />
               that Colony compared with the others. He 
               <br />
               would be happy to give the fullest information 
               <br />
               in his power as they went over the resolu- 
               <br />
               tions seriatim. He was not aware of any books 
               <br />
               on the subject having been taken from the 
               <br />
               Library, except that two hours ago he had 
               <br />
               sent for a volume containing the latest state- 
               <br />
               ments of exports and imports. In now mov- 
               <br />
               ing that the Speaker do leave the chair, for 
               <br />
               the House to go into Committee on these 
               <br />
               resolutions, he would brieﬂy give the House 
               <br />
               such information as he thought it should be 
               <br />
               put in possession of. At this period of the 
               <br />
               session, and as the terms of the agreement 
               <br />
               had been very fully discussed at the time of 
               <br />
               the Quebec Conference and subsequently, he 
               <br />
               did not intend to weary the House with many 
               <br />
               observations. He took it for granted that the 
               <br />
               policy of bringing Newfoundland into the 
               <br />
               Union would not be disputed. Any one who 
               <br />
               looked at the matter would see that this 
               <br />
               Union could not be complete so long as this 
               <br />
               Island, stretching across the Gulf of the St. 
               <br />
               Lawrence, with Nova Scotia on one side and 
               <br />
               Labrador on the other, did not belong to 
               <br />
               the Dominion. He thought, too, that the ex- 
               <br />
               tent and value of the trade of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               were not sufﬁciently known. He would ﬁrst 
               <br />
               allude to the extent of the Maritime interest. 
               <br />
               According to the latest statistical information 
               <br />
               within our reach, no less than 1,557 vessels 
               <br />
               were owned in Newfoundland, having a ton- 
               <br />
               nage of 87,000 tons, and an estimated value 
               <br />
               of $4,000,000. Then as regarded its foreign 
               <br />
               trade 1,216 vessels in one year entered the 
               <br />
               various ports of Newfoundland, and 1,016 
               <br />
               vessels cleared. The aggregate of seamen be- 
               <br />
               longing to these vessels was upwards of 
               <br />
               10,000. There were engaged besides in the 
               <br />
               seal-ﬁshing 230 sail, and in the cod-ﬁshing 
               <br />
               13,000 boats, employing a population of nearly 
               <br />
               40,000 persons. Newfoundland stood in a happy
