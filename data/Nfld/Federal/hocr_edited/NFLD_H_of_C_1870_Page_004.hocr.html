               Hon. Sir George-È. Cartier said the matter 
               <br />
               did not affect or interest the representatives of 
               <br />
               the other Provinces. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               Lambton said that he wished to see them all 
               <br />
               Conservatives; but let him try to get up a 
               <br />
               Liberal party. With regard to the charge of the 
               <br />
               want of success in Confederation, and support- 
               <br />
               ing it by the cases of Newfoundland and Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island, and the North West, he would 
               <br />
               refer to those countries. With regard to New- 
               <br />
               foundland, it had rejected the proposal; but the 
               <br />
               terms were not those of the Government but of 
               <br />
               the House. The House agreed to their proposed 
               <br />
               terms, and then they ceased to be their pro- 
               <br />
               posals; and he was surprised to see that such 
               <br />
               intelligent men as the members for Lambton 
               <br />
               and Sherbrooke should found their charges 
               <br />
               upon such a foundation. He would tell the 
               <br />
               House that if they would be quiet, in a short 
               <br />
               time the terms would be accepted. With regard 
               <br />
               to Prince Edward Island, the Government had 
               <br />
               made certain proposals, but they did not like to 
               <br />
               do anything without the approval of Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment. They had telegraphed the terms they 
               <br />
               should submit, and they had not yet received a 
               <br />
               reply. They could not force such powerful 
               <br />
               Provinces as Newfoundland and Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island to accept their terms, but they 
               <br />
               must wait. With regard to the North-West Ter- 
               <br />
               ritory, the proceedings adopted had not been 
               <br />
               the action simply of the Government, but had 
               <br />
               been adopted by the House. After the plans had 
               <br />
               been adopted by Parliament the House was 
               <br />
               responsible for them. He hoped his hon. friend 
               <br />
               did not object to that. The responsibility rested 
               <br />
               not upon the Government, but upon the Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment which had passed it; they had done all in 
               <br />
               their power to bring about the admission of the 
               <br />
               North-West into Confederation. He would 
               <br />
               admit that at the time the Confederation Act 
               <br />
               was discussed in Quebec, and at the discus- 
               <br />
               sions on it, they were not in possession of all 
               <br />
               the information that was desirable. The idea 
               <br />
               was that the Hudson Bay Company were not 
               <br />
               treating the inhabitants kindly, and that they 
               <br />
               would enter the Union gladly, but recent cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances showed that the Government of 
               <br />
               the country was not as unpopular as it was 
               <br />
               represented. His own impression was that the 
               <br />
               population had become indifferent to it, and 
               <br />
               the late lamentable circumstances proved that 
               <br />
               it was partly unpopular. He regretted that his 
               <br />
               own colleague was now to be addressed as an 
               <br />
               opponent. Before he accepted the office, he 
               <br />
               came to him (Sir George) and asked him
