               Hon. Mr. Wood said that in Ontario the 
               <br />
               working of the Insolvency Act had not found 
               <br />
               much favour with any large class of the com- 
               <br />
               munity. A large portion of the merchants, 
               <br />
               farmers, &amp;c., would be glad to see the Insol- 
               <br />
               vency Law done away with altogether. The 
               <br />
               working of the law had proved most unsatis- 
               <br />
               factory. Not one estate in a dozen had paid 
               <br />
               10 cents on the dollar after meeting expenses. 
               <br />
               Many had paid nothing. He believed there 
               <br />
               were cases of persons who had deliberately 
               <br />
               contracted debts with the intention of getting 
               <br />
               rid of them under this law. It was said it was 
               <br />
               impossible to distinguish between traders and 
               <br />
               non-traders. If the distinction was not defined 
               <br />
               in the Act, it had been clearly defined by 
               <br />
               many decisions in Courts. He thought it un- 
               <br />
               advisable to change the ﬁrst clause, which, 
               <br />
               while allowing persons, whether traders or 
               <br />
               non-traders, to take advantage of the Act, did 
               <br />
               not allow non-traders to make a voluntary 
               <br />
               assignment.

               Hon. Mr. Dunkin thought the clause could 
               <br />
               not stand as it was. No Court of law had 
               <br />
               any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difficulty</span> in deciding who were traders 
               <br />
               and who were not. The true principle in this 
               <br />
               matter was that of the amendment, not the 
               <br />
               amendment to the amendment. What they 
               <br />
               wanted to deal with here, especially with 
               <br />
               their limited jurisdiction, was the insolvency 
               <br />
               of the trading class. If this Parliament was 
               <br />

               objections of any particular Province, what 
               <br />
               was the value of the jurisdiction assigned to

               the Provincial Legislatures with regard to 
               <br />
