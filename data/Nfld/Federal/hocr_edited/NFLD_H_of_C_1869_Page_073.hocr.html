               of Newfoundland must be an immense acces-

               sion to the Union. He wished he had the 
               <br />
               power and eloquence of the Hon. Mr. Brown 
               <br />
               when expatiating on this subject. (Hear, hear.)

               If that honourable gentleman were on the

               ﬂoor of the House today, he would take larger, 
               <br />
               more liberal, and more able views of this 
               <br />
               question than were taken by honourable 
               <br />
               gentlemen usually following him. The Minis-<br />
               ter of Customs having deprecated viewing 
               <br />
               this question from a practical point of view, 
               <br />
               proceeded to take credit to the representa- 
               <br />
               tives of New Brunswick for having to a man 
               <br />
               voted for the acquisition of the North-West 
               <br />
               Territory. They did not stop to ask the ques- 
               <br />
               tion: What had they in that North-West Terri- 
               <br />
               tory to contribute to us? but though not di- 
               <br />
               rectly interested, they felt that the Dominion 
               <br />
               at large would be benefitted, and cheerfully 
               <br />
               voted for this great land purchase. As to the 
               <br />
               proposition now before the House, it only 
               <br />
               carried out a portion of the same great scheme 
               <br />
               of Union. He hoped hon. gentlemen from all 
               <br />

               Hon. Mr. Galt was strongly in favour of 
               <br />
               continuing the work of Union and consolida- 
               <br />
               tion so happily begun on this continent. The 
               <br />
               present terms offered by Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               should, he urged, be accepted, as they were 
               <br />
               substantially those adopted by the Quebec 
               <br />
               Conference, and subsequently by the Parlia- 
               <br />
               ments of Canada, and New Brunswick, and 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia, and they were terms not un- 
               <br />
               reasonable or unjust in any respect whatever.

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">He</span> took issue with the member for West Dur- 
               <br />
               ham in his proposition that the land ought to 
               <br />
               be in the hands of the Local Governments. He 
               <br />
               believed the public domain ought to be under 
               <br />
               the control of the Dominion. It ought to be at 
               <br />
               the disposal of the only Legislature which 
               <br />
               could have a uniform policy on emigration 
               <br />
               and settlement. The hon. gentleman argued, 
               <br />
               too, that if the mineral lands were placed at 
               <br />
               the disposal of the Dominion they would en- 
               <br />
               deavour to extract from them their $150,000 a 
               <br />
               year, and the industry of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               would be depressed. Precisely the contrary re- 
               <br />
               sult would in his (Mr. Galt’s) opinion follow. 
               <br />
               If the lands were left in the hands of the 
               <br />
               Local Government they had to depend on 
               <br />
               them for the means of local administration. It 
               <br />
               was clear that no liberal policy would be in 
               <br />
               their power, whereas it would be in the power 
               <br />
