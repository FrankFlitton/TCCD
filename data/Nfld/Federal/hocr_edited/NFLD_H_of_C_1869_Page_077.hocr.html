               Sir John A. Macdonald then argued there 
               <br />
               was the consideration of national policy. New- 
               <br />
               foundland possessed the key to our front door. 
               <br />
               It might be considered chimerical, but he be- 
               <br />
               lieved there was something in the report of 
               <br />
               Mr. Sandford Fleming in reference to the 
               <br />
               shortest highway between this continent and 
               <br />
               Europe. He believed that the time would 
               <br />
               come, in our day, when the route across New- 
               <br />
               foundland would become the great highway of 
               <br />
               passenger traffic. He would repeat that if his 
               <br />
               hon. friend really wished, as he professed, to 
               <br />
               give the Crown lands to Newfoundland, and 
               <br />
               also the $150,000, then he should move a dis- 
               <br />
               tinct resolution to that effect. The only effect 
               <br />
               of his present amendment was to disturb the 
               <br />
               basis of the entire arrangement, and probably 
               <br />
               postpone the admission of Newfoundland into

               the Dominion for an indefinite period.
