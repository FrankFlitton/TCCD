            <p> Mr. Gibbs said he had no hesitation in <lb/>
giving the vote he had done the other day, <lb/>
but the remarks of the honourable member <lb/>
were rather ungracious, coming from a gen<lb break="no"/>tleman who introduced his last resolution <lb/>
well knowing, from the fate of the ﬁrst, that <lb/>
the information asked for would not be <lb/>
granted, and who, because he could not get <lb/>
all, would take none. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Mr. Mackenzie said that the motion moved <lb/>
by the honourable member for
Chateauguay, <lb/>
to which allusion had been made, was one <lb/>
suggested by the member of South Lennox, <lb/>
and spoken favourably of by the members for <lb/>
Renfrew and South Ontario. One of these <lb/>
gentlemen having suggested the motion to the <lb/>
member for Chateauguay with whom they <lb/>
had been in accord in bank sentiments, noth<lb break="no"/>ing was more natural than that honourable <lb/>
gentleman should make the motion, and he <lb/>
(Mr. Mackenzie) confessed, however, that he <lb/>
was never more astonished in his life than to <lb/>
see one member after another member stand <lb/>
up and vote against this very motion. (Hear <lb/>
and laughter). <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Mr. Cartwright was free to acknowledge he
<lb/>
did suggest the motion, but he bowed to the <lb/>
judgment of the Minister of Justice in the <lb/>
matter, who had desired that compliance with <lb/>
the resolution would be adverse to the public <lb/>
interest. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Mr. Mackenzie said that not a single mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the Ministry said the motion of the <lb/>
member for Chateauguay was adverse to the <lb/>
public interest. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Hon. Mr. Galt protested against its being
<lb/>
taken for granted that the Government were <lb/>
at a great disadvantage in consequence of <lb/>
their arrangement with the Bank of Mont<lb break="no"/>real. He wished to bear his testimony to the <lb/>
fair dealing of that institution towards the <lb/>
Government. In circumstances of very con<lb break="no"/>siderable ﬁnancial difﬁculty the Government <lb/>
had received assistance from the Bank of <lb/>
Montreal, the absence of which would per<lb break="no"/>haps have proved exceedingly embarrassing to <lb/>
the Ministry of the day. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> At six o’clock the House rose.<lb/>
After the recess.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Hon. Mr. Rose having obtained leave to <lb/>
speak, said he did not decide to allow the <lb/>
statement of the member for Chateauguay to <lb/>
pass unchallenged. Now, he would state once <lb/>
for all, that the Government desired to give <lb/>
the fullest information of all the transactions <lb/>
       
         <cb/>  
            
          they had with their ﬁscal agents. There
was <lb/>
nothing whatever in these the Government <lb/>
need to be afraid of. All these transactions <lb/>
had been solely dictated and carried on with <lb/>
an eye to the public interest. No information <lb/>
which the House or country has a right to <lb/>
expect would be withheld. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Hon. Mr. Holton hoped, as every informa<lb break="no"/>tion was to be given, that the correspondence <lb/>
on this subject, which he had asked for, <lb/>
would be forthcoming. He had no hesitation <lb/>
in saying that at one time when he was in the <lb/>
Administration, the Bank of Montreal was a <lb/>
useful public servant—now it would become <lb/>
master.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Hon. John S. Macdonald said the statement
<lb/>
of the member for Chateauguay regarding <lb/>
the Bank of Montreal was not warranted. He <lb/>
protested against this continued harping <lb/>
against the Bank of Montreal. The fact was <lb/>
that the bank was patronized by the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment because it had helped them cheerful<lb break="no"/>ly and materially in times of need, and was <lb/>
besides by far the best managed institution of <lb/>
that time in the Dominion. Let the member <lb/>
for Chateauguay attack the Government and <lb/>
let the servant of the Government alone. It <lb/>
was unfair to attack the Bank of Montreal <lb/>
when the gentlemen of the Treasury Benches <lb/>
were the really responsible parties. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Dr. Parker thought that even though there
<lb/>
was nothing to conceal, as the Minister of <lb/>
Finance stated, still his continued mystery on <lb/>
the subject would excite suspicion in the <lb/>
country. He would prefer that the whole <lb/>
information should be given. <lb/>
            </p>


            <p> The motion was carried. <lb/>
