     <persName ref="pers:DORI2">Mr. Frederic Dorion</persName> (Charlevoix-Sague<lb break="no"/>nay): Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of 
     <lb/>
     privilege. I am one of two counsel for Count 
     <lb/>
     de Bernonville, a citizen of France who is 
     <lb/>
     before the court contesting an order for 
     <lb/>
     deportation. It is for this reason that I 
     <lb/>
     strongly resent the untrue and unfounded 
     <lb/>
     statement made yesterday by the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Winnipeg North (Mr. Stewart), when 
     <lb/>
     the orders of the day were called. He said:

     based on authentic and true documents which

     <emph>APPROVAL OF TERMS OF UNION WITH CANADA</emph> 
</p>
           
   
            <p>
     The house resumed from Tuesday, Febru<lb break="no"/>ary 8, consideration in committee of Bill No. 
     <lb/>
     11, to approve the terms of union of New<lb break="no"/>foundland with Canada—Mr. St. Laurent— 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Golding in the chair. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     On section 22—<hi rendition="simple:italic">Fisheries</hi>. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Right Hon. L. S. St. Laurent</persName> (Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister): Mr. Chairman, before proceeding fur<lb break="no"/>ther with this section may I make a brief 
     <lb/>
     statement. The information I gave the com<lb break="no"/>mittee last night about the recommendation 
     <lb/>
     I had received as to the distribution of posts 
     <lb/>
     of senators for the island of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     has created some uneasiness there. I said it 
     <lb/>
     had been represented to us that there were 
     <lb/>
     three main groups of the population, divided 
     <lb/>
     according to religious denominations among 
     <lb/>
     Anglican, Roman Catholic and adherents of 
     <lb/>
     the United church. That has been taken to 
     <lb/>
     mean that it would exclude the possibility of 
     <lb/>
     anyone not belonging to those three denom<lb break="no"/>inations being considered for a Senate 
     <lb/>
     appointment. That is not at all what I meant, 
     <lb/>
     nor was it the real meaning of the recom<lb break="no"/>mendation made to us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The recommendation made was that there 
     <lb/>
     were these three groups, namely the Angli<lb break="no"/>cans, the Roman Catholics, the members of the 
     <lb/>
     United church and adherents of other denom<lb break="no"/>inations not forming part of the United church. 
     <lb/>
     The high commissioner reported that my 
     <lb/>
     statement might create a false impression and 
     <lb/>
     I feel it is desirable to have any false 
     <lb/>
     impression corrected. So I wish to say that 
     <lb/>
     those recommendations did comprise in the 
     <lb/>
     group described as the United church group 
     <lb/>
     the adherents of the United church, and mem<lb break="no"/>bers of other denominations being neither 
     <lb/>
     Anglican nor Roman Catholic, and that would 
     <lb/>
     include Presbyterians, adherents of the Salva<lb break="no"/>tion Army and other denominations.

     <lb/>
     few Baptists there, but that they have not yet

     <lb/>
     information given to me was that there were 
     <lb/>
     Anglicans, Roman Catholics, and others, most 
     <lb/>
     of whom belonged to the United church. But 


            <cb/>
     

     it was not intended that anyone would be 
     <lb/>
     excluded from consideration because of his 
     <lb/>
     religious views.

     reach the point when the House of Commons 
     <lb/>
     would discuss appointments to the other place, 
     <lb/>
     or anywhere else, on sectarian grounds. How<lb break="no"/>ever, that is not the point I had in mind when 
     <lb/>
     rising. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We are dealing with section 22 of Bill No. 
     <lb/>
     11, dealing with fisheries. I consider the sub<lb break="no"/>ject matter now under discussion one of great 
     <lb/>
     importance to the whole fishing industry of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, because the provisions of this bill 
     <lb/>
     could affect that industry in the wrong way. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It seems to me that at this time it would be 
     <lb/>
     necessary for the Minister of Fisheries to give 
     <lb/>
     us a comprehensive statement about the 
     <lb/>
     whole industry. For example, according to a 
     <lb/>
     press dispatch it was stated that a fisheries 
     <lb/>
     treaty was to be signed within a few days. 
     <lb/>
     That procedure took place in the United 
     <lb/>
     States. I understand eleven countries were 
     <lb/>
     represented, that Canada and Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     are part of the set-up, and that this particular 
     <lb/>
     treaty deals with research. We are acting 
     <lb/>
     together in that field. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In Quebec and the maritime provinces fish<lb break="no"/>ing can be considered as one of the basic 
     <lb/>
     industries. I notice that section 22(2) states: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Subject to this term, all fisheries laws and all 
     <lb/>
     orders, rules, and regulations made thereunder shall 
     <lb/>
     continue in force in the province of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     as if the union had not been made, for a period of 
     <lb/>
     five years from the date of union and thereafter 
     <lb/>
     until the parliament of Canada otherwise provides, 
     <lb/>
     and shall continue to be administered by the New<lb break="no"/>foundland fisheries board; and the costs involved 
     <lb/>
     in the maintenance of the board and the administra<lb break="no"/>tion of the fisheries laws shall be borne by the 
     <lb/>
     government of Canada.

            <p>
     While I am not sure of the accuracy of my 
     <lb/>
     information, I am informed that the fisheries 
     <lb/>
     board which regulates marketing in New<lb break="no"/>foundland is representative of the fish dealers 
     <lb/>
     only, and that the industry is not represented 
     <lb/>
     thereon. I am further advised that the com<lb break="no"/>mission of government as such has no repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives on the board. If that kind of 
     <lb/>
     marketing arrangement is to continue for 
     <lb/>
     five years in Newfoundland, I think it is 
     <lb/>
     wrong. If my information is incorrect, I 
     <lb/>
     would ask the minister to give the correct 
     <lb/>
     information. If what I say is the fact, then 
     <lb/>
     surely this section should be rewritten. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     My greatest concern, and the point about 
     <lb/>
     which I wish to be most specific, is the bounty 
     <lb/>
     now paid maritime fishermen. This is a fixed 
     <lb/>
     amount. If Newfoundland is now to be in— 
     <lb/>
     cluded in the bounty arrangement—and it 
     <lb/>
     would seem that it is—the result would be a 
     <lb/>
     reduction in the amount of money paid to 
  

            <pb n="395" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-02-09_Page_0395.jpg"/>

     Quebec and maritime fishermen. Surely it is 
     <lb/>
     time the Fisheries Act was amended to pre<lb break="no"/>clude any such results. For the benefit of 
     <lb/>
     members of the house, and fishermen gener<lb break="no"/>ally, I believe an explanation as to the way 
     <lb/>
     the bounty was established might be in order. 
     <lb/>
     I am aware that most fishermen know very 
     <lb/>
     little about it and I confess that I did not 
     <lb/>
     myself until a few days ago. I am indebted 
     <lb/>
     to the Department of Fisheries for the in<lb break="no"/>formation that I have received and I think it 
     <lb/>
     should be a matter of record. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This bounty to the fishermen is known as 
     <lb/>
     the Halifax award. It was established by 
     <lb/>
     the treaty of Washington which was entered 
     <lb/>
     into in 1871 between the United Kingdom 
     <lb/>
     and the United States. Under that treaty 
     <lb/>
     United States fishermen were permitted to 
     <lb/>
     take fish off the coast of the maritime prov<lb break="no"/>inces, Quebec and Newfoundland for a cer<lb break="no"/>tain term of years. For that privilege the 
     <lb/>
     United States paid $5,500,000 to the British 
     <lb/>
     government. The British government then 
     <lb/>
     paid $1 million of the award to Newfound<lb break="no"/>land and $4,500,000 to Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The Canadian payment was placed in the 
     <lb/>
     consolidated revenue fund and after $500,000 
     <lb/>
     had been deducted as expenses the net 
     <lb/>
     amount of $4 million was recognized as the 
     <lb/>
     payment received by Canada for the grant of 
     <lb/>
     these fisheries concessions. In 1882 parlia<lb break="no"/>ment made provision for an annual grant of 
     <lb/>
     $150,000 for the purposes noted in the act, 
     <lb/>
     and that sum was later raised to $160,000. 
     <lb/>
     It is from this grant that the annual fishing 
     <lb/>
     bounties have since been paid. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     That summary is taken from the report of 
     <lb/>
     the royal commission on fisheries which sat 
     <lb/>
     in 1927, which report goes on to say: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     From the House of Commons debates of 1882 when 
     <lb/>
     the resolution upon which was founded the legisla<lb break="no"/>tion of 1882 was passed, it is plain that this annual 
     <lb/>
     grant was regarded as the interest upon the amount 
     <lb/>
     of the Halifax Award.

            <p>
     As I said in the beginning, the amount of 
     <lb/>
     money available for the purposes of paying 
     <lb/>
     this annual bounty is now $160,000. Fishing 
     <lb/>
     is the largest single industry in Newfound<lb break="no"/>land, and if under this agreement all the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland fishermen are to be eligible 
     <lb/>
     for payments under that grant, and if no 
     <lb/>
     additional money is to be disbursed, it will 
     <lb/>
     mean that the grants to Quebec and the 
     <lb/>
     maritime fishermen will be cut down. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I suggest that our Fisheries Act should be 
     <lb/>
     amended in order that the amount of the 
     <lb/>
     grant may be increased so that grants now 
     <lb/>
     paid would not be cut down because of the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland fishermen coming under the 
     <lb/>
     provisions. I should like to ask the minister 
     <lb/>
     if the governor in council have not the 
     <lb/>
     necessary power under the regulations to 
     

<cb/>

increase this amount. The regulations are to 
     <lb/>be found in P.C. 5366 of 1947, section 14 of 
     <lb/>which reads: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>

            <p>
     I am making these remarks in order to get 
     <lb/>
     a definite and specific answer from the minis<lb break="no"/>ter. The fishing industry is very important 
     <lb/>
     to the whole of Canada and at the present 
     <lb/>
     time it is facing many difficulties. If we are 
     <lb/>
     to bring in another large group of fishermen 
     <lb/>
     then I think it is time the Canadian govern<lb break="no"/>ment began to pay more attention to this 
     <lb/>
     industry than has been paid in the past. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I want to give some credit to the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Fisheries. He comes from the west coast 
     <lb/>
     and when he took office he had not had very 
     <lb/>
     much experience. Immediately after being 
     <lb/>
     appointed he took his duties quite seriously 
     <lb/>
     and made a trip across Canada and today I 
     <lb/>
     think he knows a great deal about the indus<lb break="no"/>try. I hope the cabinet will have just as 
     <lb/>
     serious views in connection with this basic 
     <lb/>
     industry as has the minister. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     As in practically every industry, a fight 
     <lb/>
     is going on now in the fishing industry. It 
     <lb/>
     has reached the stage where mechanization 
     <lb/>
     is the order of the day. A struggle is going 
     <lb/>
     on between the shore fishermen and the 
     <lb/>
     trawlers which will have to be settled. I 
     <lb/>
     think it is the obligation of the government. 
     <lb/>
     to view that particular angle very closely. 
     <lb/>
     The fishermen claim that the trawlers are 
     <lb/>
     depleting and destroying the industry. That 
     <lb/>
     is the assertion that has been made to me 
     <lb/>
     and if it is true it is the responsibility of 
     <lb/>
     the government to see that the industry is 
     <lb/>
     not destroyed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The best methods will have to be found 
     <lb/>
     to perpetuate this industry because it is an 
     <lb/>
     important food industry and deserving of 
     <lb/>
     much more consideration than it has had in 
     <lb/>
     the past. With the bringing in of another 
     <lb/>
     large group of fishermen, with the fight that 
     <lb/>
     is going on between owners and fish dealers 
     <lb/>
     and those engaged in the industry, I think 
     <lb/>
     the time is ripe for a thorough examination 
     <lb/>
     of the whole question. I should like the minis<lb break="no"/>ter to answer the questions I have posed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MAYH1">Mr. Mayhew</persName>: Mr. Chairman, I shall not at 
     <lb/>
     this time attempt to answer the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Cape Breton South, but I shall start out 
     <lb/>
     by answering the question that was put to me 
     <lb/>
     last night by the hon. member for Winnipeg 
     <lb/>
     North Centre. I am pleased indeed to have 
     <lb/>
     an opportunity to speak briefly about the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland fisheries. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As all hon. members well know, the fishing 
     <lb/>
     industry is the oldest industry on the island.

important industry. lt is the most important, 
     <lb/>not necessarily because of the annual dollar 
     <lb/>value of its products but because of the 
     <lb/>number of people engaged in it directly and 
     <lb/>indirectly and because of the unique way in 
     <lb/>which it has affected the whole economy of 
     <lb/>Newfoundland and even the character of the 
     <lb/>Newfoundland people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The hon. member for Winnipeg North 
     <lb/>
     Centre was quite right when he suggested 
     <lb/>
     that we in Canada might profit from the 
     <lb/>
     knowledge and experience of the Newfound<lb break="no"/>land fishing industry. To my mind, we stand 
     <lb/>
     to gain a great deal by coming into associa<lb break="no"/>tion with Newfoundland fishermen, shore 
     <lb/>
     workers and management in that industry. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I should like to pay a tribute to these 
     <lb/>
     magnificent people of Newfoundland. The 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland fishermen come from a hardy 
     <lb/>
     race of men and by their courage and 
     <lb/>
     resourcefulness they have built up a long and 
     <lb/>
     honourable tradition of life on the sea. From 
     <lb/>
     generation to generation they have faced with<lb break="no"/>out question the challenge and the hazards 
     <lb/>
     of the sea; they have gone out in very small 
     <lb/>
     boats and battled the elements; they plied 
     <lb/>
     their perilous trade long before the advent 
     <lb/>
     of steam and other modern improvements and 
     <lb/>
     safeguards. In spite of the many obstacles 
     <lb/>
     they have had to overcome—and have over<lb break="no"/>come—they have forced their way into the 
     <lb/>
     markets of the world. They have succeeded, 
     <lb/>
     not only because of their initiative and cour<lb break="no"/>age but also because of their skill in the 
     <lb/>
     methods of processing and because of their 
     <lb/>
     attention to the quality of their products. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     A comparison of the history of Ontario and 
     <lb/>
     Quebec and the history of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     would perhaps emphasize the contribution 
     <lb/>
     that fisheries has made to the heritage of the 
     <lb/>
     island. Here in the interior of Canada our 
     <lb/>
     forefathers cut down the forests, plowed and 
     <lb/>
     cultivated the land and reaped the harvests. 
     <lb/>
     Farming became the very backbone of our 
     <lb/>
     economy and was the determining factor in 
     <lb/>
     our social evolution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Exactly the same thing occurred in New<lb break="no"/>foundland, except that the sea took the place 
     <lb/>
     of the land. The harvests of the sea formed 
     <lb/>
     the substance of life for Newfoundlanders, 
     <lb/>
     and the life of the sea has left its impact on 
     <lb/>
     the character and the economy of the people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The fishing industry is the one industry 
     <lb/>
     that has held Newfoundland together over the 
     <lb/>
     years. The sturdy fishermen have provided 
     <lb/>
     the island with the first line of defence from 
     <lb/>
     the very beginning. They are the real New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders, and will make real Canadians. 
     <lb/>
     We should be proud to welcome these fellow 
     <lb/>
     Canadians.

     I should like to quote, if I may, from a 
     <lb/>
     recent book entitled "Newfoundland", edited

     by Dr. R. A. MacKay. Dr. MacKay is well

     At least as early as the sixteenth century annual 
     <lb/>
     fishing voyages began from western Europe, the 
     <lb/>
     banks becoming as well known to the fishermen of 
     <lb/>
     the west of England, of Spain and Portugal, 
     <lb/>
     of Brittany and Normandy, as the Caribbean was to 
     <lb/>
     the fighting men of Spain. Proximity to the fisheries 
     <lb/>
     ultimately induced permanent settlement in New<lb break="no"/>foundland, and determined its distribution about the 
     <lb/>
     coasts. The annual fishing voyages ceased with the 
     <lb/>
     Napoleonic wars, and the English fishing industry 
     <lb/>
     became resident on the island. The local economy 
     <lb/>
     which developed was pre-eminently a fishing eco<lb break="no"/>nomy. A merchant class concerned with the export 
     <lb/>
     of the fish and the import and distribution of sup<lb break="no"/>plies was established on the island, particularly 
     <lb/>
     about St. John's, which early became the commercial 
     <lb/>
     capital. The whole business life of the island devel<lb break="no"/>oped around the fishery. Retail merchants branched 
     <lb/>
     out to become wholesalers as well as retailers, im<lb break="no"/>porters and exporters. insurance brokers and ship 
     <lb/>
     owners. bankers, and in more recent times manufac<lb break="no"/>turers. Although conditions have changed greatly 
     <lb/>
     within the past half century, the stamp of the fish<lb break="no"/>ing industry still marks the economic and social 
     <lb/>
     life of the island.

            <p>
     For four centuries, up to 1900, the fishery 
     <lb/>
     was the only industry in Newfoundland of 
     <lb/>
     any real significance. In the period 1901 to 
     <lb/>
     1905 the value of fishery exports amounted to 
     <lb/>
     just over $8 million out of total exports of 
     <lb/>
     $9-6 million. Later the pulp and paper 
     <lb/>
     industry, and mining, exceeded fishing in the 
     <lb/>
     value of exports; but as I intimated before, 
     <lb/>
     from the standpoint of the number of people 
     <lb/>
     engaged in the three industries, the number 
     <lb/>
     in fisheries has remained in first place. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The fishery of Newfoundland has always 
     <lb/>
     centred primarily around the dried-codfish 
     <lb/>
     trade. Generally speaking, "fish" to New<lb break="no"/>foundlanders means "cod". Recently there 
     <lb/>
     has been a development in the fresh and 
     <lb/>
     frozen trade. This branch of the industry, 
     <lb/>
     however, has tended to supplement rather 
     <lb/>
     than to supplant the salted fish production. In 
     <lb/>
     addition, Newfoundland has important lob<lb break="no"/>ster, herring, seal, and whale fisheries. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is a wide range in the types of dried 
     <lb/>
     salted fish produced, and in the requirements 
     <lb/>
     of the various foreign markets. Newfound<lb break="no"/>land ships fish to many markets in Europe 
     <lb/>
     and in the western hemisphere. The Medi<lb break="no"/>terranean markets of Portugal, Spain, Italy 
     <lb/>
     and Greece have long been the principal 
     <lb/>
     markets for Newfoundland codfish. Substan<lb break="no"/>tial quantities are also sold in such markets 
     <lb/>
     as Brazil, the British West Indies, and other 
     <lb/>
     Caribbean countries. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Dried codfish is essentially a cheap source 
     <lb/>
     of the protein used in semi-tropical countries, 
     <lb/>
     and its keeping qualities give it a decided pre<lb break="no"/>ference over other protein foods. The fact 
     <lb/>
     that markets for dried codfish are, for the 
     <lb/>
     most part, in countries in which a large part 
     <lb/>
     of the population exists on a very low

     standard of living, renders the industry 
     <lb/>
     somewhat susceptible to world economic 
     <lb/>
     conditions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The development of the fishing industry in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland has not been one of continu<lb break="no"/>ous progress. Over the four centuries of its 
     <lb/>
     history there have been many ups and downs, 
     <lb/>
     and a number of remedies have been applied 
     <lb/>
     to bring about recovery. When the world 
     <lb/>
     economic depression struck in the early thir<lb break="no"/>ties, the economy of Newfoundland was 
     <lb/>
     unable to cope with the pressure exerted on 
     <lb/>
     it by falling markets for its principal export 
     <lb/>
     economy. In the period of 1926 to 1930 the 
     <lb/>
     codfishery yielded close to $13 million annually 
     <lb/>
     in value of exports, but from 1931 to 1935 the 
     <lb/>
     average was cut approximately in half to 
     <lb/>
     $6.4 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the face of these conditions, in 1936 the 
     <lb/>
     commission of government established the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland fisheries board, and endowed it 
     <lb/>
     with wide powers over the production and 
     <lb/>
     marketing of salted codfish. This was a 
     <lb/>
     drastic change in tactics made necessary by 
     <lb/>
     drastic economic conditions. The board was 
     <lb/>
     given authority not usually vested in such an 
     <lb/>
     organization in a democratic country; but as 
     <lb/>
     I have said, the desperate plight of the fishing 
     <lb/>
     industry made such a step imperative. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     As world conditions improved, the fishing 
     <lb/>
     industry, and indeed the whole economy of 
     <lb/>
     the island, began a slow recovery. The value 
     <lb/>
     of exports of fishery products, which stood at 
     <lb/>
     $6.9 million in 1937, rose to $8.1 million in 
     <lb/>
     1940, and then rose sharply throughout the 
     <lb/>
     war to a peak of $33.8 million in 1946. In 
     <lb/>
     1947 the Newfoundland association of fish 
     <lb/>
     exporters, NAFEL, was formed by the board. 
     <lb/>
     All exports from the island are now controlled 
     <lb/>
     by this association. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This has been but a brief survey, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, of the Newfoundland fisheries. I am 
     <lb/>
     sure you would not expect more from me 
     <lb/>
     at the present time, although it would be 
     <lb/>
     very profitable to anyone to read the many 
     <lb/>
     books and articles that can be found in the 
     <lb/>
     library.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Before answering the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Cape Breton South (Mr. Gillis), I should like 
     <lb/>
     for a minute to give a brief outline of the 
     <lb/>
     method by which the fisheries committee 
     <lb/>
     proceeded with its part of the program of 
     <lb/>
     bringing about union. It was felt that any 
     <lb/>
     time you tackled the fishing industry you 
     <lb/>
     were tackling a very live nerve centre in the 
     <lb/>
     whole economy of both countries. Therefore 
     <lb/>
     it had to be dealt with in a spirit of good will 
     <lb/>
     on both sides. When the committee was set 
     <lb/>
     up, I asked them to come to my ofiice. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Walsh was the chairman of that committee. 
     <lb/>
     He and his associates visited the office, and 
     <lb/>
     with the departmental officials we sat down 
     <lb/>
     to consider the problems before us. Before 
   

            <cb/>
 
proceeding I suggested to him that we would 
     <lb/>not consider them in the manner of horse 
     <lb/>traders. I said that I realized they were 
     <lb/>here to do a job—to negotiate—a job which 
     <lb/>they would want to live with, not only in 
     <lb/>the immediate future, but for years to come. 
     <lb/>I asked them to look upon us in the same 
     <lb/>way. I assure you that this was the spirit 
     <lb/>in which we approached the whole problem. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     At the beginning I suggested to them that 
     <lb/>
     we all knew, facing each other as we did, 
     <lb/>
     that there was one problem about which 
     <lb/>
     there would be some difficulty, and that was 
     <lb/>
     the fisheries board and NAFEL. At that time 
     <lb/>
     I intimated to them I had had some experi<lb break="no"/>ence in the splitting of wood, and had found 
     <lb/>
     it was very desirable to put a wedge in at 
     <lb/>
     the knot to open it up, and that the rest of 
     <lb/>
     the block would then fall apart in an easy 
     <lb/>
     and fairly reasonable way. That is exactly 
     <lb/>
     what we did. We started immediately to 
     <lb/>
     discuss the things that we knew were going 
     <lb/>
     to be hurdles, and somewhat difficult to get 
     <lb/>
     over. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     After spending two or three hours in 
     <lb/>
     exchanging views on this matter, we pro<lb break="no"/>ceeded by way of memorandum. We were 
     <lb/>
     given a list of questions which the delegates 
     <lb/>
     wanted us to answer. We answered these 
     <lb/>
     questions and then discussed our answers in 
     <lb/>
     another meeting. After various meetings, by 
     <lb/>
     a process of elimination, we finally reached 
     <lb/>
     a list of understandings which will be found 
     <lb/>
     in this pamphlet. I believe all hon. members 
     <lb/>
     have a copy of the pamphlet, and they will 
     <lb/>
     find the questions on page 8. These were the 
     <lb/>
     questions this committee was finally able to 
     <lb/>
     submit to a committee of the cabinet and of 
     <lb/>
     which we were finally able to get approval. 
     <lb/>
     These questions then found their way into 
     <lb/>
     the pamphlet which we have before us. I 
     <lb/>
     want to show that never at any time were 
     <lb/>
     there any harsh words. At all times the mat<lb break="no"/>ter was viewed in a reasonable and business<lb break="no"/>like way and we are very pleased with the 
     <lb/>
     results. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Some of the questions which were asked 
     <lb/>
     this afternoon have to do primarily with our 
     <lb/>
     own position, and the fight between trawlers 
     <lb/>
     and shore fishermen. I think those questions 
     <lb/>
     can quite easily be left to be dealt with when 
     <lb/>
     our estimates are under discussion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     A question was raised about the fisheries 
     <lb/>
     board. The fisheries board was set up in 
     <lb/>
     1936 by the commission. It is composed of a 
     <lb/>
     chairman and two members. This board has 
     <lb/>
     fairly wide powers, I will grant you. In 
     <lb/>
     1947 a company was set up known as NAFEL, 
     <lb/>
     which is an exporting company. 
     <lb/>

getting all the privileges that were originally 
     <lb/>given the company. We agreed to let them 
     <lb/>retain the export market for salt fish only, 
     <lb/>which will amount to about $14 or $15 mil<lb break="no"/>lion 3 year, depending of course on market 
     <lb/>conditions. NAFEL has nothing to do with 
     <lb/>the rest of the fishing industry. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     From the various departments we are tak<lb break="no"/>ing over the freezing facilities, the inspection 
     <lb/>
     service and the research department, incor<lb break="no"/>porating these into the federal system of fish 
     <lb/>
     management. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I believe I have answered all the questions 
     <lb/>
     except the one concerning the bounty. Please 
     <lb/>
     do not ask me to give the dates in connection 
     <lb/>
     with this question, because I do not remem<lb break="no"/>ber them. In substance, however, the New<lb break="no"/>foundland people received a million dollars as 
     <lb/>
     their share of the bounty; that was considered 
     <lb/>
     as their reward. The matter of sharing the 
     <lb/>
     $160,000 a year with the fishermen of New<lb break="no"/>foundland was not discussed during the con<lb break="no"/>ference. It will be divided therefore, as it 
     <lb/>
     always has been divided, between the mari<lb break="no"/>time fishermen.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GILL2">Mr. Gillis</persName>: Am I to understand, then, that

     this $160,000 which I understand is interest on

     be of strategic, economic and social advan<lb break="no"/>tage to both Newfoundland and Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Dealing specifically with fisheries, I know 
     <lb/>
     the union will prove to be mutually beneficial. 
     <lb/>
     True, the salt fish industry in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     is going to be, so to speak, on its own, to a 
     <lb/>
     certain extent for five years, but that is 
     <lb/>
     quite understandable. It takes a certain 
     <lb/>
     amount of time to adjust these things. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There has been an historical association 
     <lb/>
     between the fishermen of Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     the fishermen of our great province of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia. Many of the Newfoundland fishermen 
     <lb/>
     have fished out of Nova Scotia's ports, and 
     <lb/>
     particularly out of the home port of the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Reconstruction and Supply, 
     <lb/>
     Lunenburg. These men are well known to 
     <lb/>
     us all. There is one point I should like to 
     <lb/>
     mention and that is that, as a result of 
     <lb/>
     Canada and Newfoundland coming together, 
     <lb/>
     the hand of the Minister of Fisheries will be 


            <cb/>
          

     strengthened. We all realize the fine job he 
     <lb/>
     is doing. I think this union will help him 
     <lb/>
     because it is going to make the fishing indus<lb break="no"/>try a very large industry. Few people realize 
     <lb/>
     it is an industry that brings in a large volume 
     <lb/>
     of United States dollars. It is an industry 
     <lb/>
     that is growing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Louisburg project is one example of 
     <lb/>
     the co-operation between the federal gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and Nova Scotia on behalf of the 
     <lb/>
     industry. With Newfoundland becoming a 
     <lb/>
     tenth province of Canada, we may some day 
     <lb/>
     be able to establish a continental shelf, which 
     <lb/>
     I think is of the utmost importance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I bring up my perennial story. The 
     <lb/>
     stronger the claims of the fishermen become, 
     <lb/>
     and the claims of seafaring people in general, 
     <lb/>
     the greater the opportunity of having some 
     <lb/>
     sort of coastguard system, perhaps not 
     <lb/>
     exactly the same as the one the United States 
     <lb/>
     set up. I believe this union will help 
     <lb/>
     strengthen our request for such a system. 
     <lb/>
     There may be some difficulties during the 
     <lb/>
     period of transition but I am sure, taking the 
     <lb/>
     long-range view, this union will prove to be 
     <lb/>
     beneficial to Canada, Newfoundland and the 
     <lb/>
     maritime provinces in particular. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ARCH4">Mr. Archibald</persName>: I should like to ask the 
     <lb/>
     minister about this Newfoundland associa<lb break="no"/>tion which has control over the export of 
     <lb/>
     fish. If an individual desired to set up a 
     <lb/>
     business for the export of fish, would he have 
     <lb/>
     to pay a fee of $10,000 in order to belong 
     <lb/>
     to that association? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MAYH1">Mr. Mayhew</persName>: My understanding is, and I 
     <lb/>
     think I am right, that the regular fee for 
     <lb/>
     joining NAFEL is $10,000. Four or five men 
     <lb/>
     may get together and take out one member<lb break="no"/>ship. A person who has fish to export may 
     <lb/>
     ask a member of the association, and there 
     <lb/>
     are in all some 43 members in NAFEL, to sell 
     <lb/>
     his fish for him. It will be sold for a 
     <lb/>
     commission of from 3 to 5 per cent.   
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KNOW1">Mr. Knowles</persName>: I want to thank the minister 
     <lb/>
     for the trouble he has taken in replying at 
     <lb/>
     length to the question I asked last night. 
     <lb/>
     This is a subject in which the people con<lb break="no"/>cerned are keenly interested. Some hon. 
     <lb/>
     members may wonder why I should be 
     <lb/>
     interested in the subject, since I come from 
     <lb/>
     the centre of the continent. I suppose it is 
     <lb/>
     partly due to the fact that, as a child, I was 
     <lb/>
     brought up on stories of my Nova Scotian 
     <lb/>
     ancestors who had gone fishing on the grand 
     <lb/>
     banks. I dared to hope when I asked the 
     <lb/>
     question last night that the permission to 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland to retain their present set-up, 
     <lb/>
     at least in part, for five years, was a conces<lb break="no"/>sion to the fishermen themselves, the men 
     <lb/>
     who actually do the work. But after listen<lb break="no"/>ing to the minister's description of the set-up 
     <lb/>
     today, particularly in view of his answer to 


            <pb n="399" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-02-09_Page_0399.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">FEBRUARY 9, 1949</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">Newfoundland</hi></fw>  <fw type="num">399</fw> 
 

     the question just put to him by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Skeena, it looks to me as though 
     <lb/>
     it is the old story: it is a concession not to 
     <lb/>
     the men who do the work but to a privileged 
     <lb/>
     few. In the beginning the set-up sounded 
     <lb/>
     good, in that the marketing and export of 
     <lb/>
     fish were under the direction and control of 
     <lb/>
     a state fisheries board. Had it stopped there, 
     <lb/>
     one might have said "hear, hear." But, lo 
     <lb/>
     and behold! that board seems to have turned 
     <lb/>
     over all its rights and privileges to a fishing 
     <lb/>
     association, which is a fairly select group, if 
     <lb/>
     it is true that there is a fee of $10,000. If that 
     <lb/>
     is the situation, I hope that the department 
     <lb/>
     will get out of it any advantages there are. 
     <lb/>
     But I also hope that, in the interests of the 
     <lb/>
     men who do the work, modifications of this 
     <lb/>
     set-up will be made as quickly as possible. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ARCH4">Mr. Archibald</persName>: Can that fishing association 
     <lb/>
     do what the fisheries council of Canada did 
     <lb/>
     with the west coast co-operatives, namely, 
     <lb/>
     turn down on political grounds an application 
     <lb/>
     for membership? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MAYH1">Mr. Mayhew</persName>: I do not think I should be 
     <lb/>
     expected to answer that question. There 
     <lb/>
     seems to be in the minds of a few of the 
     <lb/>
     members an impression about which I think 
     <lb/>
     I should say something, and it will take me 
     <lb/>
     only a minute or two. They seem to think 
     <lb/>
     that the coming in of Newfoundland and the 
     <lb/>
     bringing in of another $30 million or $35 
     <lb/>
     million of business will in some way affect 
     <lb/>
     the industry in the maritime provinces. As 
     <lb/>
     a matter of fact, there will be no more fish 
     <lb/>
     for sale by reason of Newfoundland coming 
     <lb/>
     in than there would be if she stayed out. 
     <lb/>
     Both countries will be doing business in the 
     <lb/>
     same markets. I believe one will strengthen 
     <lb/>
     the other in looking for markets, and that 
     <lb/>
     both will be able to go after business together 
     <lb/>
     in a better way than would be possible 
     <lb/>
     separately. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GIBS2">Mr. Gibson</persName> (Comox-Alberni): In the event 
     <lb/>
     of a maritime fisherman finding it to his 
     <lb/>
     advantage to take his fish to Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     would he be entitled to sell his fish through 
     <lb/>
     NAFEL? Or conversely, would a Newfound<lb break="no"/>land fisherman be able to bring his fish to 
     <lb/>
     the maritimes and sell it through NAFEL? 
     <lb/>
     I refer to codfish. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MAYH1">Mr. Mayhew</persName>: That is salt fish. The answer 
     <lb/>
     is no. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACI1">Mr. MacInnis</persName>: I quite agree with the point 
     <lb/>
     the minister has made, that bringing 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland into confederation does not 
     <lb/>
     increase in any way the world fish supply 
     <lb/>
     or the North American fish supply. The fish 
     <lb/>
     supply is much the same as it was before; 
     <lb/>
     that is, the production of Newfoundland as 
     <lb/>
     a dominion and the production of the mari<lb break="no"/>time-province section of this dominion will 
  

            <cb/>
        



     be much the same after confederation as 
     <lb/>
     before. But it may affect the maritime fisher<lb break="no"/>men if the assistance given to the fisheries 
     <lb/>
     board, or to the organization that has been 
     <lb/>
     set up by the fisheries board—which, as has 
     <lb/>
     been mentioned, is a purely big-business com<lb break="no"/>mercial organization—will give the board a 
     <lb/>
     greater advantage in the markets of the 
     <lb/>
     world than the Canadian fishermen have 
     <lb/>
     under production conditions in Canada, where 
     <lb/>
     better labour conditions prevail—conditions 
     <lb/>
     which are none too good but perhaps better 
     <lb/>
     than they are in Newfoundland. That is the 
     <lb/>
     point I wish to make. I think we should be 
     <lb/>
     satisfied here, because of the understanding 
     <lb/>
     that the dominion government is to pay the 
     <lb/>
     costs of the fisheries board for the next five 
     <lb/>
     years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MAYH1">Mr. Mayhew</persName>: We are paying only the 
     <lb/>
     deficit. I do not think there is any difference 
     <lb/>
     in the opportunity that Newfoundland has. 
     <lb/>
     I do not think the people are in any better 
     <lb/>
     position than we are in the maritime prov<lb break="no"/>inces at the present time. They operate some 
     <lb/>
     boats of their own between Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     and the West Indies and have enjoyed that 
     <lb/>
     market right along. I expect they will con<lb break="no"/>tinue to do so. Those boats will be taken 
     <lb/>
     over by the Department of Transport. There 
     <lb/>
     is in Newfoundland a bait-freezing service 
     <lb/>
     which I think is a better one than we have 
     <lb/>
     in Canada. We shall have to do something to 
     <lb/>
     improve ours so that it will be equal to New<lb break="no"/>foundland's. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACI1">Mr. MacInnis</persName>: The minister said that, 
     <lb/>
     according to the terms of the agreement, 
     <lb/>
     Canada was undertaking to pay only the

     deficit in the administration of the New<lb break="no"/>foundland fisheries board. Is that the state<lb break="no"/>ment the minister made? Before he answers, 
     <lb/>
     I may say that is not the way I read it in 
     <lb/>
     subsection 2 of term 22, which reads as 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACI1">Mr. MacInnis</persName>: Part of the Department of 
     <lb/>
     Fisheries of Canada? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MAYH1">Mr. Mayhew</persName>: Yes.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ISNO1">Mr. Isnor</persName>: I think there is one point we 
     <lb/>
     should bear in mind with regard 'to this five- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     year period. As I understand, the Newfound<lb break="no"/>land fisheries board will operate as a federal 
     <lb/>
     agency under the control of the governor in 
     <lb/>
     council. If I am correct in that, it does away 
     <lb/>
     with some of the worries that the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber opposite has in regard to its operation. 
     <lb/>
     But I take a wider View of awards than did 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Cape Breton South, 
     <lb/>
     because that Halifax award applies largely 
     <lb/>
     to the inshore fishermen. He also raised the 
     <lb/>
     question as to the operation of the fishing 
     <lb/>
     industry. I think Canada and Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     or the maritime provinces including Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     will be in an exceptionally fortunate position 
     <lb/>
     having regard to the future fishing industry 
     <lb/>
     of the world. We certainly will be able to 
     <lb/>
     take care of a population of 160 million, or 
     <lb/>
     all the consumers on the north American 
     <lb/>
     continent. In this fisheries development, we 
     <lb/>
     should take a long-range view not only of the 
     <lb/>
     benefits to Newfoundland, the new province, 
     <lb/>
     but of the effect it will have on our Canadian 
     <lb/>
     fishing industry. I for one welcome the 
     <lb/>
     thought that we are going to be able to join 
     <lb/>
     our forces and export in still larger quan<lb break="no"/>tities than ever before. I do not expect any 
     <lb/>
     trouble between the maritime provinces and 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland in regard to regulations, 
     <lb/>
     because they have already shown a willing<lb break="no"/>ness to co-operate in developing new and 
     <lb/>
     more extensive markets. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     May I say a word about the trawler? A 
     <lb/>
     number of years ago I was drawn into the 
     <lb/>
     trawler question. In fact I was almost cruci<lb break="no"/>fied by certain groups and papers in the mari<lb break="no"/>times, but I am just as firmly convinced today 
     <lb/>
     as I was when I took my stand, in 1938, if I 
     <lb/>
     remember rightly, that the fishing trawler is 
     <lb/>
     necessary if we are to develop a large export 
     <lb/>
     market. You cannot sell in small quantities 
     <lb/>
     in a profitable way. It is all right for the 
     <lb/>
     inshore fishermen. I am familiar with the 
     <lb/>
     inshore fishermen. In the summer months I 
     <lb/>
     live right next door to them. I am friendly 
     <lb/>
     with them and am anxious to see them pros<lb break="no"/>per, but they can only prosper by developing 
     <lb/>
     and holding a market in central Canada and 
     <lb/>
     in foreign countries. Therefore the trawler 
     <lb/>
     is necessary. A continuity of supply must be 
     <lb/>
     maintained if we are to continue in any 
     <lb/>
     developed market. Because of that, I am 
     <lb/>
     sure that those who say the trawler must be 
     <lb/>
     done away with are unfamiliar with this 
     <lb/>
     important question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I quite agree with the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Cape Breton South that there are differences  
     <lb/>
     of opinion in the matter. There are those 
     <lb/>
     who say that if you allow the unrestricted use 
 

            <cb/>
   

     of the trawler it will destroy our fishing 
     <lb/>
     grounds. I wish to point out that today the 
     <lb/>
     fishing banks of Canada and Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     are quite close. We have an advantage over 
     <lb/>
     the United States fishermen. As I said a 
     <lb/>
     moment ago, we must continue to operate 
     <lb/>
     the fishing trawler if we are to bring in large 
     <lb/>
     quantities of fish, process them and ship 
     <lb/>
     them to export markets, and in that way 
     <lb/>
     bring additional money to this country, which 
     <lb/>
     we as a progressive people are seeking. We 
     <lb/>
     are seeking increased export markets. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. member for Cape Breton South 
     <lb/>
     is anxious to rise in his place and take excep<lb break="no"/>tion to my remarks. I would ask him to 
     <lb/>
     wait a minute. It was not my intention to 
     <lb/>
     take part in this debate, but I know that 
     <lb/>
     from the maritime point of view the fishing 
     <lb/>
     industry is an important one. At the present 
     <lb/>
     time we have a minister who is interested 
     <lb/>
     not in the one section of the country which 
     <lb/>
     he represents in this house, namely the 
     <lb/>
     extreme west coast, but in all sections of the 
     <lb/>
     country. He has shown his interest by coming 
     <lb/>
     to the extreme east, and he has made himself 
     <lb/>
     familiar with our needs. Because of these 
     <lb/>
     visits to the different parts of the country 
     <lb/>
     we shall have a better transportation system 
     <lb/>
     to help the extreme east and west to market 
     <lb/>
     their fish in a better condition in central 
     <lb/>
     Canada. We are anxious to ship larger quan<lb break="no"/>tities to central Canada than we are doing 
     <lb/>
     at the present time. We realize that industrial 
     <lb/>
     central Canada, with its large population, 
     <lb/>
     roughly speaking 64 per cent of the popula<lb break="no"/>tion of the country, is a real market for our 
     <lb/>
     fish and the few products that we have to sell. 
     <lb/>
     We must ship our fish in a better condition 
     <lb/>
     than we have in years gone by. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am pleased that the minister has shown 
     <lb/>
     his interest in our problems. He has promised 
     <lb/>
     us that we shall have a more rapid trans<lb break="no"/>portation system to make available to the 
     <lb/>
     people of central Canada the fine type of 
     <lb/>
     fish that we catch along the Atlantic coast, 
     <lb/>
     particularly in Nova Scotia.

     to the trawlers and drifters owned by the

     will find the answer to his question. At the

     <lb/>
     not allowed to fish within a twelve-mile 
     <lb/>
     radius of the shores along the maritime prov<lb break="no"/>inces, but they may fish within three miles 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland. The Newfoundland fisher<lb break="no"/>men will be allowed to fish in the same way 
     <lb/>
     as Canadian trawlers. We shall have to 
     <lb/>
     change the regulations to bring that into 
     <lb/>
     effect. If the hon. member will read the top 
     <lb/>
     of the page dealing with trawling he will get

     <persName ref="pers:HAZE1">Mr. Hazen</persName>: I notice that in subsection 2 of 
     <lb/>
     section 22 the words used are: "For a period 
     <lb/>
     of five years from the date of union". That 
     <lb/>
     is a definite period. I presume it was put in 
     <lb/>
     at the request of the Newfoundland delega<lb break="no"/>tion. Was any consideration given to the fact 
     <lb/>
     that Newfoundland might apply prior to the 
     <lb/>
     end of five years, or within five years, for a 
     <lb/>
     change? In other words, were the words 
     <lb/>
     "from the date of union" the governing 
     <lb/>
     factor? Could these words not have been 
     <lb/>
     inserted, "unless the province of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land requests that they or any of them be 
     <lb/>
     terminated at an earlier date? Why is it so 
     <lb/>
     definite, a period of five years?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MAYH1">Mr. Mayhew</persName>: My understanding is that this

     <persName ref="pers:KNOW1">Mr. Knowles</persName>: I should like to ask a ques<lb break="no"/>tion on subsection 4. Half way through the

     subsection we find the following words, "... 
     <lb/>
     may be revoked or altered by the body or 
     <lb/>
     person that made them." Am I to take it that 
     <lb/>
     that body or person may refer to NAFEL? 
     <lb/>
     Has NAFEL the authority to change the regu<lb break="no"/>lations that they have made? Our concern is 
     <lb/>
     that the fisheries board set up by the state 
     <lb/>
     apparently has not much power left; most 
     <lb/>
     of the power is in the hands of this $10,000

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MAYH1">Mr. Mayhew</persName>: NAFEL itself has no author<lb break="no"/>ity to make regulations. The regulations will 
     <lb/>
     be made by the board. The board was set 
     <lb/>
     up by the commission form of government

     that this is a most important industry in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. Did any discussions take 
     <lb/>
     place with the Newfoundland delegation 
     <lb/>
     regarding the future of the industry? I under<lb break="no"/>stand a large volume of fish was sold in the 
     <lb/>
     British market, and that at the present time 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain is finding difficulty in getting 
     <lb/>
     the dollars to pay for Canadian products. 
     <lb/>
     With Newfoundland becoming part of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     there will be tariff barriers which will pre<lb break="no"/>vent the importation into Newfoundland of 
     <lb/>
     goods which previously came from Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain. Thereby a problem will be created 
     <lb/>
     which may make it difficult for Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     to accept and pay for the quantity of fish which 
     <lb/>
     formerly came from Newfoundland. Will the 
     <lb/>
     minister say whether there was any discus<lb break="no"/>sion of that problem, and whether any assur<lb break="no"/>ance is being gîven to the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     fishing industry that they might expect to 
     <lb/>
     sell as much fish under the new arrangement 
     <lb/>
     as they did under the earlier one? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: I did not hear everything the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member said, but I understood his 
     <lb/>
     remarks related to what arrangements could 
     <lb/>
     be made with respect to the sale of fish by 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland in European countries either 
     <lb/>
     for sterling or for other European currencies. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Last year an arrangement was made by the 
     <lb/>
     British government whereby it took over 
     <lb/>
     from Newfoundland the currency proceeds 
     <lb/>
     of sales of fish in those areas—escudos in 
     <lb/>
     Portugal, or lira in Italy—and gave to New<lb break="no"/>foundland blocked sterling for those other 
     <lb/>
     currencies. The Newfoundland government 
     <lb/>
     gave to the fishermen equivalent amounts in. 
     <lb/>
     dollars to pay for the fish. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The blocked sterling thus acquired was 
     <lb/>
     held in a special account available, and avail<lb break="no"/>able only, for the reduction and the servicing 
     <lb/>
     of the sterling debt of Newfoundland held in 
     <lb/>
     the United Kingdom. The Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     government approached the United Kingdom

            <fw type="running">HOUSE OF COMMONS</fw>
 

     at the time discussions of union with Canada 
     <lb/>
     were under way, and asked them if they 
     <lb/>
     would renew that arrangement for the com<lb break="no"/>ing season. The United Kingdom government 
     <lb/>
     has agreed to do 50. In other words, the 
     <lb/>
     United Kingdom has agreed to take from 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland the proceeds from sales of 
     <lb/>
     fish in those European markets, and give 
     <lb/>
     them blocked sterling for it, which will be 
     <lb/>
     placed in this account. Then, of course, the 
     <lb/>
     government of Newfoundland would have to 
     <lb/>
     provide dollars for the fishermen. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the part of Canada, we as a country— 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland being a part of this country, 
     <lb/>
     or soon to become a part—would be able to 
     <lb/>
     make the necessary dollars available to New<lb break="no"/>foundland for those proceeds, because under 
     <lb/>
     the terms of union Canada has undertaken to 
     <lb/>
     assume the payment of. sterling debt. We 
     <lb/>
     would therefore be in a position to use the 
     <lb/>
     proceeds of such sales for the servicing and 
     <lb/>
     reduction of that sterling debt.

     <persName ref="pers:MATT2">Mr. Matthews</persName> (Kootenay East): I should

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

            <p>
     Does that mean that when these regula<lb break="no"/>tions come into effect there will be a general

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MAYH1">Mr. Mayhew</persName>: We will try so far as pos<lb break="no"/>sible to have an equalization of salaries. In

     <persName ref="pers:ARCH4">Mr. Archibald</persName>: With respect to liquidation

     <lb/>
     canned salmon so as to help liquidate the 
     <lb/>
     debt of Newfoundland in that way? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: Perhaps we could answer that 
     <lb/>
     when we are considering Newfoundland's 
     <lb/>
     debt. It is expressed in terms of dollars. The 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland sterling debt is expressed in 
     <lb/>
     terms of dollars at $62 million. It has vary<lb break="no"/>ing maturities. Canada will have to service 
     <lb/>
     the debt until it is repaid, and in due course 
     <lb/>
     will have to provide for payment. In order 
     <lb/>
     to provide for payment Canada will have to 
     <lb/>
     acquire the necessary sterling; and it will 
     <lb/>
     acquire that sterling by giving to the United 
     <lb/>
     Kingdom treasury the equivalent amount in 
     <lb/>
     dollars. Presumably the dollars will be used 
     <lb/>
     as part of the general dollar reserve of the 
     <lb/>
     Bank of England or the United Kingdom 
     <lb/>
     treasury, and used for whatever purposes 
     <lb/>
     their laws provide. But I do not think 
     <lb/>
     Canada would be in a position to impose con<lb break="no"/>
      

            <cb/>

ditions upon the Bank of England or the 
     <lb/>
     treasury of the United Kingdom as to how 
     <lb/>
     such proceeds would be used.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DICK1">Mr. Dickey</persName>: Mr. Chairman, before the 
     <lb/>
     section is carried I should like to support 
     <lb/>
     what was said by the minister and also by 
     <lb/>
     my colleague, the senior member for Halifax, 
     <lb/>
     with respect to the industry generally. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Nova Scotia and Newfoundland fishing 
     <lb/>
     industries are quite similar. I believe the 
     <lb/>
     union of these industries under one juris<lb break="no"/>diction will be a source of strength and will 
     <lb/>
     result in far-reaching benefits for the industry 
     <lb/>
     as a whole both in Nova Scotia and in other 
     <lb/>
     parts of the maritime provinces, as well as 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland. As the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     industry stands, having been developed under 
     <lb/>
     a separate jurisdiction, it is unavoidable that 
     <lb/>
     at the present time there are certain arrange<lb break="no"/>ments and regulations concerning the industry 
     <lb/>
     which are different from those under the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian jurisdiction as applied to the 
     <lb/>
     industry in Nova Scotia and the other mari<lb break="no"/>time provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I believe it indicates a desire of all parties 
     <lb/>
     to see that the two industries are united 
     <lb/>
     under one jurisdiction, with the least amount 
     <lb/>
     of damage to either, when it is pointed out 
     <lb/>
     that arrangements have been made to con<lb break="no"/>tinue in force for a period of time certain of 
     <lb/>
     these special regulations under which the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland industry. has developed, in 
     <lb/>
     order to provide an orderly and proper uni<lb break="no"/>fication of the regulations which in future 
     <lb/>
     will apply to the industry as a whole. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The fact that theseregulations have been 
     <lb/>
     continued in force does not in any way show 
     <lb/>
     that these particular regulations and arrange<lb break="no"/>ments are approved, that they will be con<lb break="no"/>tinued in force permanently, or that any of 
     <lb/>
     them will be made to apply to the industry 
     <lb/>
     in those parts of the maritime provinces 
     <lb/>
     which already form a part of Canada. That 
     <lb/>
     the whole question received the greatest pos<lb break="no"/>sible consideration is shown by the great 
     <lb/>
     detail set out in section 22, now under con<lb break="no"/>sideration, and more particularly by the very 
     <lb/>
     detailed discussion of the various questions 
     <lb/>
     involved, and information which has been 
     <lb/>
     given in the committee. The industry as a 
     <lb/>
     whole will benefit through the efforts of the 
     <lb/>
     Department of Fisheries to improve methods 
     <lb/>
     of packing and transporting fish products to 
     <lb/>
     market. As a result of benefiting to that 
     <lb/>
     extent the industry will be able to bring 
     <lb/>
     about considerable expansion.

     The hon. member for Cape Breton South 
     <lb/>
     rather left the impression that trawlers were 
     <lb/>
     destroying the shore fishing industry. My 
     <lb/>
     colleague pointed out that there were two 
     <lb/>
     schools of thought on that matter. I think 
     <lb/>
     it is generally agreed that if there is to be

     any considerable expansion of the fishing 
     <lb/>
     industry in the maritime provinces and on 
     <lb/>
     the Atlantic coast a continuing and regular 
     <lb/>
     supply of suitable fish will have to be pro<lb break="no"/>vided. The only basis upon which that expan<lb break="no"/>sion can be built is the proper use of trawlers. 
     <lb/>
     Far from destroying the shore fishing indus<lb break="no"/>try, the proper use of trawlers will contribute 
     <lb/>
     to its prosperity.

     <persName ref="pers:HAZE1">Mr. Hazen</persName>: I have had the opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     looking at this pamphlet containing the state<lb break="no"/>ments of questions raised by the Newfound<lb break="no"/>land delegation. On page eight it is stated 
     <lb/>
     that Newfoundland trawlers will be per<lb break="no"/>mitted to fish to the three-mile limit off the 
     <lb/>
     coast of Newfoundland. Will that be for the 
     <lb/>
     next five years or for a longer period?

     Throughout the rest of Canada trawlers must

     are saying that as far as Newfoundland is

     <lb/>
     up to the three-mile limit. Legislation will

     <persName ref="pers:MACD8">Mr. Macdonnell</persName> (Muskoka-Ontario): I think 
     <lb/>
     it would be desirable that a statement should 
     <lb/>
     be made to the committee with regard to this

     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: I think it is desirable that 
     <lb/>
     there should be some explanation of this 
     <lb/>
     clause for the information of hon. members 
     <lb/>
     and the public generally. The expression 
     <lb/>
     "issued or to be issued" refers to the replac<lb break="no"/>ing of certain securities by other securities. 
     <lb/>
     There is a provision for the replacing of 
     <lb/>
     securities issued under the loan act of 1933 
     <lb/>
     without changing the amount at all.

            <p>
     On the basis of conversion at the rate of 
     <lb/>
     $4.04 to the pound, the amount outstanding 
     <lb/>
     under the loan act of 1933 is $71,911,467.24. 
     <lb/>
     There is a sinking fund amounting to $9,326,<lb break="no"/>650.26, which leaves a net outstanding debt of 
     <lb/>
     $62,584,816.98.

     <lb/>
     the latest information available, the amount 
     <lb/>
     of the internal debt was $10,465,593, with a

     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: Securities were issued in 
     <lb/>
     sterling in the United Kingdom, the net 
     <lb/>
     amount of which at the present time is $62 
     <lb/>
     million. Then securities were issued in New<lb break="no"/>foundland in dollars, the net amount at the 
     <lb/>
     end of December, 1947, being approximately 
     <lb/>
     $9.5 million. An attempt was made to deter<lb break="no"/>mine what portion of the total debt incurred 
     <lb/>
     in respect of the services would have been 
     <lb/>
     in respect of federal services had union taken 
     <lb/>
     place before the expenditure was made, and 
     <lb/>
     what proportion referred to services which 
     <lb/>
     would have been provincial services had 
     <lb/>
     union been in effect. According to the report 
     <lb/>
     of 1933 it was estimated that approximately 
     <lb/>
     $67.5 million of the debt at that time was 
     <lb/>
     the result of capital expenditures and current 
     <lb/>
     deficits in connection with the railway enter<lb break="no"/>prise and war expenditures. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     We reduced that $67.5 million in the pro<lb break="no"/>portion in which the total debt existing at 
     <lb/>
     that time had been reduced over the years 
     <lb/>
     and it was found that that brought the amount 
     <lb/>
     down to $54.8 million. The Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     delegates represented, and after consideration 
     <lb/>
     it was found that their representations should 
     <lb/>
     be accepted, that there had been issued for 
     <lb/>
     war purposes during the last war a total of 
     <lb/>
     $6.5 million in war loans and savings certi<lb break="no"/>ficates. That added to the $54.8 million 
     <lb/>
     made a total of $61.3 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     That figure was found to correspond quite 
     <lb/>
     closely to the debt owing in the United King<lb break="no"/>dom in sterling. It was agreed that in bring<lb break="no"/>ing about the union Canada would take over, 
     <lb/>
     as a debt incurred for what would have been 
     <lb/>
     federal purposes, an amount equivalent to 
     <lb/>
     the United Kingdom debt, and that the 
     <lb/>
     government of the province of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     would retain the debt of approximately 
     <lb/>
     $9,500,000 as a debt incurred for purposes 
     <lb/>
     which would have been provincial. There 
     <lb/>
     was this slight discrepancy. In making the 
     <lb/>
     mathematical computation we arrived at $61.3 
     <lb/>
     million whereas the amount of the sterling 
     <lb/>
     debt was $62.5 million. It was pointed out 
     <lb/>
     to us, however, that in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     railways and the war, not only had there been 
     <lb/>
     capital expenditure of a federal nature, but 
     <lb/>
     that a portion of it had been incurred pre<lb break="no"/>sumably for the erection of public buildings, 
     <lb/>
     and that the public buildings were going to 
     <lb/>
     be distributed according to the space in them 
     <lb/>
     occupied for what would be either federal 
     <lb/>
     or provincial services. It was found therefore 
     <lb/>
     that the fairest approximate calculation that 
     <lb/>
     could be made would show that the amount 
     <lb/>
     of the sterling debt was just about as close 


            <pb n="404" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-02-09_Page_0404.jpg"/>
            <fw>404</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">Newfoundland</hi></fw> <fw type="running">HOUSE OF COMMONS</fw> 


as we could get to the amount of indebtedness 
     <lb/>incurred for purposes which would have 
     <lb/>been federal purposes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was for that reason that the sterling debt 
     <lb/>
     was assumed, and that the provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ment was to be left with its dollar debt 
     <lb/>
     owing to residents of Canada or of New<lb break="no"/>foundland.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK1">Mr. Jackman</persName>: May I ask whether the ster<lb break="no"/>ling debt of Newfoundland is held by British 
     <lb/>
     nationals? If so can we offset some of the 
     <lb/>
     sterling balances, which we own in London, 
     <lb/>
     against the payment of this debt? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: The debt will have to be 
     <lb/>
     paid in sterling, and we will be entitled to 
     <lb/>
     pay it in any sterling that we have. Of course, 
     <lb/>
     we have not endeavoured to trace the securi<lb break="no"/>ties, but presumably they are securities that 
     <lb/>
     were issued in England and issued in sterling. 
     <lb/>
     We assumed that they were probably held 
     <lb/>
     in the United Kingdom, but whether or not 
     <lb/>
     they are held there they are payable there, 
     <lb/>
     and they are payable in sterling, and we can 
     <lb/>
     use whatever sterling we have to redeem 
     <lb/>
     them.

     <persName ref="pers:MACD8">Mr. Macdonnell</persName> (Muskoka-Oniario): I take 
     <lb/>
     it the Prime Minister means not only that 
     <lb/>
     they are payable in sterling but that they are 
     <lb/>
     payable only in sterling. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: Only in sterling.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD8">Mr. Macdonnell</persName> (Muskoka-Oniario): The 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister referred to the wording where 
     <lb/>
     it says, "Stock issued or to be issued". As I 
     <lb/>
     understood him, that means that new stock 
     <lb/>
     can be issued, but only to replace existing 
     <lb/>
     stock. That gives rise to this question. Does 
     <lb/>
     that mean merely to replace stock that is lost, 
     <lb/>
     or does it mean that if under the sinking fund 
     <lb/>
     you pay off a certain amount you can then 
     <lb/>
     issue up to the old amount? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: No; it means it is only to 
     <lb/>
     replace securities originally issued. My under<lb break="no"/>standing is that under the Loan Act, 1933, 
     <lb/>
     there were securities issued to replace former 
     <lb/>
     securities, and that there are some of those 
     <lb/>
     that have not yet been converted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD8">Mr. Macdonnell</persName> (Muskoka-Ontario): So the 
     <lb/>
     net result is that it will be the original 
     <lb/>
     amount not subject to increase, and subject 
     <lb/>
     to decrease to the extent of the sinking fund? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: That is correct.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FLEM1">Mr. Fleming</persName>: My question has to do gener<lb break="no"/>ally with the financial terms, and it applies to 
     <lb/>
     article 23 and several of the other articles 
     <lb/>
     which are to be found under the general 
     <lb/>
     heading, "financial terms". I should like to 
     <lb/>
     ask the Prime Minister to supply a little more 
     <lb/>
     information as to the net result as far as the 
     <lb/>
     annual charges that will be borne by Canada 
     <lb/>
     are concerned. The information which has 
   

            <cb/>
      

     been furnished to the house is not quite up to 
     <lb/>
     date. The document which has been circulated 
     <lb/>
     entitled "Report and documents relating to 
     <lb/>
     the negotiations for the union of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land with Canada" deals at page 70 with the 
     <lb/>
     question of probable revenues and probable 
     <lb/>
     expenditures accruing to Canada from New<lb break="no"/>foundland. That information is based on 1947 
     <lb/>
     figures, and also relates to the terms offered 
     <lb/>
     to Newfoundland in 1947. The figures at 
     <lb/>
     page 70 are a part of annex No. 4, which is 
     <lb/>
     annexed to the so-called "proposed arrange<lb break="no"/>ments for the entry of Newfoundland into 
     <lb/>
     confederation," which accompanied the letter 
     <lb/>
     of October 29, 1947, of the former Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Canada to the governor of New<lb break="no"/>foundland, to be found at page 57 of this 
     <lb/>
     same document. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As I gather it, the position under the terms 
     <lb/>
     offered in 1947 was roughly to this effect. 
     <lb/>
     Canada might anticipate drawing from New<lb break="no"/>foundland into the federal treasury approxi<lb break="no"/>mately $20 million per annum on the assump<lb break="no"/>tion of a continuation of the 1947 level of eco<lb break="no"/>nomic activities in Newfoundland. It was calcu<lb break="no"/>lated also that probable expenditures on New<lb break="no"/>foundland out of the federal treasury, embrac<lb break="no"/>ing tax agreement payments, old age pensions, 
     <lb/>
     family allowances and other departmental 
     <lb/>
     expenditures, would total approximately $27 
     <lb/>
     million. On page 71 it is pointed out that 
     <lb/>
     there are four items not included in the 
     <lb/>
     estimate of $27 million odd. They are: first, 
     <lb/>
     the transitional grants; secondly, the cost of 
     <lb/>
     servicing that part of the Newfoundland debt 
     <lb/>
     assumed by Canada; thirdly, any costs in 
     <lb/>
     respect of the Newfoundland railway or its 
     <lb/>
    auxiliary steamship services taken over 
     <lb/>by Canada; and, fourthly, any capital 
     <lb/>expenditure. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I pause at that point to make this comment. 
     <lb/>
     In trying to arrive at the net result, it would 
     <lb/>
     appear that on the basis of the 1947 offer the 
     <lb/>
     net result to the treasury would be a deficit 
     <lb/>
     of roughly $7 million as between federal 
     <lb/>
     revenue and probable expenditures, plus 
     <lb/>
     three and a half million dollars of transitional 
     <lb/>
     grants in each of the first three years of 
     <lb/>
     union, plus the other three of the four items 
     <lb/>
     referred to on page 71. But those are not 
     <lb/>
     the terms that are before the house today. 
     <lb/>
     The terms were revised in 1948, and the 
     <lb/>
     result has been to increase very substantially 
     <lb/>
     the amounts of the transitional grants that 
     <lb/>
     are offered by Canada to Newfoundland. It 
     <lb/>
     is proposed to increase the grants substan<lb break="no"/>tially during the first eight of the twelve 
     <lb/>
     years during which transitional grants are 
     <lb/>
     payable. By doing some arithmetic one finds 
     <lb/>
     that the total of transitional grants contem<lb break="no"/>plated in the 1947 offer was $26,250,000, 
     <lb/>
     whereas the-transitional grants that are con<lb break="no"/>templated by article 28 of the terms of union 
     <lb/>
     total $42,750,000. I assume that the amount 
  

            <pb n="405" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-02-09_Page_0405.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">FEBRUARY 9, 1949</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">Newfoundland</hi></fw>  <fw type="num">405</fw> 
  


     of the transitional grants was increased in the 
     <lb/>
     interval between 1947 and 1948 for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of making the terms of union more 
     <lb/>
     acceptable to the people of Newfoundland, 
     <lb/>
     and perhaps to meet some of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     that had been encountered there towards 
     <lb/>
     confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I should like to ask the Prime Minister if 
     <lb/>
     he is in a position to give to the house now 
     <lb/>
     up-to-date figures as to the probable net 
     <lb/>
     result to the federal treasury of union based 
     <lb/>
     on the figures on pages 70 and 71 as varied, 
     <lb/>
     first by the increase in the transitional 
     <lb/>
     grants, and. secondly, by any possible changes 
     <lb/>
     arising from the use of 1947 figures as basic. 
     <lb/>
     It may be the government is in a position to 
     <lb/>
     give us more recent figures than those used 
     <lb/>
     here.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: I should not like to 
     <lb/>
     attempt to go into the details of those cal<lb break="no"/>culations. Those estimates that were made

     are contained in this annex 4. They were 
     <lb/>
     rough estimates and it was found that, in

     many respects, more precise information

     1947. It was found that, in order to leave the 
     <lb/>
     provincial government in a position to carry 
     <lb/>
     out its responsibilities and give to the people 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland services that would be pro<lb break="no"/>gressing up to the scale of services provided 
     <lb/>
     in other provinces, without imposing taxes 
     <lb/>
     which it would not be practical to try to 
     <lb/>
     make effective at once, additions in the 
     <lb/>
     transitional grants were required. It is 
     <lb/>
     because of that feature that those increases 
     <lb/>
     in the transitional grants were provided. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think the Minister of Finance and his 
     <lb/>
     officers did make calculations before recom<lb break="no"/>mending to the committee the reasonableness 
     <lb/>
     of the proposals, and I think he would be in 
     <lb/>
     a much better position than I to give my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend such information as his officials were 
     <lb/>
     able to obtain. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: As the Prime Minister has 
     <lb/>
     suggested, perhaps I might follow that up, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman. When the first delegation was 
     <lb/>
     here discussing terms of union, certain figures 
     <lb/>
     were made available as to the probable 
     <lb/>
     revenues in Newfoundland. It was on the 
     <lb/>
     basis of those figures or estimates that the 
     <lb/>
     original financial proposals were made. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Following the holding of the plebiscite and 
     <lb/>
     the arrival of the new delegation a good deal 
     <lb/>
     of additional work had been done with 
     <lb/>
     respect to the probable revenues and expen<lb break="no"/>ditures in Newfoundland. The Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     delegation had retained the services of a very 
     <lb/>
     capable accounting firm. A careful analysis 
     <lb/>
     had been made of the probable revenues in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland and an attempt was made to 
     <lb/>
     forecast a probable provincial budget. As 
     <lb/>
     the committee will appreciate, it was rather 
     <lb/>
     difficult to do that because of the difficulty 
 

            <cb/>

of assessing the extent to which the federal 
     <lb/>services would accomplish what, in the past, 
     <lb/>had been done by the province, and just how 
     <lb/>much would be carried on by the province. 
     <lb/>That was, of course, on the expenditure side. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the revenue side of a proposed provin<lb break="no"/>cial budget, it was necessary to take account 
     <lb/>
     of the fact that union would effect a rather 
     <lb/>
     revolutionary change in the tax sources of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland. Up to the time of union, the 
     <lb/>
     major sources of revenue were sources which 
     <lb/>
     either were exclusively within the purview 
     <lb/>
     of the federal government or would be shared 
     <lb/>
     by the federal and provincial governments. 
     <lb/>
     The major source of revenue in Newfound<lb break="no"/>land has always been the customs duty. This 
     <lb/>
     revenue would no longer be available to the 
     <lb/>
     new provincial government. Income taxes, 
     <lb/>
     corporation taxes, succession duties and the 
     <lb/>
     like are fields that are shared by the two 
     <lb/>
     governments. The difficulty in assessing what 
     <lb/>
     the revenues would really be was consider<lb break="no"/>able. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was, of course, realized by the New<lb break="no"/>foundland delegation and by the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     delegation that it would be possible and 
     <lb/>
     necessary to develop new sources of revenue, 
     <lb/>
     in the light of those which are utilized in 
     <lb/>
     other Canadian provinces, but that inevitably 
     <lb/>
     it would take some time to develop those 
     <lb/>
     sources of revenue. For that reason, it was 
     <lb/>
     decided it would be necessary to increase 
     <lb/>
     the transitional grants which, as the com<lb break="no"/>mittee will have appreciated upon looking at 
     <lb/>
     the terms of union, commence at the figure 
     <lb/>
     of $6.5 million for the first two years and 
     <lb/>
     diminish to nothing at the end of the twelfth 
     <lb/>
     year. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     It was upon that basis that these additional 
     <lb/>
     transitional grants were arrived at, and that 
     <lb/>
     was the consideration which prompted the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian government to recommend these 
     <lb/>
     increased grants. The Canadian government 
     <lb/>
     felt they were fair and were necessary in 
     <lb/>
     order to enable the new provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ment to have a reasonably adequate budget 
     <lb/>
     to provide a scale of provincial services 
     <lb/>
     necessary in the new province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FLEM1">Mr. Fleming</persName>: I appreciate the real difficulty 
     <lb/>
     in arriving at very precise estimates of the 
     <lb/>
     probable revenues and probable expenditures 
     <lb/>
     in a situation like this, which has some novel 
     <lb/>
     features about it. If the minister would be 
     <lb/>
     kind enough to clarify this matter, I should 
     <lb/>
     like to ask him whether my understanding of 
     <lb/>
     the situation is correct in so far as the net 
     <lb/>
     cost to the Canadian treasury is concerned. 
     <lb/>
     The anticipated total annual revenue from 
     <lb/>
     all sources after union, which will include the 
     <lb/>
     personal income taxes, corporate taxes, suc<lb break="no"/>cession duties, customs duties, import taxes, 
     <lb/>
     as well as all the other forms of taxes which

     were enumerated on page 70, will be in the 
     <lb/>
     neighbourhood of $20 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: That was our estimate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FLEM1">Mr. Fleming</persName>: Yes, I understand this was 
     <lb/>
     the estimate of the Canadian government. 
     <lb/>
     Against that, there are anticipated expendi<lb break="no"/>tures of approximately $27 million per annum. 
     <lb/>
     The tax agreement payment, which I presume 
     <lb/>
     is the subsidy payment which is provided for 
     <lb/>
     in article 26, is estimated at $6,820,000; old 
     <lb/>
     age pensions, between $2 million and 
     <lb/>
     $2,600,000; family allowances, $8,350,000; 
     <lb/>
     other departmental expenses, $9,400,000. This 
     <lb/>
     makes up the total I mentioned. There would 
     <lb/>
     appear up to that point to be an annual 
     <lb/>
     deficit of $7 million in round figures. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The increase in the transitional grants from 
     <lb/>
     $3,500,000 to $6,500,000 would bring the deficit 
     <lb/>
     up to $13,500,000, approximately, per annum, 
     <lb/>
     but that does not include three other figures: 
     <lb/>
     first, the costs of servicing that part of the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland debt assumed by Canada; sec<lb break="no"/>ondly, any costs in respect of the Newfound<lb break="no"/>land railway or its auxiliary 
     <lb/>
     services taken over by Canada; thirdly, any 
     <lb/>
     capital expenditures. Could the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Finance give any estimate at all of those three 
     <lb/>
     latter factors, as to what they might be 
     <lb/>
     expected to amount to, and could he say a 
     <lb/>
     word as to the anticipated additional cost of 
     <lb/>
     defence, so that we will have as complete a 
     <lb/>
     picture as it is possible to draw at this stage 
     <lb/>
     of the net result for the treasury of Canada? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: Before the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Finance gives his estimate, possibly I should 
     <lb/>
     give the estimate that was brought back to 
     <lb/>
     us in 1948 by the Newfoundland delegation. 
     <lb/>
     They disputed our estimate of the revenues 
     <lb/>
     as being too modest. Our estimate of what 
     <lb/>
     Canada would derive in 1949 was $20,185,000. 
     <lb/>
     Their estimate of what would be derived on 
     <lb/>
     the level of economy of 1949 was $26,922,000. 
     <lb/>
     They made that as their estimate of what 
     <lb/>
     Canada would derive from those various 
     <lb/>
     sources—personal income tax, corporation tax 
     <lb/>
     and so forth. They also disputed the 
     <lb/>
     $27,150,000 because that included the old age 
     <lb/>
     pensions payment at $2,600,000, and they said 
     <lb/>
     it would not exceed $2,400,000. So they came 
     <lb/>
     back this time telling us that our estimate of 
     <lb/>
     the revenue Canada would get, on the level 
     <lb/>
     of the economy of 1949, was too low, that it 
     <lb/>
     should amount to $26,922,000; and that our 
     <lb/>
     estimate of the expenditure on these items 
     <lb/>
     was a little bit too high and would be 
     <lb/>
     $26,970,000, practically balancing each other. 
     <lb/>
     Of course those figures are merely estimates. 
     <lb/>
     Before the Minister of Finance gave his own 
     <lb/>
     figures, I thought I should give to hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers the representation that had been made 
     <lb/>
     by the delegation from Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <cb/>
            

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: I forget for the moment what 
     <lb/>
     other things my hon. friend had in mind par<lb break="no"/>ticularly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FLEM1">Mr. Fleming</persName>: I went on to deal with the 
     <lb/>
     factors enumerated at the top of page 71 of 
     <lb/>
     the booklet. I asked if the minister could give 
     <lb/>
     any estimate at all as to factors 2, 3 and 4, 
     <lb/>
     which are as follows: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     (2) Costs of servicing that part of the Newfound<lb break="no"/>land debt assumed by Canada;

            <p>
     (3) Any costs in respect of the Newfoundland rail<lb break="no"/>way or its auxiliary steamship services, taken over 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     (4) Any capital expenditures. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     I also asked whether the estimate of their 
     <lb/>
     expenditure, this figure aggregating $27 mil<lb break="no"/>lion in round figures, took any account of the 
     <lb/>
     increased burden of national defence. There 
     <lb/>
     is an item here entitled "other departmental 
     <lb/>
     expenditures", but it is an amount of only 
     <lb/>
     $9,400,000. Does that take any account of the 
     <lb/>
     increased burden of national defence which 
     <lb/>
     will now fall on the federal treasury with 
     <lb/>
     respect to the defence of Newfoundland? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: No. I have not any revised 
     <lb/>
     figure as to probable federal revenue from 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland, and I would prefer not to 
     <lb/>
     hazard any further statement on that matter 
     <lb/>
     at this time. We are, however, in process of 
     <lb/>
     preparing estimates to be included in what 
     <lb/>
     would be the main estimate in order to pro<lb break="no"/>vide services in Newfoundland. While those 
     <lb/>
     are not completed yet, they are fairly well 
     <lb/>
     advanced. Those expenditures, including 
     <lb/>
     expenditures for veterans' benefits and one 
     <lb/>
     thing and another, which are not included 
     <lb/>
     here, will be substantially higher than the 
     <lb/>
     figure of $27 million shown on page 70. 
     <lb/>
     Including all those special items, I think it 
     <lb/>
     will probably be something of the order of 
     <lb/>
     $50 million, including additional estimates 
     <lb/>
     for defence and the like. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FLEM1">Mr. Fleming</persName>: I should like to be clear with 
     <lb/>
     regard to that figure of $50 million. Is that in 
     <lb/>
     addition to the $27 million? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: No. What I am saying is this. 
     <lb/>
     Of course, before union is completed I shall 
     <lb/>
     be bringing down the main estimates for the 
     <lb/>
     fiscal year from April 1, 1949, to March 31, 
     <lb/>
     1950. Therefore I have decided that, in the 
     <lb/>
     main estimates, we should not include New<lb break="no"/>foundland items, but that they should be 
     <lb/>
     brought in as special supplementary esti<lb break="no"/>mates. I think it is an advantage to deal with 
     <lb/>
     the matter in that way, in that it will show 
     <lb/>
     to members of the house in detail the addi<lb break="no"/>tional expenditure which it is contemplated 
     <lb/>
     will be necessary for Newfoundland. Those 
     <lb/>
     estimates will be brought in. My present 
     <lb/>
     intention would be to table those estimates 
     <lb/>
     on or about March 31, on the assumption that

     the legal formalities will have been complied 
     <lb/>
     with in order to make union effective about 
     <lb/>
     that date. Present indications are that the 
     <lb/>
     over-all amount of those estimates, including 
     <lb/>
     the other items to which I have referred— 
     <lb/>
     those relating to veterans and the like—will 
     <lb/>
     be something of the order of $50 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FLEM1">Mr. Fleming</persName>: For clarity's sake, may I ask 
     <lb/>
     this further question. That $50 million will 
     <lb/>
     include the $27 million, plus the transitional 
     <lb/>
     grant, plus the other three factors at the top 
     <lb/>
     of page 71?

            </p>
   
            <p>

            </p>

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:FLEM1">Mr. Fleming</persName>: It is an inclusive figure? 
</p>

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: That is correct.

     Such evidence as is available would indicate that 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland railway system is badly run down 
     <lb/>
     and would require the expenditure of substantial 
     <lb/>
     amounts for rehabilitation. Estimates of the prob<lb break="no"/>able cost of such rehabilitation can only be guesses 
     <lb/>
     on the basis of data at present available. It would 
     <lb/>
     appear that the rails would need to be renewed on 
     <lb/>
     the whole of the railway within a period of ten 
     <lb/>
     years. and that at the same time ballast should be 
     <lb/>
     renewed, embankments and cuts widened. drainage 
     <lb/>
     restored or improved and that &amp; majority of the 
     <lb/>
     bridges would need renewing. The cost of such 
     <lb/>
     rehabilitation over a ten-year period would be of 
     <lb/>
     the order of $10 million. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     rehabilitation. Much of the car equipment is of

     wooden construction and a number of the loco<lb break="no"/>motives are not worth repairing. It may be hazarded 
     <lb/>
     that the cost of rehabilitating rolling stock over a 
     <lb/>
     ten-year period would be of the order of $7 million.

     I read that the rates of pay, as far as can 
     <lb/>
     be judged from the sample given, are on the 
     <lb/>
     whole somewhat lower than those in Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Under the heading "Results of operation", it 


            <cb/>

is reported that there was a deficit of about 
     <lb/>$525,000 in 1944-45 and $698,000 in 1945-46, 
     <lb/>after adjustment of a non-recurring item.

            <p>
     The point upon which I should like some 
     <lb/>
     information is this. Does it now become the 
     <lb/>
     problem of the Canadian National Railways 
     <lb/>
     to take over the Newfoundland railway? Is 
     <lb/>
     there an undertaking to bring the rates of pay 
     <lb/>
     up to Canadian levels and to bring passenger 
     <lb/>
     and freight rates down to Canadian levels? 
     <lb/>
     If so, what is the probable deficit which might 
     <lb/>
     be expected? What about the capital debt of 
     <lb/>
     the Newfoundland railway? Does it become a 
     <lb/>
     charge on the consolidated revenue of Can<lb break="no"/>ada, or is it added to the already heavy bur<lb break="no"/>den of the Canadian National Railways, 
     <lb/>
     which is about twice as high as the debt of 
     <lb/>
     its competitor, the Canadian Pacific Railway? 
     <lb/>
     Can the Minister of Finance answer some of 
     <lb/>
     those questions? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: The Newfoundland railway 
     <lb/>
     will be operated by the Canadian National 
     <lb/>
     Railways; that is to say, management will be 
     <lb/>
     provided by the Canadian National Railways, 
     <lb/>
     but they will operate it as agents of the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian government in the same way as the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian National Railways operate the 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial railway. If there is a deficit, and 
     <lb/>
     I think it is fairly certain that there will be 
     <lb/>
     one, any deficit incurred will have to be voted 
     <lb/>
     by this house in the same way as deficits of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian National Railways and just as 
     <lb/>
     we have in the estimates each year an item 
     <lb/>
     for statutory obligations in connection with 
     <lb/>
     the Intercolonial railway. At the moment I 
     <lb/>
     have not available any estimates of the pos<lb break="no"/>sible or probable deficit of the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     railway. There is no doubt that it will require 
     <lb/>
     substantial capital expenditures, which will 
     <lb/>
     be classified as capital, and which presum<lb break="no"/>ably would increase the earning power of the 
     <lb/>
     railway by improving efficiency. But from an 
     <lb/>
     operating point of View the deficits, if any, 
     <lb/>
     will be a charge upon the taxpayers of Can<lb break="no"/>ada in the same way as are the deficits of the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian National Railways and of the Inter« 
     <lb/>
     colonial railway. I have forgotten my hon.

     We take them over as an asset of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Newfoundland. As the Prime Minis<lb break="no"/>ter indicated a moment ago, we have assumed 
     <lb/>
     the payment of the sterling debt, a large por<lb break="no"/>tion of which was incurred in the building 
     <lb/>
     of the railway, among other things. We will 
     <lb/>
     own the railway as an asset of the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     of Canada. As I indicated, the offsetting 
     <lb/>
     liability is a portion of the debt. I might add, 
     <lb/>
     the arrangement provides that the railway 
     <lb/>
     will be left with adequate working capital, 
     <lb/>
     stores and so on, and that is part of the 
     <lb/>

     whatsoever. But this committee is entitled

     to know just what revenues we are likely to 
     <lb/>
     receive from taxation in Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     also what the expenditures will be. The 
     <lb/>
     information which the Minister of Finance 
     <lb/>
     has given has been anything but illuminating. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     The document which was given to hon. 
     <lb/>
     members was printed in 1949. It refers to a 
     <lb/>
     conference series published in 1948. One 
     <lb/>
     might expect that the information would be 
     <lb/>
     at least reasonably up to date, but either the 
     <lb/>
     minister or the Prime Minister has said, when 
     <lb/>
     dealing with the federal revenues which we 
     <lb/>
     can expect from Newfoundland, that the 
     <lb/>
     original figure of $20,185,000 had been upped 
     <lb/>
     by the Newfoundland delegation when they 
     <lb/>
     went back home and made a further investi<lb break="no"/>gation, and that they retained a very capable 
     <lb/>
     firm of accountants—I am sure they were 
     <lb/>
     very capable—who upped these revenues to 
     <lb/>
     an estimated $26,922,000. Do we accept that 
     <lb/>
     revision of the estimate of revenue which we 
     <lb/>
     shall get from Newfoundland? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR6">Mr. St. Laurent</persName>: We neither accept it nor 
     <lb/>
     dispute it. We shall get such amounts as will 
     <lb/>
     be provided by the present rates of taxation 
     <lb/>
     applied to operations which actually take 
     <lb/>
     place. These are estimates. We accept them 
     <lb/>
     as estimates, but we do not guarantee that 
     <lb/>
     these estimates will prove to be accurate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK1">Mr. Jackman</persName>: I am not asking for a guar<lb break="no"/>antee. Of course they must be estimates in 
     <lb/>
     the very nature of things, but one certainly 


            <cb/>
   

     does a little checking and double checking. 
     <lb/>
     The delegation met here with our own repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives for weeks, if not for months. 
     <lb/>
     Surely there must be a very good idea in the 
     <lb/>
     minds of members of the government as to 
     <lb/>
     what a reasonable estimate is. I am asking 
     <lb/>
     a specific question. Is the reasonable estimate 
     <lb/>
     in the eyes of our own advisers and our own 
     <lb/>
     responsible ministers $20 million or is it 
     <lb/>
     nearly $27 million, which was the final estim<lb break="no"/>ate of the Newfoundland delegation? That 
     <lb/>
     is a simple question. Surely the government 
     <lb/>
     holds at least a belief that it must be nearly 
     <lb/>
     one or the other. I know that when we 
     <lb/>
     apply our taxation laws to Newfoundland we 
     <lb/>
     get a certain figure. We do not know exactly 
     <lb/>
     what it is, but we must have made some 
     <lb/>
     estimate which we hoped would bear some 
     <lb/>
     accuracy, because it is simply amazing, when 
     <lb/>
     the budgets are brought down year after year 
     <lb/>
     and estimates are made running up to 
     <lb/>
     hundreds of millions of dollars, how accurate 
     <lb/>
     they sometimes are, although I admit that in 
     <lb/>
     the last few years the surpluses have been a 
     <lb/>
     little higher than the government could ever 
     <lb/>
     possibly have expected. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     As members of this committee, we should 
     <lb/>
     inquire into what these probable expenditures 
     <lb/>
     are going to be. The minister, in his usual 
     <lb/>
     slapdash fashion, has said that the figure of 
     <lb/>
     $27 million applies to transitional grants 
     <lb/>
     which are now $6,500,000— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: Total payments. The main 
     <lb/>
     additional item, if my hon. friend will permit 
     <lb/>
     me, will be approximately $14,500,000 under 
     <lb/>
     the transitional grants, the tax agreement, and 
     <lb/>
     other payments to the province. Add 
     <lb/>
     $14,500,000 to $27 million and you get up to 
     <lb/>
     $41 million odd. Then there are veterans 
     <lb/>
     benefits of $4 million or $5 million, and one 
     <lb/>
     thing and another. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK1">Mr. Jackman</persName>: It is this "one thing and 
     <lb/>
     another" to which I object. This committee is 
     <lb/>
     entitled to know what we are doing. As I 
     <lb/>
     said before, we are willing to go into this 
     <lb/>
     irrespective of any dollars and cents. The 
     <lb/>
     question of union with Newfoundland rises 
     <lb/>
     above that; nevertheless we owe a duty to 
     <lb/>
     our own people in Canada and we need the 
     <lb/>
     information. I would ask the minister not 
     <lb/>
     to give me a few figures on this and that and 
     <lb/>
     say, et cetera, et cetera, then arrive at $50 
     <lb/>
     million. What I want to know is this. What 
     <lb/>
     is added to the probable expenditures of $27 
     <lb/>
     million, which I think the minister said had 
     <lb/>
     to be revised upwards? I should like to know 
     <lb/>
     what the additional figures are. I want them 
     <lb/>
     itemized to make up the total of approxi<lb break="no"/>mately $50 million which the minister gave 
     <lb/>
     us. We have the transitional grants. which 
     <lb/>
     are $6,500,000. Then we have the cost of 
     <lb/>
     servicing the Newfoundland debt, which I 
     <lb/>
     presume will be somewhere in the neighbour<lb break="no"/>

     hood of $2,400,000. The minister can correct 
     <lb/>
     me if I am wrong. Surely he knows what the 
     <lb/>
     experience is in operating the Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     railway even with the high freight rates and 
     <lb/>
     passenger rates which we heard about, and 
     <lb/>
     possibly a lower wage scale than we have in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. What has been the experience there 
     <lb/>
     in the last few years?—because in the nature 
     <lb/>
     of things it is not likely that there will be 
     <lb/>
     too radical a change in a short time. What 
     <lb/>
     is the deficit on the Newfoundland railway 
     <lb/>
     likely to be, if there is a deficit? It may be a 
     <lb/>
     profit, for all I know, but I want a figure on 
     <lb/>
     that. I want to know exactly what other 
     <lb/>
     items, including the cost of veterans allow<lb break="no"/>ances, will go to make up the figure of $50 
     <lb/>
     million more or less which will be the cost 
     <lb/>
     to Canada of the first year of operation. I 
     <lb/>
     have not said a word about the revenues, 
     <lb/>
     which are estimated on the basis of 1947, I 
     <lb/>
     think, because that was applying the tax laws 
     <lb/>
     as they existed in Canada at that time, and 
     <lb/>
     we, representing the people of Canada, surely 
     <lb/>
     expect that the tax rates will be much less, 
     <lb/>
     therefore the tax revenues will be much less. 
     <lb/>
     However, I will not ask the minister to make 
     <lb/>
     any estimate in that regard just now. If he 
     <lb/>
     would throw some light on how the $50 mil<lb break="no"/>lion probable expenditures are made up I 
     <lb/>
     should be very grateful. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: That question is fair enough. 
     <lb/>
     I am afraid I cannot give the information at 
     <lb/>
     once. The reason I gave the round figure of 
     <lb/>
     $50 million was that I asked the officers of 
     <lb/>
     the various departments to segregate the 
     <lb/>
     expenditures in the different departments 
     <lb/>
     relating to Newfoundland. The other day 
     <lb/>
     I asked what the total of these estimates 
     <lb/>
     would be and I was informed that it was 
     <lb/>
     something of the order of $50 million or $55 
     <lb/>
     million. I have not the details here. I will 
     <lb/>
     get them. This discussion will probably go 
     <lb/>
     on for some time. The full detail of course 
     <lb/>
     will be, set out in the special supplementary 
     <lb/>
     estimate to which I referred a moment ago, 
     <lb/>
     but I cannot give my hon. friend a break<lb break="no"/>down of that here now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The major item is the extension to New<lb break="no"/>foundland of rehabilitation grants and- other 
     <lb/>
     veterans benefits, which run to quite sub<lb break="no"/>stantial sums of money. That is a major item 
     <lb/>
     in the increase. It may well be that the gross 
     <lb/>
     figure which I have given also includes an 
     <lb/>
     estimate for deficit on the railways but I 
     <lb/>
     shall have to ask my hon. friend to allow 
     <lb/>
     that to stand and I shall try to give it to 
     <lb/>
     him either tomorrow afternoon or certainly 
     <lb/>
     before the discussion finishes.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FLEM1">Mr. Fleming</persName>: Going back to my now 
     <lb/>
     familiar problem about the net result, the 
     <lb/>
     minister has now said that the total probable 
     <lb/>
     expenditures for a full year would be $50 
     <lb/>
     million to $55 million. The Prime Minister 


            <cb/>

has indicated that the estimates of federal 
     <lb/>revenue in a year are, on the one hand, the 
     <lb/>Canadian estimate of $20 million, in round 
     <lb/>figures and, on the other hand, the New<lb break="no"/>foundland estimate of, shall we say, $27 mil<lb break="no"/>lion, in round figures. This means that, with 
     <lb/>those figures, the net cost to the federal 
     <lb/>treasury through union would be a minimum 
     <lb/>of $23 million per annum, and might run up 
     <lb/>to as high as $35 million, based on the 
     <lb/>assumption of the continuance of the present 
     <lb/>scale of economic activity, and also on the 
     <lb/>continuance of the present scale of federal 
     <lb/>taxation. If, as we sincerely hope, there is 
     <lb/>a substantial reduction in rates of taxation 
     <lb/>this year, the anticipated revenue from New<lb break="no"/>foundland would be reduced accordingly, and 
     <lb/>the net charge on the federal treasury would 
     <lb/>be increased accordingly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Would the minister comment upon that? 
     <lb/>
     According to my arithmetic the figures of cost 
     <lb/>
     would be somewhere between $23 million 
     <lb/>
     and $35 million per annum. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: That is probably right. But, 
     <lb/>
     as the hon. member appreciates, those are 
     <lb/>
     estimates. If, in fact, the federal revenues 
     <lb/>
     from Newfoundland are of the order of $20 
     <lb/>
     million, and if in fact the federal expendi<lb break="no"/>tures in Newfoundland, of one sort or another, 
     <lb/>
     are of the order of $50 million, obviously 
     <lb/>
     there would be some $30 million paid out 
     <lb/>
     more than is taken in, in direct revenue. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     My hon. friend is right when he says that. 
     <lb/>
     But I am sure he appreciates that in the 
     <lb/>
     early stages of union it is perhaps not a fair 
     <lb/>
     test of the ultimate revenue-producing capa<lb break="no"/>city of Newfoundland, nor is the amount 
     <lb/>
     received in revenue at the outset a fair test 
     <lb/>
     of the value of Newfoundland, or the con<lb break="no"/>tribution it may make to the Canadian federa<lb break="no"/>tion. I do not think we can do that—and I 
     <lb/>
     am sure my hon. friend was not suggesting 
     <lb/>
     that we could. I am simply pointing out 
     <lb/>
     that we cannot judge this entirely in terms 
     <lb/>
     of either estimates or dollars and cents. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FLEM1">Mr. Fleming</persName>: I agree entirely with what 
     <lb/>
     the minister says. I would not wish anyone 
     <lb/>
     to think that I am basing my judgment as to 
     <lb/>
     the advantages of union either to Newfound<lb break="no"/>land or to Canada on these figures which have 
     <lb/>
     been brought out this afternoon upon inquiry. 
     <lb/>
     However, this is a matter of some importance, 
     <lb/>
     and inquiries have been made with a view 
     <lb/>
     to eliciting essential information. On the 
     <lb/>
     other side, if we were thinking in terms of 
     <lb/>
     a ledger balance in respect of the union, of 
     <lb/>
     course we would have to take account of the 
     <lb/>
     economic advantages accruing to both sides 
     <lb/>
     as a result of the increased facilities for trade, 
     <lb/>
     and other similar advantages. It is a separate 
     <lb/>
     and distinct problem.

            <p><persName ref="pers:PROB1">Mr. Probe</persName>: Referring to this deficit, which 
     <lb/>is estimated variously as running from $23 
     <lb/>million to $35 million annually, as of this 
     <lb/>year, would the minister indicate what the 
     <lb/>position will be in five, ten or fifteen years. 
     <lb/>Some of these are non-recurring debts and 
     <lb/>expenditures as of this or next year. This 
     <lb/>figure, whatever it may be, of the present 
     <lb/>deficit, will be sharply or gradually reduced 
     <lb/>to what figure in what time? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: As I have often had occasion 
     <lb/>
     to say in the house, I claim no gift as a 
     <lb/>
     prophet; and anyone who could attempt to 
     <lb/>
     forecast what the revenues and expenditures 
     <lb/>
     of a province or of the dominion would be 
     <lb/>
     years ahead is a worker of miracles. It is 
     <lb/>
     absolutely impossible to make anything but 
     <lb/>
     a wild guess. But if one assumes that New<lb break="no"/>foundland develops and occupies a full place 
     <lb/>
     in the Canadian economy, I think it is fair 
     <lb/>
     to assume that its revenues will expand; and 
     <lb/>
     my experience as Minister of Finance has 
     <lb/>
     been that expenditures will also expand. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PROB1">Mr. Probe</persName>: Is it the minister's view that this 
     <lb/>
     temporary or this present apparent deficit 
     <lb/>
     will narrow considerably as soon as condi<lb break="no"/>tions stabilize? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: I should think that is bound 
     <lb/>
     to happen. Such matters as veterans affairs 
     <lb/>
     payments and transitional grants are both 
     <lb/>
     diminishing items. But I wish to take this 
     <lb/>
     occasion to say that I am never one who looks 
     <lb/>
     on the balance sheet of a Canadian province, 
     <lb/>
     the revenue from that province, or the federal 
     <lb/>
     disbursements in the province as a fair test 
     <lb/>
     of the contribution the province makes. We 
     <lb/>
     have "have" provinces in this country, and 
     <lb/>
     certain provinces which do not collect as 
     <lb/>
     much revenue. I am not one who accepts 
     <lb/>
     that as a criterion of the place that province 
     <lb/>
     occupies in confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PROB1">Mr. Probe</persName>: In section 23 it is stated that 
     <lb/>
     Canada will assume certain debts of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Newfoundland, and that the 
     <lb/>
     province itself will retain its surplus, as 
     <lb/>
     indicated in section 24. May I ask first of 
     <lb/>
     all in regard to section 23 whether there are 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland at the present time any 
     <lb/>
     arrears of debt for which Newfoundland is 
     <lb/>
     responsible, or for which she would be 
     <lb/>
     responsible if she were not entering confed<lb break="no"/>eration?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: No. The debt of Newfound<lb break="no"/>land has been fully serviced and all matur<lb break="no"/>ities have been met. The debt which Canada 
     <lb/>
     is assuming, as the Prime Minister explained, 
     <lb/>
     is its external debt, the debt which is payable 
     <lb/>
     in sterling. I am informed that all of that 
     <lb/>
     debt is now callable, if that is desired, at 
     <lb/>
     any time on three months' notice. 
     <lb/>

            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PROB1">Mr. Probe</persName>: With respect to the guarantees 
     <lb/>
     for corporations or institutions within New<lb break="no"/>foundland, are they also up to date or are 
     <lb/>
     there arrears of debts for which Newfound<lb break="no"/>land has some responsibility? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: So far as I am aware—and I 
     <lb/>
     am sure I am correctly informed—all obliga<lb break="no"/>tions of Newfoundland have been fully met. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACN2">Mr. MacNicol</persName>: Mr. Chairman, I agree with 
     <lb/>
     some of the remarks made by the minister. 
     <lb/>
     I do not think we should split hairs, or be too 
     <lb/>
     much alarmed by a consideration of what 
     <lb/>
     Canada is going to get at the present time or 
     <lb/>
     in a certain number of years as a financial 
     <lb/>
     return from Newfoundland. The island has 
     <lb/>
     not had the opportunity it should have had. 
     <lb/>
     I have made an exhaustive survey of the 
     <lb/>
     facts, and I am convinced that it can do much 
     <lb/>
     better than it has done. I believe we have 
     <lb/>
     nothing to fear in that regard. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The railway has been mentioned. The first 
     <lb/>
     thing I would suggest to the minister and the 
     <lb/>
     government would be a plan for reservicing 
     <lb/>
     the railway for standard-gauge cars. It is a 
     <lb/>
     narrow-gauge line, and much more time is 
     <lb/>
     required to go from Port aux Basques to St. 
     <lb/>
     John's than should be required. The faster 
     <lb/>
     the trains could cover that distance, the more 
     <lb/>
     money would be made by the railway. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Therefore that is one of the first suggestions 
     <lb/>
     I would make, namely that it be made a 
     <lb/>
     standard-gauge line. Then I would suggest 
     <lb/>
     further equipment for the port of Port aux 
     <lb/>
     Basques so that larger ships, capable of 
     <lb/>
     carrying cars, could be unloaded quickly and 
     <lb/>
     reloaded rapidly at Port aux Basques. I can 
     <lb/>
     see myself at some time in the future board<lb break="no"/>ing a train at Toronto, one properly equipped 
     <lb/>
     and having proper sleeping accommodation, 
     <lb/>
     and remaining on that train until I reached 
     <lb/>
     St. J ohn's, Newfoundland. I do not see how 
     <lb/>
     the railway can be made to pay unless it is 
     <lb/>
     equipped so that people can travel on it in 
     <lb/>
     modern equipment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It will take a few years to have that done; 
     <lb/>
     but the sooner it is done the sooner that rail<lb break="no"/>way will be able to produce a revenue. At 
     <lb/>
     the present time the passenger traffic on it is 
     <lb/>
     not as heavy as it should be. I have found 
     <lb/>
     the general service satisfactory, although the 
     <lb/>
     sleeping accommodation was a little cramped 
     <lb/>
     for me. However, a modern car would 
     <lb/>
     eliminate that difficulty. I found the meals 
     <lb/>
     quite satisfactory. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We will have an opportunity, not only to 
     <lb/>
     build up Canada but to build up this new 
     <lb/>
     province. I would not hedge at all in giving 
     <lb/>
     it opportunities to develop. It has vast re<lb break="no"/>sources of pulpwood. If the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Dufferin-Simcoe were here he could tell 


            <pb n="411" facs="final/images/NFLD_H_of_C_1949-02-09_Page_0411.jpg"/>
            <fw type="dateline">FEBRUARY 9, 1949</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">Newfoundland</hi></fw>  <fw type="num">411</fw>
         

     the committee much more effectively than 
     <lb/>
     I can just what results might be expected 
     <lb/>
     from that pulpwood. A condition exists there 
     <lb/>
     that does not exist in Canada or anywhere 
     <lb/>
     else that I know of, although it may in Nor<lb break="no"/>way, whereby the forests regrow in thirty 
     <lb/>
     years. I never saw such forest growth in 
     <lb/>
     my life as I saw in Newfoundland. This is 
     <lb/>
     brought about by the moisture content of the 
     <lb/>
     air and the ameliorating temperatures, the 
     <lb/>
     country being of course surrounded by water. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I hope the minister does not become dis<lb break="no"/>tracted by thinking there is any possibility 
     <lb/>
     that we are not going to be able to carry 
     <lb/>
     out our obligations. Give the island a chance 
     <lb/>
     and it will pay its way. It has not had a 
     <lb/>
     chance up to the present. The same applies 
     <lb/>
     to the fisheries. The whole service should 
     <lb/>
     be made more rapid than it is today so that 
     <lb/>
     people may travel back and forth more 
     <lb/>
     quickly. They should be able to ship more 
     <lb/>
     rapidly the goods they sell and in that way 
     <lb/>
     develop their business. The more business 
     <lb/>
     they do, the more they will be able to buy 
     <lb/>
     from us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I made a comparison of the costs to the 
     <lb/>
     consumer in Newfoundland. I found that 
     <lb/>
     people along the coast were generally op<lb break="no"/>posed to confederation. One argument I used 
     <lb/>
     was that it would cost them much less to live 
     <lb/>
     if they were part of Canada because their 
     <lb/>
     present rates of duty are so high. I found 
     <lb/>
     that the cost of ordinary groceries, food and 
     <lb/>
     other articles was from fifty per cent to one 
     <lb/>
     hundred per cent more than in Canada. If 
     <lb/>
     these people are given an opportunity to buy 
     <lb/>
     at rates comparable to what we pay, they will 
     <lb/>
     buy much more. That will be better for the 
     <lb/>
     older provinces of Canada and it will help 
     <lb/>
     to reduce the deficits on the railroad by 
     <lb/>
     providing more freight. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I am for one not going to endorse the 
     <lb/>
     expectation that Newfoundland is going to 
     <lb/>
     embarrass Canada financially. I look at the 
     <lb/>
     bright side of things. I think union will be 
     <lb/>
     most helpful to Canada. We can work 
     <lb/>
     together. They should be given a chance to 
     <lb/>
     come up to our standards in every way. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GREE1">Mr. Green</persName>: Has the government any plans 
     <lb/>
     in mind for the promoting of industry in 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland? Section 24(2)(c) reads:

            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     <lb/>
     but nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the

            <p>
     Apparently that contemplates that the pro<lb break="no"/>vincial government of Newfoundland will 


            <cb/>

assist in the development of industry, but I 
     <lb/>think it is of the utmost importance that the 
     <lb/>federal government should also promote the 
     <lb/>establishment of industries in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>We have much the same kind of problem on 
     <lb/>the west coast. There is a greater need for 
     <lb/>assistance of this kind in the remote provinces 
     <lb/>than there is in the central provinces. Can 
     <lb/>the minister tell us whether the government 
     <lb/>has in mind assisting in the development of 
     <lb/>industries in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: My hon. friend will appreciate 
     <lb/>
     that primarily this comes under the juris<lb break="no"/>diction of the Minister of Trade and Com<lb break="no"/>merce. The minister was down in Newfound<lb break="no"/>land last week, and prior to that officers of 
     <lb/>
     his department, acting on the assumption 
     <lb/>
     that union was probable, were down in New<lb break="no"/>foundland going over the industrial situation 
     <lb/>
     and making a survey of what could be done 
     <lb/>
     and in what way the federal government 
     <lb/>
     could assist, not only during the transitional 
     <lb/>
     period but in the development of such indus<lb break="no"/>tries as might be suitable to Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The paragraph to which my hon. friend has 
     <lb/>
     referred was put in because, as may be seen 
     <lb/>
     from the section itself, Newfoundland is being 
     <lb/>
     permitted to retain its surplus, which amounts 
     <lb/>
     to some $26 million. That is a rather unusual 
     <lb/>
     provision when the dominion is taking over 
     <lb/>
     most of the debt, but it was felt that it was 
     <lb/>
     quite proper that that should be done and the 
     <lb/>
     surplus made available to the new provincial 
     <lb/>
     government for whatever purposes it saw fit 
     <lb/>
     to use it in the interests of the province. 
     <lb/>
     However, it was felt that it would not be 
     <lb/>
     appropriate that it should be used to subsidize 
     <lb/>
     the sale of Newfoundland products so that 
     <lb/>
     they might enter into unfair competition with 
     <lb/>
     those of the other provinces. That was a con<lb break="no"/>dition in the original proposals for union and 
     <lb/>
     it was continued in this arrangement.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GREE1">Mr. Green</persName>: The minister has said that this

     would point out to him that the industrial

     bank could be of great help in Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     and I should like to know whether any steps

     During recent months we have been receiv<lb break="no"/>ing complaints in the west that the industrial

     <lb/>
     assisting industry. If they adopt a policy of

     that kind in Newfoundland there will not be

     <lb/>
     which have good prospects of being repaid. 
     <lb/>
     I think the hon. member will find when we

     of that bank and of the Bank of Canada I 
     <lb/>
     think he will find they were to the effect 
     <lb/>
     that a policy has been deliberately adopted 
     <lb/>
     of not being so free with loans. It is not a 
     <lb/>
     matter of whether the loans will be repaid; 
     <lb/>
     it is simply a matter of holding down expan<lb break="no"/>sion. There has been considerable criticism 
     <lb/>
     over a policy of that type being adopted on 
     <lb/>
     the west coast and I suggest to the minister 
     <lb/>
     that he check the situation because I think 
     <lb/>
     it is as I have stated. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: I am sure my hon. friend does 
     <lb/>
     not want me to debate the operations of the 
     <lb/>
     industrial development bank. I have been 
     <lb/>
     following them pretty closely and there will 
     <lb/>
     be an opportunity later in the session to 
     <lb/>
     consider its operations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CLAX1">Mr. Claxton</persName>: I should like to supplement 
     <lb/>
     the answer of my colleague to the question 
     <lb/>
     put by the hon. member for Vancouver 
     <lb/>
     South about the promotion of industry. I 
     <lb/>
     can say that, in anticipation of the possi<lb break="no"/>bility or probability that union would take 
     <lb/>
     place on March 31, officers of the Depart<lb break="no"/>ment of Trade and Commerce were sent to 
     <lb/>
     St. John's. There is also a committee of 
     <lb/>
     senior officials in Ottawa specially appointed 
     <lb/>
     to deal with problems of the continuation 
     <lb/>
     and development of industry in Newfound<lb break="no"/>land. Further, a special inquiry was made 
     <lb/>
     by a team of ofl'icials into the prospects and 
     <lb/>
     outlook of' the seventy-five relatively small 
     <lb/>
     industries that exist in Newfoundland to see 
     <lb/>
     by what means they could be assisted and 
     <lb/>
     encouraged. If the Minister of Trade and 
     <lb/>
     Commerce were here he would, I think, be 
     <lb/>
     able to give one or two rather striking illus<lb break="no"/>
 

            <cb/>

trations of the way in which we expect that 
     <lb/>
     union will assist the development of industry 
     <lb/>
     in Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GREE1">Mr. Green</persName>: Does the Minister of National 
     <lb/>
     Defence know of any definite plan for assist<lb break="no"/>ing industry there? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CLAX1">Mr. Claxton</persName>: Yes. Some steps have already 
     <lb/>
     been taken to meet certain special needs of 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland industry—for example, in the 
     <lb/>
     supply of raw materials. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">The Deputy Chairman</persName>: We are dealing 
     <lb/>
     with section 24. When the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Vancouver South rose I was just about to . 
     <lb/>
     ask the committee if they would carry sec<lb break="no"/>tion 23. I wonder if they would do that now? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD8">Mr. Macdonnell</persName> (Muskoka-Ontario): As I 
     <lb/>
     understand it, we still have to get certain 
     <lb/>
     information which has been asked for under 
     <lb/>
     section 23, and which the Minister of Finance 
     <lb/>
     is to give us tomorrow. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: Whether it comes under section 
     <lb/>
     23 or section 24 is immaterial. Section 23 
     <lb/>
     happens to relate to the assumption of the 
     <lb/>
     debt. I undertook to obtain for the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Rosedale, and I should be able to 
     <lb/>
     have it at the opening of the house tomorrow 
     <lb/>
     afternoon, a statement by main heads of the 
     <lb/>
     major items of expenditure. I could not give 
     <lb/>
     it to him broken down by individual depart<lb break="no"/>ments, but I presume the committee want to 
     <lb/>
     know the main headings showing how the 
     <lb/>
     figure of $50 million which I have given is 
     <lb/>
     made up. I hope to be able to have that 
     <lb/>
     tomorrow afternoon. There are, of course, a 
     <lb/>
     great many non-recurring items in that 
     <lb/>
     figure. There are amounts which have to 
     <lb/>
     be paid in adjustment of accountable 
     <lb/>
     advances, taking over consumable stores, and 
     <lb/>
     that sort of thing, which are referred to in 
     <lb/>
     the document. I will have that statement 
     <lb/>
     available for the committee tomorrow after<lb break="no"/>noon.   
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD8">Mr. Macdonnell</persName> (Muskoka-Ontario): I would 
     <lb/>
     suggest that section 23 be left over. It seems 
     <lb/>
     to me it is always better to have a section 
     <lb/>
     still under review, and not be discussing it 
     <lb/>
     afterwards when it is supposed to have been 
     <lb/>
     passed. Then we seem to be at a disadvan<lb break="no"/>tage in asking questions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">The Deputy Chairman</persName>: I should like to 
     <lb/>
     say to the hon. member that the only point 
     <lb/>
     I had in mind was to keep things in order. 
     <lb/>
     I wanted to keep the record straight. But if 
     <lb/>
     the committee decides to let section 23 stand, 
     <lb/>
     that is all right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: For instance, I could give the 
     <lb/>
     information under section 26, which provides 
     <lb/>
     for the financial payments to Newfoundland. 
     <lb/>
     I think it is immaterial under which section 
     <lb/>
     I give it.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK1">Mr. Jackman</persName>: The minister has been good 
     <lb/>
     enough to say he will give a breakdown of 
     <lb/>
     probable expenditures. Will he also give 
     <lb/>
     us a breakdown of the estimated federal 
     <lb/>
     revenue? We have been given two figures, 
     <lb/>
     $20 million and $27 million. I am sure that 
     <lb/>
     each of the items which go to make that up- 
     <lb/>
     and there are about nine or ten listed in the 
     <lb/>
     pamphlet—was the subject of considerable 
     <lb/>
     discussion between our delegation and the 
     <lb/>
     Newfoundland delegation. I believe we are 
     <lb/>
     entitled to know on what the estimate is 
     <lb/>
     based. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: I could give that at once. I 
     <lb/>
     have that here if my hon. friend wishes it, 
     <lb/>
     but I have to put the expenditure item over 
     <lb/>
     until tomorrow.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK1">Mr. Jackman</persName>: If the minister would table

     it, I think it might be quite adequate.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK1">Mr. Jackman</persName>: May I ask the minister 
     <lb/>
     whether or not there are any outstanding 
     <lb/>
     tax agreements between Newfoundland and 
     <lb/>
     any taxpayers in the former dominion. If 
     <lb/>
     there are any such agreements, is it to be 
     <lb/>
     the policy of Canada to honour them? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: On the question of the agree<lb break="no"/>ments to which my hon. friend refers, the 
     <lb/>
     colony or dominion of Newfoundland has 
     <lb/>
     entered into agreements, for income-tax 
     <lb/>
     concessions and customs concessions, with 
     <lb/>
     certain corporations in Newfoundland. In the 
     <lb/>
     terms of union there is a provision, section 27, 
     <lb/>
     subsection 4, which reads: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The government of the province of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     shall not, by any agreement entered into pursuant to 
     <lb/>
     this term, be required to impose on any person or 
     <lb/>
     corporation taxation repugnant to the provisions of 
     <lb/>
     any contract entered into with such person or cor<lb break="no"/>poration before the date of the agreement and sub<lb break="no"/>sisting at the date of the agreement. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     The "term" referred to in that clause is the 
     <lb/>
     term enabling them to have a tax agreement 
     <lb/>
     with the dominion. The tax concession agree<lb break="no"/>ments to which my hon. friend has referred 
     <lb/>
     are agreements which of course were entered 
     <lb/>
     into with the government of Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     and not with the government of Canada. The 
     <lb/>
     policy to be followed with respect to those 
     <lb/>
     agreements will be a matter for this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to decide. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JACK1">Mr. Jackman</persName>: The minister does not care to 
     <lb/>
     express an opinion on the policy which he 
     <lb/>
     thinks would be a fair one in the circum<lb break="no"/>stances? After all, there are certain agree<lb break="no"/>ments in Newfoundland with high contracting 
     <lb/>
     parties, certain sovereign powers. I presume 
     <lb/>
     those agreements might be respected in the 
     <lb/>
     same way as taxation agreements. In other 
     <lb/>
     words, would the minister care to say 
     <lb/>
     whether the policy in the case of a high con<lb break="no"/>

     <lb/>be different from the policy for an ordinary

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: Of course, the agreements to 
     <lb/>
     which my hon. friend refers are contracts,

     and there is in the terms of union nothing

     that deprives the contracting parties, the

     beneficiaries of these tax concessions, of any 
     <lb/>
     legal right which they have. Newfoundland 
     <lb/>
     will of course become a province of Canada,

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:COCK2">Mr. Alan Cockeram</persName> (York South): Before 
     <lb/>
     the house adjourns, I rise to a question of 
     <lb/>
     privilege. I did not do so earlier for the 
     <lb/>
     reason that it was necessary for me to check 
     <lb/>
     the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Hansard</hi> record to make sure of the words 
     <lb/>
     used by the Minister of Finance (Mr. Abbott). 
     <lb/>
     I wish to refer to the statement made by the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Finance earlier this afternoon in 
     <lb/>
     which he implied that, in putting the question 
     <lb/>
     I asked before the orders of the day, I did 
     <lb/>
     so as a representative of special interests. 
     <lb/>
     Referring to myself he said: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     I am aware of the special interest which he has

            </p></quote>

            <p>
     I ask the Minister of Finance to withdraw 
     <lb/>
     that statement. I asked the question because 
     <lb/>
     the gold mining industry has a far-reaching 
     <lb/>
     influence on the general economy of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and on the welfare of every Canadian citi<lb break="no"/>zen. My only interest is that of a Canadian, 
     <lb/>
     and I resent the imputation contained in the 
     <lb/>
     minister's words. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: Mr. Speaker, of course I have 
     <lb/>
     nothing to withdraw.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:COCK2">Mr. Cockeram</persName>: You certainly have.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: I said what I know to be a 
     <lb/>
     fact. My hon. friend has a special interest in 
     <lb/>
     the subject on which he questioned me. I

     have reason to know that, because on numer<lb break="no"/>ous occasions he has spoken to me about it; 
     <lb/>he has made numerous speeches in the house 
     <lb/>on the subject, and I made a completely 
     <lb/>accurate statement of fact. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

    

    
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:COCK2">Mr. Cockeram</persName>: Mr. Speaker, I object to 
     <lb/>
     this whole proceeding, because I have never 
     <lb/>
     obtained an honest or frank statement from 
     <lb/>
     the minister on any question I have asked 
     <lb/>
     in this house. He always comes back with a 
     <lb/>
     flippant reply which does not mean a thing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ABBO2">Mr. Abbott</persName>: If I were given to rising on 
     <lb/>
     questions of privilege I would ask my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend to withdraw the statement that he has 
     <lb/>
     never received an honest statement from me, 
     <lb/>
     but knowing my hon. friend as well as I do 
     <lb/>
     I will not bother to ask him to withdraw it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DREW2">Mr. Drew</persName>: Mr. Speaker, because of the 
     <lb/>
     particular manner of the reply that has been 
     <lb/>
     made by the minister, there can be no doubt 
     <lb/>
     whatever that the words implied a special 
     <lb/>
     interest on the part of the member, and he 
     <lb/>
     should withdraw that imputation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:COCK2">Mr. Cockeram</persName>: I am not prepared to let it 
     <lb/>
     go at that. The manner in which the minis<lb break="no"/>ter made that statement implied dishonesty 
     <lb/>
     or some such thing on my part, and I want 
     <lb/>
     him to withdraw. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. Speaker</persName>: I believe both sides of the 
     <lb/>
     house have accepted the statement made by 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member, and the statement made by 
     <lb/>
     the minister. I do not believe the character 
     <lb/>
     either of the member or of the minister has 
     <lb/>
     been assailed. There is no doubt about the 
     <lb/>
     honesty of either, and I think both sides 
     <lb/>
     should be satisfied.
