               Mr. Low: If the government of Newfound- 
               <br />
               land are to be expected to render their people 
               <br />
               the services they require, it seems to me that 
               <br />
               the resources will play an important part. 
               <br />
               If the provincial government ﬁnds, however, 
               <br />
               that it has control of only a small portion of 
               <br />
               the resources, then their chances of rendering 
               <br />
               to the people a high type of social services, 
               <br />
               and so on, will be much less than would 
               <br />
               otherwise be the case. In so many provinces, 
               <br />
               it was found after confederation that a large 
               <br />
               percentage of the resources had been alien- 
               <br />
               ated from the crown. I do not know what 
               <br />
               the situation is in Newfoundland, but it seems 
               <br />
               to me that the people of the rest of Canada 
               <br />
               should know just what it is. Can the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister give us some idea as to what portion 
               <br />
               of the resources has already been alienated 
               <br />
               from the crown so that they would not be 
               <br />
               under the effective control of the new provin— 
               <br />
               cial government? Perhaps, if it is possible 
               <br />
               for him to do so, he would supply the house 
               <br />
               with a list of the concessions that have been 
               <br />
               granted, together with the names of the 
               <br />
               holders of timber areas, land grants, or any 
               <br />
               other part of the natural resources of New- 
               <br />
               foundland, and give us some idea of the 
               <br />
               extent of these particular concessions. I think

               concession of large timbered areas, from 
               <br />

               the control of the provincial government and

               been a few mineral leases in that area, but 
               <br />
               my understanding is that the greater portion

               <br />

               Mr. Low: After the resources had been 
               <br />
               turned back to us in 1931 we found of course 
               <br />
               that about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">52%</span> per cent of a good many of 
               <br />
               these resources had been alienated from the 
               <br />
               crown. That was true of oil. That is why 
               <br />
               today the people of Alberta cannot recover, 
               <br />
               for their own services, the royalties from 
               <br />
               those parts that were alienated. I appreciate 
               <br />
               the statement the Prime Minister has made, 
               <br />
               but I just wondered if it would not be 
               <br />
               possible to obtain a list of the concession 
               <br />
               holders in order to have it on the record. I 
               <br />
               say that for this reason. Some day the people 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland may come back and ask 
               <br />
               for a revision of the ﬁnancial arrangement, 
               <br />
               at any rate. The people of Canada ought to 
               <br />
               know under what conditions they are 
               <br />
               operating. If the rest of Canada has on 
               <br />
               Hansm'd a record of the list of concessions 
               <br />
               and the extent of them, then the people will 
               <br />
               have at least some basis on which to form 
               <br />
