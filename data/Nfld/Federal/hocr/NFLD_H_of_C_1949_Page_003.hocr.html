               in this house since confederation; it is a 
               <br />
               motion which it carried in its present form 
               <br />

               another motion. The continuance of this 
               <br />
               debate rests entirely upon that assumption, 
               <br />
               which, it seems to me, is not consistent with 
               <br />
               our parliamentary practice.

               some handicap in debating a motion such as 
               <br />
               this because it deals with the address of His

               shall be limiting ourselves to Thursday and

               Friday. Without notice of another motion we 
               <br />
               might ﬁnd ourselves in a difficult position 
               <br />
               if the proposal of the government should 
               <br />

               <br />
               the house to make an order and expecting the 
               <br />

               <br />
               moved my motion in this form because I had 
               <br />

               that this motion provides for the order of

               wish to have a debate this afternoon I am 
               <br />
               quite prepared to have it. I even suggested 
               <br />
               that we should have it. However, I was told 
               <br />
               that that would not meet their convenience 
               <br />
               because other arrangements had been made 
               <br />
               for the rest of the day. It was necessary to 
               <br />
               make some provision for tomorrow and 
               <br />
               Friday. 
               <br />

               On Friday I will move that the debate on 
               <br />
               the address be not given precedence during 
               <br />
               those days, but that precedence be given to 
               <br />
