               The fact is that members of this House of 
               <br />
               Commons and other legislative bodies in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               independence which is the hallmark of free 
               <br />
               parliaments. There is no reason on this or 
               <br />
               any other occasion to assume that merely 
               <br />
               because of the tag on which a member was 
               <br />
               elected he is simply to become a servile digit 
               <br />

               The practice is very well established, and 
               <br />
               on this occasion I think it would be well if 
               <br />
               I were to place before the house the opinion 
               <br />
               of a member whose virtues have been loudly 
               <br />

               ing of parliament, and of this parliament 
               <br />
               particularly. I would quote the words of the 
               <br />
               right hon. member for Glengarry (Mr. Mac-

               <br />
               always agreed on every subject; but in this 
               <br />
               instance surely I can offer to hon. members 
               <br />
               opposite no better advice than that of the 
               <br />
               man for whom they have shown such un-

               reserved respect in these past few days and 
               <br />

               Therefore I should like to read what the

               right hon. member for Glengarry said in

               <br />
               seems to me, set forth the very core of the 
               <br />
               consideration that should be in our minds. I 
               <br />
               shall quote his words, and these will be his

               ably protracted. But no such situation arises 
               <br />

               <br />
               any event. But even without that, the motion 
               <br />
               is wholly unnecessary, and therefore it is

               I think it is unfortunate that this debate 
               <br />
               must be interrupted, but my experience in the 
               <br />
               twelve years I have been here is that nor- 
               <br />
               mally the debate on the address lasts any- 
               <br />
               where from three to six weeks. I realize that 
               <br />
               there is great urgency in connection with the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland agreement, but that urgency 
               <br />
               arises because of a situation not in our own 
               <br />
               country or in our own parliament but in the 
               <br />
               British parliament. May I say that that is 
               <br />
               the reason why we shall support the amended 
               <br />

               <br />
