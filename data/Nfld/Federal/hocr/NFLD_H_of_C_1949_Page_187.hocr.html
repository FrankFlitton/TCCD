               truly said that at the moment Newfoundland 
               <br />
               has not a legislature; it has a government. 
               <br />
               The legislature was set aside with the con- 
               <br />
               sent of Newfoundland, and a commission of 
               <br />
               government set up in 1934. Incidentally, may 
               <br />
               I add that the Statute of Westminster had 
               <br />
               then been in effect for several years, and up 
               <br />
               to that time the legislature of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               had the opportunity to say whether or not it 
               <br />
               wished to come within the provisions of that 
               <br />
               statute. The powers of the legislature, how- 
               <br />
               ever, were placed in the hands of the parlia- 
               <br />
               ment of Great Britain. It is for Great Britain 
               <br />
               now, as trustee of that legislature, dominion, 
               <br />
               colony, or whatever you want to call it, to 
               <br />
               decide whether or not it is in the interests 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland. I say that, so far as we in 
               <br />
               Canada are concerned, whether or not we 
               <br />
               agree with the method that was adopted in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland to bring about the agreement, 
               <br />
               our duty is to see that, in supporting the 
               <br />
               address, we are doing what is in the best 
               <br />
               interests of Canada. Because I believe that 
               <br />
               is so, I think we should proceed with the 
               <br />
               voting of the address.

               In 1934, as I have already said, the status 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland was changed at the request 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland herself, but was there ever 
               <br />
               more democratic procedure than that which 
               <br />
               was followed in relation to the entry of New- 
               <br />
               foundland into confederation? As there was 
               <br />
               no legislature, it is quite conceivable that the

               that it came up. The leader of the opposition
