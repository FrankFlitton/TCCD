               to its present state by an unwritten constitu-

               had a written constitution of any kind, and 
               <br />

               <br />
               He pointed out that, so far as possible, they

               as they were expressed at the imperial con- 
               <br />
               ference of 1921. He said it was unnecessary 
               <br />
               to lay down in black and white a constitution 
               <br />
               for the British empire, and pointed out that

               the United Kingdom has a constitutional

               structure based upon maxirns of one kind or 
               <br />
               another. There are certain countries that

               have written constitutions, such as France,

               adopted the Statute of Westminster but for

               certain reasons New Zealand and Australia

               more important question whether amendments

               majority of the provincial parliaments and/or gov- 
               <br />
               ernments. The usage here was that in six out of the 
               <br />
               seven amendments, action was taken by the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom parliament as a result of requests from the

               <br />
               either all or some of the provinces and none of. them 
               <br />
               was consulted. The amendmentof 1930 affected cer-

               tain provinces and these alone were consulted and 
               <br />
