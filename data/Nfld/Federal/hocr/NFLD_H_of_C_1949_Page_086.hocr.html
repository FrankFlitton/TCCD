               Mr. Hansel]: The Prime Minister has 
               <br />
               thanked us for some little advice that he may 
               <br />
               have received from members of the opposi-

               <br />
               the pie and give him some further advice. I 
               <br />
               appreciate what he has said with respect to 
               <br />
               the overbalancing of one side of the other

               place, but there is a way in which it can be 
               <br />
               overcome. I know that I am not voicing 
               <br />
               anything new, but from my experience here 
               <br />
               a feeling has grown upon me that we are in 
               <br />
               need of some parliamentary and electoral 
               <br />
               reform. No country remains static. We make 
               <br />
               progress. We change our ideas and we 
               <br />
               change the machinery which is used to put 
               <br />
               over those ideas. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I contend, Mr. Chairman, that the govern- 
               <br />
               ment and this entire house should give some 
               <br />
               consideration to a change in our parlia- 
               <br />
               mentary and electoral machinery and have 
               <br />
               the gentlemen who sit in the other place 
               <br />
               elected by common consent of the people of 
               <br />
               Canada. Personally I see no particular 
               <br />
               reason why in the other place there should be 
               <br />
               sitting two apparently separate bodies, one 
               <br />
               the counterpart of the government side of 
               <br />
               the house and the other the counterpart of 
               <br />
               the opposition side. Why cannot that body be 
               <br />
               a true example of a democratic institution? 
               <br />
               Let each member act independently and 
               <br />
               oppose or favour a measure as his experience 
               <br />
               guides him.

               I know it is difﬁcult to put this election idea

               <br />
               It is extremely difﬁcult to do that because 
               <br />
               naturally they like to have the privilege of

               that kind of thinking is retained in the public

               Mr. Rowe: The Minister of Justice has said 
               <br />
               that we have it now. It is reformed because 
               <br />
               nothing has been appointed to it for a number 
               <br />
               of years except reformers. However, the pre- 
               <br />
               decessor of the Prime Minister stated on one 
               <br />
               occasion, when asking about reforming the 
               <br />
               Senate, that no one was appointed to the 
               <br />
               Senate by his government except those who 
               <br />
               were committed to submit to any reforms the 
               <br />
               present party might design. Therefore I 
               <br />
               should like to ask the Prime Minister whether 
               <br />
               in the appointment of these new senators 
               <br />
               from Newfoundland he would inﬂict that 
               <br />
               obligation upon them which, I understand, 
               <br />
               has been inﬂicted upon every senator 
               <br />
               appointed by his government. 
               <br />

               Mr. St. Laurent: I know of no inﬂiction 
               <br />
               imposed upon any of the members in the 
               <br />
               other place, nor have I found in their reaction 
               <br />
               to notiﬁcation of appointment that they felt 
               <br />
               that anything was being inﬂicted upon them.
