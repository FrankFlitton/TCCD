               we should ﬁnd the obstacle so great that two

               legislative bodies, both supposed to have 
               <br />
               great powers, could not have managed some-

               <br />
               of will. I have seen lawyers get around 
               <br />
               situations of that kind simply by adding the

               words, “Notwithstanding anything in this
