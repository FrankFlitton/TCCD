               Mr. St. Laurent: I am told it has been so

               long since elections were held in Newfound-

               <br />
               which were along the lines of the statement

               made by the Minister of Reconstruction and 
               <br />

               it behooves us to go out and see that they vote

               sible to have representation during this 
               <br />
               session, because that would mean that the

               an election. That would account for April

               if gentlemen were elected to this parliament

               twice before they really became members of 
               <br />
               parliament. We would have to wait and see

               how events developed in order to determine 
               <br />

               Mr. Fulton: There is one consideration 
               <br />
               which I feel should be borne in mind and 
               <br />
               given careful thought in making appoint- 
               <br />
               ments from Newfoundland to the other house. 
               <br />
               A number of hon. members have observed— 
               <br />
               with some degree of deprecation, I take it 
               <br />
               ——that there is in Newfoundland a substantial 
               <br />
               body <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">d‘opinion</span> which is opposed, we will 
               <br />
               say, not to the idea but to the method of 
               <br />
               confederation. I feel that that fact should 
               <br />
               be carefully borne in mind when appoint- 
               <br />
               ments are being made to the Senate. That 
               <br />
               body of opinion, which we understand is 
               <br />
               substantiel, is entitled to representation in 
               <br />
               the six appointments to be made to the other 
               <br />
               chamber. 1 think we can all take it as a fact 
               <br />
               that the purpose of the other house is, among 
               <br />
               other things, to provide representation for all

               groups of opinion, particularly minority 
               <br />
               groups, in the Canadian parliament. I would

               strongly urge that this matter be taken into 
               <br />
               consideration. Perhaps the Prime Minister

               appointments to the Senate has been in a 
               <br />

               haps the debate also offers a good opportunity
