               the zeal which he showed in upholding the 
               <br />
               cause of union. From the very beginning he 
               <br />
               made the cause of union his own. He spared 
               <br />
               neither time, energy, nor aught of his great 
               <br />
               abilities in seeking to bring about the happy

               oldest member of this House of Commons— 
               <br />
               I hasten to say, not oldest in years, but in 
               <br />
               years of membership in this house—to con-

               gratulate hon. members collectively on the

               quality, yes, the excellence of the debate which 
               <br />
               took place on the terms of union. The debate, 
               <br />
