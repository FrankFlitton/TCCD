               <br />
               voted with the rest of us for an amendment

               house had before it, on the same kind of 
               <br />
               motion, the amendment moved by the hon.

               hon. friends in the Social Credit party voted 
               <br />
               for that amendment, which asked that redis-

               amendment had been defeated, after they had

               there are some Liberals who are equally 
               <br />
               inconsistent; because there were a number 
               <br />
               of them in 1943 who, when redistribution 
               <br />

               <br />
               voted against it. In 1946 the Liberals turned 
               <br />
               around the other way, and all of them were

               <br />
               We voted for the amendment in 1943 even

               though it might have been said at that time

               Mr. Knowles: —the late Lord Bennett, made 
               <br />
               a statement with regard to parties and mem-

               <br />
               that the people of this country expect some- 
               <br />
               thing better of their public men than that, 
               <br />

               one with which I started out, and on which I

               ﬁnd myself agreeing with the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Calgary West (Mr. Smith). This whole 
               <br />
               business brings into bold relief the necessity 
               <br />
