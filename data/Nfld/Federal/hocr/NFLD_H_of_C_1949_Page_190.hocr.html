               <br />
               of the provinces of this great dominion. If 
               <br />
               there never has been laid down a procedure

               by which constitutional amendments can take 
               <br />
               place, a procedure which will preserve the 
               <br />
               rights of the provinces, then I say it is high 
               <br />
               time it was done. Perhaps this amendment 
               <br />
               provides the starting point from which such a

               I am not afraid to say what I would do as 
               <br />
               to the number of provinces that should con- 
               <br />
               sent to the bringing in of another province. 
               <br />
               If the reference mentioned in this amendemnt 
               <br />
               is placed before the provinces, I think it is 
               <br />
               reasonable to say to them that if two-thirds of 
               <br />
               the provinces express their desire to support 
               <br />
               this resolution, then the wishes of those two- 
               <br />
               thirds will be made the rule for Canada. I 
               <br />
               think that is the arrangement that is adhered 
               <br />
               to in the United States. But my opinion may 
               <br />
               not be the opinion of the provinces. Let them 
               <br />
               say. We are waiving even in this resolution 
               <br />
               one further safeguard to the constitution, and 
               <br />
               that is reference to the people themselves. 
               <br />
               That is a further safeguard that is used in 
               <br />
               the United States. I do not think it is at all 
               <br />
               unreasonable to consult with the provinces 
               <br />
               and to ask them for their support in laying 
               <br />
               down a procedure for future constitutional 
               <br />
               amendments. If two—thirds of them, or any 
               <br />
               other fraction agreed to by the provinces 
               <br />
               themselves, indicate their support of this 
               <br />
               resolution, on the terms that have been set out 
               <br />
               in the bill, I think the decision should be 
               <br />
               binding upon the whole of Canada. The pre— 
               <br />
               cedent would then be established for govern- 
               <br />

               I do not think there is anything further I 
               <br />
               should say at this time, except this one thing. 
               <br />
               When the leader of the C.C.F. says that it is 
               <br />
               time that we reviewed our constitution and 
               <br />
               laid down some procedure for bringing it 
               <br />
               more into line with the times in which we 
               <br />
               live, I should like to say that I have never 
               <br />
               been able to see why in the world anyone 
               <br />
               should be in a hurry when he is on the wrong 
               <br />
               road. Let us be sure that we are on the right 
               <br />
               road before we move, especially in regard to 
               <br />
               a matter that affects the rights and privileges 
               <br />
               of provinces that certainly have been given 
               <br />
               a good measure'of autonomy under the Brit-

               ish North America Act. I intend to support 
               <br />
               the amendment.

               was remarkable for three things. One of 
               <br />

               members of this parliament, representing all 
               <br />
               the people of Canada, expressed their views 
               <br />
               on this subject, and the good will and the 
               <br />
               good spirit with which the debate was con-

               debate was remarkable was the fact that the

               complex matters contained in the terms of 
               <br />
               union were thoroughly discussed, questions 
               <br />
               were raised and answered, and in the end 
               <br />
               there was still unanimity on both the sub-

               stance and the form of the terms. This,

               of the week were remarkable for the way 
               <br />

               passed in this house during my eight years 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parliament.</span> I refer to the Prime Minister of 
               <br />
               Canada (Mr. St. Laurent). He showed him- 
               <br />
               self to be a great parliamentarian and a great 
               <br />
               constitutional lawyer. He showed himself to 
               <br />
               have a grasp of this subject unequalled, I 
               <br />
               believe, in any part of Canada. He showed a 
               <br />
               frankness and a fairness that must have won 
               <br />
               the admiration of my hon. friends opposite, 
               <br />

               <br />
               succeeded him, we have two men whose

               names, in the minds and hearts of the people 
               <br />
