               degree of democracy should be used in the

               followed, namely a referendum vote of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               one. There may be a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> of opinion 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland between those who wanted

               responsible government and those who wanted

               best way to smooth out those differences 
               <br />

               terms of confederation as quickly as possible,

               I must ﬁrst agree with the view he has

               expressed, and maintain that, in so far as

               the entry of Newfoundland into confedera-

               erned by the stipulations not of an ordinary

               probably expedient to recall it.

               In my opinion, Mr. Speaker, the new bill 
               <br />
               before the house is a further departure from 
               <br />
               the provisions of the British North America 
               <br />
               Act and I take the liberty of drawing the 
               <br />
               attention of hon. members to that fact. When 
               <br />
               one is aware of the present government’s 
               <br />
               ideas on centralization, this breach assumes a 
               <br />
               great deal of importance. Not only do the 
               <br />
               government deliberately overrule a section of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act, but they dis- 
               <br />
               regard explicit undertakings agreed upon 
               <br />
               since 1934 with the people of Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               In November 1933 Newfoundland’s legislative 
               <br />
               assembly requested the suspension of its 
               <br />
               letters patent, and the said act was ratiﬁed 
               <br />
               by the British parliament. The act passed 
               <br />
               by the assembly of Newfoundland included 
               <br />
