               Mr. Drew: This is exactly a sample of the 
               <br />
               problem that the provinces faced when they 
               <br />
               were trying to deal with some of the minis- 
               <br />
               ters of the government at the time the con- 
               <br />
               ference still met before it was stopped by the 
               <br />
               dominion government. The minister knows 
               <br />
               perfectly well that there was a co-ordinating 
               <br />
               committee, that there was an economic com- 
               <br />
               mittee, that they prepared accurate computa- 
               <br />
               tions and that these computations were a 
               <br />
               matter of record; and he had this record in 
               <br />
               front of him when this was under discussion. 
               <br />
               These records were prepared and they showed 
               <br />
               that at that time the ﬁgure in the case of 
               <br />
               Ontario would be $12 for every man, woman 
               <br />
               and child in the province. The way in which 
               <br />
               it would work out was this. An estimate was 
               <br />
               made of the amount which it would be neces- 
               <br />
               sary for each province to raise under the plans 
               <br />
               put forward by the dominion government. 
               <br />
               Then in relation to that amount the economic 
               <br />
               experts worked out how much it would be 
               <br />
               necessary to raise in each province by this so- 
               <br />
               called registration fee, but which I described 
               <br />
               then, as on all earlier occasions that we dis- 
               <br />
               cussed it, as a poll tax. For that was and is the 
               <br />
               correct expression.

               Mr. Drew: The more you do of that the 
               <br />
               better. Mr. Chairman, now that I am in this 
               <br />
               chamber I do not intend to permit the con- 
               <br />
               tinued misrepresentation of what took place 
               <br />
               at the conference. When the suggestion is 
               <br />
               made that this was not discussed, let me read 
               <br />
               from the record of the proceedings the state- 
               <br />
               ment that was made at the conference, with 
               <br />
               the minister who has just taken his seat 
               <br />
               sitting at the table; and the fact that this 
               <br />
               discussion took place in accordance with my 
               <br />
               statement was not questioned because it could 
               <br />
               not be questioned. He knows it now as he 
               <br />
               knew it then. This is what the record says. 
               <br />
               Fortunately there is a record, because if 
               <br />
               there were no record these misrepresenta— 
               <br />
               tions could go on indeﬁnitely. You have been 
               <br />
               told that this was not discussed earlier. 
               <br />
