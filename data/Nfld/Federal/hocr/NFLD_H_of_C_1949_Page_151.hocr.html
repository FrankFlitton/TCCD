               rose because I could not understand what he

               <br />

               Canadian would have lost his domicile. I 
               <br />
               simply said that had never been the situa-

               not think my hon. friend meant to confuse the

               Canadians as they will be after March 31, 
               <br />
               with one who had to establish domicile. If a 
               <br />
               man is in fact a Canadian the question of 
               <br />
               domicile would not arise, even though he had 
               <br />
               been gone from Canada for twenty years 
               <br />
               before he enlisted in an allied service, if 
               <br />
               he had maintained his Canadian domicile. 
               <br />
               That is an entirely different matter.
