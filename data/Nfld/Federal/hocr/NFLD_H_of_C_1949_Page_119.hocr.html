               Mr. Howard C. Green (Vancouver South): 
               <br />
               On Monday last the Minister of Reconstruc- 
               <br />
               tion and Supply promised to have a further 
               <br />
               investigation made of the Fraserview build- 
               <br />
               ing project in Vancouver, in order to see if 
               <br />
               there was not some way in which the several 
               <br />
               hundred people already living in the area 
               <br />
               could be protected against interference with 
               <br />
               their property by Central Mortgage and 
               <br />
               Housing Corporation. In the intervening days 
               <br />
               I have received many heartrending letters 
               <br />
               from these people, and it would appear that 
               <br />
               the actions of the corporation have been 
               <br />
               unbelievably arbitrary and annoying. It the 
               <br />
               minister acts at once, it should be possible to 
               <br />
               have this sweeping expropriation plan altered. 
               <br />
               Can the minister make a further report 
               <br />
               today? I suggest that he himself take a plane 
               <br />
               to Vancouver and have this question settled.

               I would say that this subdivision is similar 
               <br />
               to that on Renfrew Heights. It seemed to lend 
               <br />
               itself well to development of this kind. Where 
               <br />
               so many veterans are involved, in such a

               the Toronto jail farm at Lansing, not the old 
               <br />
               Christie Street hospital or Chorley Park. I 
               <br />
               should like to hear from the Minister of 
               <br />
               Veterans Affairs and the Minister of National 
               <br />
               Defence about these matters, because the 
               <br />
               people are without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">homes</span> and have no place- 
               <br />
               to go. They have been turned out.

               question refers to the old Christie Street
