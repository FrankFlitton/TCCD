               In the ﬁrst war we were not prepared, and 
               <br />
               yet a million men went from the dominions 
               <br />
               to participate in the ﬁrst war. They went 
               <br />
               under the individual sovereignty status and 
               <br />

               <br />
               men 130,000 fell on the ﬁeld of battle. Those

               <br />
               in the period between the two wars another 
               <br />
               organization was started up. Eﬂ'orts of this 
               <br />
               kind in league of nations societies or peace 
               <br />
               societies have been a failure for 100 years or 
               <br />
               more. We remember the concert of Europe 
               <br />
               from 1815 to 1823, when Russia, Prussia, and 
               <br />
               Austria formed what was known as the Holy 
               <br />
               Alliance. They were going to survey condi- 
               <br />
               tions in Europe every ﬁve years and when war 
               <br />
               seemed- imminent they would endeavour to 
               <br />
               bring about peace. It was such a humbug that 
               <br />
               a great prime minister, George Canning, pro- 
               <br />
               posed that Britain get out of Europe 
               <br />
               altogether. It simply led to the Monroe 
               <br />
               doctrine. The Holy Alliance lasted from 1815 
               <br />
               to 1823 and culminated in what has come to 
               <br />
               be known as the Monroe doctrine. What was 
               <br />
               that doctrine? In a word, Mr. Chairman, it 
               <br />
               was nothing more than the supremacy of 
               <br />
               Britain on the seas. -And that is what has

               foreign policy of this country is and I am 
               <br />
               bound to say that I have failed in the attempt. 
               <br />
               We have no foreign policy and we never did 
               <br />
               have one. The foreign policy the minister 
               <br />
               announced earlier in the session was simply 
               <br />
               dependence upon the united nations organiza-

               We did nothing to encourage parliamentary

               <br />
               bring on a debate in the spring of 1947 regard- 
               <br />
               ing the scuttling of the empire. The empire 
               <br />
               has been cut to pieces. We have seen what 
               <br />

               the Mediterranean; we lost the Suez canal.
