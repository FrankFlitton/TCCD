               I am absolutely opposed to the policy of

               My own personal View with respect to

               these negotiations has been that it would be 
               <br />
               a serious responsibility to do or say anything 
               <br />
               which wouldI prevent the entry of Newfound- 
               <br />
               land into Canada. I may be an optimist, 
               <br />
               but I do believe that the Canadian nation 
               <br />
               is destined to occupy an import-ant place 
               <br />
               in world affairs. I do believe, further, that

               that place in world affairs would be better

               thereto was not closed to Canada by another 
               <br />
               sovereignty over the territories of Newfound-

               Because of that attitude, we made offers

               ments from the Canadian people at the

               on the part of the people of Newfoundland

               It might be that there would come about

               in Newfoundland a division of opinion that 
               <br />
               would show that the time was not ripe for 
               <br />
               union to take place, and that it would not
