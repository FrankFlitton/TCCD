               Excellency the governor in council. That was

               requested by the delegation from Newfound-

               31, 1949. They felt that there should be a

               proclamation immediately bringing a certain

               proper administration would have to be made, 
               <br />

               Perhaps the question may arise as to why 
               <br />
               it is necessary to have a statute passed by the 
               <br />
               parliament of the United Kingdom to conﬁrm 
               <br />
               the entry of Newfoundland into Canada. 
               <br />
               There are two reasons for that. One is that 
               <br />
               this does in fact, though it may not in form, 
               <br />
               amount to an amendment to, or a derogation 
               <br />
               from, the terms of the British North America 
               <br />
               Act in so far as Canada is concerned.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Hon. members will recall that under section 
               <br />
               146 of the British North America Act it was 
               <br />
               provided that Newfoundland might be 
               <br />
               admitted into the confederation upon joint 
               <br />
               addresses of the houses of parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada and of Newfoundland by order made 
               <br />
               by, then Her Majesty, on the advice of her 
               <br />
               council of the United Kingdom. This time 
               <br />
               it was not possible to comply, even if it had 
               <br />
               been desirable to do so, with the exact terms 
               <br />
               of the procedure set out in section 146, 
               <br />
               because there were no houses of parliament 
               <br />
               of the colony of Newfoundland; and secondly, 
               <br />
               it might not have been desirable to have that 
               <br />
               procedure resorted to because, since the enact- 
               <br />
               ment of the Statute of Westminster and as a 
               <br />
               consequence of constitutional developments, 
               <br />
               His Majesty, on the advice of his ministers 
               <br />
               responsible to the parliament of the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom, no longer exercises the prerogatives 
               <br />
               of the crown over Canada.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               His Majesty now, by reason of the situation 
               <br />
               or development which brought about the 
               <br />
               Statute of Westminster, and which is regis-

               <br />

               <br />
               respect of Canadian affairs upon, and only 
               <br />

               The second reason is that at the present

               <br />

               on the decision of its own parliament, should

               nized internationally, to make laws having 
               <br />
               extraterritorial effect as has the parliament 
               <br />

               <br />
               ment of Canada would hardly reach out and 
               <br />
               gather in a territory that was subject to the 
               <br />
               legislative and administrative jurisdiction of 
               <br />
               another autonomous nation. And whatever 
               <br />
               may be the ﬁne points of technical procedure 
               <br />
               in that regard, the relations between Canada 
               <br />
               and the United Kingdom are not such that 
               <br />
               anything which would appear so discourteous 
               <br />
               would be considered on either side.

               It was felt therefore that the most expedi- 
               <br />
               tious procedure might be to follow the pre- 
               <br />
               cedent which had been established when 
               <br />
               changes were made with respect to natural 
               <br />
               resources in the possession of the western 
               <br />
               provinces. There the entry of the western 
               <br />
               provinces into confederation had been accom- 
               <br />
               plished in accordance with the terms of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act. However, it was 
               <br />
               found that when it became advisable to 
               <br />
               modify those terms, their modiﬁcation would 
               <br />
               constitute a derogation from the express pro-

               visions of the British North America Act. In 
               <br />
               order to bring that modiﬁcation about in such 
               <br />
               a manner as to leave no doubt in any mind 
               <br />
               that it was done in a form beyond successful 
               <br />
               contestation before the courts, agreements 
               <br />
               were made between the government of Can-

               ada and the governments of each of the 
               <br />
               western provinces. The agreements contained 
               <br />
               clauses very similar to this section 50 which 
               <br />
               I have read to the house. Those agreements 
               <br />
               were to be subject to the approval of the 
               <br />
               Canadian parliament and the approval of the 
               <br />
               legislature of the province concerned, and 
               <br />
