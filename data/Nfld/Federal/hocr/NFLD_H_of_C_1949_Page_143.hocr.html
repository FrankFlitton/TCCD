               the Dawson report which I have just read. 
               <br />
               The fact is that the line between Truro and 
               <br />
               Sydney, including the crossing of the strait 
               <br />
               of Canso, has a capacity which is fully taken 
               <br />
               up at present by the business using that line 
               <br />
               of railway and the crossing of the strait. What 
               <br />
               the railway will do with any further trafﬁc 
               <br />
               is more or less of a mystery. The Minister 
               <br />
               of Transport knows how the members from 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia have urged him to consider 
               <br />
               improving the system, and particularly im- 
               <br />
               proving the crossing over the strait of Canso. 
               <br />
               The entry of Newfoundland into Canada, with 
               <br />
               the additional burden which will be placed 
               <br />
               upon the transportation system, although a 
               <br />
               burden we hope for and which is one of our 
               <br />
               objects, is only another reason added on top 
               <br />
               of the very valid arguments and reasons 
               <br />
               which have existed for years for properly

               In section 32 there is also mentioned a pro— 
               <br />
               posal to complete the motor road in New- 
               <br />
               foundland which in a few years’ time should 
               <br />
               make possible reasonable highway travel in 
               <br />
               the new province. The provision of a proper 
               <br />
               crossing for the strait of Canso is important 
               <br />
               from that point of view as well. No one will 
               <br />
               feel that the prospective trafﬁc will be prop- 
               <br />
               erly served unless a suitable crossing is pro- 
               <br />
               vided. The province of Nova Scotia has 
               <br />
               co-operated with the dominion government 
               <br />
               in what we understand was a thorough 
               <br />
               engineering survey of the crossing of the 
               <br />
               strait of Canso, the report on which we are 
               <br />
               anxiously awaiting from the minister. I 
               <br />
               think that indicates that the province of Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia is prepared to do its share in provid- 
               <br />
               ing for a part of the expense of a highway 
               <br />
               crossing of the strait. I hope the dominion 
               <br />
               government is prepared to do its part with 
               <br />
               respect to the provision of a reasonable and 
               <br />
               proper crossing from a railway point of view. 
               <br />
               I want to emphasize to the committee that 
               <br />
               the entry of Newfoundland is only one further 
               <br />
               but very important consideration which must 
               <br />
               be kept in mind.

               <br />
               Transportation difﬁculties in that region are 
               <br />
               referred to in the press from day to day. I 
               <br />
               noticed that the old ferry that crosses the 
               <br />
               strait is tied up because there is ice there, and 
               <br />
               they have to shift her to new moorings, and 
               <br />
               all that kind of thing. I have seen that in 
               <br />
               the press every day for the last week. The 
               <br />
               point I Ihould like to drive home to the 
               <br />
               government is that practically everyone who 
               <br />
               has ever discussed the improvement of trans- 
               <br />
               portation facilities in eastern Canada is 
               <br />
               agreed that it should be done. There is no 
               <br />
               difference of opinion. The reconstruction 
               <br />
               committee said it should be done; in the 
               <br />
               Dawson report—and these are all government 
               <br />
               agencies—it was stressed very strongly. The 
               <br />
               Disney report, the report of a railway engi- 
               <br />
               neer, said it could be done, that it was within 
               <br />
               reason as far as cost is concerned, and that 
               <br />
               there was no engineering problem. No one 
               <br />
               has disagreed with the necessity for it.

               Bringing Newfoundland within confedera- 
               <br />
               tion is going to mean a tremendous increase 
               <br />
               in trafﬁc on that end of the line. My infor- 
               <br />
               mation is that seventy-ﬁve per cent of the 
               <br />
               imports of Newfoundland previous to this 
               <br />
               agreement came from the United States by 
               <br />
               water. When Newfoundland ﬁnally hooks up 
               <br />
               with us and these agreements are ratiﬁed I 
               <br />
               believe those imports which were being 
               <br />
               brought in from the United States will come 
               <br />
               from Canada, which means they will have to 
               <br />
               be shipped down from Ontario and Quebec, 
               <br />
               dragged over that old, twisted, crooked one- 
               <br />
               track line, held up at the strait of Canso 
               <br />
               and then transferred to that inadequate ferry 
               <br />
               serv1ce now operating between North Sydney 
               <br />
               and Newfoundland. I think there must be 
               <br />
               an improvement right along the line. If we 
               <br />
               are to properly service that tenth province 
               <br />
               I think the government should get a report 
               <br />
               from the engineering commission as soon as 
               <br />
               possible and begin the necessary improve- 
               <br />
               ments down there. Unless that is done, 
               <br />
               because of the inadequacy of the transporta- 
               <br />
               tion facilities, Newfoundland will have to 
               <br />
               continue to bring in her imports by water 
               <br />
               from the United States. We have long delays 
               <br />
               at that end of the line now, with our ordinary
