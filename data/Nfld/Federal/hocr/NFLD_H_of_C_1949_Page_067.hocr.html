               The British North America Act contemplated that

               there might be union between Canada and New—

               I ask, ﬁrst, in view of the fact that under 
               <br />
               the Newfoundland Act, 1933, and the commis- 
               <br />
               sion report at that time, it was contemplated 
               <br />
               that responsible government would be 
               <br />
               restored, why is it that the plan of confedera- 
               <br />
               tion as provided for under section 146 of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act has not, in fact, 
               <br />
               been followed in this case? Secondly, what 
               <br />
               has the Canadian government done to remove 
               <br />
               the reasons for the objections that have been 
               <br />
               made by that very large minority that showed 
               <br />
               its strength in the vote on the two references? 
               <br />
               Thirdly, have any representations been 
               <br />
               received in opposition to the course followed 
               <br />
               by the Canadian government from groups of 
               <br />
               individuals in Newfoundland claiming to 
               <br />
               represent the seventy odd thousand who voted 
               <br />
               for the restoration of responsible government? 
               <br />
               If such representations have been made, 
               <br />
               would the Prime Minister table them and also 
               <br />
               table the replies given in reference thereto? 
               <br />
               Fourthly, and I think it is very important, the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition has made clear that 
               <br />
               our responsibility as Canadians is to vote on 
               <br />
               this legislation and in no way to infringe 
               <br />
               upon the sovereignty of another dominion. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Recognizing that, I should like to ask this 
               <br />
               question. In View of the fact that Newfound- 
               <br />
               landers will now become Canadians, and the 
               <br />
               desire of each of us must be to remove any pos- 
               <br />
               sibility of disunity by reason of the fact that 
               <br />
               the government has not followed the scheme 
               <br />
               set forth in the British North America Act 
               <br />
               to cover possible union in the future, has this 
               <br />
               government made any representations to the 
               <br />
               British government regarding the question 
               <br />
               whether or not it would be preferable that 
               <br />
               responsible government be restored in New- 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I think an answer to those questions would 
               <br />
               go a long way towards arousing the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland to a realization that we in
