               cratically elected representatives <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of.</span> New-

               foundland decided unanimously that at that

               <br />
               pressing the question of confederation with 
               <br />
               Canada; they would ask the people the two 
               <br />
               straightforward questions: are you in favour of 
               <br />
               continuing commission of government, or are 
               <br />
               you in favour of responsible government? In 
               <br />
               spite of that unanimous decision by the New- 
               <br />
               foundland convention the British government 
               <br />
               disregarded this expression of opinion and 
               <br />
               the people were obliged to express themselves 
               <br />
               on the three questions. I know that in the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst referendum there was not a clear major-

               ity. In the second referendum there was a 
               <br />
               small majority; but the charge is made that 
               <br />
               a large amount of money from outside New- 
               <br />
               foundland was used to inﬂuence opinion.
