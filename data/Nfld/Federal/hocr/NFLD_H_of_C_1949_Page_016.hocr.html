               At no time in the life of this parliament was 
               <br />
               it more important that the debate on the 
               <br />
               address should proceed without interruption

               <br />
               Hon. members opposite seem to forget that,

               technically at least, there has been a change

               of government with the change of prime

               Perhaps I should not have been amazed, 
               <br />
               but I must confess to some degree of surprise 
               <br />
               that the hon. member for Rosetown-Biggar 
               <br />
               (Mr. Coldwell) should have submitted so 
               <br />
               weakly this afternoon in the face of the 
               <br />
               government’s steam roller. That is evidence 
               <br />
               of an altogether too friendly association 
               <br />
               between Liberal members and the C.C.F. 
               <br />
               party in this house. If that is to be an 
               <br />
               example of the way in which that group is to 
               <br />
               function in opposition, then I suggest it come 
               <br />
               out in its true colours and proclaim itself as 
               <br />
               simply a wing of the government party. If 
               <br />
               we are to have a continuation of that attitude 
               <br />

               <br />
               expect from the C.C.F. party during this 
               <br />
               session will be a very friendly, mild and 
               <br />
               ladylike kind of criticism.

               Now, Mr. Speaker, there has been an 
               <br />
               attempt on the other side to ridicule the 
               <br />
               importance of this debate. The reason is 
               <br />
               perfectly obvious, Mr. Speaker. The fact of 
               <br />
               the matter is that the debate on the address 
               <br />
               gives the members of the opposition, yes, 
               <br />
               and such other private members of the house 
               <br />
               as choose to assert their freedom and respon- 
               <br />
               sibility as members of the house, an oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity to stand in their places and criticize 
               <br />
               the government on its past record, on its 
               <br />
               policy, on the contents of the speech from 
               <br />
               the throne, and on the omissions from it. 
               <br />
               Not only is this a duty; it is a responsibility 
               <br />
               which every member of the house must 
               <br />
               exercise according to his rights if he would 
               <br />
               do his duty by those whom he represents.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Necessarily, any government characterized 
               <br />
               by such ﬂaws in its record affords very great 
               <br />
               opportunity for criticism. If this debate is 
               <br />
               not throttled, or sidetracked by the govern- 
               <br />
               ment steam roller, there will be plenty of 
               <br />
               criticism of the government in this chamber 
               <br />
               during the course of this debate. Is it any 
               <br />
               wonder, Mr. Speaker, that a government 
               <br />
               which has shown itself so impatient of 
               <br />
               criticism would desire in this way to throttle

               This resolution means precisely what it

               says. It signiﬁes that the government is not 
               <br />
               prepared to permit parliament, in the 
               <br />
               ordinary way, to proceed in freedom to 
               <br />
               express criticism of government policy. The 
               <br />
               reason becomes all the more obvious in the

               the possibility of a general election. What

               <br />
               on the eve of an election, to throttle criticism 
               <br />
               in this house, and this at a time when much 
               <br />
               criticism is being heard from the people of 
               <br />
               this country. That is the measure of the 
               <br />
               government’s sense of responsibility to those 
               <br />
               to whom it owes responsibility, that, at this 
               <br />
               above all times, it should seek to stiﬂe

               criticism.

               In this house the day before yesterday,

               Mr. Speaker, we went through a form which

               is followed on the opening day in every 
               <br />
               parliament which stems from the mother of 
               <br />
               parliaments. In the measure which has 
               <br />
               been traditionally introduced respecting the 
               <br />

               ness of its choosing without ﬁrst having to 
               <br />
               take up the program laid down before it in 
               <br />
               the speech from the throne. Is that an empty 
               <br />
               formality? Is it simply a reminder that in 
               <br />
               days gone by a free parliament found itself 
               <br />
               at odds with a monarch?
