               In view of allegations repeatedly made to the 
               <br />
               contrary, I want to make it perfectly clear that 
               <br />
               neither Canada nor any Canadian participated 
               <br />
               directly. or indirectly, in the recent decision of the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland to seek union with Canada. 
               <br />
               On July 13, 1943, the then Prime Minister, the Right 
               <br />
               Hon. W. L. Mackenzie King, O.M., stated on the floor 
               <br />
               of the House of Commons that any idea of bringing 
               <br />
               Newfoundland into confederation must initiate “on 
               <br />
               the part of the people of Newfoundland rather than 
               <br />
               on the part of members of this house. certainly at 
               <br />
               this particular time. If the people of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               should ever decide that they wish to enter the 
               <br />
               Canadian federation and should make that decision 
               <br />
               clear beyond all possibility of misunderstanding. 
               <br />
               Canada would give most sympathetic consideration 
               <br />
               to the proposal."

               favourable position in which it would place 
               <br />
               Canada, both nationally and internationally, 
               <br />
               to be joined by Newfoundland. There is, 
               <br />
               however, no inconsistency in the unanimity 
               <br />
               of our support last week and the stand now 
               <br />
               taken by my leader in the amendment he has 
               <br />
               moved. The amendment has nothing to do 
               <br />
               with the desirability of confederation. We 
               <br />
               supported that desirability of union and we 
               <br />
               are unchanged in that view. But, sir, believ- 
               <br />
               ing as we do in confederation, we demand 
               <br />
               that the principles of confederation as set out 
               <br />
               in the British North America Act be complied 
               <br />
               with by the parliament of this country, to the 
               <br />
               end that our constitution shall be upheld. As 
               <br />
               I listened to my hon. friend the Minister of 
               <br />
               National Defence (Mr. Claxton), who appar- 
               <br />
               ently would make shortcuts through the 
               <br />
               constitution, I was reminded that in 1925
