               great human concern. No one can plead

               today, any more than he could plead then,

               be recalled that at that time the argument

               was put forth that it could be done under the

               undertakings which had been given in the

               the debate which has taken place about the

               <br />
               which must be considered here is whether 
               <br />
               or not this parliament has that measure of 
               <br />
               supremacy which makes it possible for it to

               deal with the things which could be done by 
               <br />
               the representatives of Canada. The argument

               support of the measures to which I have

               referred, and which undoubtedly were

               measures that were being sought by the

               <br />

               <br />
               had been made that the dominion government 
               <br />
               deal with the matter by virtue of its over- 
               <br />

               <br />
               argument had been made that this was 
               <br />
               something which it was essential for the

               <br />
               ments made in the debate. I read, from 
               <br />
               page 750 of Hansard of February 12, 1935, 
               <br />
               the words of the right hon. member for 
               <br />
               Glengarry. They are as follows:

               <br />
               to be as we all along have believed it to be. that, 
               <br />
               if a national scheme of unemployment insurance 
               <br />
               was to be drawn up. it could be done only in one 
               <br />
               of two ways. One way was by agreement with the 
               <br />
               provinces whereby they would act within their 
               <br />
               jurisdiction and the government of Canada would 
               <br />
               contribute grants in aid, as has been done in the 
               <br />
               case of old age pensions; the other way was by 
               <br />
               amending the British North America Act in a man-

               <br />

               conference with the provinces, if properly carried 
               <br />

               amendment of the British North America Act. but 
               <br />
               ﬁve years have been lost in the holding of any 
               <br />
               conference of the kind. I say here that we will yet
