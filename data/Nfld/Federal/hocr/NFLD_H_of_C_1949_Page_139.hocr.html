               Mr. Caldwell: The point I had in mind is 
               <br />
               this. This is under the British system. In 
               <br />
               Britain the telegraphs and telephones are all 
               <br />
               operated by the post <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬂ‘ice.</span> When we take 
               <br />
               over the post <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬂ'ice</span> and we take over the 
               <br />
               postal telegraphs and telephones, which dif- 
               <br />
               fers from what is done in other parts of 
               <br />
               Canada, is it the intention of the government 
               <br />
               to recommend that we continue to operate 
               <br />
               them as one service? It seems to me that 
               <br />
               that is the proper way to operate these com- 
               <br />
               munications. I have never been able to see 
               <br />
               why it is that in our country we have the 
               <br />
               telephones operated in one province by a 
               <br />
               provincial company and in other provinces 
               <br />
               by the Bell Telephone Company, and the 
               <br />
               telegraphs operated by railway companies 
               <br />
               and so on. It would be much more economical 
               <br />
               to have the whole thing under one heading. 
               <br />
               It has worked out very well where it has 
               <br />
               been done, as it has been done in most 
               <br />
               countries. What is the intention of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment in this regard?

               says, the position in Newfoundland with 
               <br />
               reference to telecommunications is entirely 
               <br />
               different from that in Canada. The radio 
               <br />
               service is divided into two parts, the ﬁrst part 
               <br />
               having to do with telephone and wireless and 
               <br />
               the other part having to do with ship-to-shore 
               <br />
               installations. That latter part will be taken 
               <br />
               over by the Department of Transport and 
               <br />
               operated as such. The former part, the part

               to which my hon. friend addresses his ques— 
               <br />
               tion, will be taken over by the government. 
               <br />
               So far it has not been determined whether 
               <br />
               the Canadian National Telegraphs will operate 
               <br />
               it but I presume it will. If it does, the Cana-

               That is not the intention thus far in New-
