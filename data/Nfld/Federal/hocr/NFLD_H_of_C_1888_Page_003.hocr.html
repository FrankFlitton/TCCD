               He said: There is a Bill before the House standing, I 
               <br />
               think, for its second reading, introduced by the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Frontenac (Mr. Kirkpatrick), which relates closely 
               <br />
               to this subject, and I sincerely hepe the hon. member will 
               <br />
               press his Bill, and that it will receive the support of both 
               <br />
               sides of this House. His Bill is to permit American vessels 
               <br />
               to aid vessels which are wrecked or disabled in Canadian 
               <br />
               waters. I suppose that that Bill would not have been in- 
               <br />
               troduced by that hon. gentleman unless the Canadian au- 
               <br />
               thorities had hitherto prevented American vessels from 
               <br />
               aiding wrecked or disabled vessels in Canadian waters. I 
               <br />
               have no doubt, however, that the reason why the Canadian 
               <br />
               authorities took this exceeding harsh line was because the 
               <br />
               American Government prevented Canadian vessels from 
               <br />
               assisting vessels which were wrecked in American waters. 
               <br />
               I think it will be of considerable advantage to this 
               <br />
               House, in the consideration of the Bill to which I have 
               <br />
               referred, if these papers are bi ought down, so much, at 
               <br />
               least, as the Government feel at liberty to bring down, 
               <br />
               and I hepe they will bring them all down. The 
               <br />
               motion refers not only to correspondence and Orders in 
               <br />
               Council with reference to the refusal of the United 
               <br />
               States authorities to allow Canadian wrecking vessels 
               <br />
               and machinery to assist vessels in American waters, 
               <br />
               but also as to the refusal of the Canadian authorities 
               <br />
               to allow Americans to do so, so that we will have both 
               <br />
               features of the case before us when we have these papers. 
               <br />
               1 have no doubt, as I said before, that the Canadian author- 
               <br />
               ities could not have adopted the harsh measures which they 
               <br />
               have in this matter, and which are to be cured by this Bill, 
               <br />
               unless the Americans had done the same, but I Ô¨Ånd in the 
               <br />
               United States Congress they do not take exactly that view 
               <br />
               of the case. They seem to think that the Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern.</span> 
               <br />
               ment has acted much more harshly towards them than they 
               <br />
               have acted towards the Canadian Government. However, 
               <br />
               the ,apers <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wrllgshow</span> how that is. But in order to show
