               Mr. CHURCH: We are a party to Great 
               <br />
               Britain’s granting of a ninety-nine year lease, 
               <br />
               binding Canada with America, which is prac- 
               <br />
               tically a freehold of all the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               bases, and that includes Labrador inland as 
               <br />
               well as on the ocean. In view of that 
               <br />
               agreement, have we the power as a parliament 
               <br />
               to go into Newfoundland and give away, not 
               <br />
               only the bases, but the land and the bay 
               <br />
               where they are trying to develop a port? 
               <br />
               Ungava bay is a big bay and they have no 
               <br />
               port there yet, and the bill is in the dark 
               <br />
               on it. Have we the power to do this in 
               <br />
               view of the ninety-nine year lease made by 
               <br />
               the British government with the United 
               <br />
               States for the use of all these bases in New- 
               <br />
               foundland and right down to British Guiana, 
               <br />
               Which is the size of Great Britain? You 
               <br />
               know, Mr. Chairman, that in the last war 
               <br />
               German boats came right up the St. Lawrence 
               <br />
               and we had a secret meeting of parliament 
               <br />
               in connection with that. I contend that 
               <br />
               Canada is bound by that ninety-nine year 
               <br />
               lease and that we have no power to part with 
               <br />
               this property. 
               <br />

               These people told the railway committee 
               <br />
               that they had dealt with a former Newfound- 
               <br />
               land government before the war. I would ask 
               <br />
               the Minister of Transport, what was the nature 
               <br />
               of the arrangement, if any, the said company 
               <br />
               made with the old provisional government of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland? What form did it take? Was 
               <br />
               it just an act of the provisional government? 
               <br />
               If it was, no wonder Newfoundland went 
               <br />
               bankrupt. I think the committee is entitled 
               <br />
               to this information. Does not the agreement 
               <br />
               with the United States for a ninety-nine year 
               <br />
               lease of bases include not only the bases on 
               <br />
               the ocean but the bases on the land and in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland and all of Labrador, and all 
               <br />
               the inlets on the coast? In the last war 
               <br />
               German boats were up near Iceland and 
               <br />
               Greenland, oﬁ' Newfoundland, and in the St. 
               <br />
               Lawrence and Hudson strait, and we had to 
               <br />
               send ships up there. It cost a lot of money 
               <br />
               and lives.

               for the general advantage of Canada when the 
               <br />
               territory and inlets are not in Canada at all? 
               <br />
               We might just as well claim that inlets and

               if the legal department of the crown has been 
               <br />
               consulted about this bill. I do not like 
               <br />
               to worry the Minister of Justice. I shall not 
               <br />
               ask him for his legal opinion, but I think he 
               <br />
               should have been consulted as to whether 
               <br />
               this bill is worth the paper it is written on. 
               <br />
               It goes over the heads of the Canadian and 
               <br />
               British governments and over the head of the 
               <br />
               provisional government of Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               Great Britain had a temporary trusteeship 
               <br />
               over the whole country of Newfoundland while 
               <br />
               the war was on. I should like to know who 
               <br />
               drafted and recommended this bill. I think 
               <br />
               all that information should be on the table. 
               <br />
               So far as I am concerned I do not think it 
               <br />
               makes any difference. I feel that I have done 
               <br />
               my duty as a member of parliament in calling 
               <br />
               the attention of the committee to what is 
               <br />
               involved in this omnibus bill.

               any difficulty in answering the hon. member’s 
               <br />
               question. This bill, no more than any other 
               <br />
               bill which is approved by a. committee of 
               <br />
               the house, creates a monopoly. Any other 
               <br />
               corporation or company which seeks similar 
               <br />
               rights can apply to parliament in the same 
               <br />
               way as did this company, and its application 
               <br />
               will be dealt with by the committee on rail-

               ways, canals and telegraph lines. While I

               do not know what the answer would be, I am 
               <br />
               sure that the committee would want to give 
               <br />
               such corporation similar rights to these. The 
               <br />
               answer is, therefore, that this bill does not 
               <br />
               preclude another company from making 
               <br />
               application.
