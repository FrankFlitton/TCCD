               the estimate of the Canadian government. 
               <br />
               Against that, there are anticipated expendi-

               is the subsidy payment which is provided for 
               <br />

               appear up to that point to be an annual

               up to $13,500,000, approximately, per annum, 
               <br />
               but that does not include three other ﬁgures:

               ﬁrst, the costs of servicing that part of the

               land railway or its auxiliary

               <br />
               expected to amount to, and could he say a

               word as to the anticipated additional cost of 
               <br />
               defence, so that we will have as complete a

               picture as it is possible to draw at this stage 
               <br />

               Mr. St. Laurent: Before the Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance gives his estimate, possibly I should 
               <br />
               give the estimate that was brought back to 
               <br />
               us in 1948 by the Newfoundland delegation. 
               <br />
               They disputed our estimate of the revenues 
               <br />
               as being too modest. Our estimate of what 
               <br />
               Canada would derive in 1949 was $20,185,000. 
               <br />
               Their estimate of what would be derived on 
               <br />
               the level of economy of 1949 was $26,922,000. 
               <br />
               They made that as their estimate of what 
               <br />
               Canada would derive from those various 
               <br />
               sources—personal income tax, corporation tax 
               <br />
               and so forth. They also disputed the 
               <br />
               $27,150,000 because that included the old age 
               <br />
               pensions payment at $2,600,000, and they said 
               <br />
               it would not exceed $2,400,000. So they came 
               <br />
               back this time telling us that our estimate of 
               <br />
               the revenue Canada would get, on the level 
               <br />
               of the economy of 1949, was too low, that it 
               <br />
               should amount to $26,922,000; and that our 
               <br />
               estimate of the expenditure on these items 
               <br />
               was a little bit too high and would be 
               <br />
               $26,970,000, practically balancing each other. 
               <br />
               Of course those ﬁgures are merely estimates. 
               <br />
               Before the Minister of Finance gave his own 
               <br />
               ﬁgures, I thought I should give to hon. mem-

               <br />

               increased burden of national defence which

               Mr. Abbott: No. I have not any revised 
               <br />
               ﬁgure as to probable federal revenue from 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, and I would prefer not to

               hazard any further statement on that matter 
               <br />
               at this time. We are, however, in process of 
               <br />
               preparing estimates to be included in what 
               <br />
               would be the main estimate in order to pro- 
               <br />
               vide services in Newfoundland. While those 
               <br />
               are not completed yet, they are fairly well 
               <br />
               advanced. Those expenditures, including 
               <br />
               expenditures for veterans’ beneﬁts and one 
               <br />
               thing and another, which are not included 
               <br />
               here, will -be substantially higher than the

               ﬁgure of $27 million shown on page 70. 
               <br />
               Including all those special items, I think it 
               <br />
               will probably be something of the order of 
               <br />
               $50 million, including additional estimates 
               <br />

               Mr. Fleming: I should like to be clear with 
               <br />
               regard to that ﬁgure of $50 million. Is that in 
               <br />
               addition to the $27 million?

               Mr. Abbott: No. What I am saying is this.

               Of course, before union is completed I shall 
               <br />
               be bringing down the main estimates for the 
               <br />
               ﬁscal year from April 1, 1949, to March 31, 
               <br />
               1950. Therefore I have decided that, in the 
               <br />
               main estimates, we should not include New- 
               <br />
               foundland items, but that they should be 
               <br />
               brought in as special supplementary esti- 
               <br />
               mates. I think it is an advantage to deal with 
               <br />
               the matter in that way, in that it will show 
               <br />
               to members of the house in detail the addi- 
               <br />
               tional expenditure which it is contemplated 
               <br />
               will be necessary for Newfoundland. Those 
               <br />
               estimates will be brought in. My present 
               <br />
               intention would be to table those estimates 
               <br />
               on or about March 31, on the assumption that
