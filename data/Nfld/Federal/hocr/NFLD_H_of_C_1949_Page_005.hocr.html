               Mt. St. Laurent: In order to avoid debate I am 
               <br />
               quite prepared to withdraw the motion and to trust 
               <br />
               that it will be the desire of hon. members tomorrow

               The leader of the opposition (Mr. Drew) 
               <br />
               said:

               So that there may be no misunderstanding. I was 
               <br />
               dealing with a motion in a certain form. The Prime 
               <br />
               Minister has indicated his willingness to withdraw 
               <br />
               that motion. We come now to another point. There 
               <br />
               can be no objection to proceeding with the debate 
               <br />
               in the usual way in so far as the mover and 
               <br />
               seconder are concerned. but I am unaware of any 
               <br />
               precedent for the leader of the opposition and the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister following immediately afterwards 
               <br />
               under such circumstances as we have here. I do 
               <br />
               not think that should be suggested. The speech 
               <br />
               from the throne has only been presented today. The 
               <br />
               debate is on that speech, and it is customary to 
               <br />
               afford the leader of the opposition an opportunity 
               <br />
               to examine it so that his remarks will deal with it. 
               <br />
               I want to make that observation now that the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister has withdrawn the motion. I make the 
               <br />
               observation as to my views of the procedure on the 
               <br />
               debate merely for the purpose of avoiding any mis- 
               <br />
               understanding tomorrow.
