               The British North America Act is set forth 
               <br />
               in clear and understandable language. True,

               after listening to this debate I can understand

               that there is room for different interpreta-

               Now, I was rather surprised at the advice 
               <br />
               offered by my hon. friend the member for 
               <br />
               Grey-Bruce (Mr. Harris). Yesterday he sug- 
               <br />
               gested that this address to His Majesty 
               <br />
               appeared on the order paper the day before 
               <br />
               we voted on third reading of the bill. Of 
               <br />
               course it was on the order paper, but it was 
               <br />
               not brought before the house for discussion. 
               <br />
               I would suggest to the hon. gentleman that no 
               <br />
               one would rise in the house at that time to 
               <br />
               debate something which was not properly 
               <br />
               before the house. No one had an opportunity 
               <br />
               of even considering it, because the third 
               <br />
               reading of the bill was called. My hon. 
               <br />
               leader, however, alluded to the possibility of 
               <br />
               something not yet disclosed in his address on 
               <br />

               Let me deal particularly with the amend- 
               <br />
               ment for a moment. As I understand, Mr.

               Speaker, there is no one within this party 
               <br />
               who questions the right of this parliament to 
               <br />
               make the terms of union with the colony of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. We have already given evid- 
               <br />
               ence of our approval by our agreement on 
               <br />
               the bill as it was considered clause by clause. 
               <br />
               While certain parts of the bill were drawn 
               <br />
               to the attention of the administration as mat- 
               <br />
               ters that might be considered for amendment, 
               <br />
               no effort was made to amend those clauses. 
               <br />
               We accepted them as the basis of union. In 
               <br />
               that sense, we have said, this parliament 
               <br />
               could act.

               I think the hon. Minister of National

               that it is possessed of the necessary authority 
               <br />
               to make any deal which is in the national 
               <br />
               interests of this country. No one has ques- 
               <br />
               tioned that. What we do say is that, when 
               <br />
               one comes to read the address to be presented 
               <br />
               to His Majesty the King, one ﬁnds a reference 
               <br />
               which requires an amendment to the British 
               <br />
               North America Act. Upon that, we say, the 
               <br />
               provinces should be consulted. After the con- 
               <br />
               clusion of these consultations, the address 
               <br />
               would then be forwarded and dealt with 
               <br />
               accordingly. The reference the amendment 
               <br />
               seeks relates to the constitutional aspect only, 
               <br />
               not to the terms of union with Newfoundland.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I can quite understand that, if you were 
               <br />
               to refer the terms of union to the provinces, 
               <br />
               it might be a long time before you would be 
               <br />
               able to obtain approval. I believe the senti- 
               <br />
               ment in Canada is overwhelmingly in favour 
               <br />
               of admitting Newfoundland into confedera- 
               <br />
               tion. Having regard to that fact, I believe a 
               <br />
               reference to the provinces at the present time, 
               <br />
               since the provincial legislatures are in session 
               <br />
               or will be in session shortly, would receive 
               <br />
               prompt attention. Owing to the sentiment in 
               <br />
               favour of union, I feel satisﬁed that prompt 
               <br />
               approval would be received. Then the British 
               <br />
               North America Act could be amended and 
               <br />
               Newfoundland could be admitted into con- 
               <br />
               federation.

               As has been said already, we have a con- 
               <br />
               stitution. Either it means something or it 
               <br />
               means nothing. A great principle is indeed 
               <br />
               here involved. The position is just the same 
               <br />
               as that in which a set of rules is laid down 
               <br />
               for a hockey match or for a lacrosse match. 
               <br />
               If you disregard the rules, then you are 
               <br />
               bound to have a more or less chaotic condi— 
               <br />
               tion, or a complete disregard for all rules… 
               <br />
               I like to look beyond the present stage. I 
               <br />
               do not think it requires any reference by the 
               <br />
               Minister of National Defence (Mr. Claxton)‘ 
               <br />
               to the great men who negotiated the deal. I' 
               <br />
               think we all have an appreciation of each. 
               <br />
               other. I do not think it requires any refer— 
               <br />
               ence to what happened in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland…</span> 
               <br />
               That was their responsibility and their busi— 
               <br />
               ness, not ours. The question about which we- 
               <br />
               are vitally concerned is this. Have we the 
               <br />
               right to amend the British North America Act 
               <br />

               <br />
