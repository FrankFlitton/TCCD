               the Hansard record to make sure of the words 
               <br />
               used by the Minister of Finance (Mr. Abbott). 
               <br />
               I wish to refer to the statement made by the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance earlier this afternoon in 
               <br />
               which he implied that, in putting the question 
               <br />
               I asked before the orders of the day, I did 
               <br />
               so as a representative of special interests. 
               <br />
               Referring to myself he said: 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I am aware of the special interest which he has 
               <br />
               in the matter. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I ask the Minister of Finance to withdraw 
               <br />
               that statement. I asked the question because 
               <br />
               the gold mining industry has a far-reaching 
               <br />
               inﬂuence on the general economy of Canada, 
               <br />
               and on the welfare of every Canadian citi- 
               <br />
               zen. My only interest is that of a Canadian, 
               <br />
               and I resent the imputation contained in the 
               <br />
               minister’s words.
