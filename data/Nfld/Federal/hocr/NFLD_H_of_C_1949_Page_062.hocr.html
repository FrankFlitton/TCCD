               made by the leader of the opposition. The 
               <br />
               ﬁrst one is the undesirability of there being 
               <br />
               in the terms of union something which 
               <br />
               appears to many to be a new principle; that 
               <br />
               is to say, some impediment or barrier to 
               <br />
               interprovincial trade arising out of the terms 
               <br />
               of this clause which was inserted in the agree-

               Hon. gentlemen will notice with what care 
               <br />
               this provision was drafted. It provided that 
               <br />
               the parliament of Canada would not prohibit 
               <br />
               or restrict such manufacture and sale in New- 
               <br />
               foundland except at the request of the legis— 
               <br />
               lature of the province of Newfoundland. By 
               <br />
               a majority judgment the supreme court has 
               <br />
               now decided that the parliament of Canada 
               <br />
               cannot prohibit or restrict the manufacture 
               <br />
               or sale of oleomargarine in any of the prov- 
               <br />
               inces. I must confess that one of the reasons 
               <br />
               given in the majority judgment came to me 
               <br />
               rather as a surprise. I had assumed that this 
               <br />
               provision in the Dairy Industry Act was one 
               <br />
               which related to the subject of agriculture. 
               <br />
               As hon. members know, parliament and the 
               <br />
               legislatures of the provinces have concurrent 
               <br />
               jurisdiction in respect of matters dealing with 
               <br />
               agriculture. But the supreme court held that 
               <br />
               this was not a matter related to agriculture, 
               <br />
               but rather something which was local and 
               <br />
               private within the province. Consequently 
               <br />
               it held that the parliament of Canada had no 
               <br />
               jurisdiction in regard to it. The clause as 
               <br />
               drafted envisages that the parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada would not so “prohibit or restrict” 
               <br />
               except at the request of the legislature of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. If the parliament of Canada 
               <br />
               has no jurisdiction, in that the matter does 
               <br />
               not come within the clause relating to agri- 
               <br />
               culture in the British North America Act, it 
               <br />
               cannot do anything at all about it. My View 
               <br />
               was that if it had jurisdiction, it was because 
               <br />
               the subject matter related to agriculture, 
               <br />
               over which both parliament and the legis- 
               <br />
               lature would have jurisdiction. As far as I 
               <br />
               was concerned, I felt that it might be proper, 
               <br />
               in a matter in which both had jurisdiction, 
               <br />
               to agree, since oleomargarine had been avail- 
               <br />
               able in Newfoundland for a long time, that 
               <br />
               the parliament of Canada would not exercise 
               <br />
               its jurisdiction unless the legislature of the 
               <br />
               province requested it to do so. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The term provided in addition that, if this 
               <br />
               was something over which parliament had 
               <br />
               jurisdiction, the oleomargarine manufactured 
               <br />
               and offered for sale in Newfoundland would 
               <br />
               not be exported into any other of. the Cana- 
               <br />
               dian provinces, unless the parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada, having jurisdiction, made it legal for 
               <br />
               oleomargarine to be manufactured and sold 
               <br />
               in those provinces. That is the thing that is 
               <br />
               regarded as setting up a barrier to trade, 
               <br />
               involving a new principle.

               Well, Mr. Speaker, it does not involve a 
               <br />
