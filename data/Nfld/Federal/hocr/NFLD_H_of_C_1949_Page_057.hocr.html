               Mr. Stanley Knowles (Winnipeg North

               Centre): Mr. Speaker, I wish to speak brieﬂy 
               <br />
               concerning only two matters which arise 
               <br />
               from the bill now before us. It has been 
               <br />
               said by a number of hon. members who have 
               <br />
               already spoken that as Canadians we must 
               <br />
               do our best to extend the warmest possible 
               <br />
               welcome to the people of Newfoundland as 
               <br />
               they enter confederation. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               One of the consequences of confederation 
               <br />
               will be the coming to this city and to parlia- 
               <br />
               ment of seven members of the House of Com- 
               <br />

               _‘he question I raise, and which I hope is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Jeing</span> considered by the government, is this: 
               <br />
               What sort of welcome will it be for these 
               <br />
               thirteen new members of the Canadian par- 
               <br />
               liament if, upon arriving here, they ﬁnd they 
               <br />
               have no office space? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> I suggest strongly that 
               <br />
               this is a matter which should receive the 
               <br />
               serious consideration of the government, and 
               <br />
               I suggest further it would not be out of place 
               <br />
               for the government to indicate to parliament 
               <br />
               whether or not such consideration is being 
               <br />
               given, and if 50, along what lines.

               This matter has been taken up on many

               <br />

               to parliament of representatives of New- 
               <br />

               I could make a case for the greater space

               <br />

               add however that it seems to me to be

               <br />
               themselves crowded in the matter of ofﬁce

               tion to this matter, particularly because of 
               <br />
               the way in which the problem will be aggra-

               <br />
               tell us, either from the ﬂoor of the house or

               <br />

               I too am concerned about the relationship

               between the measure now before us and 
               <br />
               chapter 80 of the statutes of 1947, an act to 
               <br />
               incorporate Quebec, North Shore and Labra-

               member for Broadview to point out that there 
               <br />
               had been inserted in that act a saving 
               <br />
               clause as set out in section 7 to the effect that 
               <br />
               all the things parliament was permitting this

               on, permission would have to be secured from 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. The reference is not to the
