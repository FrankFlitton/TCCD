               The hon. member for Lake Centre (Mr. 
               <br />
               Diefenbaker) has asked what the Canadian 
               <br />
               government has done to remove the objec-

               Canadian government did nothing to remove 
               <br />
               those objections, leaving it to the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland to make their decision and

               <br />

               The fourth question was, Has this govern—

               ment made any representations to the United

               Kingdom government as to the desirability of 
               <br />
               restoring responsible government. To that 
               <br />
               question I must answer that we did not. We 
               <br />
               felt that it was not our province to do so 
               <br />
               and that, in so far as the Canadian govern- 
               <br />
               ment was concerned, it should leave entirely 
               <br />
               to the government of the United Kingdom 
               <br />

               taking of such steps on their side as they 
               <br />
               might see ﬁt. We felt that the Canadian 
               <br />
               government would have its responsibilities to 
               <br />
               the Canadian parliament in the attitude it 
               <br />
               was taking for Canada in these issues, and 
               <br />
               that it should not assume any further or 
               <br />
               greater responsibility than that.

               I hope that this statement of fact will 
               <br />
               satisfy most people that we endeavoured to

               maintain a correct attitude in the course of 
               <br />

               paper articles the statement that this sug- 
               <br />
               gestion of union was the result of a deep-laid

               ing of the Quebec conference in 1943, there 
               <br />
               is one assertion I wish to make. I do not

               think I need to do more than mention the

               statement. But for the record I deny that

               <br />
               At that time the leaders of those democratic 
               <br />
               nations were endeavouring to devise ways

               Moreover, I emphatically deny that there 
               <br />
               was at any time any attempt by the Canadian 
               <br />
               government, otherwise than by maintaining 
               <br />
               a correct attitude and by maintaining the 
               <br />
               attitude that the whole of the people have 
               <br />
               maintained, to induce our Newfoundland 
               <br />
               friends to become associated with us. We felt 
               <br />
               then, as I still feel today, that the most effec- 
               <br />
               tive way we could act to bring about, as early 
               <br />
               as possible, a consummation of this dream of 
               <br />
               1867, was to behave as honourable, free men 
               <br />
               in a prosperous community, acting in a cor- 
               <br />
               rect manner in the administration of their 
               <br />
               affairs. We felt that was the thing that would 
               <br />
               be most apt to make an impression upon the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland. That attitude was 
               <br />
               adopted and maintained with the most 
               <br />
               scrupulous exactitude. On the other hand, 
               <br />
               we felt that to do anything that might be 
               <br />
               construed as a rebuff to or a repulse of any 
               <br />
               advances that were being made would be 
               <br />
               offensive to that population; and we refrained 
               <br />
               from doing anything of that kind. I hope the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland and the people of 
               <br />
               Canada will ﬁnd in the end that this union, 
               <br />
               on the ‘terms that have been proposed, will 
               <br />
               work out to the mutual advantage of all those 
               <br />
               who will be citizens of greater Canada, and 
               <br />

               <br />
               positive about that. We are told by the New- 
               <br />

               <br />

               it would come into force in any one of the 
               <br />
               dominions upon adoption by the parliament

               of that dominion, and the parliament or the

               then legislature of Newfoundland had not 
               <br />

               <br />
