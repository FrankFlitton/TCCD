               That convention was elected. After it had 
               <br />
               investigated the ﬁnancial situation and so 
               <br />
               forth its ﬁndings were made public. Then the 
               <br />
               government of Newfoundland said: We will 
               <br />
               ask the people themselves whether they want 
               <br />
               responsible government, a continuation of the 
               <br />
               commission of government, or confederation 
               <br />
               with Canada. In view of the fact that three 
               <br />
               questions were to be submitted, they said, if 
               <br />
               there is not an absolute majority in favour of 
               <br />
               any one there will have to be a second 
               <br />
               referendum. There was a vote but there was 
               <br />
               no absolute majority in favour of any of the 
               <br />
               three questions, and a second referendum was 
               <br />
               held.

               On that second occasion the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland, instead of saying that they wanted 
               <br />
               responsible government restored, decided 
               <br />
               against it. In the ﬁrst referendum some of 
               <br />
               them had wanted responsible government 
               <br />
               restored, but they were not a majority of 
               <br />
               those who voted. In the second referendum 
               <br />
               the majority said: No, we do not want respon- 
               <br />

               Twenty-ﬁve members of the convention

               <br />
               at the attitude taken by the hon. member 
               <br />

               justiﬁcation for putting the question to the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland. The national con- 
               <br />
               vention was merely a convention to inquire 
               <br />
               into the situation and to make recommenda- 
               <br />

               terms of the Newfoundland act of 1933— 
               <br />
               which provided that on request of the people

               of Newfoundland, when their ﬁnancial situa- 
               <br />
               tion had been restored, they would get back 
               <br />
               responsible government—the procedure to 
               <br />
               bring about union had not been that con- 
               <br />
               templated in section 146 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. That section, as hon. members 
               <br />
               will recall, provided that her majesty, on the 
               <br />
               advice of her most honourable privy council, 
               <br />
               might on the joint addresses of the houses of

               We did not consider it would be proper for 
               <br />
               us to express any views in respect to the 
               <br />
               manner in which the government of the

               <br />
               that had been made in 1933. We constantly 
               <br />
               maintained the position that we felt the Cana- 
               <br />
               dian people would be glad to welcome the 
               <br />
               entry of Newfoundland into confederation, 
               <br />
               but that we should not do anything to inﬂu-

               ence her decision or course of action in the 
               <br />
               matter. To be quite frank, I may say we 
               <br />
               felt that this would probably be the most 
               <br />
