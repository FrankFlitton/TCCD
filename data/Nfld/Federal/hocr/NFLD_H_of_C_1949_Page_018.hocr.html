               Speaker, I think it has become apparent that 
               <br />
               we are not getting anywhere. If we have 
               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. Green: I realize that at times we all 
               <br />
               must show certain partisanship in this house, 
               <br />
               but I meant what I said when I indicated 
               <br />
               that I planned to try to analyze this question 
               <br />
               in an unbiased way. The question is whether 
               <br />
               or not the members of the government are 
               <br />
               taking the right attitude towards the debate 
               <br />
               on the address in reply to the speech from 
               <br />
               the throne. Let me direct the minds of hon. 
               <br />
               members back to the announcements made in 
               <br />
               the press about this session. In Vancouver 
               <br />
               I read that the speech from the throne would 
               <br />
               be considered for only a day or two and that 
               <br />
               we would then go on to discuss this proposed 
               <br />
               union with Newfoundland. In other words, 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister and the cabinet from the 
               <br />
               start have had the idea that this throne speech 
               <br />
               debate would last for a matter of only a few 
               <br />
               hours and then would be adjourned, or in 
               <br />
               effect would be pushed aside and used as a 
               <br />
               ﬁller between other items of government 
               <br />
               business. The result must inevitably be that 
               <br />
               the debate on the speech from the throne will 
               <br />
               be of little use to the members of this house 
               <br />
               or to the country. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               We saw this same attitude taken at the 
               <br />
               opening of the last session. Back in Dec- 
               <br />
               ember 1947 we were all surprised to learn, 
               <br />
               again from the press, that the house was to be 
               <br />
               called into session a few days before Christ— 
               <br />
               mas, and that the reason it was being called 
               <br />
               was to deal with the Geneva trade treaties. 
               <br />
               I may be wrong in that, but I think that Was 
               <br />
               the main reason given for calling the house

               in December. Mention may also have been 
               <br />
               made of the austerity program. In any 
               <br />
               event, I came east then believing that the 
               <br />
               main reason for calling that session was to 
               <br />
               consider the Geneva treaties. When we came 
               <br />
               here we were met with exactly the same plan 
               <br />
               that is being attempted at this session. The 
               <br />
               speech from the throne was to be dealt with 
               <br />
               for a day or two, and then we were to go on 
               <br />
               with this emergency business. As it turned 
               <br />
               out, the debate on the Geneva treaties lasted 
               <br />
               for two days, and then was adjourned until 
               <br />
               after Christmas, when it was again adjourned. 
               <br />
               The treaties were sent to a committee and 
               <br />
               the committee made a report, but the house 
               <br />
               never dealt with it or with the treaties; they 
               <br />
               have not been approved to this day. They are 
               <br />
               to come up again at this present session. On 
               <br />
               that former occasion the same attitude that is 
               <br />
               being taken today was taken by the cabinet 
               <br />
               towards parliament and towards the debate 
               <br />
               on the speech from the throne. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I submit that there are some serious objec- 
               <br />
               tions to that attitude; in fact, there are grave 
               <br />
               dangers in the government of Canada adopt— 
               <br />
               ing that attitude. First of all, the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister and his colleagues have placed far 
               <br />
               too little importance on this throne speech 
               <br />
               debate, which can only mean that they place 
               <br />
               far too little importance on parliament itself, 
               <br />
               on the private members of this house, whether 
               <br />
               they be in the opposition or on the govern- 
               <br />
               ment side, and on the people represented in 
               <br />
               this house by the private members. The 
               <br />
               keystone of our democratic system of govern- 
               <br />
               ment is parliament, not the cabinet. Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment is composed of men and women 
               <br />
               entrusted by their constituencies with the 
               <br />
               responsibility of leading the nation. Under 
               <br />
               our system the leadership of this nation 
               <br />
               should not come from the cabinet; in the 
               <br />
               ﬁnal analysis it should come from parliament. 
               <br />
               The cabinet is only the executive of 
               <br />
               parliament.
