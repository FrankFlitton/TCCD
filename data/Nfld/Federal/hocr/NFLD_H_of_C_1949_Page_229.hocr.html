               <br />
               safeguarding the right of the provinces to be 
               <br />
               consulted in circumstances of that kind. 
               <br />
               Through this amendment, which has no 
               <br />
               other meaning, we are saying to the provinces: 
               <br />
               “Very well, we shall be nice enough to seek 
               <br />
               your advice, but whatever be your answer, 
               <br />
               we shall take no heed of it.”

               To take refuge in such a procedure for the 
               <br />
               sole protection of our most precious rights 
               <br />
               and privileges is a strange way of protecting 
               <br />
               the autonomy of the provinces.

               I said a while ago, Mr. Speaker, that so far 
               <br />
               the provinces had taken but a negative stand 
               <br />
               in the matter of autonomy, and I believe that 
               <br />
               my own remarks and those I have quoted 
               <br />
               have made clear that very important point in 
               <br />
               these discussions.

               The same thing is happening here today.

               So far we have had but one semi-political

               statement from a premier who, from his

               If the premiers of the provinces concerned 
               <br />
               are so jealous of their autonomy, if they are 
               <br />
               sincere when they claim the autonomy of the
