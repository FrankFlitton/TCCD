               inherent in this section a dangerous constitu- 
               <br />
               tional difﬁculty. What I have to say has 
               <br />
               nothing whatever to do with the desirability 
               <br />
               or otherwise of permitting the manufacture 
               <br />
               and sale of margarine; it has to do with the 
               <br />
               constitutional question as to Whether or not 
               <br />
               it is competent under the British North

               The Prime Minister in referring to the

               <br />
               referring to the provision in the Canada 
               <br />
               Temperance Act, but I would point out that 
               <br />
               there is a very deﬁnite distinction between 
               <br />
               restraint on the movement of liquor between 
               <br />
               provinces and on the movement of ordinary 
               <br />
               commodities and products. That distinction 
               <br />
               was clearly drawn in a case having to do with 
               <br />
               the Natural Products Marketing Act of 1934 
               <br />
               and the amending act of 1935. At page 420 
               <br />
               of the Supreme Court Reports, 1936, in the 
               <br />
               judgment of the then Chief Justice of Canada 
               <br />
               a clear distinction is drawn between the 
               <br />
               restraint placed upon the movement of liquor 
               <br />
               between provinces and of other, ordinary, 
               <br />
               articles of trade. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The chief justice pointed out that the 
               <br />
               Canada Temperance Act imposed those re— 
               <br />
               strictions in order that assistance might be 
               <br />
               given to the penal provisions of the provinces 
               <br />
               which had placed some prohibition on the 
               <br />
               use of alcoholic beverages within their own 
               <br />
               areas. The basis of that restraint is not the 
               <br />
               basis which could be used for the purpose of 
               <br />
               passing legislation to restrain other kinds of 
               <br />
               trade. I think the words of the judgment 
               <br />
               clearly indicate the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> and show that 
               <br />
               the suggestion put forward by the minister 
               <br />
               is not a correct parallel. I quote from the 
               <br />
               judgment at page 420 as follows: 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The application of the principle implicit in this 
               <br />
               passage must always be a delicate and difﬁcult task. 
               <br />
               That is shown by reference to the history of the 
               <br />
               Canada Temperance Act. The prohibitory clauses 
               <br />
               of the legislation undoubtedly do affect civil rights 
               <br />
               directly but, in Russell v The Queen (1), the board 
               <br />
               took the view that the real subject matter of the 
               <br />
               legislation was not property and civil rights. but 
               <br />
               matter connected with public order and having a 
               <br />
               close relation to the criminal law. It was likened to 
               <br />
               “laws which place restrictions on the sale or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">custody</span> 
               <br />
               of poisonous drugs, or of dangerously explosive <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subw</span> 
               <br />
               stances . . on the ground that the free sale or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">use‘</span> 
               <br />
               of them is dangerous to public safety, and making <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> 
               <br />
               a criminal offence . . to violate these restrictions. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               . ." It was described as “legislation . . . relating; 
               <br />
               to public order and safety " and belonging to the- 
               <br />
               class of ”Laws. .for the promotion of public order. 
               <br />

               In the words of the judgment in that case,
