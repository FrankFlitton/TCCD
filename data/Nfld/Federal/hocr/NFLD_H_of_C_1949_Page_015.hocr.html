               couple of days the government has shown an 
               <br />
               uncertainty, a lack of unity, and a failure to 
               <br />
               realize in what direction it is going except in 
               <br />
               the direction of an election. We have the 
               <br />
               right to know whether my right hon. friend 
               <br />

               <br />
               ﬁdence of this house. The people want the 
               <br />
               members of this parliament to have an oppor-

               taxation policy is wrong, that its income tax 
               <br />
               is unjust. When I say this I speak for the 
               <br />
               farmers. The government says it has the 
               <br />

               <br />
               an opportunity of having their lack of con— 
               <br />
               ﬁdence in this government placed before this 
               <br />

               <br />
               awakening from their normal lethargy, and

               extend also to the rights of this house which

               to your right, Mr. Speaker, some degree of

               concern for constitutional practices and the

               Let no one underestimate the importance of 
               <br />
               the subject now under discussion. It is not a 
               <br />
               mere question of procedure for today or pro- 
               <br />
               cedure for Monday. What is at issue here 
               <br />
               goes far deeper than that. It is procedure 
               <br />
               measured in terms of the duties and respon- 
               <br />
               sibilities of the executive branch of govern- 
               <br />
               ment to this house. Is the government sup- 
               <br />
               reme? If so, it matters little what happens 
               <br />
               here, and certainly the motion should pass. 
               <br />
               If, however, the house is supreme, then it is 
               <br />
               the house that should determine the order 
               <br />
               in which business shall be taken up; and 
               <br />
               above all things, before this government is 
               <br />
               permitted to lay any business before the 
               <br />
               house, it must establish, in the recognized 
               <br />
               constitutional manner, that it possesses the 
               <br />
               conﬁdence of the house. Under conditions 
               <br />
               now obtaining in this house and this country 
               <br />
               the government has no right to lay before 
               <br />
               this chamber one item of government business 
               <br />
               calling for a decision without having estab- 
               <br />
               lished that it does possess the conﬁdence of

               the house.

               Consider exactly what it means if this 
               <br />
               motion is adopted. In the ﬁrst place, it means 
               <br />
               the government has asserted that the time of 
               <br />
               this house must be rationed. It means that 
               <br />
               the government asserts its right to sidetrack 
               <br />
               the important debate on the address in 
               <br />
               favour of a measure it proposes to introduce. 
               <br />
               It means also, in effect, that the government 
               <br />
               does not owe a primary responsibility to the 
               <br />
               house. It is time this house, out of self-respect,
