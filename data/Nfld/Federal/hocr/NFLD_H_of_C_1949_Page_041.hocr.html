               We join in welcoming Newfoundland into the

               Canadian community of provinces, the 
               <br />

               <br />
               the warmest possible welcome. At the same

               <br />
               Providence will set His seal upon the greater 
               <br />
               Canada to the end that she may go forward 
               <br />
               and realize fully her great destiny.

               I hope that the terms of agreement between 
               <br />
               our two countries, as ﬁnally approved, will 
               <br />
               be so satisfactory to both the people of 
               <br />
               Canada and the people of Newfoundland that 
               <br />
               it will stand unchallenged for many years 
               <br />
               to come. I confess, though, that I have felt 
               <br />
               some misgiving arising out of the fact that, 
               <br />
               when the second referendum took place on 
               <br />
               July 22, 1948, only 44 per cent of the elec— 
               <br />
               torate voted for confederation. It is true, I 
               <br />
               admit, that, of those who voted, a majority 
               <br />
               voted for union. I do not suggest at all that 
               <br />
               anyone was at fault except the electors 
               <br />
               themselves, in that they did not get out to 
               <br />
               the polls. I believe, however, that we all could 
               <br />
               have felt more secure and happier about the 
               <br />
               result if sufﬁcient interest had been taken by 
               <br />
               all the electorate in Newfoundland so that, 
               <br />
               when the vote took place, there would have 
               <br />
               been an undoubted, over-all majority of the 
               <br />
               electors supporting union. I hope of course 
               <br />
               that the great majority of the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland will eventually come to understand 
               <br />
               and appreciate the step that is being taken 
               <br />
               and that they will eventually give to it their 
               <br />
               wholehearted support.

               Much has been said this afternoon about 
               <br />
               the people of Newfoundland and about their 
               <br />
               great country. Thus far all the speakers have 
               <br />
               extolled the virtues of Newfoundlanders, and 
               <br />
               quite rightly so. I share in the admiration 
               <br />
               that has been expressed for this great people 
               <br />
               and for what they have accomplished under, 
               <br />
               as we all understand, great difﬁculties. If the 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders confederate with us, they 
               <br />
               will deﬁnitely enrich the sum total of the 
               <br />
               qualities of the people of greater Canada. 
               <br />
               Their spiritual, moral, physical and cultural 
               <br />
               qualities are certainly no less than our own. 
               <br />
               We know of course that their country 
               <br />
               possesses resources and strategic values of 
               <br />
               great importance. We appreciate all of these; 
               <br />
               nevertheless the advantage will not be all on 
               <br />
               one side. Let me say that if we are fortunate 
               <br />
               enough to have Newfoundland join with 
               <br />
               Canada, Canada will gain much. At the same 
               <br />
               time, let me say that Newfoundland also will 
               <br />
               gain much. We have here the greatest coun- 
               <br />
               try on the face of the earth, and I say that 
               <br />
               in full realization of the magnitude of the 
               <br />
               statement I am making. I believe, and have 
               <br />

               <br />
               Canada will prove to be the real bulwark of 
               <br />
               the whole of America, not only materially, but

               I have always appreciated the fact that 
               <br />
               Canada is the one part of America that retains 
               <br />
               by statute observance of the Sabbath day. 
               <br />
               That fact gives to our country a moral 
               <br />
               strength which cannot be found in any other 
               <br />
               part of America. It may not be appreciated 
               <br />
               now, but I am strongly hoping that certain 
               <br />
               forces in our country, who today are moving 
               <br />
               to repeal that statute and to throw open the 
               <br />
               Sabbath day to the same activities that take 
               <br />

               When Newfoundland comes in, if she 
               <br />
               chooses to approve this agreement, I express 
               <br />
               the hope that she too will join with us in try-

               people second to none anywhere in the world.
