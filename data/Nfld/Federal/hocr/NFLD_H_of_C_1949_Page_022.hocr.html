               <br />

               The purpose of this amendment is to 
               <br />
               remove in part the restrictions as to secrecy 
               <br />
               imposed by section 121 of the Income Tax 
               <br />
               Act, which as it stands at present can have 
               <br />
               the effect of preventing a minister of the 
               <br />
               crown from giving the Senate or the House 
               <br />
               such information as it might be perfectly 
               <br />
               legitimate to ask for and obtain. No change 
               <br />
               is made by this bill in the matter of informa—

               tion obtained from personal income tax 
               <br />

               secret. I may say that in this particular the 
               <br />
               bill is different from the one which I intro-

               duced last year and to which some objection 
               <br />
               was taken. On the other hand, this amend-
