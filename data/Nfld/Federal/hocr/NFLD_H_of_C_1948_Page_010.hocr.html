               by the dairy interests. These interests do not,

               <br />
               been rightly heralded, by the democratic

               <br />
               world recovery; and none of the nations has 
               <br />
               so great a stake in this program as Canada,

               This great agreement was only reached, of

               course, through important concessions being 
               <br />
               made by each of the participating nations. One 
               <br />
               of those conditions is contained in article XI 
               <br />

               The Canadian experts who were at Geneva 
               <br />
               appeared before the senate committee last 
               <br />
               year and said that Canada had fought very 
               <br />
               hard against this condition because of our 
               <br />
               margarine situation, but that in the end we 
               <br />
               had given up and so were pledged to abide 
               <br />
               by that clause. Further evidence along that 
               <br />
               line was given in a statement by the leader

               The Newfoundland proposals have an 
               <br />
               equally shocking implication. This sister 
               <br />
               country, with climate and geography much 
               <br />
               like our own, had another problem in com- 
               <br />
               mon with us. They tound their butter pro- 
               <br />
               duction was insufﬁcient to meet domestic 
               <br />
               needs; but they did not stick their heads in 
               <br />
               the sand like an ostrich. They embarked, 
               <br />
               after mature considerations, upon the manu- 
               <br />
               facture of margarine, using mainly their own 
               <br />
               domestic oils; and margarine now sells for 
               <br />
               roughly half the price of butter there. When 
               <br />
               they inquired about the conditions under 
               <br />
               which they might enter confederation, natur- 
               <br />
               ally they were most anxious to preserve this 
               <br />
               right and insisted upon it. The Dominion of 
               <br />
               Canada, in- its turn, agreed; with this pro- 
               <br />
               vision, however, that margarine manufactured 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland could not cross the pro- 
               <br />
               vincial boundaries. This amazing condition

               strikes at the very economic heart of the 
               <br />
               pact of confederation. Paragraph <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">121'</span> of the
