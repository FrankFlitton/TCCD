               My contention has been in conformity with

               the view held by an earlier Minister of

               During the debates in the house for many 
               <br />
               years past, when discussion was heard 
               <br />
               respecting appeals to the privy council, I 
               <br />
               have taken the view that as the British North 
               <br />
               America Act was a statute, and as it was the 
               <br />
               written constitution for Canada, it could not 
               <br />
               after 1931 be altered without the consent of 
               <br />
               the provinces. I held that minorities had 
               <br />
               rights under the British North America Act, 
               <br />
               the same as majorities; and I held further 
               <br />
               that, under the British North America Act, 
               <br />
               1867, the rights of minorities were guaranteed. 
               <br />
               The provinces were to be consulted regarding 
               <br />
               those rights. '

               I also referred to the acquisition by the 
               <br />
               United States of the territories of Alaska and 
               <br />
               Louisiana, the latter by means of agreement 
               <br />
               and treaty with France, which vested in the

               United States of America the guaranty of 
               <br />
               language and religion. Then Huey Long came 
               <br />
               along as governor of that state and, while he 
               <br />
               supported the Washington administration, 
               <br />
               wanted to change the whole thing. He did

               If ever Canada got the right completely 
               <br />
               to amend its own constitution, then we might 
               <br />
               as well say that the British North America

               May I at this point examine two other 
               <br />
               features of this proposal, the ﬁrst of which 
               <br />
               has to do with the Statute of Westminster, 
               <br />
               and the legal status of Canada under that 
               <br />
               statute. Let me refer to the basis of this 
               <br />
               whole study. In this, the second part of my 
               <br />
               address, may I make reference to the status 
               <br />
               we have acquired. If we are to understand 
               <br />
               how the Statute of Westminster affects Can- 
               <br />
               ada, we must ﬁrst look at certain facts in 
               <br />
               connection with that statute. Let us ﬁrst 
               <br />
               look at what it is. It is a rule of strict law. 
               <br />
               The British North America Act is also a rule 
               <br />
               of strict law. But Great Britain has had no 
               <br />
               strict law as her constitution; she has had 
               <br />
               an unwritten constitution—a constitution 
               <br />
               made up of usages, precedents, customs and 
               <br />
               maxims.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               But in the Statute of Westminster we have 
               <br />
               a ﬁxed statute which must be construed 
               <br />
               strictly, as Professor Wheare, of Christ 
               <br />
               Church, Oxford, says in his splendid text book

               which is often quoted in the British courts 
               <br />
               and in the British parliament. In 1933 New-

               foundland surrendered her status as a domin- 
               <br />
               ion. The second part of the consideration of 
               <br />
               this matter refers to the realm of law. These 
               <br />
               are non-legal rules. They are not illegal; but 
               <br />
               the British empire was founded on them.

               These unwritten rules, practices, maxims, 
               <br />
               customs, usages and conventions are described ' 
               <br />
               in a leading text book by Dr. Dicey. In it 
               <br />
               he points out that Great Britain has and 
               <br />
               always has had an unwritten constitution, 
               <br />
               and he states that she has depended for her 
               <br />
               constitution upon these maxirns, customs and 
               <br />
               usages to which I have referred.

               Now what is the difference between the 
               <br />
               first of these, namely, a ﬁxed written statute 
               <br />
               like the British North America Act, which is 
               <br />
               construed strictly by the courts, and this 
               <br />
               second form of constitution, the rights, cus- 
               <br />
               toms, maxims and usages of the mother 
               <br />
               country?

               The Statute of Westminster is a constitu- 
               <br />
               tion; it is strict law. It is construed strictly 
               <br />
               by the courts. Dominion status cannot be 
               <br />
               decided by the rules of strict law. The most 
               <br />
               important rules are to be found in the con- 
               <br />
               stitutional conventions agreed to at imperial 
               <br />
               conferences. These rules were declared at 
               <br />
               the imperial conferences of 1921, 1926 and 
               <br />
               1930. And up to the Statute of Westminster, 
               <br />
               1931, this organization of constitutional con- 
               <br />
               ventions in law has long been felt in the 
               <br />
               history and development of the British 
               <br />
               empire, both in their government of these 
               <br />
               communities and in their relations with each 
               <br />
               other. This is backed up by executive and 
               <br />
               legislative powers.

               It was asserted that Great Britain and the

               Lord Buckmaster, at one time lord chan-

               <br />
               the bill had been a mistake. I said at the

               time that I looked upon it as one of the most 
               <br />
               mischievous statutes with which he ever had 
               <br />
               to deal—a statute which to a very large 
               <br />
               extent caused the second world war. And as 
               <br />
               I pointed out, it had led to separatism, isola-
