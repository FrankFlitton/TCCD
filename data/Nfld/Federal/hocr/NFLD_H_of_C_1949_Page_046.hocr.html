               I should like to discuss this evening a prob- 
               <br />
               lem which so far has not received very much 
               <br />
               consideration during this debate, namely, the 
               <br />
               point of View of the 71,334 or the 47-66 per 
               <br />
               cent of the people in Newfoundland who 
               <br />
               voted for responsible government. Very 
               <br />
               frankly, I admit I cannot pose as a competent 
               <br />
               authority on Newfoundland’s history or prob- 
               <br />
               lems. I did, however, spend a week in New- 
               <br />
               foundland in December. It was something of 
               <br />
               a shock to me to ﬁnd so much bitterness there 
               <br />
               over the question of confederation. This 
               <br />
               is a problem which the rest of us in Canada 
               <br />
               would do well to consider carefully. I 
               <br />
               realize it is not primarily a Canadian prob- 
               <br />
               lem, but we must face the fact that 47-66 per 
               <br />
               cent of the people voted for responsible gov- 
               <br />
               ernment. Here is a minority coming into 
               <br />
               confederation feeling that they have real 
               <br />
               grievances.

               I should like to take a little time tonight to 
               <br />
               present a point of view which I found in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. I might say I was rather 
               <br />
               surprised to ﬁnd that Newfoundland is so 
               <br />
               isolated from Canada. I happened to be 
               <br />
               there the day after the terms of union were 
               <br />
               signed. The following day, when the by- 
               <br />
               election was held in the constituency of 
               <br />
               Digby-Annapolis-Kings, I was curious to 
               <br />
               ascertain the outcome of the elections, and I 
               <br />
               checked with the only radio system there, as 
               <br />
               well as with the newspapers, to ﬁnd out what 
               <br />
               word there was from Canada. I was told that 
               <br />
               news from Canada had to reach Newfound- 
               <br />
               land via London and the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland would not expect to hear any news 
               <br />
               of the by-election on the radio until the fol-

               we had not had Canadian Press service in

               <br />
               recall, too, that during the years we in 
               <br />
               Canada have had very little information con—

               already been pointed out, Newfoundland 
               <br />
               played a very active part in world war I. 
               <br />
               They added to their national debt to the 
               <br />
               extent of over $50 million and then, in the 
               <br />
               years following the war, found themselves in 
               <br />
               a difﬁcult ﬁnancial position. In 1931, New— 
               <br />
               foundland appealed to the British govern— 
               <br />
               ment for ﬁnancial assistance, but was not 
               <br />
               satisﬁed with the terms offered by the British.

               oldest colony in the British empire were to default

               Since 1933, the people in this important 
               <br />
               island have been denied the right to elect 
               <br />
               their members to transact the business of the 
               <br />
               country. As I stated, it was clearly set forth 
               <br />
               in 1933 and 1934 that this was a temporary 
               <br />
               arrangement and that, when the economic 
               <br />
               position of the island improved, the demo- 
               <br />
               cratic rights of the people would be restored.
