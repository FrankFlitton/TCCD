               the question just put to him by the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Skeena, it looks to me as though 
               <br />
               it is the old story: it is a concession not to 
               <br />
               the men who do the work but to a privileged 
               <br />
               few. In the beginning the set-up sounded 
               <br />
               good, in that the marketing and export of 
               <br />
               ﬁsh were under the direction and control of 
               <br />
               a state ﬁsheries board. Had it stopped there, 
               <br />
               one might have said “hear, hear.” But, 10 
               <br />
               and behold! that board seems to have turned 
               <br />
               over all its rights and privileges to a ﬁshing 
               <br />
               association, which is a fairly select group, if 
               <br />
               it is true that there is a fee of $10,000. If that 
               <br />
               is the situation, I hope that the department 
               <br />
               will get out of it any advantages there are. 
               <br />
               But I also hope that, in the interests of the 
               <br />
               men who do the work, modiﬁcations of this 
               <br />
               set—up will be made as quickly as possible.

               <br />
               seems to be in the minds of a few of the

               <br />
               I should say something, and it will take me 
               <br />
               only a minute or two. They seem to think 
               <br />
               that the coming in of Newfoundland and the 
               <br />
               bringing in of another $30 million or $35 
               <br />
               million of business will in some way affect 
               <br />
               the industry in the maritime provinces. As 
               <br />
               a matter of fact, there will be no more ﬁsh

               <br />
               in than there would be if she stayed out. 
               <br />
               Both countries will be doing business in the 
               <br />
               same markets. I believe one will strengthen 
               <br />
               the other in looking for markets, and that 
               <br />
               both will be able to go after business together
