               <br />
               the Progressive Conservatives, enacted such a 
               <br />
               a bill in 1935. It was declared ultra vires of 
               <br />
               this parliament. We need national social 
               <br />

               they should be the constitutional right of 
               <br />

               entry of Newfoundland into this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confederation,</span> 
               <br />
               I hope it will highlight some of these problems 
               <br />
               which are as much constitutional problems 
               <br />
               as those other factors which have been debated 
               <br />
               in this house during the past two or three 
               <br />
               days. On behalf of my colleagues and myself, 
               <br />
               I should like to say we welcome the people 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland. They have a remarkable 
               <br />
               history. I am not going over their history 
               <br />
               again because I mentioned some of its inter- 
               <br />
               esting features when this matter was intro- 
               <br />
               duced in the house. They are the descendants 
               <br />
               of hardy ﬁsherfolk, in the main; descendants 
               <br />
               of the people who braved the storms of the 
               <br />
               Atlantic and settled on the island to the east 
               <br />
               of us against great odds, discouragements and 
               <br />
               preventions. Today I wanted to mention some 
               <br />
               considerations which we must keep in mind if 
               <br />
               we are to make Canada great, not geographi- 
               <br />
               cally, but in humanity, in progress and in 
               <br />
               welfare. We must keep these basic conditions 
               <br />
               in mind if we want to build a great country 
               <br />
               which will be an example to the rest of the 
               <br />
               world. Let us hope that, when Newfoundland 
               <br />
               is gathered into the family of Canadian prov- 
               <br />
               inces, we may go forward with renewed 
               <br />
               courage and renewed hope to a healthier, 
               <br />
               happier and more secure Canadian nation.

               Mr. Jean-Francois Pauliai (Temiscouata): 
               <br />
               I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. The 
               <br />
               point of order is my contention that it is 
               <br />
               impossible to adopt the main motion now 
               <br />
               since it contains a statement which is not 
               <br />
               true. I mention one in particular. Before 
               <br />
               that, there were joint motions from the House 
               <br />
               of Commons and the Senate. At the present 
               <br />
               time the motion is submitted to both houses. 
               <br />
               In the motion I read the following paragraph: 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               And whereas the agreement containing terms of 
               <br />
               union between Canada and Newfoundland set out 
               <br />
               in the schedule to this act has been duly approved 
               <br />
               by the parliament of Canada and by the government 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland; ' 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I do not know whether the government of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland has approved it. It may have 
               <br />
               done so. But the parliament of Canada has 
               <br />
               not yet approved it. The Senate is still at it. 
               <br />
               Although this is the last stage of discussion 
               <br />
