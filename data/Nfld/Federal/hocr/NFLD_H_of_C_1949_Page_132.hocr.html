               tional requirements would not have been

               covered. It was thought that for greater 
               <br />
               security they might want to be sure that for 
               <br />
               at least eight years they could have the terms 
               <br />
               of the tax agreement. We told them that, if 
               <br />
               they wished to have that, they would have the 
               <br />
               option of taking it; but if they took the 
               <br />
               security, if they made a bargain for eight 
               <br />
               years, it would be a ﬁrm bargain. We did not 
               <br />
               think that we should give them the right to 
               <br />
               have it extended for a period of eight years 
               <br />
               and also give them the beneﬁt of having it 
               <br />
               revised if we were making any other kind of 
               <br />
               agreement with any of the other provinces.

               We said: If you want a ﬁrm deal for a 
               <br />
               period of eight years we will not ask you to 
               <br />
               take an option, but after you have a govern- 
               <br />
               ment with a legislature to which it is respon— 
               <br />
               sible and that government and that legislature 
               <br />
               wish to have a deal made in a ﬁrm fashion for 
               <br />
               eight years, we will not object. If, however, 
               <br />
               you make a deal for eight years, you should 
               <br />
               realize that you will not be entitled to a 
               <br />
               review. They said: Does that mean that 
               <br />
               there will not be any possibility of making 
               <br />
               ‘a revision? We told them: There will not 
               <br />
               be any right to require a revision to be 
               <br />
               made, but if it is felt at that time that one is 
               <br />
               in order it can be made, provided the gov— 
               <br />
               ernment of the day takes the responsibility 
               <br />
               of recommending the modiﬁcation to parlia- 
               <br />
               ment.

               The leader of the opposition knows that, 
               <br />
               under the present tax agreement with the 
               <br />
               seven provinces, if something is granted to 
               <br />
               one as a right it is acquired by the other six. 
               <br />
               That is the thing against which we provided 
               <br />
               by this option. We said: If you want to 
               <br />
               make a ﬁrm agreement it will be the kind 
               <br />
               of agreement that will not automatically give

               <br />
               a new bargain. It may very well be that if 
               <br />
               my hon. friends are over here or if we are 
               <br />
               still here, another arrangement might be

               made with the provinces which would also 
               <br />
               extend to Newfoundland, and the government 
               <br />

               recommending to parliament the conse- 
               <br />
               quential appropriation. It seems to us that 
               <br />
               if the new government of Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               responsible to its legislature, wanted to make 
               <br />
