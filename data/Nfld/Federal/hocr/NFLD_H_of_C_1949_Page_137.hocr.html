               As I mentioned previously, the newspapers

               indicate that while the Prime Minister is in

               Washington he is to have some discussions

               <br />

               <br />
               have taken place between Canada and Great

               expenditures. If the newspaper reports are

               <br />

               <br />
               be necessary for either Canada or some other

               <br />
               The situation is the same as if the hon. mem-

               ber, having a farm, leased a building lot on it 
               <br />
               for ninety-nine years and then sold his farm. 
               <br />
               The acquirer would have to take the farm 
               <br />
               and respect the agreement the hon. member 
               <br />
               had made with regard to the building lot.

               But he could go to the man who had the lease 
               <br />
               on the building lot and try to make a new 
               <br />

               Mr. Coldwell: Paragraph (g) of section 31 
               <br />
               refers to protection and encouragement of 
               <br />
               ﬁsheries and operation of bait services. How 
               <br />
               do these bait services differ from what we 
               <br />
               have in the maritime provinces? As far as 
               <br />
               I can remember, there are no federal bait 
               <br />
               services for the maritime ﬁshermen. I may be 
               <br />
               wrong in that respect, but I do not think I am. 
               <br />
               What are those bait services that are referred 
               <br />
               to? Are they convenient services which the 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen ﬁnd valuable both economically 
               <br />
               and socially? Is this service the Newfound- 
               <br />
               land ﬁsherman enjoys the kind of service that 
               <br />
               might be extended to the ﬁshermen of the 
               <br />
               maritime coasts where, I believe, the pro- 
               <br />
               vision of bait is, at some seasons of the year, 
               <br />
               extremely difﬁcult? I have an idea that in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland there is being done something 
               <br />
               different from what is being done by the
