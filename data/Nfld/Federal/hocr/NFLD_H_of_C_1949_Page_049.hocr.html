               In conclusion, I should like to plead with 
               <br />
               hon. members in all sections of the house to 
               <br />
               face up to the fact that here is a minority 
               <br />
               problem that will embarrass us for some con- 
               <br />
               siderable time. I am familiar with the com- 
               <br />
               ment made by a great many that in this 
               <br />
               point of View I am expressing the case of the 
               <br />
               wealthy people in the Avalon peninsula. I 
               <br />
               need not tell the house that my contacts were 
               <br />
               not with the millionaires in St. John’s. I 
               <br />
               tried to ﬁnd a fairly good cross section of 
               <br />
               opinion in Newfoundland, and we must try 
               <br />
               to recognize that an injustice has been done 
               <br />
               in the methods which have been adopted in 
               <br />
               the negotiations. I do not suggest for a 
               <br />
               moment that all the wrong is on one side and 
               <br />
               all the right on the other. I do not propose 
               <br />
               to take sides in what is really a Newfound- 
               <br />
               land domestic problem, but it does vitally 
               <br />
               affect Canada and it is the duty of all hon. 
               <br />
               members to admit frankly that there is a 
               <br />
               problem there and that together we must try 
               <br />
               to solve it. 
               <br />

               I have no doubt that eventually the people 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland will be happy members of 
               <br />
               our larger Canadian family. I agree with the 
               <br />
               Minister of National Defence (Mr. Claxton), 
               <br />
               who suggested that marriages which take 
               <br />
               place between mature adults can result in a 
               <br />
               happy future for the participating parties. 
               <br />
               There are also adjustments which have to be 
               <br />
               made by people who marry late in life. The 
               <br />
               negotiating parties should have full informa- 
               <br />
               tion regarding all the details which have 
               <br />
               occurred in connection with the arrangements 
               <br />
               leading up to the marriage. I should like to 
               <br />
               express the hope that people in all parts of 
               <br />
               Canada will co—operate with our friends from 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, who will become a part of 
               <br />
               the country, and that we shall see to it that 
               <br />
               we can all work to establish a better Canada 
               <br />
               than we have ever known before.

               stand the stand that we are taking in this 
               <br />
               particular situation. Most Canadians will 
               <br />
               welcome Newfoundland and the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland as a sister province of our 
               <br />
               great nation. Surely nature intended that

               the north half of the North American con- 
               <br />
               tinent should be joined together economically 
               <br />
               and by blood. What has happened quite 
               <br />
               recently is the discovery of great material 
               <br />
               wealth in ore in Labrador. This seems to

               have had something to do, at any rate, with 
               <br />
               the sudden interest which we Canadians and 
               <br />
               Americans have taken in recent months in 
               <br />
               the development of that great area.

               ciples of democracy. We are here as the 
               <br />
               representatives of the Canadian people, hav- 
               <br />

               <br />
               which this government has entered into with 
               <br />
               a delegation from Newfoundland. The basis 
               <br />
               upon which we are making our decision is 
               <br />
               that we, for the Canadian people, believe that 
               <br />
               on the basis of these terms Canada should 
               <br />
               form an agreement and an alliance to go into 
               <br />
               confederation with Newfoundland. But the 
               <br />
               sad fact about this whole arrangement is that 
               <br />
               no similar legislature in Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               elected by the people, ever had any oppor-

               In a few weeks, if this measure becomes

               had? They have had no responsible legisla-

               ture for a number of years. A commission

               has been governing that country since 1934, 
               <br />
               I believe. This commission carried on its 
               <br />
               work, and suddenly it was decided that a 
               <br />
               convention should be held. Under the author— 
               <br />
               ity of the British government they sat in con- 
               <br />
               vention. In that convention there were some 
               <br />
               forty-ﬁve representatives who, under their 
               <br />
               terms of reference, were instructed, I believe, 
               <br />
               only to investigate the matter and make 
               <br />
               recommendations. But instead of that, they 
               <br />
               have gone ahead with some kind of referen-
