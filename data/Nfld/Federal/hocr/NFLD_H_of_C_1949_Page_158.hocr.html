               All I am saying is that, when we are told 
               <br />
               about the proposals that were made, we 
               <br />
               should remember that along with them went 
               <br />
               these contributions; and when you say, “let 
               <br />
               us have these payments”, let us also be quite 
               <br />
               sure that the people of Canada want to make 
               <br />
               them, because they are part and parcel of 
               <br />
               the same proposal. Since this matter has 
               <br />
               come up, and the difﬁculties of dealing with 
               <br />
               it at a conference have been mentioned, may 
               <br />
               I repeat that there is absolutely no place 
               <br />

               That is that these things have to be paid for.

               anything about the subject knew what the 
               <br />

               <br />
               contained in the green book, and we had been 
               <br />
               working over that with the provinces from 
               <br />

               <br />

               I do not think there were many people con— 
               <br />
               cerned with this business who did not know

               what the proposals were. Then the present

               leader of the opposition made the statement

               <br />

               The record stands, and I deny the statement
