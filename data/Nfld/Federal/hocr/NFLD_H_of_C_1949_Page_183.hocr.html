               In this case, a different procedure is being 
               <br />
               followed. The Prime Minister has indicated 
               <br />

               <br />

               tion to the principle embodied in section 4 of 
               <br />
               the Statute of Westminster, a principle which 
               <br />
               is recognized in the very wording of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               pointed out by the Prime Minister, because it

               <br />

               <br />
               appointed the commission of government. I 
               <br />
               doubt whether any member of this house

               would suggest that, if the commission of gov—

               ernment were dissolved by a further act of 
               <br />
               the parliament of the United Kingdom, there 
               <br />
               would be any question that Newfoundland 
               <br />
               would be restored to the status of dominion 
               <br />

               <br />
               minster was enacted. If that be so, it would 
               <br />
               seem to me that Newfoundland also should 
               <br />
               have been in a position to indicate their 
               <br />
               request for and their consent to the procedure 
               <br />
               which was being adopted. But it is clear that
