               in the agreement, then right at the outset 
               <br />
               we are accepting the inclusion in the agree- 
               <br />
               ment of something that the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, within a comparatively short 
               <br />
               time, may consider unsatisfactory, having 
               <br />
               regard to the speed with which those 
               <br />
               adjustments took place after the terms of 
               <br />
               the dominion-provincial agreements were 
               <br />
               announced in the House of Commons in 1946. 
               <br />
               I therefore come back to my comments of 
               <br />
               yesterday on this subject. I suggest to the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister that consideration be given 
               <br />
               to the unsatisfactory results that might follow 
               <br />
               the inclusion of a limitation of that kind, 
               <br />
               and that, through negotiation with the 
               <br />
               representatives of Newfoundland, this parti-

               In so far as these arrangements are con- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> cerned, it is appropriate to point out that the 
               <br />
               representatives of Newfoundland have con— 
               <br />
               curred in these terms. Whether the authority 
               <br />
               of those who represented Newfoundland was 
               <br />
               adequate is, as I said yesterday, something 
               <br />
               to be determined by the people of New-

               foundland and the government of the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom. The mere fact of concurrence, 
               <br />
               however, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">does.</span> not constitute a reason for 
               <br />
               opposing the terms under which the union 
               <br />
               goes forward. I wish to make it clear that I 
               <br />
               see very serious objections to the provisions 
               <br />
               I have mentioned. I think it would be desir- 
               <br />
               able that these grounds of possible objection 
               <br />
               be removed. It could be done by consulta- 
               <br />
               tion; and, if it is done, at least two reasons 
               <br />

               <br />

               There is in this agreement a provision that 
               <br />
               the subsidy payments may continue, not for 
               <br />
               the shorter period in which they are payable 
               <br />
               to the other provinces but, on the option of 
               <br />
               the representatives of Newfoundland, for an 
               <br />
               extended period of eight years. This is not 
               <br />
               a ground for opposing the terms of. union, 
               <br />
               although I do object in principle to such an 
               <br />
               arrangement. It has been agreed to by 
               <br />
               certain provinces. I think it is an unsatis— 
               <br />
               factory arrangement, but that is for them to 
               <br />
               decide. The whole problem, of course, can 
               <br />
               be solved when there is a resumption of the 
               <br />
               dominion-provincial conferences and the

               <br />
