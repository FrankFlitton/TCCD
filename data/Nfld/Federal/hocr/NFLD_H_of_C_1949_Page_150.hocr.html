               expect me to cover fully points 2 and 3. Point 
               <br />
               2 was made by both of them. They are larger 
               <br />
               questions, and I shall be glad to discuss them 
               <br />
               at some later date. I should like to say with 
               <br />
               regard to point 2, however, that there are a 
               <br />
               number of old veterans in Canada who can- 
               <br />
               not be quite properly deﬁned as imperials, 
               <br />
               and who served in either the commonwealth 
               <br />
               forces or the allied forces. The third point 
               <br />
               made by the hon. member for Nanaimo was 
               <br />
               not made by those who discussed very 
               <br />
               thoroughly how the war veterans allowance 
               <br />
               would be reﬂected amongst the older veter- 
               <br />
               ans of Newfoundland, but I assure him we 
               <br />
               will keep that in mind as we enter upon the 
               <br />
               administrative stage after the ﬁrst of April. 
               <br />
               On the ﬁrst point made by the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Nanaimo, as we stand now in Canada, a 
               <br />
               man domiciled in Canada before he enlisted 
               <br />
               in the ﬁrst world war is eligible to apply for 
               <br />
               veterans allowance regardless of whether he 
               <br />
               served in the commonwealth forces or in the 
               <br />
               allied forces. Therefore, when this agreement 
               <br />
               is signed, those Newfoundland veterans of 
               <br />
               world war I who served on behalf of Canada, 
               <br />
               as it will be then, wherever it may have been, 
               <br />
               and who‘ had pre-war domicile in Canada, as 
               <br />
               it will be then, will be eligible to apply for 
               <br />
               war veterans allowance.

               Mr. Pearkes: I am very pleased to hear the 
               <br />
               minister say that those men who were domi- 
               <br />
               ciled in Canada, and who served in the 
               <br />
               imperial forces, will now be eligible for war 
               <br />
               veterans allowance. I know they have been 
               <br />
               allowed to apply for war veterans allowance, 
               <br />
               but they have not in all cases received it. I 
               <br />
               have referred individual cases to the min- 
               <br />
               ister and to his department, and the answer 
               <br />
               has always been that these men were not 
               <br />
               domiciled immediately before their enlistment. 
               <br />
               I can tell the names of men who were living in 
               <br />
               Canada prior to the outbreak of world war I, 
               <br />
               had been living here for a number of years, 
               <br />
               and for some reason had left Canada and gone 
               <br />
               to the United Kingdom. Sometimes it was 
               <br />
               for educational purposes, and in some cases 
               <br />
               to adjust private matters. In other cases they 
               <br />
               had gone to the United States. Because they 
               <br />
               had left Canada for a period of twelve months 
               <br />
               prior to the outbreak of war, although they 
               <br />
               had been domiciled in Canada for four, ﬁve or 
               <br />
               more years, they have been refused the war 
               <br />
               veterans allowance. If a man was domiciled 
               <br />
               in Canada immediately before he enlisted in 
               <br />
               the imperial forces I know he is eligible for 
               <br />
               the allowance, but those who were not domi- 
               <br />
               ciled here immediately prior to the outbreak 
               <br />
               of war have had their applications refused. I 
               <br />
               am pleased to note, however, that the minister 
               <br />
               has now said that they will be eligible.

               Mr. Mutch: There is one question with 
               <br />
               respect to immediate domicile. The war 
               <br />
               veterans allowance board has consistently 
               <br />

               <br />
               ing been domiciled in Canada, left Canada 
               <br />
               for purposes of education. I think I can quite 
               <br />
               safely challenge anyone to ﬁnd an authentic 
               <br />
               case of a man being declared ineligible if he 
               <br />
               left Canada for educational purposes, even 
               <br />
               if he was in the middle of two years at 
               <br />
               Oxford, or something of that sort. If he came 
               <br />
               originally from England, and his parents 
               <br />
               came with him and established domicile here, 
               <br />
               the board has consistently held that his domi- 
               <br />
               cile was here. In such a case he would be 
               <br />
               treated as though he had enlisted from an 
               <br />
               immediate domicile even though he joined 
               <br />
               the forces While he was at Oxford, let us say. 
               <br />
               If I understood the hon. member for Nanaimo 
               <br />
               a few moments ago when he was talking 
               <br />
               about this matter, he kept repeating the fact 
               <br />
               that Canadians, who left Canada and went 
               <br />
               to the United States or some other place, and 
               <br />
               who subsequently joined the British navy or 
               <br />
               some other force, have not been eligible in 
               <br />
               the past under the War Veterans Allowance 
               <br />
               Act. If that is what he did say, then the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman will realize, of course, that he is 
               <br />
               in error, because there is no question of 
               <br />
               domicile for a Canadian. It follows that when 
               <br />
               a Newfoundlander becomes a Canadian, as 
               <br />
               he will do, the question of domicile does not 
               <br />
               exist. The question of domicile exists for 
               <br />
               those who came as immigrants to this coun— 
               <br />
               try, who were here for a time and then 
               <br />
               returned home, joined the allied forces, and 
               <br />
               subsequently returned. As to the interpreta- 
               <br />
               tion of the question whether or not they are 
               <br />
               domiciled, the period is not ﬁxed except by 
               <br />
               practice. The whole entitlement hinges on 
               <br />
               the question of domicile, and the interpreta- 
               <br />
               tion is in the hands of the board itself. It 
               <br />
               will be the same situation when we extend 
               <br />
