               to me it is always better to have a section 
               <br />
               still under review, and not be discussing it 
               <br />
               afterwards when it is supposed to have been 
               <br />
               passed. Then we seem to be at a disadvan- 
               <br />
               tage in asking questions.

               The Deputy Chairman: I should like to 
               <br />
               say to the hon. member that the only point 
               <br />
               I had in mind was to keep things in order. 
               <br />
               I wanted to keep the record straight. But if 
               <br />
               the committee decides to let section 23 stand, 
               <br />
               that is all right.

               Mr. Abbott: For instance, I could give the 
               <br />
               information under section 26, which provides 
               <br />
               for the ﬁnancial payments to Newfoundland.

               I think it is immaterial under which section
