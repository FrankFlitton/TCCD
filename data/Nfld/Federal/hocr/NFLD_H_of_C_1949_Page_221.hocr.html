               early to make any worth-while statement as

               Mr. Angus Maclnnis (Vancouver East): I 
               <br />
               intended to direct a question to the Minister 
               <br />
               of Labour, but as it perhaps involves govern- 
               <br />
               ment policy I will direct it to the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister. On Thursday last I asked the Minis— 
               <br />
               ter of Labour if the government was giving 
               <br />
               consideration to assisting employable unem-

               ployed in the city of Vancouver. On the

               basis of a telegram received from the Van-

               <br />
               I wish to repeat that question today. The

               <br />
               comparable to the ﬂoods of last summer. Will 
               <br />
               the government assure the house that it will 
               <br />
               look into the situation with a view to render-
