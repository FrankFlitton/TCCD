               Here, Mr. Speaker, I now open a paren- 
               <br />
               thesis. I am mildly astonished when a gentle- 
               <br />
               man holding the responsible ofﬁce of the last 
               <br />

               <br />
               refers in light terms to legality and legal 
               <br />
               quibbles when speaking of a thing so sacred 
               <br />
               as the constitution; of the instrument which 
               <br />
               makes secure our liberty and freedom of 
               <br />
               conscience, and which guarantees us the type 
               <br />
               of life of which we are proud and which 
               <br />
               the whole world envies. You must remember 
               <br />
               that this constitution provides a method for 
               <br />
               taking into this dominion certain areas. It 
               <br />
               prescribes certain conditions which must 
               <br />
               exist before those areas can come into con- 
               <br />
               federation. It says that the colony of New— 
               <br />
               foundland must pass an address or a resolu- 
               <br />
               tion by its legislature before it can meet the 
               <br />
               requirements of the statute.

               Let us be quite certain about this matter. 
               <br />
               This is not our statute; this is a statute of 
               <br />
               Great Britain. This is the statute enacted by 
               <br />
               the imperial parliament, the body in which 
               <br />
               the residuary powers of that island now abide, 
               <br />
               since their suspension, on the island’s request, 
               <br />
               in 1930 or 1933. Who is it that says it has 
               <br />
               not the power to deal with this matter? Is 
               <br />
               it Newfoundland? Is it Canada? No. It is 
               <br />
               Great Britain that says this statute does not 
               <br />
               permit the king and his honourable privy 
               <br />
               council to ratify this agreement, be it good, 
               <br />
               bad or indifferent. The statute does not per- 
               <br />
               mit the ratiﬁcation of this agreement between 
               <br />
               Canada and Newfoundland, because one of 
               <br />
               the conditions precedent, one of the elemen- 
               <br />
               tary conditions, is lacking, and that is the 
               <br />
               will of the people of Newfoundland expressed 
               <br />
               through a duly elected legislature. That is 
               <br />
               the opinion of the law ofﬁcers of Great 
               <br />
               Britain, Mr. Speaker, not of this House of 
               <br />
               Commons. The government of Great Britain 
               <br />
               says that under a particular statute the power 
               <br />
               is lacking to incorporate Newfoundland into 
               <br />
               the Canadian confederation by order in 
               <br />
               council. They have not got the power. Then, 
               <br />
               it is said by Great Britain, the statute must 
               <br />
               be amended. When the hon. Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice says that no amendment to the 
               <br />
               British North America Act is contemplated, 
               <br />
               he is in error. All I can say is, he cannot 
               <br />
               have read section 146 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. He should do penance for the

               Let us go one step further. The statute has 
               <br />
               to be amended because there is not the power 
               <br />
               in the British government to act, owing to 
               <br />
               the fact that the conditions precedent have 
               <br />
               not been met. Just by chance, it happens 
               <br />
               that the statute to be amended is the Cana-

               dian constitution. For the moment, I sweep 
               <br />
               aside the Statute of Westminster and I bring 
               <br />

               <br />
               I am quoting what he said in 1946 as reported 
               <br />
               at page 1936 of Hansard of that year:

               The Prime Minister knows that. I admire his 
               <br />
               advocacy and his subtlety; but I doubt the 
               <br />
               worth and the actuality of his argument. It 
               <br />
               is said, and I think it is admitted, that no 
               <br />
               confederation could have taken place had 
               <br />
               Quebec not been in agreement. I think that is 
               <br />
               admitted. Confederation could not have hap- 
               <br />
               pened unless the delegation from Quebec 
               <br />
               consented to enter the pact. I will ask my 
               <br />
               right hon. friend what he thinks the verdict 
               <br />
               would have been had he stood before a jury 
               <br />
               composed of Cartier, Cauchon, Chapais, 
               <br />
               Dorion, Langevin and Tache', and a score of 
               <br />
               others, and said to them that the conditions 
               <br />
               upon which they were to enter confederation 
               <br />
               could be changed at any time that a mere 
               <br />
               majority of this house and of the Senate

               I apply to his argument that homely test. 
               <br />
               I do not think that many here who know the 
               <br />
               spirit of men like Dorion, and others of that 
               <br />
               valiant host that took part in those debates, 
               <br />
               will dare to assert for one instant that, had 
               <br />
               it ever been suggested to them that our con- 
               <br />
               stitution could be amended by the British par- 
               <br />
               liament upon the request of a mere majority 
               <br />
               of these two houses, that they would have 
               <br />
               agreed to enter confederation. By applying 
               <br />
               that test, I think some doubt must be cast
