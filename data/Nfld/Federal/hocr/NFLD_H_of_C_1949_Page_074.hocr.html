               The situation which presented itself to us 
               <br />
               was that the government of the United King— 
               <br />
               dom had requested the election of a national 
               <br />
               convention; that this national convention had 
               <br />
               passed a resolution requesting the governor 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland to inquire whether the 
               <br />
               Canadian government would be prepared to 
               <br />
               receive a delegation and to explore with that 
               <br />
               delegation whether or not there were satis- 
               <br />
               factory terms which could govern the union 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland with Canada. The reply 
               <br />
               given was that we would welcome that dele— 
               <br />
               gation. The delegation came. We worked 
               <br />
               with them for over three months, and after— 
               <br />
               ward submitted what we then considered 
               <br />
               would appear to be fair terms upon which 
               <br />
               the union could be consummated.

               We did nothing beyond that at that time.

               I‘he matter came before the national conven— 
               <br />
               tion; and after discussing the terms a majority 
               <br />
               of the national convention voted against 
               <br />
               including in the referendum a question as to 
               <br />
               whether or not the people would wish to 
               <br />
               unite with Canada. I can give this house the

               assurance that we expressed no views as to 
               <br />
               whether that question should or should not 
               <br />

               <br />
               were told, that there were petitions signed 
               <br />

               <br />

               maintaining an attitude of the strictest 
               <br />
               neutrality, because personally I think many of 
               <br />

               <br />
               in giving ﬁnal form to those terms. If I 
               <br />
               remember correctly the hon. gentleman, or 
               <br />
               some hon. gentleman on the other side, asked 
               <br />
               what would be considered a clear and unmis-

               takable decision of the people of Newfound-

               <br />
               not discussed the matter in council—I said I 
               <br />
               thought it would be the usual democratic 
               <br />
               process; that if there was a majority, that 
               <br />
               majority would be apt to be considered as 
               <br />
               the expression of the views that should pre— 
               <br />
               vail, but that after all it was not our respon- 
               <br />
               sibility to count the ballots or decide the 
               <br />
               sufﬁciency or insufﬁciency of the vote. If the 
               <br />
               government of the United Kingdom and the 
               <br />
               government of Newfoundland, after counting 
               <br />
               the ballots, stated to us on their responsibility 
               <br />
               that there had been a majority for union with 
               <br />
               Canada, I said I thought it would be very 
               <br />
               difﬁcult for us to refuse to recognize the 
               <br />
               validity of that statement; and they did state 
               <br />
               to us that there had been a clear majority 
               <br />
               expressing a desire to unite with Canada, and 
               <br />
               that the governor was appointing a delegation 
               <br />
               to come and discuss the ﬁnal terms of union.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               That delegation came. The situation was 
               <br />
               discussed, I think, in a manner that did credit 
               <br />
               to both the Canadian and the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               delegations. I believe the view that prevailed 
               <br />
               was that it was not a time to try to get this 
               <br />
               or that particular advantage but that it was 
               <br />
               in the interests of all, if there was to be union, 
               <br />
               to have such terms determined as could be 
               <br />
               accepted by the majority of the reasonably- 
               <br />
               minded people in Canada and Newfoundland 
               <br />
               as being fair and apt to promote the welfare 
               <br />
               of the enlarged Canadian nation.
