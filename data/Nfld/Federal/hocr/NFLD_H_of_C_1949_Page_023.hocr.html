               Mr. Howard C. Green (Vancouver South):

               known as the Fraserview project. Apparently 
               <br />
               the corporation has expropriated the property 
               <br />
               of certain residents who already live in this 
               <br />

               received complaints about bulldozers tearing

               Hon. Robert H. Winters (Minister of Recon- 
               <br />
               struction and Supply): The hon. member was 
               <br />
               good enough to give me notice of his question, 
               <br />
               and I have looked into the matter brieﬂy. 
               <br />
               The Fraserview project is in accordance with 
               <br />
               an agreement between the city of Vancouver 
               <br />
               and the Central Mortgage and Housing Cor- 
               <br />
               poration. The development is a veterans’ 
               <br />
               rental project involving some 300 acres of 
               <br />
               land immediately west of the Fraser golf club. 
               <br />
               Most of this land was owned by the city of 
               <br />
               Vancouver as tax sale land, but some parcels 
               <br />
               are owned by individuals. It was considered 
               <br />
               desirable to replan the area. For this reason, 
               <br />
               possession of all the land was required. Expro- 
               <br />
               priation has taken place in respect to both 
               <br />
               privately—owned vacant land and privately- 
               <br />
               owned buildings. 
               <br />

               The planning has been arranged so that, 
               <br />
               as far as possible, existing buildings will 
               <br />
               remain undisturbed. A number of houses 
               <br />
               may have to be moved, although by arrange- 
               <br />
               ment of the planning it is hoped to keep this 
               <br />
               number to a minimum. The situation has 
               <br />
               been explained to individual owners in the 
               <br />
               area, and every effort is being made to cause 
               <br />
               as little inconvenience as possible. An ofﬁcial 
               <br />
               of the corporation is devoting his whole time 
               <br />
               to dealing with individual owners. The 
               <br />
               vacant land is now being cleared so that an 
               <br />
