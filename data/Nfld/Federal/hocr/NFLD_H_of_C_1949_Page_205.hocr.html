               difﬁculties in front of him. He has the bene-

               have respect and who deals with foreign

               pretty soon and tell us—because we will all

               I now turn to the socialists on my left. The

               made a speech. I knew every word he was

               given it phrase by phrase, but I did know he 
               <br />
               would support this measure. Why? Because 
               <br />
               their whole philosophy is the centralization of 
               <br />
               authority in a single government. Therefore 
               <br />
               that was his position. The best example we

               have had of that in recent years was when 
               <br />
               the Minister of Trade and Commerce (Mr. 
               <br />
               Howe) last year, with his tongue in his cheek, 
               <br />
               brought in a bill with respect to centralizing 
               <br />
               in this government the handling of coarse

               porting it was the socialist government of 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan. They came through all right; 
               <br />
               they did not even let the ball have a second 
               <br />
               bounce. They grabbed it and came right 
               <br />
               back. So that is their position. I understand 
               <br />
               it, because it has been the position of social- 
               <br />
               ists from Karl Marx right down to the day 
               <br />
               of the hon. member for Rosetown—Biggar. 
               <br />
               That is their whole position; so we can thor— 
               <br />
               oughly understand them. ,

               Perhaps you may think, Mr. Speaker, that 
               <br />
               it is a bit late; but if I may I should like to 
               <br />
               turn your mind—perhaps “invite the turning 
               <br />
               of your mind” would be a better expression—— 
               <br />
               to just what the present position is. This is 
               <br />
               an amendment to the British North America 
               <br />
               Act. No one has seen ﬁt to deny that. No 
               <br />
               one has made a single suggestion that it is 
               <br />
               anything other than that. So, as far as I am 
               <br />
               concerned, I am anxious to leave behind what 
               <br />
               people have said from 1864 until the present 
               <br />
               time. I have been advised by men who were 
               <br />
               experts in this business that anyone who is 
               <br />
               in politics would like to forget everything he
