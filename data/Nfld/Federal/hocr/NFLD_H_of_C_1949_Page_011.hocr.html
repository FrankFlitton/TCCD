               Mr. St. Laurent: The reason for making the 
               <br />
               motion is to determine now that on February 
               <br />
               7 we may proceed with the resolutions and 
               <br />
               legislation necessary to implement the agree— 
               <br />
               ment for the union of Newfoundland with 
               <br />
               Canada. It is an express term of that agree— 
               <br />
               ment for union that it will come into force 
               <br />
               and bring about the union if there is assented 
               <br />
               to, by His Majesty, a bill of the parliament 
               <br />
               of the United Kingdom conﬁrming legislation 
               <br />
               passed by this parliament and by the govern- 
               <br />
               ment of Newfoundland ratifying the terms of 
               <br />
               that agreement. That procedure requires that 
               <br />
               there be in this house ﬁrst of all a resolution, 
               <br />
               the one that was mentioned ﬁrst under the 
               <br />
               heading “government notices of motions” to- 
               <br />
               day. That resolution is necessary before any 
               <br />
               bill can be introduced, because a bill to con- 
               <br />
               ﬁrm the agreement will impose charges upon 
               <br />
               the consolidated revenue fund. Then the bill 
               <br />
               itself must run the gauntlet of the usual 
               <br />
               stages of procedure in this house and in the 
               <br />
               other place before it can become the law of 
               <br />
               the land. It is felt that it would be undesir- 
               <br />
               able to have the matter dealt with at all by 
               <br />
               the parliament of the United Kingdom until 
               <br />
               the parliament of Canada has expressed the 
               <br />
               views of the people of Canada with respect 
               <br />
               to the union. Before the parliament of the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom will attempt to deal with 
               <br />
               the matter at all, in order to comply with the 
               <br />
               terms of the statute of Westminster there will 
               <br />
               be required a joint address of this house and 
               <br />
               of the senate asking His Majesty to lay before 
               <br />
               the parliament of the United Kingdom a bill 
               <br />
               embodying the proper legislation.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               When I was over in London some months 
               <br />
               ago I had some discussion on this subject with 
               <br />
               members of the government of the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom, and I was told that they would like 
               <br />
               to have not less than three weeks to deal with 
               <br />
               the legislation in their houses of parliament 
               <br />
               after the proceedings had been completed 
               <br />
               here. It is therefore urgent, I think, that we 
               <br />
               reach this matter and ascertain, at as early a 
               <br />
               date as possible, the views of the parliament 
               <br />
               of Canada upon the terms of union that were 
               <br />
               signed last December. It was for that reason 
               <br />
               that, when I announced to the gentlemen of 
               <br />
               the press the date that was ﬁxed for the 
               <br />
               session, I explained to them that we were 
               <br />
               calling parliament together on a Wednesday 
               <br />
               instead of a Thursday, as had been done in 
               <br />
               several previous years, so that there might 
               <br />
               be a couple of days of debate on the address 
               <br />
               before we asked parliament to suspend the 
               <br />
               debate and deal with the matters concerning 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, as it had been our intention

               When notice of this motion was given I

               found that there were many members of par- 
               <br />
               liament on both sides of the house who felt 
               <br />
               that it was not necessary to commence on 
               <br />
               January 31 in order to have the Newfound- 
               <br />
               land proceedings properly dealt with in time, 
               <br />
               and that they wished to have at least another 
               <br />
               full week of debate on the address before 
               <br />
               adjourning it.

               It is my view that we do generally make 
               <br />
               better progress in dealing with the substan- 
               <br />
               tive business of parliament if we do not have 
               <br />
               too many disputes over matters of procedure, 
               <br />
               and I would take it for granted that we would 
               <br />
               be probably just as far advanced with the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland matter after a week or two if 
               <br />
               we met the wishes of hon. members who wish 
               <br />
               to have an additional week to debate the

               The reason for bringing the motion forward

               is to have it ﬁxed, that we will start on this 
               <br />

               <br />

               the Prime Minister (Mr. St. Laurent) and hon.

               leader of the opposition and those associated
