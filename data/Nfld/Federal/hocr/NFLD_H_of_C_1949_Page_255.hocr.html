               we are dealing? It is an amendment to the

               been brought forth in such number about the

               The Secretary of State for External Affairs 
               <br />
               (Mr. Pearson) made some remarks on this 
               <br />
               point this afternoon.' It was obvious he had 
               <br />
               missed the point at issue. He took the posi- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the leader of the opposition as well as the 
               <br />
               speech made by the member for Lake Centre 
               <br />
               (Mr. Diefenbaker), the government was being 
               <br />
               criticized for not following the procedure of 
               <br />
               section 146. Of course, that is not the fact. 
               <br />
               The government is being criticized because it 
               <br />
               departed from the provisions contained in the 
               <br />
               constitution without consulting the provinces. 
               <br />
               The constitution is not only the constitution 
               <br />
               of this federal parliament; it is the constitu- 
               <br />
               tion of the provinces and of the provincial 
               <br />
               legislatures.

               It all comes down to a question which has 
               <br />
               been aired in this house before, and that is 
               <br />
               whether the constitution, which is the con- 
               <br />
               stitution of the provinces as well as of the 
               <br />
               dominion, can be amended in particulars and 
               <br />

               Referring this afternoon to this question of 
               <br />
               consultation with the provinces, the Secretary 
               <br />
               of State for External Affairs brushed it aside. 
               <br />
               He said—I think I am quoting him correctly— 
               <br />
               that it was absolutely unnecessary to consult 
               <br />
               the provinces. Bearing in mind the fact that

               of State for External Affairs (Mr. Pearson)

               was so enthused by his recent conversion that

               he spoke without due reﬂection.

               Certainly, it becomes obvious he has not 
               <br />
               studied the position taken in the past by the 
               <br />
               great leaders of his party. I should like to 
               <br />
               direct his attention to the remarks of Sir 
               <br />
               Wilfrid Laurier when dealing with this ques- 
               <br />
               tion of consultation with the provinces in the 
               <br />
               session of 1906—07. The question before the 
               <br />
               house at that time was a change in the repre- 
               <br />
               sentation in the House of Commons for the 
               <br />
               maritime provinces. Sir Wilfrid Laurier 
               <br />
               emphasized the extreme seriousness of any 
               <br />
               proposal to amend the constitution. After 
               <br />
               saying that the deviation from the principle 
               <br />
               laid down in the confederation act which was 
               <br />
               sought in the resolution then before the house 
               <br />
               was only a very slight one, he enunciated the 
               <br />
               following principle, and I am quoting from 
               <br />
               his remarks as found at page 2195 of Hansa'rd, 
               <br />
               1906-07: 
               <br />

               But. though the deviation from the principle is 
               <br />
               limited, yet it involves an amendment to the con- 
               <br />
               stitution. and an amendment to the constitution is 
               <br />
               always a serious matter and one which should not 
               <br />
               lightly be entered upon.
