               I thought that was worth putting on the 
               <br />
               record this afternoon. The leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition (Mr. Drew) has spoken at length 
               <br />
               in regard to their war record, and I think we 
               <br />
               all appreciate what the island did during the 
               <br />
               war. But Lord Ammon also found that con- 
               <br />
               ditions on the island were deplorable. He 
               <br />
               noted that the people depended for their 
               <br />
               livelihood mainly on ﬁsh, timber and the land, 
               <br />
               with ﬁshing quite the predominant industry. 
               <br />
               He said that much of the poverty was due to 
               <br />
               the long-established methods pursued by the 
               <br />
               old-style salt and dried cod industry, in which 
               <br />
               the ﬁshermen went from one debt sheet to 
               <br />
               another through the operation of what is 
               <br />
               known as the truck system, now illegal in the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom and in many other places. 
               <br />
               On this his comment was interesting, and 
               <br />
               again I want to quote it:

               The uncrowned kings of the settlements are the 
               <br />
               “planters" or outport merchants, who supply the 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen, buy their ﬁsh and in their own lights act 
               <br />
               as “guides, philosophers and friends" to the settle— 
               <br />
               ments. All of them take heavy risks in advancing 
               <br />
               money on the probable out-turn of the ﬁshery. If 
               <br />
               it fails, they fail heavily; if it prospers, they prosper. 
               <br />
               Many are honest men who have helped hundreds of 
               <br />
               ﬁshermen through hard winters, others are unscrup- 
               <br />
               ulous. All profess to abhor the truck system, but 
               <br />
               none seems willing to help the ﬁshermen out of 
               <br />
               the net of debt in which they are constantly en- 
               <br />
               meshed; and all hold surprising views on the proﬁt

               He also noted something else; that wherever 
               <br />
               co-operatives had been established—and the 
               <br />
               establishment of co-operatives has proceeded 
               <br />
               apace, very largely under the leadership of 
               <br />
               the university of St. Francois Xavier in Nova

               for their product, the condition of the whole 
               <br />

               As I said before, at this stage it is not 
               <br />
               proper to discuss any of the ﬁfty sections, 
               <br />

               However, I do want to say something about 
               <br />
               the necessity of our working together in an 
               <br />

               <br />
               the island for the purpose of raising the 
               <br />
               standards of living and preventing further 
               <br />
               exploitation by monopolistic and selﬁsh inter-

               ests, from which the masses of the people 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland have suffered from the very 
               <br />
               beginning. We should consider Newfoundland 
               <br />
               and Labrador as part of the whole maritime 
               <br />
               region, which incidentally is a region that 
               <br />
               cries aloud for a new deal. We believe the 
               <br />
               federal authority, of course in co-operation 
               <br />

               The other day we heard a great deal about 
               <br />
               the centralization of government. In my 
               <br />
               opinion the real danger of the loss of pro- 
               <br />
               vincial independence, yes, of individual inde- 
               <br />
               pendence, is not in the dominion-provincial 
               <br />
               tax arrangements made by this parliament 
               <br />
               with seven of the provinces, but in the con- 
               <br />
               centration of ﬁnancial and economic power in 
               <br />
               the hands of a few wealthy individuals or 
               <br />
               corporations in one or two of the provinces 
               <br />
               of Canada. Not many months ago the present 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition, then premier of 
               <br />
               Ontario, stated that 52 per cent of all indus- 
               <br />
               trial and military production during the war 
               <br />
               came from Ontario. Granted, that was a ﬁne 
               <br />
               record for the managers and workers in indus- 
               <br />
               try in this province, a record of which they 
               <br />
               can be very proud. But is it not an indication 
               <br />
               of the tremendous concentration of industry 
               <br />
               in one province, if the hon. gentleman’s ﬁgure 
               <br />
               is right, especially since the bulk of the 
               <br />
               remainder of Canadian industry, 48 per cent, 
               <br />
               is concentrated in one other province? It is 
               <br />
               all very well to argue that Canada has grown 
               <br />
               strong because the provinces control certain 
               <br />
               resources which make for national strength; 
               <br />
               but to say, as the leader of the opposition did 
               <br />
               on January 28, that—
