               Mr. E. G. Hansen (Macleod): Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               to clarify my own position I desire to say a 
               <br />
               word or two on the amendment. Before doing 
               <br />
               so, however, I should like to refer to the 
               <br />
               remarks that were made by the hon. mem— 
               <br />
               ber for Winnipeg North Centre (Mr. Knowles) 
               <br />
               when he attempted to show that this group 
               <br />
               was somewhat inconsistent in our vote upon 
               <br />
               the measure for redistribution some years 
               <br />
               ago, and our vote upon the amendment that 
               <br />
               was moved thereto. Perhaps my hon. friend 
               <br />
               thought he had a rather sound argument. I 
               <br />
               will not deny that he had some shred of 
               <br />
               legal argument on the point, but I think if 
               <br />
               we analyse the situation as it existed then 
               <br />
               in respect to redistribution we will ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               what we in this group were actually doing 
               <br />
               then was to protect the interests of the 
               <br />
               provinces.

               The measure requiring certain amendments 
               <br />
               to the constitution in order that redistribu- 
               <br />
               tion might be deferred was introduced 
               <br />
               because there had been a shift in the popula- 
               <br />
               tion, and that shift in population left some 
               <br />
               of the provinces of Canada at a disadvantage. 
               <br />
               We voted for an amendment that was worded 
               <br />
               exactly as this one is worded because we 
               <br />
               desired that the matter should be referred to 
               <br />
               the provinces for consultation. The amend- 
               <br />
               ment was moved by the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Lake Centre (Mr. Diefenbaker). We voted 
               <br />
               that way because we thought the provinces 
               <br />
               should be consulted in the matter.

               When the main motion was put, realizing

               that it would protect the provinces because 
               <br />
               of the shift in population, we voted for it. 
               <br />
               We see no inconsistency there whatsoever. 
               <br />
               If the main motion had been in any way detri-

               mental to the provinces we certainly would 
               <br />
               not have voted for it. May I also suggest 
               <br />
               that the redistribution measure was not some- 
               <br />
               thing that was as important as this matter, 
               <br />
               for the reason that there was not really a 
               <br />
               principle involved in it. It was a matter of 
               <br />
               seats in the House of Commons here; and if 
               <br />
               we had carried out redistribution at the time 
               <br />
               it would not have been fair to the provinces 
               <br />
               by reason of the fact that their citizens were 
               <br />
               living temporarily in other parts of the 
               <br />
               country.

               I favour the amendment, Mr. Speaker; and 
               <br />
               in doing so I do not look upon it as consti- 
               <br />
               tuting a motion of non-conﬁdence in the 
               <br />

               has been passed, and all parties in the house 
               <br />
               evidently were in favour of it. If we had

               been against the measure and had voted

               ratifying the agreement, then such an amend- 
               <br />
               ment would have been a motion of non- 
               <br />
               conﬁdence; but we voted for the admission 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland as the tenth province and 
               <br />
               now we are saying that, since we have ratiﬁed 
               <br />
               the agreement and have given our support 
               <br />
               to the action of the government, we would 
               <br />
               like to see it referred to the provinces for 
               <br />
               consultation. To my mind, all the amend- 
               <br />
               ment does is to show a desire on the part 
               <br />
               of this parliament to give the provinces an 
               <br />
               opportunity of expressing themselves in 
               <br />
               respect to a people who are to become 
               <br />
               partners with them in constituting a larger 
               <br />
               Canada. It seems to me that is a reasonable 
               <br />
               attitude to take. I think we may presume 
               <br />
               the provinces are quite willing to welcome 
               <br />
               this new partner; and if that presumption 
               <br />
               is correct would it not be pleasing to the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland to know that the 
               <br />
               nine provinces of Canada were in accord in 
               <br />
               welcoming them into confederation? I think 
               <br />
               that would be a good thing to do. If there 
               <br />
               are any misgivings that‘any of the provinces 
               <br />
               are not favourable to welcoming this tenth 
               <br />
               province, then perhaps the sooner we know 
               <br />
               it the better, because it may only create 
               <br />
               complications after we are ﬁnished with the 
               <br />
               matter.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I listened with some interest to the speech 
               <br />
               this evening by the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               (Mr. Garson). He rather ridiculed any 
               <br />
               thought that there might be a principle of 
               <br />
               centralization opposing this amendment. I do 
               <br />
               not agree with him there. In this present 
               <br />
               day there is a constant urge the world over 
               <br />
               for the bringing in of this principle of 
               <br />
               centralization. I do not believe this is done 
               <br />
               by any casual series of happenings; there is 
               <br />
               no question in my mind but that it is done 
               <br />
               by design. There are two world philosophies. 
               <br />
               One is that of effective democracy, which 
               <br />
               leads to the freedom of the people. The 
               <br />
               other world philosophy is one of authori— 
               <br />
               tarianism, which leads to world dictatorship. 
               <br />
               That is all there is to it, to my mind; that 
               <br />
               is the only great issue in the world today, 
               <br />
               notwithstanding all the various groups afﬁl- 
               <br />
               iated with political organizations. And there 
               <br />
               is a continual urge the world over to apply 
               <br />
               this principle of centralization.

               In my opinion, Mr. Speaker, we are dealing 
               <br />
               with a principle in this amendment; and 
               <br />
               principles do not change. Principles are 
               <br />
               either right or wrong; and the principle of 
               <br />
               centralization is the principle of authoritar- 
               <br />
               ianism which in the ﬁnal analysis leads to 
               <br />
               world dictatorship and world stateism. That 
               <br />
               principle is right or wrong. Some people may 
               <br />
               believe it to be right, but that is the issue, 
               <br />
               right or wrong; and the defeat of this amend-
