               with reference to Christie Street hospital at 
               <br />
               Toronto. As has been known, arrangements

               have been under way for some time under 
               <br />
               which all veteran patients are being trans-

               ferred from Christie Street hospital to Sunny- 
               <br />
               brook. This transfer is now rapidly being 
               <br />
               completed. As the transfer permits, the 
               <br />

               <br />
               and Commerce): Mr. Speaker, as this trans- 
               <br />
               action was handled by War Assets Corpora- 
               <br />
               tion, for which I am responsible, perhaps I 
               <br />
               may answer the question now. The circum- 
               <br />
               stances are that some time ago Chorley Park 
               <br />
               was sold to the city of Toronto, and payment 
               <br />
               of $100,000 was made to the crown. As the 
               <br />
               documents were being completed, circum- 
               <br />
               stances compelled the Department of National 
               <br />
               Defence to ask that that sale be cancelled for 
               <br />
               the time being. This morning I had a con- 
               <br />
               ference with the mayor of Toronto, and we 
               <br />
               agreed that Christie Street hospital would 
               <br />
               be substituted for Chorley Park in the former 
               <br />
               transaction. The effect is that we have sold 
               <br />
               Christie Street hospital to the city of Toronto 
               <br />
               for $100,000. The sale includes certain beds 
               <br />
               and utensils which are not required for 
               <br />
               federal purposes. It is my understanding that 
               <br />
               the building will be used in part for a hospi- 
               <br />
               tal and in part for a home for aged persons. 
               <br />
               Delivery will be made as quickly as ﬁnal 
               <br />
               transfer of patients can be made by the 
               <br />
               Department of Veterans Affairs.
