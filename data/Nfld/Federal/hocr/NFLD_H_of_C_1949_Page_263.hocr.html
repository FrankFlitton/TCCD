               I want to warn the leader of the opposi-

               tion. From the‘ very beginning, I have been 
               <br />
               a consistent defender of provincial rights in 
               <br />
               the house. He can read the speeches I have 
               <br />
               made against the succession duties act; what 
               <br />
               I have said about the Rowell-Sirois com-

               mission, and my denunciation of the bureau- 
               <br />
               crats who made that report. My votes have 
               <br />
               been consistent. I can compare myself favour- 
               <br />

               leader of the opposition. I will go further. 
               <br />
               I will tell the hon. leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               the real meaning of the subamendment. It is 
               <br />
               a desire to give the veto to the provinces in 
               <br />
               connection with this Newfoundland business, 
               <br />
               in the same way as San Francisco has given 
               <br />
               the veto to the major powers. If the veto is 
               <br />
               good enough for the Russians, it is good 
               <br />
               enough for the provinces. There is no reason 
               <br />
               why the provinces should not have it.

               ment of my hon. friend, which I was glad to 
               <br />
               support, he will vote to give a veto to the 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               road to Damascus. That does not mean that 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition is my favourite 
               <br />
               apostle, but I treat him with the same con-

               leagues; and I offer him an olive branch. 
               <br />
               That gesture shows the kindly spirit animating 
               <br />
