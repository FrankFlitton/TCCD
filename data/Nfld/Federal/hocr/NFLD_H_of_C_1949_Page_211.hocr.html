               The other thing that has bothered me in 
               <br />
               this debate, Mr. Speaker, was brought home 
               <br />
               during the speech, both before and after the 
               <br />
               dinner recess, by my hon. friend the member 
               <br />
               for Lake Centre (Mr. Diefenbaker). In com- 
               <br />
               mon with other members of this house, I 
               <br />
               always listen with a great deal of interest to 
               <br />
               the speeches the hon. member makes. I enjoy 
               <br />
               the way in which he builds up his case, and 
               <br />
               the use he makes of the material upon which 
               <br />
               he draws. No man in this house studies more 
               <br />
               or shows more background in the speeches 
               <br />
               that he makes. But this evening, he did some- 
               <br />
               thing—possibly he was unconscious of what 
               <br />
               he was doing—which amazed me. The mem- 
               <br />
               ber told this house of the position taken by 
               <br />
               his party in 1946. He stated that position 
               <br />
               correctly. He referred to the amendment 
               <br />
               that was moved in that session by himself, 
               <br />
               and he was correct in saying that that amend- 
               <br />
               ment was identical in form with the amend- 
               <br />
               ment that is now before the house. What 
               <br />
               was the issue before us at that time? The 
               <br />
               question was a request for an amendment to 
               <br />
               the British North America Act to provide for 
               <br />
               redistribution. The hon. member and his 
               <br />
               party took the view in 1946 that we should 
               <br />
               not ask for or be able to obtain an amendment 
               <br />
               of that character by a simple majority vote 
               <br />
               in this House of Commons. When the hon. 
               <br />
               member ﬁnished, I asked if he would permit 
               <br />
               me to ask a question. Perhaps I was a little 
               <br />
               too late, since it took some time for the 
               <br />
               applause for his speech to die down. At any 
               <br />
               rate, he did not answer my question. I asked 
               <br />
               him what position his party took back in 
               <br />
               1943, but the hon. member made no reply. 
               <br />

               May I tell the story. I refer you, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, to July 5, 1943. As a matter of fact 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Lake Centre (Mr. Diefen- 
               <br />
               baker) during the course of his remarks this 
               <br />
               evening took up a copy of Hansard for July 5, 
               <br />
               1943, and quoted a certain passage from a 
               <br />
               speech delivered by my leader, so I take it he 
               <br />
               must know the position taken by his party as 
               <br />
               recorded in that issue of Hansard. He must 
               <br />
               have known the way in which he voted, and 
               <br />
               that the question before the house was an 
               <br />
               amendment to the British North America Act.

               point rather than with the Minister of

               amendment to the British North America 
               <br />
               Act. At the end of that address, there was 
               <br />
               the usual phrase that all the acts down to 
               <br />
               and including this one may be described as 
               <br />
               the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1943. 
               <br />
               In other words, it was an amendment to the 
               <br />
               British North America Act, and it was 
               <br />

               My hon. friends to the right supported 
               <br />
               the move on that occasion. The member 
               <br />
               for Peel (Mr. Graydon), who was then leader 
               <br />
               of the ofﬁcial opposition, spoke on the 
               <br />
               question, but during the whole course of 
               <br />
               his speech did not raise the question of 
               <br />
               reference to the provinces. The hon. member 
               <br />
               for Lake Centre (Mr. Diefenbaker) did not 
               <br />
               speak at all. Only one member of the 
               <br />
               Progressive Conservative party raised the 
               <br />
               question at all, and that was the member 
               <br />

               the member for Lake Centre, the member

               for Peel and the whole of the Progressive

               Conservative group who were in the house 
               <br />
               at that time voted for the amendment. In 
               <br />
               other words, in 1943, they gave their approval 
               <br />
               to the principle of securing an amendment 
               <br />

               <br />

               members in the house at that time who voted 
               <br />

               the advantage of Ontario and all provinces 
               <br />
