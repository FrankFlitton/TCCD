               day that it was possible to wait until such

               consultation had been effected and the neces- 
               <br />
               sary consent obtained, I believe it is my duty 
               <br />
               to maintain in this house the attitude I have 
               <br />
               always held: that of stoutly defending the 
               <br />
               rights of Quebec and the respecting of its 
               <br />

               I must add, however, that I will not vote

               in favour of the amendment moved by the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition. I consider it to be 
               <br />
               lacking in sincerity and like a man who would 
               <br />
               arrange a way out so as to apply—if he should 
               <br />
               ever become leader of the government—the 
               <br />
               policy of centralization he advocated on Sep- 
               <br />
               tember 8 and January 26, 1939, and which is 
               <br />
               not likely to reassure Quebec.

               Therefore I state my proposal very plainly 
               <br />
               and clearly. If the Progressive Conservative 
               <br />
               party will accept my amendment to the 
               <br />

               <br />
               but if they reject my own, I submit that 
               <br />
               theirs will forever go down in parliamentary

               Mr. Ralph Maybank (Winnipeg South Cen- 
               <br />
               tre): I regret very much, Mr. Speaker, that I 
               <br />
               am not able to follow the remarks made by 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman who has just taken his 
               <br />
               seat. Always, when I hear members from 
               <br />
               Quebec speaking in the tongue that is most 
               <br />
               familiar to them, I am envious. But, when I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd them also conducting a quarrel with a 
               <br />
               non-French member of the house who is, him- 
               <br />
               self, blessed with a knowledge of “the twa 
               <br />
               tongues” my envy is still greater. I am unable 
               <br />
               to make any examination of the remarks the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman has made, but perhaps that is 
               <br />
               just‘ as well because, in the limited time at 
               <br />
               my disposal, what I really desire to do is to 
               <br />
               consider the amendment proposed by the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition. 
               <br />

               What I should like to do before this debate 
               <br />
               comes to a close is to examine what I think 
               <br />
               - is a superﬁcially clever manoeuvre by the 
               <br />
               Tory party, and just see where we would get 
               <br />
               if we followed the procedure which the hon. 
               <br />
               leader of the Tory party has offered to this 
               <br />
               house. As a matter of fact, sir, I submit to 
               <br />
               you and to the members of this house that the 
               <br />
               amendment of the Tory leader shows some- 
               <br />
               thing very important. It shows that he and 
               <br />
               all of his supporters are either inane or insin- 
               <br />

               <br />

               is so great insincerity among them as their 
               <br />
               amendment seems to disclose. But when you 
               <br />
               consider the procedure that is offered us, it 
               <br />
               is extremely difficult to believe that these 
               <br />
               gentlemen and the leader of these gentlemen 
               <br />
               can actually be so foolish as this proposal 
               <br />
               shows them to be. Well, I have to say I do 
               <br />
               not know which description applies to them; 
               <br />
               that is, whether they are foolish or insincere.

               But perhaps what this amendment says 
               <br />
               should be examined in the light of the record 
               <br />
               that we have before us; and I should like, just 
               <br />
               brieﬂy, to set forth that record. Last week 
               <br />
               all of these gentlemen were indicating, by 
               <br />
               their various speeches, that just as soon as 
               <br />
               possible—and certainly by March 31—they 
               <br />
               wanted to get the commonwealth, shall I say, 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland into the confederation 
               <br />
               known as Canada. And tonight they would 
               <br />
               claim they still propose to do just that same 
               <br />
