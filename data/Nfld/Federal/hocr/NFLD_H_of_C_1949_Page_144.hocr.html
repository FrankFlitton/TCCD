               Mr. Chevrier: I am sorry I waSanot here 
               <br />
               when the junior member for Halifax began 
               <br />
               his remarks, but from what he said afterward 
               <br />
               I gathered he was interested in the trans- 
               <br />
               portation facilities in that area, and I think 
               <br />
               mainland of Cape Breton and Newfoundland 
               <br />

               member for Cape Breton South also inter— 
               <br />
               jected some remarks to which perhaps I 
               <br />
               should reply.

               I had not expected, and I am sure the com- 
               <br />
               mittee did not interpret, section 32 of the

               <br />
               section upon which something should be said 
               <br />
               about Canso. However, I am quite prepared 
               <br />
               at this time to tell my hon. friends, particu- 
               <br />
               larly the junior member for Halifax, who 
               <br />
               dealt with it at the beginning of his remarks, 
               <br />
               that it is rather difﬁcult to deal with a matter 
               <br />
               which is still in the hands of a board of 
               <br />
               engineers. I am sure the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Cape Breton South is most anxious to draw 
               <br />
               me out. I would not think the junior mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Halifax would want to do that; but 
               <br />
               much as I would like to be drawn out I can 
               <br />
               only repeat what I said before, which is that 
               <br />
               the board of engineers is still studying the 
               <br />
               project. There are four methods of trans— 
               <br />
               portation across the straits: the tunnel, the 
               <br />
               bridge, the causeway and improved facili- 
               <br />
               ties. In the last conversation I had with the 
               <br />
               board of engineers they indicated to me that 
               <br />
               they could come to no conclusion as to which 
               <br />
               of these methods of transportation would be 
               <br />
               most suitable and most practicable having 
               <br />
               regard to all the circumstances, but that 
               <br />
               before they could carefully consider the 
               <br />
               question of a bridge they would have to get 
               <br />
               authorization to put a test pier down in the 
               <br />
               strait in order to get certain data. The con-

               Another point raised by the junior member 
               <br />
               for Halifax was in connection with the trans- 
               <br />
               portation facilities not only to and from the 
               <br />
               I can deal with this rather quickly. The 
               <br />
               preliminary survey made by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁcers</span> of 
               <br />
               the Canadian National Railways indicated 
               <br />
               that after union there would be a consider- 
               <br />
               able increase in transportation to and from 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. The report indicated an 
               <br />
               increase of thirty per cent for coastal steam- 
               <br />
               ships, a thirty per cent increase in rail trafﬁc, 
               <br />
               and a twenty—ﬁve per cent increase in trafﬁc 
               <br />
               across Cabot strait; and, as has been brought 
               <br />
               out already, I think it will be necessary to 
               <br />
               improve the facilities at North Sydney. That 
               <br />
               is being given careful consideration at the 
               <br />
               moment, and when the matter has been 
               <br />
               brought to a deﬁnite position it will be pos-
