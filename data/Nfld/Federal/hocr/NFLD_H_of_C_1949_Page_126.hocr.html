               Mr. Nicholson: The ﬁnancial aspects are 
               <br />
               really what I wanted to discuss. The Minister 
               <br />
               of Finance gave a very low estimate. The 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance gave an early estimate, I 
               <br />
               would think, in the light of past performance, 
               <br />
               and the Minister of Transport was not here 
               <br />
               yesterday when I mentioned that freight rates 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland are about twice as high as 
               <br />
               in the maritimes. In this report I ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               the present rate on whale oil from St. John’s 
               <br />
               to Moncton is $1.25, while the projected rate 
               <br />
               under the Maritime Freight Rates Act is 60 
               <br />
               cents. The rates on whale guano are $1.25 and 
               <br />
               60 cents; on lingon berries, $1.65 and 90 cents; 
               <br />
               on cod ﬁllets, $1.40 and 75 cents. The same 
               <br />
               thing applies to commodities moving to St. 
               <br />
               John’s. The rate on fresh meat from Monc- 
               <br />
               ton is $1.24, and the new rate will be 73 cents. 
               <br />
               The rate on condensed milk is $1.58, and the 
               <br />
               new rate will be $1. I also understand that 
               <br />
               present wages in Newfoundland are a good 
               <br />
               deal lower than in Canada, and that they are 
               <br />
               to be brought up to Canadian rates. I wonder 
               <br />
               if the Minister of Transport will indicate how 
               <br />
               the estimate of one and a half million dollars 
               <br />
               was reached.

               Mr. Abbott: I said that was an early 
               <br />
               estimate, and we must not be held too closely 
               <br />
               to it. That estimate was made in 1947. As 
               <br />
               yet we have made no estimate beyond that 
               <br />

               Mr. Nicholson: I think the minister revised 
               <br />
               his ﬁgures yesterday. I believe some member 
               <br />

               <br />
               and give us some idea of the situation. Before 
               <br />
               many weeks I imagine the Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance will have to bring supplementary 
               <br />

               at this stage he would be able to give us some

               general way the questions the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               has in mind. I believe he is raising three 
               <br />
               points now, though I did not see the ques- 
               <br />

               <br />
               was not here at the time. In reference to the

               moment is that it operates on a ﬁscal year 
               <br />
               basis, and that for the year 1948 there is a 
               <br />
               deﬁcit of something in the neighbourhood of 
               <br />
               $2,200,000; and that if the Canadian National 
               <br />
               Railways were to take it over under the terms 
               <br />

               He also asked some questions in reference 
               <br />
               to rates. I am unable to go into the detailed 
               <br />
               rate structure, which would be a matter of 
               <br />
               some length and would require a great deal 
               <br />
               of technical knowledge. I can tell him, how- 
               <br />
               ever, that it is the intention to apply to the 
               <br />
               new province of Newfoundland the same 
               <br />
               basic rate structure which now applies to the 
               <br />
               maritime region. In other words, the basic 
               <br />
               rate structure which exists today in the three 
               <br />
               maritime provinces would be made applicable 
               <br />
               to the province of Newfoundland. That 
               <br />
               would mean, I should think, a considerable 
               <br />
               decrease in those rates. What it may be in 
               <br />
               the way of percentage it is difﬁcult to say, 
               <br />
               because there are hundreds and even 
               <br />
               thousands of rates. The Canadian National 
               <br />
               Railways, were they to take over the New- 
               <br />
               foundland railway, would ﬁle with the board 
               <br />
               of transport commissioners the basic rate 
               <br />
               structure for the island, and thereafter any- 
               <br />
               one who felt discriminated against could 
               <br />
