               In Quebec at the present time there is a 
               <br />
               civil code which came into force in 1866, and 
               <br />
               which contains provisions that the parliament 
               <br />
               of Canada would have the right to amend or 
               <br />
               repeal. But it has not yet been seen ﬁt to 
               <br />
               do that. The legislature of Quebec would not 
               <br />
               have the right to enact that kind of legiSIa- 
               <br />
               tion, but it does apply as a part of the legis- 
               <br />
               lation of Quebec until such time as parlia- 
               <br />
               ment sees ﬁt to deal with it. It will be the 
               <br />
               same with respect to Newfoundland. They 
               <br />
               have a certain body of laws which will con- 
               <br />
               tinue to be applied until by proclamation it 
               <br />
               is stated that the present laws of the domin- 
               <br />
               ion in that regard will be substituted for 
               <br />
               those that exist in the province. or course it 
               <br />
               is not intended that it will take very long. 
               <br />
               It is intended to be merely a transitional 
               <br />
               measure to bring progressively into force 
               <br />
               those Canadian laws under conditions which 
               <br />
               will not prove to be embarrassing; and it is 
               <br />
               perhaps because there were on the delegation 
               <br />
