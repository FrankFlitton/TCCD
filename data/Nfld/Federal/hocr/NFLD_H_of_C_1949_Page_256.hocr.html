               That is just the issue which is before us 
               <br />
               now. It is a question which is too greatly 
               <br />
               charged with serious consequences for the 
               <br />
               future welfare of this country for us to per-

               mit ourselves to deal with it on the basis of 
               <br />
               expediency, on the basis that it is a mere 
               <br />
               procedural matter, on the basis of conven-

               <br />
               As was well said this afternoon by the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Stanstead (Mr. Hackett), it is a 
               <br />
               matter of the constitution under which the 
               <br />
               development of this country has proceeded 
               <br />
               in the past; it is a matter of the constitution 
               <br />
               which guarantees or has guaranteed to us 
               <br />
               the freedom and liberty, and the opportunity 
               <br />
               for advancement and self-expression, which 
               <br />
               have made Canada and the Canadian people 
               <br />
               the country and” people that they are.

               Again I say that it is not enough to dismiss 
               <br />
               this question by sayingthat the constitution 
               <br />
               does not provide for consultation with the 
               <br />
               provinces on questions of admission of new 
               <br />
               territory into the dominion, because the 
               <br />
               position is that the constitution itself pro- 
               <br />
               vides methods by which new territories could 
               <br />
               be added. So long as the constitutional 
               <br />
               method is followed, there is of course no 
               <br />
               necessity of consulting with the provinces. 
               <br />
               Whether we consider that the British North 
               <br />
               America Act is a pact, a treaty, a compact, 
               <br />
               or a contract, the inescapable fact is this: 
               <br />
               the original parties to confederation had in 
               <br />
               mind the possibility of the subsequent entry 
               <br />
               into confederation of new territory. They 
               <br />
               considered that matter carefully, and agreed 
               <br />
               to and laid down certain procedures which 
               <br />
               should be followed when that event should 
               <br />
               come to pass. That agreement having been 
               <br />
               entered into and having been given binding 
               <br />
               form under the British North America Act, 
               <br />
               if that procedure is followed there is then 
               <br />
               no need to consult with any of the provinces 
               <br />
               or any of the other members of confederation 
               <br />
               ———and I would point out that the provinces 
               <br />
               are members of confederation. But that is 
               <br />
               not the position here. The position here is 
               <br />
               that the constitutional procedure, the pro- 
               <br />
               cedure already agreed to by the parties to 
               <br />
               confederation, is not being followed. Surely, 
               <br />
               therefore, it is not only legally correct but 
               <br />
               it is only morally just that the parties to

               I have referred to what is the actual point 
               <br />
               at issue here, as I see it. Last week we 
               <br />
               settled the question of the desirability or 
               <br />
               otherwise of the admission of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               into confederation. In spite of all the slight- 
               <br />
               ing remarks which have been leveled at 
               <br />
               the members of this side individually and 
               <br />
               as a party for what is said by our opponents 
               <br />
               to be a reversal in our stand, the fact is that 
               <br />
               we have not reversed our stand. We stand 
               <br />
               ﬁrm by our original position that it is a 
               <br />
               desirable thing that Newfoundland should be 
               <br />
               admitted into the family of the confederation 
               <br />
               of Canada. What we raise objection to is that 
               <br />
               now the very fact of that desirability, which 
               <br />
               we sincerely and in good faith agreed to, 
               <br />
               should be urged as a compulsion on us, in 
               <br />
               an effort to force us to agree to an uncon- 
               <br />
               stitutional method of attaining a desirable 
               <br />
               objective. If there be any insincerity in the 
               <br />
               approach to this matter, it is on the part 
               <br />
               of those on government benches when they 
               <br />
               seek to resort to methods of that kind.

               Here again we see asserted the principle 
               <br />
               that the constitution can be amended in a 
               <br />
               matter of vital importance to the whole 
               <br />
               framework of confederation—the question of 
               <br />
               the admission or exclusion of new territory— 
               <br />
               without consultation with the parties to con- 
               <br />
               federation, by mere majority vote in this 
               <br />
               house. We have in the past taken our stand 
               <br />
               against that proposition. Our stand is one 
               <br />
               which actually needs no justiﬁcation beyond 
               <br />
               its own merits. It is in fact justiﬁed and 
               <br />
               supported by the principles laid down by 
               <br />
               past great leaders of confederation, including 
               <br />
               great leaders of the Liberal party.

               We again question and again deny the 
               <br />
               principle contended for by the present Prime 
               <br />
               Minister when he was Minister of Justice in 
               <br />

               which was based the redistribution of that 
               <br />
               year. We deny the principle that the federal

               parliament has the right, by a mere majority 
               <br />
