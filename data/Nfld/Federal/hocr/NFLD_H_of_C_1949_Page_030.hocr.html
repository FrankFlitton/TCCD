               situation with respect to Newfoundland, but 
               <br />
               after all I think the completion of the scheme 
               <br />
               of confederation is of more concern to the 
               <br />
               general Canadian public than is the question 
               <br />
               of determining whether Mr. John Jones or 
               <br />
               Mr. Tom Allen, residing in one of the villages 
               <br />
               or towns of Newfoundland, shall have the 
               <br />
               right to use oleomargarine instead of having 
               <br />

               I think those are the only departures from 
               <br />
               the general scheme, because in a general 
               <br />
               way it was the desire of those people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland who favoured entry into 
               <br />
               Canada to become Canadian citizens, subject 
               <br />
               to the same laws and entitled to the same 
               <br />

               I come now to the matter of ﬁnancial terms. 
               <br />
               That was a tough one. The people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland did not want to become a province 
               <br />
               of Canada under conditions which would not 
               <br />
               make it reasonably probable that they could 
               <br />
               carry on successfully, and participate in the 
               <br />
               advantages which appertain to Canadians 
               <br />
               generally. We on our side wanted to provide 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial terms which would make it reason- 
               <br />
               ably probable, if not certain, that the addition 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland to the economy of Canada 
               <br />
               would ultimately prove to be beneﬁcial to both 
               <br />
               partners, to the older Canadians and to the 
               <br />
               newer arrivals. It was found, after more 
               <br />
               precise and careful study of the administra- 
               <br />
               tive problems that would be faced by the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment of the province of Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               that the terms suggested in the offer submit- 
               <br />
               ted in October, 1947, would not be sufﬁcient 
               <br />
               at the start to enable the provincial govern- 
               <br />
               ment to provide for its people on a basis com-

               parable to that which is provided by the other 
               <br />
               Canadian provinces. It was felt there had to 
               <br />
               be quite substantial provisional grants, extend- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the present economy of the island to the kind 
               <br />
               of economy which would make it possible for 
               <br />
               the provincial government to provide the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland with substantially 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Canadian people by their provincial gov-

               ernments, without resorting to a burden of 
               <br />
               taxation heavier, having regard to capacity 
               <br />
               to pay, than that which bears upon the people 
               <br />

               would be most nearly comparable to the

               situation which would be apt to develop in

               After long negotiations it proved possible,

               I think, to arrive at the scheme which is set 
               <br />
               out in the terms of union, and which is apt to 
               <br />
               achieve that result. Human foresight, how-

               the coming into force of the terms of union 
               <br />
               a commission would be set up to examine the

               object of equalizing the lot of the people of 
               <br />
               the new province with that of the people of 
               <br />

               that may be made at that time by a royal 
               <br />
               commission. It was felt by the Newfoundland

               delegation, and by the representatives of the 
               <br />
               Canadian government, that this was some-

               <br />
               of fairness on both sides, and that it was not

               <br />
               what would happen with respect to the report 
               <br />
               of a royal commission. It was felt if there 
               <br />
               was an investigation and a report by a com-

               At the time many people in Newfoundland

               felt that the government of the United King-

               ernment to discuss and negotiate a possible 
               <br />
               union with Canada. The government of the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom chose to call together a

               whether they wished to join us in our march 
               <br />
               toward the future. The people of Newfound-
