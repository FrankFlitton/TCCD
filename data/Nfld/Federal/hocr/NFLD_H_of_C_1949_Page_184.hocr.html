               Hon. members will recall that following the 
               <br />
               radio address made by the Prime Minister, 
               <br />
               in which he had indicated that we should 
               <br />
               strive to provide for amendment of our own 
               <br />
               constitution without going outside of Canada 
               <br />
               for that purpose, I asked him whether it was 
               <br />
               intended to proceed with that matter during 
               <br />
               the present session, and he indicated that 
               <br />
               such was not the intention of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment. I also asked the Prime Minister if the 
               <br />
               provinces would be consulted when it was 
               <br />
               decided to proceed with that matter, and he 
               <br />
               said that they would. He has recognized the 
               <br />
               desirability of consulting the provinces about 
               <br />
               matters which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affect</span> our constitution, and the 
               <br />
               concern of the provinces about the sanctity 
               <br />
               of that constitution. In this case we have 
               <br />
               before us an amendment to the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. The draft bill, which is part 
               <br />
               of the resolution, says in section 2: 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               This act may be cited as the British North America

               <br />
               to 1946. and this act may be cited together as the

               government of the United Kingdom to amend 
               <br />

               ity decision of the parliament of Canada, 
               <br />
               without consulting the provinces. The ques- 
               <br />
               tion then arises whether the provinces have 
               <br />

               The Prime Minister himself has made it 
               <br />
               clear that he believes the procedure being 
               <br />
               followed relates to the Statute of West- 
               <br />
               minster, and he referred to section 4 as 
               <br />
               explaining the procedure being followed by 
               <br />
               the parliament of Canada. As I have already 
               <br />
               indicated, the wording of the resolution con- 
               <br />
               forms with the exact wording of section 4 of 
               <br />
               the Statute of Westminster. 
               <br />

               The Prime Minister has pointed out that 
               <br />
               Newfoundland may not have carried for- 
               <br />
               ward all the formalities on their side, which 
               <br />
               in my opinion does not in any way affect 
               <br />
               what they might or might not do, if within 
               <br />
               the Statute of Westminster they had the 
               <br />
               legislative authority which deﬁned their 
               <br />
               position as a dominion. And, in so far as we 
               <br />
               are concerned, I think we should remember 
               <br />
               that the provinces were- conceded a very 
               <br />
               direct interest in the Statute of Westminster 
               <br />

               Since this does raise what I believe to be 
               <br />
               a very important consideration, I would refer 
               <br />
               to the report of the Senate of Canada at the 
               <br />

               You will recall that in some discussions we have

               had with reference to the report of the imperial

               <br />
               made in the report of 1929, I have endeavoured to 
               <br />

               The conference appears to have ignored the fact

               that the confederation of the provinces of Canada 
               <br />
               was brought about by the action of the provinces. 
               <br />
               Our constitution is really the crystallization into 
               <br />
               law by an imperial statute of an agreement made by 
               <br />
               the provinces after full consultation and discussion.

               that this agreement should not be altered without
