               how in the late seventeenth and eighteenth 
               <br />
               century ﬁsherfolk who crossed the Atlantic 
               <br />
               paid their church tithes after having returned 
               <br />
               from ﬁshing expeditions on the grand banks. 
               <br />
               When they came back, this great reservoir 
               <br />
               of new food for a hungry continent of 
               <br />
               Europe was more valuable to the people of 
               <br />
               Europe than all the treasures Sir Walter 
               <br />
               Raleigh hoped to ﬁnd farther south. It was 
               <br />
               his brother adventurer, Sir Humphrey Gil- 
               <br />
               bert, who concentrated upon Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               I believe it was Francis Bacon who said that 
               <br />
               the ﬁsheries of Newfoundland were more 
               <br />
               valuable to posterity than all the mines of 
               <br />
               Peru. I believe that is true.

               So the beginnings of Newfoundland were 
               <br />
               laid by hardy ﬁsherfolk who, perhaps, had 
               <br />
               no thought of settling so far across the stormy 
               <br />
               ocean. But it was the wealth of ﬁsh which 
               <br />
               laid the foundation of Newfoundland, just 
               <br />
               as it may be said that the fur trade laid the 
               <br />
               foundation of New France. And just as in 
               <br />
               the seventeenth century Canada was typi- 
               <br />
               cally French in its origins, characteristics 
               <br />
               and customs, so it may be said that New- 
               <br />
               foundland is typically British in its origins, 
               <br />
               in its customs, and in its general outlook 
               <br />
               upon life.

               is now the Northwest Territories, Manitoba, 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan and Alberta, so the ﬁsh-dealing 
               <br />
               merchants of the west of England tried to 
               <br />
               keep settlers from landing and taking root in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. They wanted to keep the
