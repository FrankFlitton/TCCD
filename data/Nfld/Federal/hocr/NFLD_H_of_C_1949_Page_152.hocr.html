               Mr. MacNicol: I want to ask two questions 
               <br />
               on this section. First, what will be the posi- 
               <br />
               tion of the South African war veteran in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland after confederation? Will it 
               <br />
               be the same as that of the South African 
               <br />
               veteran in Canada? Second, what about the 
               <br />
               widows of deceased non—pensioned soldiers? 
               <br />
               Will their position be the same in Newfound-

               Mr. Knowles: This is an omnibus section, 
               <br />
               which covers a number of matters, and to 
               <br />
               begin with I should like to ask one or two 
               <br />
               questions in reference to old age pensions. I 
               <br />
               am sorry the Minister of National Health and 
               <br />
               Welfare is not in his seat, but I see his par— 
               <br />
               liamentary assistant is here. One situation 
               <br />
               obtains in connection with old age pensions 
               <br />
               which is somewhat analogous to the problem 
               <br />
               that has just been discussed with respect to 
               <br />
               the war veterans allowance. I refer to the 
               <br />
               residence qualiﬁcations. If I understand the 
               <br />
               terms aright, once Newfoundland becomes 
               <br />
               part of Canada it will mean—and I would 
               <br />
               say rightly so—that a person who has lived 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland for the required qualifying 
               <br />
               period, which is twenty years as deﬁned in the 
               <br />
               regulations, will qualify for the old age pen- 
               <br />
               sion. This means that before long we are 
               <br />
               going to have this situation. We will have 
               <br />
               people who have lived in Newfoundland for 
               <br />
               a period of eighteen years, during which time

               pay its share of the contribution to old

               <br />
               the legislature puts an old age pensions act 
               <br />
               into effect? That would mean, of course, that 
               <br />
               under present conditions persons in New- 
               <br />

               <br />
               qualifying for the old age pension, would 
               <br />
               receive a pension of $22.50 a month. Has 
               <br />
               that phase of the question been discussed?
