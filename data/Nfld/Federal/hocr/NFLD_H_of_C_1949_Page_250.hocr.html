               the house, with which I was dealing before 
               <br />
               I was so rudely and unnecessarily interrupt-

               the next step in the proceedings was an 
               <br />
               address to be passed by this parliament, 
               <br />
               directed to the British parliament, which 
               <br />

               said. Up to last Friday the position was that 
               <br />
               the Tories were taking the position that they 
               <br />
               wanted to effect the union of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               and Canada in accordance with the terms of 
               <br />
               the agreement already mentioned, and to do it 
               <br />
