               Mr. Maybank: When these gentlemen make 
               <br />
               up their minds whether or not they want me 
               <br />
               to go ahead, then I will know. They seem to 
               <br />
               be a little uncertain. By their amendment the 
               <br />
               Tories have put themselves in the position 
               <br />
               that, according to them, the resolution pro- 
               <br />
               posed, whereby Newfoundland will be 
               <br />
               brought into confederation, is wrong, and 
               <br />
               that the only right way is to have the amend- 
               <br />
               ment carried which would send the matter to 
               <br />
               all of the provinces one after the other for 
               <br />
               agreement, or veto. A good many remarks 
               <br />
               were made by the hon. member for Stanstead 
               <br />
               (Mr. Hackett) which seem to indicate that is, 
               <br />
               indeed, the position they are taking. If that 
               <br />
               is their line, if the procedure of their amend- 
               <br />
               ment is what must be done, then they should 
               <br />
               vote against the motion of the government to 
               <br />
               bring Newfoundland into confederation. They 
               <br />
               should vote against it if they have the nerve 
               <br />
               to do so. I challenge the Tories now to 
               <br />
               vote against the resolution. I tell them to 
               <br />
               their faces that, in spite of all their talk, 
               <br />
               yelling and laughter, they have not got the 
               <br />
               nerve to do so. They are again trying to 
               <br />
               play both ends against the middle. They are 
               <br />
               hoping to be able to go out and say, “We did 
               <br />
               everything we could to bring Newfoundland 
               <br />
               in”; and they want to say in some places, “We 
               <br />
               did everything we could to keep Newfound- 
               <br />
               land out except on your say—so.” They want 
               <br />
               to be in the position of saying both. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Under their scheme you will ﬁnd them 
               <br />
               striving to get as many votes as possible in 
               <br />
               Ontario by saying, “We took the proper line 
               <br />
               for Canadian expansion to bring in this ﬁne 
               <br />
               new province.” That is what they want to 
               <br />
               say in Ontario. In some places in Quebec they 
               <br />
               want to say, “You see, we did all we could 
               <br />
               to put Maurice Duplessis in the position we 
               <br />
               wanted him to be, the arbiter of all such 
               <br />
               things as this.” That is their position, and I 
               <br />
               dare them to vote against the resolution.

               Mr. E. D. Fulton (Kamloops): Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               I enter this debate for one main purpose; 
               <br />
               that is, to clear up an obvious misconception 
               <br />
               which exists as to the real meaning of the 
               <br />
               amendment moved by the leader of the oppo- 
               <br />
               sition (Mr. Drew). But before I do that I 
               <br />
               feel I must make reference to some remarks 
               <br />
               which have been made, mainly from the other 
               <br />
               side of the house. I think most hon. mem- 
               <br />
               bers have heard about as much as they wish 
               <br />
               to hear from or about the hon. member who 
               <br />
               has just taken his seat, but I cannot allow his 
               <br />
               remarks to go altogether unanswered, so I 
               <br />
               shall start with them though I shall not dwell 
               <br />
               on them for longer than is necessary. The 
               <br />
               hon. member made a great deal of the words 
               <br />
               “inanity” and “insincerity”. From the whole 
               <br />
               tenor of his remarks it becomes obvious to 
               <br />
               hon. members, I think even on his own side. 
               <br />
               that anyone so incapable of experiencing or 
               <br />
               understanding sincerity as he would not be 
               <br />
               able to see any sincerity in a suggestion made 
               <br />
               by anyone else. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               There is one thing, however, on which I 
               <br />
               think the hon. member for Winnipeg South 
               <br />
               should be congratulated. He has studied the 
               <br />
               rules with such care and diligence and to such 
               <br />
               good effect—and apparently just for this pur— 
               <br />
               pose—that he can come closer than any other 
               <br />
               hon. member can to unparliamentary language, 
               <br />
               procedure and behaviour without actually 
               <br />
               overstepping the bounds.

               But that is the only thing upon which he 
               <br />
               is to be congratulated. Indeed, if success in 
               <br />
               this house to is be measured by the proportion 
               <br />
               of calculated insult and contumely carried in 
               <br />
               speeches, then certainly the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Winnipeg South, who has just resumed his 
               <br />
