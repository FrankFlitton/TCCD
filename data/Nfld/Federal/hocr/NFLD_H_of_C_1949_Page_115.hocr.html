               brought about by the moisture content of the

               I made a comparison of the costs to the 
               <br />
               consumer in Newfoundland. I found that 
               <br />
               people along the coast were generally op- 
               <br />
               posed to confederation. One argument I used 
               <br />
               was that it would cost them much less to live 
               <br />
               if they were part of Canada because their 
               <br />
               present rates of duty are so high. I found 
               <br />
               that the cost of ordinary groceries, food and 
               <br />
               other articles was from ﬁfty per cent to one 
               <br />
               hundred per cent more than in Canada. If 
               <br />
               these people are given an opportunity to buy 
               <br />
               at rates comparable to what we pay, they will 
               <br />
               buy much more. That will be better for the 
               <br />
               older provinces of Canada and it will help 
               <br />
               to reduce the deﬁcits on the railroad by 
               <br />

               <br />
               the west coast. There is a greater need for

               diction of the Minister of Trade and Com-

               The paragraph to which my hon. friend has

               from the section itself, Newfoundland is being 
               <br />
               permitted to retain its surplus, which amounts 
               <br />
               to some $26 million. That is a rather unusual 
               <br />
               provision when the dominion is taking over 
               <br />
               most of the debt, but it was felt that it was 
               <br />
               quite proper that that should be done and the 
               <br />
               surplus made available to the new provincial

               to use it in the interests of the province. 
               <br />
               However, it was felt that it would not be 
               <br />
               appropriate that it should be used to subsidize 
               <br />

               <br />
               they might enter into unfair competition with 
               <br />
               those of the other provinces. That was a con-

               dition in the original proposals for union and 
               <br />
