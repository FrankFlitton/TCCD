               <br />
               the Canadian federal structure. There are two 
               <br />
               extreme views on this subject, both of which 
               <br />

               <br />
               View which I hope none of us holds. That view 
               <br />
               has been embodied in words used by the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition at another time. I 
               <br />
               think I should quote him because his words 
               <br />
               have already been put on Hansa'rd and I 
               <br />
               think they are quite interesting and of some 
               <br />
               importance. He said in 1941:

               that was the view which was expressed by

               certain speakers in the Social Credit group,

               said last night in a very interesting speech 
               <br />
               that he felt that the powers of the provinces 
               <br />
               should be increased; that they should get 
               <br />
               enough money from the federal government 
               <br />
               to carry out their responsibilities, but that 
               <br />
               those responsibilities should be increased so 
               <br />
               that they would have control and power over 
               <br />
               such things as prices and markets.

               that occasion there was no consultation with

               the provinces. The facts as I understand 
               <br />
               them are that since 1867 there have been ten 
               <br />
               substantive amendments to the British North 
               <br />
               America Act—1871, 1875, 1886, 1907, 1915, 
               <br />

               In connection with only two of those 
               <br />
               amendments were the provinces consulted, in 
               <br />
               1907 and 1940. The 1907 amendment had to 
               <br />
               do with the alteration of provincial subsidies 
               <br />
               and the 1940 amendment was designed to

               transfer authority for unemployment insur- 
               <br />
               ance from the provinces to the dominion. 
               <br />
               Those were clearly questions which affected 
               <br />
               provincial jurisdiction and provincial rights

               night—again I hope I am quoting him correct- 
               <br />
               ly—that in the matter of amendment of our

               <br />
               is absolutely necessary. If it is absolutely 
               <br />
               necessary, such action has not been taken very 
               <br />
               often. Certainly there has not been a single 
               <br />
               case in our history when such consultation 
               <br />

               I think the origin of this idea of consulta- 
               <br />
               tion is to be found in the theory of the devel- 
               <br />
               opment of our federal structure which is 
               <br />
               referred to by constitutionalists as the com- 
               <br />
               pact theory or the treaty theory or the con- 
               <br />
               tract theory. The idea is that at the beginning 
               <br />
               of the Canadian nation, in 1865 to 1867, the 
               <br />
               provinces made a contract. They made a con- 
               <br />
               tract with whom? Of course not with the 
               <br />
               dominion government because it did not exist, 
               <br />
               and indeed not on behalf of all the provinces 
               <br />
               because they did not exist. At that time there 
               <br />
               was not even a province of Quebec or a prov- 
               <br />
               ince of Ontario, because they had been joined 
               <br />
               as the province of Canada.’ It is also well to 
               <br />
               remember that in 1865 to 1867 the compact,
