               expression, through their representatives in

               Canada that union is desired and should take

               explanatory. The house has already sanc-

               tioned the principle that there should be 
               <br />
               such an address, because it has approved the 
               <br />
               terms of union, the ﬁftieth of which is that 
               <br />

               requirement of an act of the parliament of 
               <br />
               the United Kingdom has been approved by 
               <br />
               the house, and the terms of the Statute of

               Westminster make it necessary, to achieve 
               <br />
               that end, that there should be the address

               I think it is proper to say that the govern—

               the Canadian people, are all gratiﬁed to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that the matter of the union of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               .with Canada has been dealt with so thorough— 
               <br />
               ly, on such a high level, and with the 
               <br />
               unanimity witnessed in our proceedings 
               <br />
               during the course of the last week. It must 
               <br />
               be a source of satisfaction to those who will 
               <br />
               soon be our new fellow citizens in this nation 
               <br />
               that it was the common view of all parties 
               <br />
               in this house, representing all sections of 
               <br />
               the Canadian people, that it would be 
               <br />
               desirable to have the people of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               become associated with us. Of course the 
               <br />
               Canadian people have never really thought 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland as another country, and 
               <br />
               the fact that they are to become associated 
               <br />
               with us is, for all older Canadians, a source 
               <br />
               of particular satisfaction. We have in French 
               <br />
               a saying which goes like this: Dis-moi qui 
               <br />
               tu nantes, et je te dirai qui tu es. I was 
               <br />
               accustomed to thinking that the English

               equivalent was: Birds of a feather ﬂock 
               <br />
               together, but it is really more than that. If 
               <br />
               I might venture to translate the French saying 
               <br />
               it would go something like this: Tell me 
               <br />
               with whom you are associated, and that will 
               <br />
               tell me what you are. We of Canada are 
               <br />
               happy that those who know the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland will be judging us by their 
               <br />
               knowledge of the sturdy qualities of those 
               <br />
               splendid people. I hope that the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland will be equally satisﬁed to 
               <br />
               be judged by what their new Canadian fellow 
               <br />
               citizens have been able to achieve during 
               <br />
               the eighty years which have elapsed since 
               <br />

               derived from our common origin, from 
               <br />
               common development of our respective social

               association between the young men and 
               <br />
               young women of our respective peoples during 
               <br />
               the two great wars, and particularly during 
               <br />
               the last war. Many of our sons and daughters 
               <br />
               served with the young men and young women 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland, some of them in Newfound- 
               <br />
               land itself, others on the high seas with units 
               <br />
               of the Royal Canadian Navy based in New- 
               <br />
               foundland. If I may be permitted to mention 
               <br />
               something quite personal, I feel particularly 
               <br />
               close to the people of Newfoundland by reason 
               <br />
               of the fact that, during the many months of 
               <br />
               my son’s service in convoy duty on the 
               <br />
               Atlantic, the units of the Royal Canadian 
               <br />
               Navy with which he was serving were based 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland. What was my own exper- 
               <br />
               ience during those days was the experience 
               <br />
               of thousands of Canadians. It created a 
               <br />
               relationship which makes the prospect of 
               <br />
               common citizenship with those splendid 
               <br />
               people one that is very pleasant to envisage.

               I shall not attempt to summarize the great 
               <br />
               history of the sturdy people of Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               wresting their sustenance from the sea, as 
               <br />
               most of our people, in the early days, had to 
               <br />
               wrest their sustenance from the forests and 
               <br />
               the ﬁeld‘s. Although there was a difference 
               <br />
               in vocation, the difference seems only to have 
               <br />
               created a close relationship between our two 
               <br />
               peoples. There is a great poet, E. J. Pratt, 
               <br />
               whom we claim as Canadian but whom 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders claim to be a poet of New- 
               <br />
               foundland; hereafter, though being a Canadian 
               <br />
               poet, he will at the same time be a poet 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland. We are familiar, as they
