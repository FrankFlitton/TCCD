               Mr. Garson: The statement in connection 
               <br />
               with this resolution must necessarily be an 
               <br />
               extremely short one. As hon. members 
               <br />
               know, there are on the federal statute books 
               <br />
               of Canada a number of statutes which refer 
               <br />
               to the various provinces of Canada by name. 
               <br />
               They have to do with a variety of subjects. 
               <br />
               The only purpose of the bill, to which this 
               <br />
               resolution is the introduction, is to amend 
               <br />
               those various statutes by inserting the word 
               <br />
               “Newfoundland” in the appropriate places in 
               <br />
               order to make all of those statutes now upon 
               <br />
               the books apply to Newfoundland in the same 
               <br />
               way as they do to every other province of 
               <br />
               Canada. When the bill goes into committee 
               <br />
               anyone who is interested may follow, section 
               <br />
               by section, the explanations which are given 
               <br />
               opposite, and tie them in, but all of these 
               <br />
               provisions without exception are what lawyers 
               <br />
               term consequential in that they arise out 
               <br />

               <br />
               foundland being brought into confederation. 
               <br />
               They are the amending provisions that have 
               <br />
               to be made in a number of federal statutes.

               Mr. A. L. Smith (Calgary West): I am not 
               <br />
               attempting to speak on this, but I should like 
               <br />
               to learn from the Minister of Justice (Mr. 
               <br />
               Garson) what method has been adopted. Have 
               <br />
               you gone through all the statutes of Canada 
               <br />
               with a view to ﬁnding the particular ones 
               <br />
               that need to be amended, or will your bill 
               <br />
               be in somewhat general terms, saying that 
               <br />
               where so and so is mentioned it shall be 
               <br />
               deemed to include Newfoundland? I am 
               <br />
               merely asking for information. For example, 
               <br />
               I can think of a number of places in the 
               <br />
               criminal code Where there are speciﬁc provi- 
               <br />
               sions relating to certain provinces which do 
               <br />
               not apply to other provinces. Will the bill 
               <br />
               when we get it, with the explanations, call 
               <br />
               attention to the individual statutes to which 
               <br />
               the bill may have reference, so that we can 
               <br />
               understand it without doing a great deal of 
               <br />
               research on our own?

               <br />
               living has now reached the highest ﬁgure in 
               <br />

               phenomenal. The cost of living index in 
               <br />
               August, 1945, stood at 119-6. It has now 
               <br />
               risen to 159—6. That is a tremendous increase 
               <br />
               since the removal of controls; and the effect, 
               <br />
               of course, is really disastrous on people with 
               <br />
               small and ﬁxed incomes, such as veterans 
               <br />
               and other pensioners, or people whose wages 
               <br />
               or salary have not gone up to any extent. 
               <br />
               It seems to me this is a matter with which 
               <br />
               the house should grapple this session. I have 
               <br />
               noticed that in the United States, for example, 
               <br />
               where the increase has been greater than here 
               <br />
               and the cost of living ﬁgure is higher, in his 
               <br />
               message to congress President Truman 
               <br />
               indicated the necessity of doing something 
               <br />
               about the restoration of controls if the cost 
               <br />
               of living did not come down. And I would
