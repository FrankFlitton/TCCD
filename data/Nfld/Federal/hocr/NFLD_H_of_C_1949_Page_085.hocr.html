               suggestion made by the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Kamloops. The Prime Minister has just told 
               <br />
               us, perhaps jocularly, that the people of New— 
               <br />
               foundland do not know just what their poli- 
               <br />

               <br />
               had an election for so long a time. I would 
               <br />
               point out to him that at the time of confedera— 
               <br />
               tion there was a great upheaval in political 
               <br />
               opinion, and some men who took an active 
               <br />
               interest in public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs</span> changed their ideas. 
               <br />
               Some went one way and some went the other. 
               <br />
               Some were in favour of confederation and 
               <br />
               some were against it. I believe it is true that, 
               <br />
               when the senators were appointed after con- 
               <br />
               federation, they were chosen both from those 
               <br />
               who opposed confederation and from those 
               <br />
               who favoured it. The government of that 
               <br />
               day took care to see that the Senate was 
               <br />
               represented by both those who favoured con— 
               <br />
               federation and those who opposed it. In 
               <br />
               Newfoundland today there are people who 
               <br />
               oppose this union and people who favour it. 
               <br />
               I think that the example followed at the 
               <br />
               time of confederation could well be followed 
               <br />
               today, and that it would have good results 
               <br />
               in the end.

               matter I had in mind. Right after confedera- 
               <br />
               tion a bill was introduced. I forget the name 
               <br />
               of the sponsor, but I have a copy of the 
               <br />
               original bill at home. There was a sugges- 
               <br />
               tion that the government of each province 
               <br />
               should appoint one half the senators from that 
               <br />
               province. The Prime Minister nods his head. 
               <br />
               He is familiar with that suggestion. The 
               <br />
               government in each province would name 
               <br />
               one half. of the senators and the federal gov- 
               <br />
               ernment would name the other half. In that 
               <br />
               way the government would avoid what is 
               <br />
               taking place now. I have forgotten how 
               <br />
               many Liberal senators and how many Conser- 
               <br />
               vative senators there are in the other place. 
               <br />
               They are so far apart in numbers that the 
               <br />
               other place has become only a government 
               <br />
               rubber stamp, with no possibility of the 
               <br />
               opposition affecting any controversial legis- 
               <br />
               lation.

               Since the government will name the sen-

               <br />
               should appoint to the Senate. I noticed that 
               <br />
               three religious denominations were men- 
               <br />
               tioned. I thought that I should mention the 
               <br />
               military forces of Newfoundland. Yesterday 
               <br />
               we heard of the splendid record of the navy, 
               <br />
               the army and the air force of Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               I remember that after the ﬁrst world war 
               <br />
               vacancies in the Senate were ﬁlled from the 
               <br />
               different armed forces. If that practice was 
               <br />
               good in those days it is good now. I suggest 
               <br />
               to the Prime Minister that in making these 
               <br />
               appointments he consider making some of 
               <br />
               them from the different armed forces. The 
               <br />
               armed forces are entitled to this consideration 
               <br />
               and Newfoundland would be a good place to 
               <br />
               start. It could then be followed out in ﬁlling 
               <br />
               the large number of vacancies that we have 
               <br />
               in Canada.

               Mr. St. Laurent: I thank hon. members for 
               <br />
               the advice that is being tendered tonight. I 
               <br />
               would not have risen even to express my 
               <br />
               thanks were it not that I ﬁnd it necessary to 
               <br />
               differ from the opinion expressed by the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Davenport. It would be a mistake 
               <br />
               to have in the other place gentlemen feeling 
               <br />
               that they had a responsibility to a govern- 
               <br />
               ment of a Canadian province. National unity 
               <br />
               in Canada demands that all those who form 
               <br />
               part of the Canadian parliament feel that 
               <br />
               their responsibility is to the Canadian people 
               <br />
               as a whole, and that they are not the repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives of any provincial government or 
               <br />
               any municipality or other local authority. 
               <br />
               On that point I feel that I have to differ from 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman. But I do recognize that 
               <br />
