               provinces of Canada, if they ultimately

               146, to bring into union all of the territories 
               <br />

               have made the enlargement of our dominion

               What is the difﬁculty with which the nego- 
               <br />
               tiators were confronted in this particular case? 
               <br />
               It is notorious what it was. The dominion 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland, as a result of circumstances 
               <br />
               entirely beyond its control, and certainly 
               <br />
               beyond Canada’s control, had got into ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               difﬁculty, and its legislative government was 
               <br />
               superseded by another perfectly legitimate 
               <br />
               and legal government, properly established 
               <br />
               in accordance with the law. By way of 
               <br />
               replying to the question of the last speaker, 
               <br />
               may I say that I do not profess to be an 
               <br />
               expert on this matter because the whole thing 
               <br />
               came freshly to my attention with the amend- 
               <br />
               ment moved by the leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               (Mr. Drew). No one will dispute, however, 
               <br />
               that in Newfoundland at the present time 
               <br />
               there is a legally constituted government with 
               <br />
               proper legal authority. But it is not a legis- 
               <br />
               lative body and therefore cannot produce 
               <br />
               the address that is necessary under section 
               <br />
               146. '
