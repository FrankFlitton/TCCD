               reference can hardly be serious. The Tories

               In his resolution the Tory leader says that 
               <br />
               nothing must be done until there is what he 
               <br />
               calls “a satisfactory conclusion” of the deal- 
               <br />
               ings, negotiations, consultations or whatever 
               <br />
               you wish to call them, with the nine prov- 
               <br />
               inces. He is careful not to say what he means 
               <br />
               by “a satisfactory conclusion”. We cannot tell 
               <br />
               whether he means that he would be willing 
               <br />
               to let Newfoundland into confederation as a 
               <br />
               new province if three-quarters of the prov- 
               <br />
               inces agreed, whether he would be satisﬁed 
               <br />
               with a two-thirds count, or whether he would 
               <br />
               be satisﬁed with a mere majority. As it 
               <br />
               stands now, he commits himself to the prin- 
               <br />
               ciple of the veto. What his resolution means 
               <br />
               is that he will not allow Newfoundland to 
               <br />
               become part of Canada unless and until some 
               <br />

               over there to stop this Tory business of 
               <br />
               endeavouring to buy their way into Quebec.

               As I speak, something reminds me of 
               <br />
               Walter Savage Landor. who has written a few 
               <br />
               volumes of very ﬁne stories under the title, 
               <br />
               “Imaginary Conversations”. They are very 
               <br />
               interesting. I would recommend that the hon. 
               <br />
               members opposite read some of them. They 
               <br />
               would ﬁnd much that would be helpful. I was 
               <br />
               playing with the idea of what Landor could 
               <br />
               do in writing another story. It could be a 
               <br />
               conversation between the premier of Ontario 
               <br />
               and the premier of Quebec. I suppose the 
               <br />
               imaginary conversation would have been 
               <br />
               something like this: “Well, now, look, Maurice, 
               <br />
               you may depend upon this. There will never 
               <br />
               be anything done of a constitutional nature 
               <br />
               without your having the last say. I can assure 
               <br />
               you of that, Maurice.” The reply would be, 
               <br />
               “Well, George, remember if you do not keep 
               <br />
               that promise I can ruin you just as quickly 
               <br />
               as I can make you.”
