               of my remarks I will endeavour to show, Mr.

               <br />

               <br />
               the province of Quebec. Mark you, sir, it must 
               <br />
               be noted that the privy council did not render 
               <br />
               a judgment, a judicial decision; it was no more 
               <br />
               than a report on a reference which, as I will 
               <br />
               show later on, was badly drafted, incomplete, 
               <br />
               not properly presented, and proper action on it
