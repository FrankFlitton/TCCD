               Mr. Jean-François Pouliof (Témiscouafa): 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, I am open—minded about this 
               <br />
               question of Newfoundland, but I was sur- 
               <br />
               prised at some of the arguments used by the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition (Mr. Drew). He 
               <br />
               referred to Newfoundland as being a domin- 
               <br />
               ion, but he knows that the British government 
               <br />
               appointed the Amulree commission whose 
               <br />
               recommendations were approved, ﬁrst by the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland government and afterward by 
               <br />
               the British government who put them into 
               <br />
               force. One of the recommendations of that 
               <br />
               commission was that the legislative and 
               <br />
               executive authority be vested in the governor, 
               <br />
               who was to be advised by a commission of six 
               <br />
               members appointed by the British govem- 
               <br />
               ment. One of those commissioners, Mr. 
               <br />
               Walsh I believe, was here. Newfoundland is 
               <br />
               no longer a dominion, as the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition knows very well.

               We have had some ﬁne dissertations about 
               <br />
               the fathers of confederation. They were great 
               <br />
               men, they were statesmen, but they are all 
               <br />
               dead. I am more interested in the living than 
               <br />
               in the dead, although I have great respect for 
               <br />
               the dead. As I say, I was openminded about 
               <br />
               Newfoundland until a few days ago when I

               too much publicity could be given to this. It

               Viscount Jowitt, Lord Chancellor of Great Britain. 
               <br />
               stated that the decision of Canada to incorporate 
               <br />
               Newfoundland was far from being stingy.

               It is certain that union for a great many years to 
               <br />
               come will be a heavy burden upon the Canadian 
               <br />
               people, he stated in answer to the Tory Lord 
               <br />
               Semphill. He said that that was one reason why 
               <br />
               several people from Newfoundland were under the 
               <br />
               impression that they were being sold to Canada by 
               <br />
               the British government.

               Lord Jowitt was kind enough to inform 
               <br />
               Canada of the burden that would have to be 
               <br />
               carried on our shoulders. If the leader of 
               <br />
               the British government in the House of Lords, 
               <br />
               the Lord Chancellor, says that this deal will 
               <br />
               be a heavy burden for Canada, then I may 
               <br />
               not be for it. I will leave aside all hair- 
               <br />
               splitting about section 146 of the British

               North America Act and section 6 of the 
               <br />
               Statute of Westminster. I have already said 
               <br />
               and written that the Statute of Westminster 
               <br />
               is just bunk and changes nothing in the

               British North America Act. Who ever heard
