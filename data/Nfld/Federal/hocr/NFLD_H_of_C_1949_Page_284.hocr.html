               It was all of a century and a quarter ago 
               <br />
               that one and more of the leading public men 
               <br />
               in this country began to advocate what was 
               <br />
               then referred to as a union of all the British— 
               <br />

               <br />
               has been all but brought about at this time. 
               <br />
               Not only has that result been achieved, but 
               <br />
               today we have all but succeeded in bringing

               I should like particularly this afternoon to 
               <br />
               speak as a Canadian, as a representative of 
               <br />
               the people of Canada in this House of Com-

               here not merely as representatives of indi-

               vidual constituencies, but as representatives 
               <br />
               of the people of Canada as a whole. In 
               <br />
               speaking as one of such, I should like above 
               <br />
               all to say how warmly and sincerely all 
               <br />
               Canada, as at present constituted, will wel- 
               <br />
               come the entrance into confederation of the 
               <br />
               island province of Newfoundland and how 
               <br />
               delighted we are at the welcome which we 
               <br />
               know awaits Newfoundland when, as the 
               <br />
               tenth province of Canada, she is greeted by 
               <br />
               her nine sister provinces.

               It must be a source of deepest satisfaction 
               <br />
               to the people of Newfoundland who followed 
               <br />
               the debate on the terms of union, as it is to 
               <br />
               the people of Canada, to realize that with 
               <br />
               respect to each of the essential successive 
               <br />
               steps in this historic transaction, there has 
               <br />
               been, with the exception of a single dissenting 
               <br />
               voice, unanimous approval by the members 
               <br />
               of Canada’s House of Commons. The one 
               <br />
               dissenting voice has only helped to emphasize 
               <br />
               the completeness of our unanimity. Nothing 
               <br />
               could more eloquently express the warmth of 
               <br />
               the welcome which this House of Commons 
               <br />
               extends to the people of Newfoundland on 
               <br />
               becoming a part of Canada. Nothing could 
               <br />
               more eloquently have expressed the feeling 
               <br />
               of the people of Canada, as disclosed by their

               I have desired to say only these few words,

               Mr. Speaker. I have felt that in the minds of 
               <br />
               some, the discussion of the last day of two on 
               <br />
               a matter of procedure may have served to 
               <br />
               dim the brightness of the achievement itself, 
               <br />
               the great objective which was reached so 
               <br />
               splendidly in the course of the debate on the 
               <br />

               There can be no doubt that the union of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland with Canada will be to the 
               <br />
               mutual advantage of the peoples of both 
               <br />
               countries. It will, however, mean more than 
               <br />
               mere mutual advantage. The talent, the 
               <br />
               enterprise, the resources which each will con- 
               <br />
               tribute to the other will help to strengthen 
               <br />
               both. What is more, at a time such as the 
               <br />
               present, it will help to give each of us a 
               <br />
               greater conﬁdence as we face the uncertain-

               be overcome; there will be obstacles to be 
               <br />
               surmounted; there will be rough places to be 
               <br />
               made smooth once the union has taken place. 
               <br />
               Readjustments are always difﬁcult but these 
               <br />
               are domestic matters which will be as success-

               fully met as similar problems in the past have 
               <br />
               been met. What, I believe, is most important 
               <br />
               of all, is the fact that this union, when it 
               <br />
               comes into being, will be of great mutual 
               <br />
               advantage not only to Newfoundland and to 
               <br />
               Canada, but to all countries which, directly 
               <br />
               or indirectly, are concerned with the main- 
               <br />
               tenance of peace. It will mean more effective 
               <br />
               co-operation between free nations at this time 
               <br />
               of great uncertainty in world movements and 
               <br />
               affairs. It means much to have the most 
               <br />
               effective co-operation between all of those 
               <br />
               nations that cherish kindred ideas and ideals 
               <br />
