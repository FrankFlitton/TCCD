               Mr. LaCroix: Mr. Speaker, I cannot share, 
               <br />
               either, the view expounded by the leader of 
               <br />
               the C.C.F. (Mr. Caldwell) who holds that 
               <br />
               whenever a national issue is involved we are 
               <br />
               entitled to change the constitution without 
               <br />
               consulting the provinces.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The adoption of this view would lead us 
               <br />
               very far indeed. There is no telling what we 
               <br />
               would see if the C.C.F. party, to our great 
               <br />
               misfortune, ever came to power. This would 
               <br />
               be true especially of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">minority</span> like ours 
               <br />
               which seeks to conserve its French and 
               <br />
               Catholic traditions, on the banks of the great 
               <br />
               and beautiful river which bears the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister’s name, and which considers itself, 
               <br />
               and rightly so, as the last outpost of French 
               <br />
               thought and culture on the North American 
               <br />
               continent.

               I do not share the opinion of those who 
               <br />
               claim that the province of Quebec need not 
               <br />
               be consulted with regard to the annexation 
               <br />

               The province of Quebec has too many 
               <br />
               interests in this respect to allow itself to be 
               <br />
               totally neglected. What about the borders 
               <br />
               between Labrador and Quebec, which are not 
               <br />
               yet clearly deﬁned? That is a question of 
               <br />
               vital interest to my province, because of the 
               <br />
               great natural resources which lie in that part 
               <br />
               of the country.

               We must also consider the fact that Great 
               <br />
               Britain deprived Quebec, by means of an 
               <br />
               award by the privy council, of all that part 
               <br />
               of my province which is called Labrador, 
               <br />
               which I still consider part of the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec, but this was done by England in 
               <br />
               order to confer an asset upon Newfoundland 
               <br />
               in anticipation of her future negotiations

               concerning union with Canada.
