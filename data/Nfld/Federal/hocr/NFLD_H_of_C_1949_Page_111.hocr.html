               Such evidence as is available would indicate that 
               <br />
               the Newfoundland railway system is badly run down 
               <br />
               and would require the expenditure of substantial

               up to Canadian levels and to bring passenger 
               <br />
               and freight rates down to Canadian levels? 
               <br />

               be expected? What about the capital debt of
