               he raised the other day I can say this. After

               the Canadian Citizenship Act came into force 
               <br />
               on January 1, 1947, a new form of Canadian 
               <br />
               passport was issued. Subsequently it was 
               <br />
               found that certain inconveniences arose in 
               <br />
               renewing old passports which had been issued 
               <br />
               before January 1, 1947, because the national 
               <br />
               status of Canadians was not accurately 
               <br />
               described therein. Persons holding such pass- 
               <br />
               ports are being asked, when they apply for 
               <br />
               renewals, to replace them with new passports. 
               <br />

               to direct a question to the Minister of Mines 
               <br />

               <br />
               send notice to him only at a late hour. Is 
               <br />
               consideration being given to liberalizing 
               <br />
               existing immigration regulations to permit

               Hon. J. A. MacKinnon (Minister of Mines 
               <br />
               and Resources): I received a copy of the 
               <br />
               question just before coming into the cham- 
               <br />
               ber. I think it is generally understood how 
               <br />
               difﬁcult it is to act effectively, especially with 
               <br />
               regard to two of the classes which come 
               <br />
               Within the category mentioned by the hon. 
               <br />
               member—dentists and doctors. Those pro- 
               <br />
               fessions largely control the naming of those 
               <br />
               who will be eligible to practise in Canada. 
               <br />
               A few such immigrants have been allowed 
               <br />
               to come to Canada as labourers, or, in other 
               <br />
               cases, as assistants to medical men. I may 
               <br />
               say, however, that the matter is being given 
               <br />
               serious consideration.
