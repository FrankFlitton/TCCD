               <br />
               or three days ago, I read an article by 
               <br />
               Mr. Sauriol in which he said he accepted 
               <br />
               the entry of Newfoundland into confedera-

               Mr. Speaker, I had not intended to speak 
               <br />
               at length. I believe I have shown that all 
               <br />
               these points raised at the last moment are not 
               <br />
               designed to establish whether Newfoundland 
               <br />
               should be admitted into confederation, in 
               <br />
               accordance with section 146 of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act, whether we are seeking 
               <br />
               an amendment to the constitution, or whether 
               <br />
               we are violating certain parts of the act, but 
               <br />
               solely to establish, as I previously pointed out, 
               <br />
               whether we should carry on that game of 
               <br />
               political football begun quite some time ago.

               As far as I am concerned, I feel we should 
               <br />
               stick to the point. It is unfortunate that all 
               <br />
               these questions raised in the house become 
               <br />
               strictly constitutional matters.
