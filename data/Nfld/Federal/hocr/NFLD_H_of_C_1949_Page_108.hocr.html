               We assumed that they were probably held

               Prime Minister referred to the wording where 
               <br />
               it says, “Stock issued or to be issued”. As I 
               <br />

               can be issued, but only to replace existing 
               <br />
               stock. That gives rise to this question. Does 
               <br />
               that mean merely to replace stock that is lost, 
               <br />

               In trying to arrive at the net result, it would 
               <br />
               appear that on the basis of the 1947 offer the 
               <br />
               net result to the treasury would be a deﬁcit 
               <br />
               of roughly $7 million as between federal 
               <br />
               revenue and probable expenditures, plus 
               <br />
               three and a half million dollars of transitional 
               <br />
               grants in each of the ﬁrst three years of 
               <br />
               union, plus the other three of the four items 
               <br />
               referred to on page 71. But those are not 
               <br />
               the terms that are before the house today. 
               <br />
               The terms were revised in 1948, and the 
               <br />
               result has been to increase very substantially 
               <br />
               the amounts of the transitional grants that 
               <br />
               are offered by Canada to Newfoundland. It 
               <br />
               is proposed to increase the grants substan- 
               <br />
               tially during the ﬁrst eight of the twelve 
               <br />
               years during which transitional grants are 
               <br />
               payable. By doing some arithmetic one ﬁnds 
               <br />
               that the total of transitional grants contem- 
               <br />
               plated in the 1947 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offer</span> was $26,250,000, 
               <br />
               whereas the-transitional grants that are con- 
               <br />
               templated by article 28 of the terms of union 
               <br />
               total $42,750,000. I assume that the amount
