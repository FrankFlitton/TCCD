               now that a referendum is to be taken on two

               <br />
               with Canada it decides against responsible

               In his opening address this session, the

               <br />
               shown by the action of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Gottwald</span> regarding 
               <br />
               Czechoslovakia in the deposing of the late 
               <br />
               president. It shocked the whole human world, 
               <br />
               and shows us the grave danger we are in. What 
               <br />
               is this famous UNO in which the minister has 
               <br />
               confidence? We used to have an empire <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parlio—</span> 
               <br />
               mentary association. They safeguarded our 
               <br />
               interests so far as foreign affairs were con- 
               <br />
               cerned. They forgot all about the empire and 
               <br />
               became pan—American. We are not a ﬁrst-class 
               <br />
               power. We have had two wars to teach us 
               <br />
               that lesson. You have had this second UNO 
               <br />
               league of nations. We had the ﬁrst league of 
               <br />
               nations on which this country expended nearly 
               <br />
               $5,000,000 in sending deputations over to 
               <br />
               Geneva. They built buildings costing fabulous 
               <br />
               sums of money, millions of dollars in Switzer- 
               <br />
               land and Geneva, and, after that was done, it 
               <br />
               was found that it was a hollow mockery, a 
               <br />
               sham and a humbug, and drove us into a
