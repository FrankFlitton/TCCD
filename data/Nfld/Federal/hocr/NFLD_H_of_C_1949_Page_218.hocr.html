               The amendment has been proposed by the 
               <br />
               leader of the ofﬁcial opposition (Mr. Drew), 
               <br />
               who leads the Conservative party in this 
               <br />
               country. The hon. member for Lethbridge 
               <br />
               (Mr. Blackmore) has mentioned already that 
               <br />
               it is not a matter of voting with the Conserva- 
               <br />
               tives or with some other party. That might 
               <br />
               be what is in the minds of hard and fast 
               <br />
               machine politicians, but the issue is whether 
               <br />
               we are to vote for something that is right or 
               <br />
               something that is wrong. If our Conservative 
               <br />
               friends propose something we believe is right, 
               <br />
               we will vote for it. If on the other hand they 
               <br />
               propose something that is wrong, then we will 
               <br />
               most vehemently oppose it and vote against 
               <br />
               it. I know that in the past when we have 
               <br />
               voted for that which we have believed to be 
               <br />
               right and our Conservative friends have been 
               <br />
               like-minded, it has left the impression 
               <br />
               throughout the country, and certain sections 
               <br />
               of the press have tried to make it appear, that 
               <br />
               in their philosophy and beliefs the Social 
               <br />
               Crediters in reality are Conservatives poli- 
               <br />
               tically. Well, Mr. Speaker, nothing could be 
               <br />
               further from the truth. As far as political 
               <br />
               parties are concerned, we desire to travel a 
               <br />
               road which is consistent with the fundamental 
               <br />
               beliefs embodied in our social credit position.

               May I say this, that our C.C.F. friends, my

               friend the member for Calgary West (Mr.

               <br />

               <br />
               the C.C.F. to support it. I am not saying 
               <br />
               that in criticism of them. In fact, I think it 
               <br />
               is a commendation because, on this measure, 
               <br />
               they will run true to form and support it.

               <br />
               wording of this amendment. The wording

               of this amendment does not ask that the 
               <br />

               <br />

               noon the Minister of National Defence (Mr.
