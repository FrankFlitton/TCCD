               The situation in the Atlantic today is 
               <br />
               dangerous. The British government, Canada 
               <br />
               consenting, gave up all its bases from New- 
               <br />
               foundland to British Guiana to the United 
               <br />
               States for ninety—nine years. I pointed out at 
               <br />
               the time what the result of that would be. I 
               <br />
               pointed out the eﬂect it would have upon 
               <br />
               Newfoundland’s joining confederation, and my 
               <br />
               predictions have been justiﬁed. What was that 
               <br />
               lease for? It was a 99-year lease, practically a 
               <br />
               freehold lease, entered into for a consideration 
               <br />
               that proved of very little practical value. The 
               <br />
               lease should have been cancelled long ago and 
               <br />
               charged up to lend-lease. It was entered into 
               <br />
               in the darkest days of the battle of the 
               <br />
               Atlantic, and in return for that lease Britain 
               <br />
               was given some ﬁfty old, out-of-date ships. 
               <br />
               Many of them had to go into dry dock, being 
               <br />
               of no use. Others had no coal. Then Pearl 
               <br />
               Harbor broke and we got a lesson, and 
               <br />
               Canada was nearly invaded.

               I have been talking about a foreign policy. 
               <br />
               The United States has never had a foreign 
               <br />
               policy any more than we have had. For 100 
               <br />
               years it has been without such a policy. Its 
               <br />
               foreign policy was that of Andrew Jackson, 
               <br />
               George Washington and Madison. And what 
               <br />
               was the essence of that policy? Simply this: 
               <br />
               no foreign entanglement unless the shores of 
               <br />
               America are invaded. When the United 
               <br />
               States fought the Spanish-American war in 
               <br />
               1898 that was the ground they took. After- 
               <br />
               wards they wanted to abandon Manila. Our 
               <br />
               foreign policy now is to depend upon the 
               <br />
               league of nations at UNO and that we have no 
               <br />
               commitments; we simply yet take the attitude 
               <br />
               that “Parliament will decide” if war comes. 
               <br />
               That attitude, as I have pointed out before, 
               <br />
               has led to the scuttling of the British empire 
               <br />
               during the past two years. Britain, together 
               <br />
               with the dominions, stood‘ alone for two and a 
               <br />
               half, nearly three years, from 1939 to 1942, 
               <br />
               against the mighty forces of the enemy, and if 
               <br />
               the war was to have been lost, then surely it 
               <br />
               would have been lost in those three years, 
               <br />
               before aid came. But Britain weathered the 
               <br />
               storm. If Britain and the dominions do not 
               <br />
               hang together there is little hope for peace 
               <br />
               so far as the British empire is concerned.

               But not only have bases been given up in 
               <br />
               the Atlantic; we have given up bases in our 
               <br />
               own country, Canada, to the United States. 
               <br />
               Why, I do not know. Surely the United States 
               <br />
               lave enough to do to look after their own

               <br />
               because we are living in an armed world in 
               <br />
               which there has been no peace and. in which 
               <br />
               there is no real peace now. This will prove to

               <br />
               over, from 1914 to 1954. Let us not talk about 
               <br />
               peace when there is no peace. Look at the 
               <br />
               situation in India where millions of people 
               <br />
               are left to be massacred. Look at the situa- 
               <br />
               tion in Palestine. Look at the Suez. And we 
               <br />
               know what the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consequences</span> were from the 
               <br />
               invasion of Czechoslovakia. Thousands of men 
               <br />
               in the Russian satellite countries in the Bal- 
               <br />
               kans and eastern Europe are being put to work 
               <br />
               on dry docks and more are sent to the Arctic 
               <br />
               circle as slaves from Russia’s satellite states. 
               <br />
               It is impossible to ﬁnd out from the united 
               <br />
               nations organization how many people are so 
               <br />
               treated. No one can ﬁnd out anything about 
               <br />
               them, so what use is the UNO? Roumania is 
               <br />
               gone; the Balkans are gone and all that kind 
               <br />
               of thing. I am far from satisﬁed with what 
               <br />
               has been done in the British corridor over in 
               <br />
               Germany. Canada has no say over there. We 
               <br />
               are just a. minor power. We consented to be 
               <br />
               a minor power at San Francisco when the Big 
               <br />
               Five insisted on and obtained the veto power 
               <br />
               and all that kind of thing. You will have 
               <br />
               nothing to say about the peace plans whereas, 
               <br />
               if you had hung together with the mother 
               <br />
               country, you would have something to say 
               <br />
               about them. The situation in South Africa is 
               <br />
               hopeless. There are those in this house—and 
               <br />
               I have never been one of them—who speak in 
               <br />
               eulogy of the late prime minister, Lieutenant 
               <br />
               General Smuts, of South Africa. He is a repub- 
               <br />
               lican. He has all along wanted to set up a 
               <br />
               republic in South Africa. He has always been 
               <br />
               against having a British governor general, and 
               <br />
               would not give the ballot to the black troops 
               <br />
               who marched across the desert with Alexander 
               <br />
               and- Montgomery. He was one of the cabinet 
               <br />
               of the pro-Germans there before world war II. 
               <br />
               He also signed the charter of the league of 
               <br />
               nations. Yet he says now the UNO have no 
               <br />
               power and no jurisdiction over the colonies. 
               <br />
               No country in the world is going to give up 
               <br />
               its control of its own affairs or sovereignty to 
               <br />
               any foreign power or any foreign body like 
               <br />
               the UNO, unless the country is so small or 
               <br />
               has such poor defences that it could be cap- 
               <br />
               tured in any event. Who is going to give up 
               <br />
               his sovereignty? Are we in Canada to do 
               <br />
               that? One of the minister’s deputies went 
               <br />
               away down to Lake Success and Washington. 
               <br />
               He has been making some speeches and he is 
               <br />
               in favour of giving up sovereignty over our 
               <br />
               bases in Canada to the UNO. Where would 
               <br />
               we have been in the ﬁrst war if Britain had 
               <br />
               given up these bases at the Cape, at Gibraltar, 
               <br />
               at Suez, or at Hong Kong to a foreign country 
               <br />
