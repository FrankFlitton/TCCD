               Mr. A. L. Smith (Calgary West): Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, I wish to ask a question of the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Trade and Commerce. In doing so I 
               <br />
               am not going to say a great deal, and I do not 
               <br />
               wish to be shouted down until I have said a 
               <br />
               word or two. Again in last evening’s news— 
               <br />
               paper there was a dispatch from Washington 
               <br />
               which said deﬁnitely that Mr. Ralph A. Trigg, 
               <br />
               president of the Commodity Credit Corpora— 
               <br />
               tion, stated in evidence before the senate com- 
               <br />
               mittee on agriculture that they were buying 
               <br />
               from Canada 120 million bushels of wheat at 
               <br />
               $2 a bushel. Having regard to his answer 
               <br />
               given yesterday as to general procedure, at 
               <br />
               which time he told us what would happen 
               <br />
               normally, I ask the minister if he will have 
               <br />
               someone make an investigation and let us 
               <br />
               know exactly what the position is. Perhaps 
               <br />
               he would do that tomorrow or Monday or 
               <br />
               Tuesday.

               Right Hon. C. D. Howe (Minister of Trade 
               <br />
               and Commerce): Mr. Speaker, no investigation 
               <br />
               is necessary. A sale of the magnitude men- 
               <br />
               tioned by my hon. friend would not escape the 
               <br />
               notice of the government. In the ﬁrst place 
               <br />
               I will tell him we have not that quantity of 
               <br />
               wheat to sell, and we have not had for a great 
               <br />
               many months. Obviously if he is referring to 
               <br />
               a price of $2 a bushel, that is the price refer- 
               <br />

               tract with the United Kingdom. That is the 
               <br />
               only wheat that is sold at $2 a bushel. The 
               <br />
               amount of the contract is 140 million bushels 
               <br />
               for the crop year 1948-49.

               <br />
               ister): I have no information other than that 
               <br />
               gathered from the newspapers. However my 
               <br />
               understanding of the situation is that an 
               <br />
               action was instituted in the courts of justice 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland, and on motion it was dis- 
               <br />
               missed as being frivolous and vexatious. An 
               <br />
               appeal was then taken to the appeal court of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, and that appeal was dismissed, 
               <br />
               the appeal court conﬁrming the opinion of the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst judge that it was frivolous and vexatious. 
               <br />
               Now the newspapers report that leave has 
               <br />
               been granted to appeal to the privy council 
               <br />
               from the decision that the proceedings were 
               <br />
               frivolous and vexatious. Even if that appeal 
               <br />
               were heard, and even if it were allowed, it 
               <br />
               would not mean anything more than that the 
               <br />
               plaintiffs in the case would have the right 
               <br />
               to proceed on the merits of their suit; it being 
               <br />
               merely a pronouncement on a question of 
               <br />
               procedure. In View of the attitude taken by 
               <br />
               the government of Newfoundland as to the 
               <br />

               for accomplishing the further proceedings 
               <br />
               required to bring it into effect, there should

               tion): Mr. Speaker, on two occasions the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of National Revenue (Mr. McCann), in 
               <br />
               response to inquiries as to the setting up of a 
               <br />
               special committee on radio broadcasting, has 
               <br />
               left the impression that a committee would be 
               <br />
               called together if the desire to have that com- 
               <br />
               mittee were made evident. I wish to leave no 
               <br />
               doubt that we are anxious to have a special 
               <br />
               committee proceed with an inquiry; therefore 
               <br />
               I wish the minister would deal with the mat- 
               <br />
               ter on the understanding that there is a 
               <br />
               request that a special committee be appointed 
               <br />
               to deal with the subject as soon as possible. 
               <br />
