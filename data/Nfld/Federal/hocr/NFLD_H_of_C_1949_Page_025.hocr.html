               did enter the confederation, but not New- 
               <br />
               foundland. In 1869 there was an election in 
               <br />
               which the proponents of confederation with 
               <br />

               was dropped and remained quiescent for a 
               <br />
               long period of years. In 1895 it was brought 
               <br />
               up again. Serious ﬁnancial difﬁculties had 
               <br />
               been facing the government of Newfound- 
               <br />
               land. One of its commercial banks was 
               <br />
               forced to suspend its payments. At that time 
               <br />
               there were negotiations with the Canadian 
               <br />
               government looking to union, but it proved 
               <br />
               to be impossible to agree upon tentative 
               <br />
               terms that the participants in the negotia- 
               <br />

               During the first war, Newfoundland, as we 
               <br />
               all know, made a magniﬁcent contribution to 
               <br />
               the cause of the allies. Concurrently with 
               <br />
               the activity resulting from this contribution 
               <br />
               to the war a certain amount of prosperity 
               <br />
               came to the island. However, the world-wide 
               <br />
               depression of the early thirties again created 
               <br />
               a serious situation for the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland, who depend so largely upon world 
               <br />
               trade for their prosperity. An investigation 
               <br />
               was made by a commission appointed, at the 
               <br />
               request of the government of Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               by the government of the United Kingdom. 
               <br />
               The commission recommended that the con- 
               <br />
               stitution of the island be suspended and that 
               <br />
               the government of the United Kingdom make 
               <br />
               itself ﬁnancially responsible for the obliga- 
               <br />
               tions of the government of Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               It was also recommended that the government 
               <br />
               be replaced by a commission of government, 
               <br />
               made up of a governor appointed by the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom and six commissioners ap- 
               <br />

               <br />
               whom were to be chosen from residents of

               the United Kingdom and three from resid- 
               <br />
               ents of the island. It was also provided that

               nothing was done about that during the
