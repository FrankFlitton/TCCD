               In 1881, when the act was passed extending

               signed with the consent of the Quebec legis-

               much further in putting aside the directions

               <br />
               Newfoundland is not worth the paper on which 
               <br />
               it is written, and I am sure that the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec will never assent to such an agree-

               council? There was none either. Then I be- 
               <br />
               lieve I am right in contending that the Whole 
               <br />
               matter still stands as it was decided by the 
               <br />
               Canadian statutes of 1898 and 1912.

               should never have been submitted to the privy
