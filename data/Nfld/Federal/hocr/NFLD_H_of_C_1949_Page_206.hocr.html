               day—when this must be done. 
               <br />

               Now, this is an agreement between the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada and certain representa- 
               <br />
               tives from Newfoundland who signed. There 
               <br />
               is no reason in the world—and this is the 
               <br />
               very antithesis of what the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Rosetown-Biggar said—why the signatories to 
               <br />
               the agreement cannot postpone that D—day, or. 
               <br />
               whatever day you wish to call it. So all this 
               <br />
               nonsense about hurrying and so on as of 
               <br />
               March 31 falls exactly where it belongs. It 
               <br />
               is based on the effort of this government to 
               <br />
               do in an illegal way what they could do 
               <br />
               legally if they chose to take a little time and 
               <br />
               give it a little more consideration.

               This point has been raised by the Minister 
               <br />
               of National Defence particularly. He said 
               <br />
               most eloquently what has been said by thous- 
               <br />
               ands of people before he had chewed his 
               <br />
               third to the last lead pencil while he was 
               <br />
               listening to my leader. He has one right 
               <br />
               there <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now..</span> He had better try the other side 
               <br />
               because the teeth on this side are beginning
