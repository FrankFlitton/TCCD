               <br />
               has in mind the next election. One place in 
               <br />
               Canada where his party is very weak is the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec, where they are very strong 
               <br />
               for provincial rights. Another place they are 
               <br />
               very weak is the province of Nova Scotia, 
               <br />
               where they have no members in the legisla- 
               <br />
               ture and very little leadership. But the 
               <br />
               premier of Nova Scotia is also very strong for 
               <br />
               provincial rights, as he indicated 'at the last 
               <br />
               dominion-provincial conference. So I may be 
               <br />
               excused for my assumption that the leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition has those two provinces in

               was interjected into that discussion. Again 
               <br />
               it was dominion-provincial rights; and unfor-

               tunately the government, instead of trying 
               <br />
               to bring the house back to the real bread and 
               <br />

               <br />
               trap and went along with the discussion of 
               <br />
               provincial rights. As a result we have had 
               <br />
               a straight academic discussion in this house 
               <br />
               that very few people outside the house can 
               <br />
               understand. I know letters I have received 
               <br />
               have been to this effect: “Why are you fel- 
               <br />
               lows wasting time up there? Prices are 
               <br />
               away up. Unemployment is increasing. 
               <br />
               There are many internal issues to which you 
               <br />
               should be devoting your time.” 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               In my opinion we settled the question of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. After a long debate we 
               <br />
               decided that the agreement was fair and 
               <br />
               reasonable, and this house voted unanimously 
               <br />
               that Newfoundland should come into con- 
               <br />
               federation. All right. Then there was the 
               <br />
               question of giving effect to the decision we 
               <br />
               had made in connection with the agreement. 
               <br />
               That meant we had to change the statutes 
               <br />
               of Canada in order to back up the decision 
               <br />
               already made unanimously, or with one 
               <br />
               exception; one hon. member down here said 
               <br />
               no. That should have been a simple process, 
               <br />
               taking very little of the time of this house, if. 
               <br />
               we meant what we said when we voted to 
               <br />
               bring Newfoundland into confederation. 
               <br />
               Instead of that, however, the very capable 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition set out to raise an 
               <br />
               issue for the next federal election that would 
               <br />
               not mean anything to the people of this 
               <br />
               country. “Keep away from our economic 
               <br />
               problems. Keep away from the problems 
               <br />
               that affect the average, everyday person in 
               <br />
               this country in connection with the things 
               <br />
               that go on his table. Let us make the issue 
               <br />
               at the next election the question of dominion- 
               <br />
               provincial relations, which does not mean any- 
               <br />
               thing to the people of this country, but which 
               <br />
               gives us a good opportunity to set up an issue 
               <br />
               with which we might be able to confuse 
               <br />
               them.”

               That is my conception of the thing as I 
               <br />
               have watched it develop. The leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition moves an amendment to the 
               <br />
               original motion, in which he says the prov- 
               <br />
               inces should be consulted. Well, what hap- 
               <br />
               pens after they are consulted? As the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Vancouver East pointed out, one 
               <br />
               province has the veto, and you are ﬁnished. 
               <br />
               What happens to the decision we made to 
               <br />
               bring Newfoundland within confederation? 
               <br />
               That is out also. The people of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               have said they want to come in, and the 
               <br />
               Canadian people want to bring them in. We 
               <br />
               know that, if we bring Newfoundland into 
               <br />
               confederation and make available to them the 
               <br />
               social services that we have in this country, 
               <br />
               we will be relieving human misery; and as 
               <br />
               far as I am concerned the legality of any 
               <br />
               action is determined by the justice of the 
               <br />
               cause. I am willing to take any step, after 
               <br />
               consulting the members of this House of 
               <br />
               Commons, to relieve human misery because 
               <br />
               I think that is a justiﬁable action.

               The amendment proposed by the leader of

               the opposition does not mean anything. It 
               <br />
               merely created the opportunity for a debate. 
               <br />
               It provided a chance to get the headlines.

               <br />
               he is not ﬁring many shots. He is careful 
               <br />
               to propose an amendment that does not mean 
               <br />
               anything after the provinces are consulted.

               amendment that means something. That sub-

               amendment says the provinces not only 
               <br />
               should be consulted but that they should give 
               <br />
               their consent. I shall be watching with great 
               <br />
               attention to see how my hon. friends vote on

               As far as I am concerned the Minister of

               National Defence (Mr. Claxton), when he 
               <br />
               took part in this debate a few days ago, stated 
               <br />
               the question very clearly and fairly. The 
               <br />
               other four or ﬁve provinces he mentioned 
               <br />
               were brought in after a discussion in this 
               <br />
               House of Commons. No plebiscite was taken; 
               <br />
               the matter was determined here. We had 
               <br />
               the same British North America Act at that 
               <br />
               time. Newfoundland has been consulted; two 
               <br />
               plebiscites were taken, after all the issues 
               <br />
               and terms were made available to the people 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland. And they decided to come 
               <br />
               in. As I said when I spoke brieﬂy on this 
               <br />
               matter a few days ago, I was amazed at the 
               <br />
               representative vote that was obtained. Those 
               <br />
               people had not cast a ballot since 1934. The 
               <br />
               great majority of them cast a ballot for the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst time in those plebiscites. They were 
               <br />
               isolated, in outports, with no radio available
