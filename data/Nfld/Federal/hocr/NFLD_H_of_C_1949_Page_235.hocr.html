               Newfoundland

               instance, I should like to reafﬁrm the fact, 
               <br />
               which I think is beyond contradiction, that 
               <br />
               if this address is accepted and passed by this 
               <br />
               parliament not one line of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act will have been changed thereby. 
               <br />
               Nor do I think it necessary to deal at great 
               <br />
               length with the loud and vehement protesta— 
               <br />
               tions, which were made last evening and 
               <br />
               this afternoon on the other side of the house, 
               <br />
               of undying devotion to principle and con- 
               <br />
               sistency. I think that was very effectively 
               <br />
               dealt with last night by hon. members on 
               <br />
               this side of the house and on the other side. 
               <br />
               It was pointed out that while some of the 
               <br />
               speakers of the ofﬁcial opposition dealt at 
               <br />
               length with the date 1925 and with the date 
               <br />
               1946, they forgot the date 1943.

               It has been said in criticism of the govern— 
               <br />
               ment that the procedure laid down in section 
               <br />
               146 of the British North America Act is not 
               <br />
               being followed on this occasion. The govern—

               <br />
               procedure, and therefore I suggest, Mr.

               Speaker, we are entitled to draw from that 
               <br />
               criticism the conclusion that those who take 
               <br />
               that view would have followed the procedure 
               <br />

               As has been pointed out before,

               apologize for repeating it, that section pro-

               It was also pointed out last evening by 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Lake Centre (Mr. Diefen- 
               <br />
               baker) that section 146 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act contemplated that Newfound- 
               <br />
               land would join the dominion only in accord- 
               <br />
               ance with the procedure set forth in that 
               <br />
               section. I am sure he is too good a lawyer—— 
               <br />
               and I am not a lawyer at all—to believe that 
               <br />
               that is the proper interpretation to give to 
               <br />
               that section, which is not mandatory, not 
               <br />
               exclusive, but merely permissive in charac- 
               <br />
               ter. By its wording, that section does not 
               <br />
               exclude other methods of bringing Newfound— 
               <br />
               land into confederation. The reason why 
               <br />
               certain other methods have to be adopted on 
               <br />

               —and this is why I feel it necessary to say 
               <br />
               a few words on this subject today—that if we

               In the country today, and I am not referring 
               <br />
               to anything that has been said in this debate. 
               <br />
               there is I suggest a tendency, a very dangerous 
               <br />
               tendency in my View, to stir up the feeling 
               <br />
               that the provinces and the dominion are 
               <br />
               somehow and in some way hostile to each 
               <br />
               other; that the people of Canada as repre—

               sented in this parliament are in some way 
               <br />
               different from the people of Canada as repre-

               sented in the provincial parliaments; that 
               <br />
               there is, for instance, some inevitable conﬂict

               between my duty and loyalty as a resident of 
               <br />
               this province and my duty and loyalty as a 
               <br />
               Canadian. I suggest that there is great danger

               like to quote some very wise words which 
               <br />
               were uttered by the leader of the opposition 
               <br />

               of Alberta or of Nova Scotia or of any other 
               <br />
               province. If any considerable section of the 
               <br />
               people of Canada object to what is being done 
               <br />
               in this parliament of Canada, on this issue of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, they have an opportunity to 
               <br />
               express that objection through their represen- 
               <br />
               tatives. The fact that there has been so little 
               <br />
               objection to the course that has been taken 
               <br />
               shows I am sure that the feeling of the coun- 
               <br />
               try is almost unanimous in this important 
               <br />
               matter.
