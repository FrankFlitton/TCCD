               Mr. St. Laurent: My understanding of the

               legislation is that as soon as they became 
               <br />
               Canadians they would not have to wait until 
               <br />
               the government of Newfoundland had passed 
               <br />
               a pension act. They would have twenty 
               <br />
               years of Canadian residence and could receive 
               <br />
               from the government of the province where 
               <br />
               they were then residing the pension provided

               Mr. Drew: In view of the fact that there 
               <br />
               have been put on the record some statements 
               <br />
               which were doubtless a matter of interest 
               <br />
               not only to hon. members but also to people 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland who are interested in this 
               <br />
               subject, I think it would be well if I clariﬁed 
               <br />
               one point in regard to the proposals in respect 
               <br />
               of old age pensions which were put forward 
               <br />
               by the dominion government in 1945 and in 
               <br />
               an amended form in the spring of 1946. I 
               <br />
               might say on behalf of the province which I 
               <br />
               then represented that I had put forward 
               <br />
               proposals in regard to old age pensions With— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out</span> a means test. But I would remind hon. 
               <br />
               'nembers that the proposals put forward by 
               <br />
               :he dominion government in regard to old 
               <br />
               age pensions were part of a combined set of 
               <br />
               proposals which were described by the then 
               <br />
               Prime Minister as an integrated whole, and 
               <br />
               that it was necessary so to regard them. 
               <br />
               These were to be paid—not only old age 
               <br />
               pensions but other provisions—with the 
               <br />
               understanding that special taxes were to be 
               <br />
               imposed to take care of these payments. Two 
               <br />
               of the special taxes which were included in 
               <br />
               the proposals of the dominion government 
               <br />
               should not be forgotten. One was a special 
               <br />
               income tax estimated at 5 per cent of all 
               <br />
               incomes without exemption over and above 
               <br />
               any other taxes now paid. The other was a 
               <br />
               poll tax estimated at that time in the case of 
               <br />
               Ontario at $12 a head on every man, woman 
               <br />

               <br />
               employed or not.

               As I have already intimated in what I said, 
               <br />
               I asked my question a moment ago for two 
               <br />
               reasons. Perhaps one of them has already 
               <br />
               been met but the other one has not. The 
               <br />
               one thing I was anxious to draw attention 
               <br />
               to was what Canadians in nine provinces 
               <br />
               have lost and what Canadians in the ten 
               <br />
               provinces will lose because of the impos- 
               <br />
               sibility of the dominion and all the provinces 
               <br />
               getting together. The other hope that I had 
               <br />
               in raising the matter was that the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister would indicate, as his predecessor 
               <br />
               did a number of times, and as the Minister 
               <br />
               of National Health and Welfare did all dur- 
               <br />
               ing the debate on old age pensions two years 
               <br />
               ago, that that basic idea of a minimum pen- 
               <br />
               sion of $30 a month at age seventy to all 
               <br />
               Canadians without a means test was still 
               <br />
               part of the government’s aim and policy. The 
               <br />
               Minister of National Health and Welfare told 
               <br />
               us so a good many times when he referred to 
               <br />
               these proposals, and he said that still con- 
               <br />
               stituted the basic plan. I am disappointed 
               <br />
               tonight that the Prime Minister did not take 
               <br />
               the opportunity to say that so far as the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment which he heads is concerned that is 
               <br />
               still the aim.

               Mr. St. Laurent: The position of this party 
               <br />
               on this question has always been well known 
               <br />
               to the country. It has involved a pension of 
               <br />
               $30 a month without a means test but on a 
               <br />
               contributory basis. In order to have a con— 
               <br />
               tributory basis it is necessary that there be 
               <br />
               an understanding with all the provinces to 
               <br />
               enable the raising of the contribution by a
