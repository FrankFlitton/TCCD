               we Quebec Canadians and Canadian citizens 
               <br />
               had let Newfoundland join the United States. 
               <br />
               Those same nationalists would then have 
               <br />
               cried shame. They would have described in

               terms which I would not dare utter in this 
               <br />

               <br />
               language to which they resort—as a cowardly 
               <br />
               dereliction of duty the stand which they 
               <br />
               charge us with having failed to take.

               In my opinion, Newfoundland will be not 
               <br />
               only a physical but a moral asset to this 
               <br />
               country. During my six years in the Royal 
               <br />
               Canadian Navy, it was my privilege to be 
               <br />
               associated during rather difﬁcult times with 
               <br />
               companions from Newfoundland, so that I 
               <br />
               was then able to appreciate their patriotism 
               <br />
               and high moral qualities. That is why I say 
               <br />
               with the utmost assurance that Newfound- 
               <br />
               land’s entry into confederation will be for 
               <br />
               my country, for Canada, a moral asset that 
               <br />
               will further promote Canada’s development 
               <br />
               and progress. Then the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Beauharnois—Laprairie expressed great appre- 
               <br />
               hension. If I understand him correctly, he 
               <br />
               said it might be a threat to our French min- 
               <br />
               ority to bring into our confederation the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland who do not share 
               <br />
               our traditions or way of life. In this respect, 
               <br />
               I should like to inform the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Beauharnois-Laprairie, if he does not already 
               <br />
               know it, that 31 per cent of Newfoundland’s 
               <br />
               population are Roman Catholics; in other 
               <br />
               words, that 31 per cent of Newfoundlanders 
               <br />
               share the faith of our ancestors in Quebec. 
               <br />
               In that regard, I have no fear whatsoever 
               <br />
               because, as I said a while ago, since I had 
               <br />
               the privilege of associating with people from 
               <br />
               Newfoundland while serving during the war, 
               <br />
               I was in a position to appreciate the sterling 
               <br />
               qualities of these good folk. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Moreover, Newfoundland’s population is 
               <br />
               made up largely of ﬁshermen, worthy citizens 
               <br />
               whose trade is the same as that of the major- 
               <br />
               ity of my constituents, people whose work 
               <br />
               ever pits them against the elements, who toil 
               <br />
               and struggle for a livelihood and are used to 
               <br />
               facing issues squarely and judging on their 
               <br />
               merits. They have no time to waste on party 
               <br />
               matters of a purely local character, or on 
               <br />
               jingoism. Mr. Speaker, the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber also mentioned in his speech, if I under- 
               <br />
               stood him correctly, that the federal govern- 
               <br />
               ment was seeking to amend the Canadian 
               <br />
               constitution without consulting the provinces. 
               <br />
               He made this remark in such a general way 
               <br />
               that I believe it is my duty to take up this 
               <br />
               statement. No doubt he has forgotten that in

               a memorable radio address given some ten

               days ago, our leader, the right hon. Prime 
               <br />
               Minister (Mr. St. Laurent), referring to 
               <br />
               the possible effects of the abolition of appeals 
               <br />
               to the privy council, stated that consideration 
               <br />
               should be given to the means of amending 
               <br />
               our constitution. But on the very next day, 
               <br />
               here in the house, he hastened to add, in 
               <br />
               reply to a question by the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition (Mr. Drew), that such an amend- 
               <br />
               ment to the constitution should not be car- 
               <br />
               ried out without the consent of the provinces. 
               <br />
               Therefore, the hon. member’s remarks 
               <br />
               were not fully accurate and, no matter how 
               <br />
               he qualiﬁed them, do not concern solely, I am

               Mr. Speaker, ever since the opening of this 
               <br />
               session, we have heard a whole medley of 
               <br />
               contradictory statements. In the ﬁrst place 
               <br />
               the attitude of the leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               (Mr. Drew) has been most thoroughly incon- 
               <br />
               sistent. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               As I was saying before, I was at ﬁrst 
               <br />
               unwilling to take part in this debate. This 
               <br />
               was because I believed that the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition was sincere in objecting, on the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst day of this session, to any delay in debat- 
               <br />
               ing the speech from the throne. I was there- 
               <br />
               fore unwilling to delay further that particular 
               <br />
               debate by taking part myself in this one. 
               <br />
               However we have seen how, subsequently, the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition turned about com- 
               <br />
               pletely and, through a series of amendments, 
               <br />
               himself contributed to delay further the 
               <br />
               adoption of the address in reply to the speech 
               <br />
               from the throne. As a matter of fact, by 
               <br />
               moving the amendment to the resolution 
               <br />
               which is now before this house, he maintains 
               <br />
               the totally inconsistent attitude which he has 
               <br />
               taken since the beginning of the session. Was 
               <br />
               he not serious when he opposed a resolution 
               <br />
               put forward by the prime minister, which 
               <br />
               called for the adjournment of the debate on 
               <br />
               the address in reply to the speech from the 
               <br />

               The leader of the opposition has completely
