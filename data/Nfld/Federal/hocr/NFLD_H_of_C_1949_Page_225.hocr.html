               Considering that the province of Quebec is 
               <br />
               a minority in this country, that our rights, 
               <br />
               more particularly those mentioned in section 
               <br />
               133 of the British North America Act, are 
               <br />
               at the mercy of a majority in the house, 
               <br />
               according to the View expressed by the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister, which View is apparently shared by 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice (Mr. Garson) but not 
               <br />
               by myself, there is cause for concern over 
               <br />
               the protection of our rights, with the arrival 
               <br />
               of seven new members who will be sub- 
               <br />
               servient to their views rather than to the 
               <br />
               national interest. Furthermore, they are 
               <br />
               being allowed six senators, while Quebec, 
               <br />
               with a population at least ten times greater, 
               <br />
               will only have twenty—four; in proportion 
               <br />
               to her population, our province should have 
               <br />
               sixty. The newcomers are in an inﬁnitely 
               <br />
               better position than the fathers of confedera- 
               <br />
               tion. And thus, to a certain extent, we would 
               <br />
               leave in their hands the fate of our rights, 
               <br />
               guaranteed though they be by the pact of 
               <br />
               1867. A small guarantee it is if we recall 
               <br />
               how the majority in the Manitoba provincial

               In cases where, before the coming into force of

               such Catholic school districts shall, upon the coming

               This not only gives us food for thought but

               shows how important it is for the people of

               unfortunate it is that the Canadian represen-

               tatives mainly concerned with negotiating the 
               <br />
               terms of union should have been, at the same

               time, members of the privy council of Great

               Britain. No one can serve two masters.

               Canada.
