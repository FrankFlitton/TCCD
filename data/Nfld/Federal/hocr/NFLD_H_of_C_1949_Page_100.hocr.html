               <br />
               resourcefulness they have built up a long and 
               <br />
               honourable tradition of life on the sea. From 
               <br />
               generation to generation they have faced with—

               out question the challenge and the hazards 
               <br />
               of the sea; they have gone out in very small 
               <br />
               boats and battled the elements; they plied

               <br />
               they have had to overcome—and have over-

               markets of the world. They have succeeded, 
               <br />

               At least as early as the sixteenth century annual 
               <br />
               ﬁshing voyages began from western Europe, the

               ultimately induced permanent settlement in New-

               foundland. and determined its distribution about the 
               <br />
               coasts. The annual ﬁshing voyages ceased with the 
               <br />
               Napoleonic wars, and the English ﬁshing industry 
               <br />
               became resident on the island. The local economy

               about St. John’s. which early became the commercial

               capital. The whole business life of the island devel- 
               <br />
               oped around the ﬁshery. Retail merchants branched 
               <br />
               out to become wholesalers as well as retailers, im-

               turers. Although conditions have changed greatly

               centred primarily around the dried-codﬁsh

               foundlanders means “cod”. Recently there
