               Mr. Fleming: I appreciate the point the

               <br />

               I inquired how soon after the entry of 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island, British Columbia, 
               <br />
               Manitoba and the setting-up of Alberta and 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan appointments had been made 
               <br />
               to the Senate. To my surprise I was informed 
               <br />
               it was about ﬁve months. I am not sure 
               <br />
               whether there was one earlier than that, but 
               <br />
               I believe the earliest were made around the 
               <br />
               ﬁve-month period, and in some cases it was 
               <br />
               much longer than ﬁve months. I was sur- 
               <br />
               prised to ﬁnd that so long a time had been 
               <br />
               found necessary to deal with these vacancies. 
               <br />
               This point was discussed with those from 
               <br />
               whom we were seeking to be enlightened 
               <br />
               about the situation in Newfoundland. We 
               <br />
               were told it would be unwise to proceed 
               <br />
               otherwise than by threes, if we could not 
               <br />
               make six appointments. If we made the six 
               <br />
               appointments, it would be all right provided 
               <br />
               they were distributed according to religious 
               <br />
               denominations, as I have described. But if 
               <br />
               we did not do that we should make at least 
               <br />
               three appointments at a time, because it 
               <br />
               would be unsatisfactory if any one of these 
               <br />
               three groups was preferred to the other two. 
               <br />
               We were told we should be careful to avoid 
               <br />
               offending the susceptibilities of these three 
               <br />
