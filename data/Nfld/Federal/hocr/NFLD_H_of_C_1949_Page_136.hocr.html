               Mr. St. Laurent: Well, Mr. Chairman, I do 
               <br />
               not know that I should or could give an 
               <br />
               opinion as to what effect the terms of union 
               <br />
               might have on the exercise by this company 
               <br />
               of the powers it obtained by its charter. It 
               <br />
               would seem to me that they would have no 
               <br />
               effect. This company was incorporated as a 
               <br />
               railway company, and by Virtue of that incor- 
               <br />
               poration acquired the rights and privileges 
               <br />
               expressed in the charter, and also the right 
               <br />
               to exercise the powers granted to a railway 
               <br />
               company by the Railway Act within the 
               <br />
               territory that was then Canada. It may be 
               <br />
               that the company, if it wished to be governed 
               <br />
               by the provisions of the Railway Act for the 
               <br />
               whole of its operation, that is to say the por- 
               <br />
               tion in the former territory of Canada and the 
               <br />
               portion which might extend into Newfound— 
               <br />
               land, would have to get an amendment to its 
               <br />
               charter. There the law speaks all the time; 
               <br />
               but the powers under the Railway Act which 
               <br />
               were exercisable were powers only over lands 
               <br />
               in Canada; and whether the addition to the 
               <br />
               territory of Canada would extend the opera- 
               <br />
               tion of the Railway Act to the new territory 
               <br />
               is a question about which there might be 
               <br />
               some serious argument.

               There was no intent in parliament at that

               Mr. Knowles: Since this does seem to be 
               <br />
               a matter of opinion I shall not prolong the 
               <br />

               <br />
               act we passed in 1947 we gave that company 
               <br />

               these terms of union Newfoundland is part

               <br />

               <br />
               capacity of a railway company. Then it was 
               <br />
               given the right to operate a railway line in 
               <br />

               from the Newfoundland government, I am
