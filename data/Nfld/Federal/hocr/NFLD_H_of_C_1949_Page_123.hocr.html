               When the committee rose yesterday after- 
               <br />
               noon I had promised the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Rosedale (Mr. Jackman) that I would get and 
               <br />
               give to the committee information respecting 
               <br />
               estimates of federal revenues and expendi- 
               <br />
               tures in Newfoundland. I am prepared to 
               <br />
               give those estimates now.

               First, may I say that it is with some hesi- 
               <br />
               tation that I put these ﬁgures on the record, 
               <br />
               because, unless one understands the basis 
               <br />
               upon which they are prepared, they may be 
               <br />
               misinterpreted and misunderstood. It is 
               <br />
               eXtremely difﬁcult, in fact almost impossible, 
               <br />
               to make an accurate calculation of revenues 
               <br />
               derived from a particular province. It is 
               <br />
               difficult enough, as I have reason to know, to 
               <br />
               make an accurate calculation of future 
               <br />
               revenues from the whole of the country. But 
               <br />
               to determine, for example, the matter of 
               <br />
               customs duties derived from a particular 
               <br />
               province is almost impossible. In that respect, 
               <br />
               at best it can only be an informed guess. 
               <br />

               In the case of Newfoundland it was par- 
               <br />
               ticularly difﬁcult to make an accurate fore- 
               <br />
               cast, because substantial changes will occur 
               <br />
               in the economy of the province at the time 
               <br />
               of union. The whole course of trade may be 
               <br />
               altered to some extent through the elimina- 
               <br />
               tion of tariff barriers between Canada and 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. In addition, the Newfound- 
               <br />
               land statistics are not as well developed as 
               <br />
               statistics here in Canada. However, when the 
               <br />
               delegates from the national convention were 
               <br />
               in Ottawa in 1947, we did endeavour to make 
               <br />
               a rough estimate of the probable additions to 
               <br />
               Canadian revenue as a result of the union. 
               <br />
               Those are the ﬁgures which appear in the 
               <br />
               white paper of October 29, 1947. At that 
               <br />
               time our knowledge of the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               economy was somewhat less complete than 
               <br />
               it is today, and some of the estimates were 
               <br />
               based on faulty assumptions. 
               <br />

               The most important reason for making 
               <br />
               alterations in the ﬁgures, however, is not the 
               <br />
               improvement in the sources of information, 
               <br />
               but the continued rise in the national income 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland, which was not foreseen in 
               <br />
               1947. As hon. members will recall, our own 
               <br />
               budget estimate of revenues for that year was 
               <br />
               on the low side, and for exactly the same 
               <br />
               reason. As was indicated the other day, when 
               <br />
               the Newfoundland delegation were in 
               <br />
               Ottawa last summer they submitted revised

               estimates of what they considered would be 
               <br />
               the additions to our Canadian revenue. Offi-

               estimates, and they are inclined to think that

               they are probably much closer to the truth

               <br />
               This is partly due to the fact that the New—

               foundlanders themselves have a closer

               had estimated and have risen still higher. I

               If any of the revised ﬁgures for revenue 
               <br />
               were to be criticized I would be inclined to 
               <br />
               think that the personal income tax ﬁgure is 
               <br />
               on the high side. But as I have said, these 
               <br />
               can at best be but guesses and subject to 
               <br />
               errors which might well run into several mil- 
               <br />
               lion dollars. Moreover, they are based on 
               <br />
               present rates of taxes and are therefore valid 
               <br />
               just as long as the present rates are in effect. 
               <br />
               That'is another reason why I hesitate to put 
               <br />
               them forward as indicating permanent sources 
               <br />
               of revenue over the long pull.

               Then with regard to expenditures, ﬁrst of 
               <br />
               all I would draw the attention of the com- 
               <br />
               mittee to the fact that the ﬁgures to which 
               <br />
               some hon. members have referred and which 
               <br />
               were given to the delegation from the 
               <br />
               national convention were based on estimates 
               <br />
               of the cost of extending federal services to 
               <br />
               Newfoundland in a typical year rather than 
               <br />
               in a particular year. If hon. members will 
               <br />
               examine the table in the white paper that 
               <br />
               follows they will see that that point is brought 
               <br />
               out very clearly. Therefore, none of the 
               <br />
               temporary or unusual expenditures that 
               <br />
               might be expected at the time of union could
