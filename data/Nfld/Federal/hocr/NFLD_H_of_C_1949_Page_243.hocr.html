               <br />
               in the present debate, but following the 
               <br />

               (Mr. Hackett) I feel compelled to reply. 
               <br />
               He asked us what we would tell our con-

               stituentsin the province of Quebec when

               garding the annexation of Newfoundland. Here 
               <br />
               is what I intend to say to them: First, that a 
               <br />
               bill regarding Newfoundland was submitted

               the hon. members opposite did not deem it 
               <br />
               advisable to oppose it in the ﬁrst place. How- 
               <br />
               ever, having suddenly discovered that it 
               <br />
               entailed a constitutional matter about which 
               <br />
               they should protest vehemently, the debate 
               <br />
               having ended, they submitted a motion with 
               <br />
               the intention of stirring up a new debate. 
               <br />
               I shall also tell my electors that, according to 
               <br />
               section 146 of the British North America Act, 
               <br />
               the Canadian government had all the required 
               <br />
               authority, granted by the fathers of con- 
               <br />
               federation, to accept Newfoundland and 
               <br />
               annex it as a province, having had that right 
               <br />
               since 1867. I shall also tell them that the 
               <br />
               amendment of my hon. friends opposite 
               <br />
               amounts to saying that they want consulta- 
               <br />
               tion with the various prOvinces in order to 
               <br />
               ask them what Newfoundland should have 
               <br />
               done in this instance.

               The hon. member for Stanstead is an 
               <br />
               eminent lawyer, since he is president of the 
               <br />
               Canadian Bar Association. Therefore, when- 
               <br />
               ever a procedure is referred to him, he must, 
               <br />
               by force of habit, investigate it to ﬁnd out

               whether it applies and is likely to give prac—

               tical results. In fact, whenever a petition

               Newfoundland’s union with Canada, nor to 
               <br />
               consider on its merits the constitutional aspect

               of the matter, but simply to keep on playing 
               <br />
               the game of political football begun a few 
               <br />
               months ago between Ottawa, Quebec and 
               <br />
               Ontario. That is the only purpose, and this 
               <br />

               <br />
               of fact, the wording of the amendment refers 
               <br />
               only to “consultation" of the provinces, while 
               <br />
               the word “consent” constantly recurs in the 
               <br />
               remarks of the hon. members. Of course, it 
               <br />
               is an altogether different matter, as the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Stanstead pointed out. Indeed, 
               <br />
               when a client comes to your ofﬁce for a con- 
               <br />
               sultation, he is given what amounts merely to 
               <br />
               an opinion, which places him under no obli-
