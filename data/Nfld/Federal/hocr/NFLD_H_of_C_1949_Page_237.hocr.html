               Mr. Pearson: The answer to that question is 
               <br />
               that I do not consider it means amendment of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act. My view on 
               <br />
               that point was explained last night at some 
               <br />
               length, and I thought with some effectiveness, 
               <br />
               by the Minister of Justice (Mr. Garson). At 
               <br />
               this time I do not wish to repeat that argu— 
               <br />
               ment. I was about to say that if you go 
               <br />
               beyond the interpretation of the compact 
               <br />
               theory in our constitution which I have given, 
               <br />
               you get into a very strange position indeed. 
               <br />
               If you insist on a narrow legal interpretation 
               <br />
               of contract as something which cannot be 
               <br />
               changed without the parties to the contract 
               <br />
               agreeing to it, you get into, for instance, the 
               <br />
               certain difﬁculties arising from the preamble 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act. Those 
               <br />
               difﬁculties were pointed out in 1942 by the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition (Mr. Drew) in a very 
               <br />
               interesting statement which I should like to 
               <br />
               put on the record. It is taken from the 
               <br />
               Montreal Gazette of November 13, 1942, and 
               <br />

               normal observation on the contract theory

               and its possible implications. But it does

               show that if you take a theory and apply it

               <br />
               very difﬁcult constitutional position. For 
               <br />
               instance, it would mean that not one single 
               <br />
               change should be made in our constitutional

               structure without the consent of every prov- 
               <br />
               ince, because it would be unthinkable that 
               <br />
               the provinces should be discriminated against 
               <br />
               in this respect, and that one province should 
               <br />
               have a right which another province did not 
               <br />
               have. That in its turn would mean that a 
               <br />
               majority of the people in the smallest prov- 
               <br />
               ince would be given a right of veto over every 
               <br />
               constitutional change in the country. That 
               <br />
               would mean about 61,000 people. If that 
               <br />
               course were adopted, and that is the logical

               Therefore the ﬁrst obligation under the 
               <br />
               amendment is the obligation of consultation 
               <br />
               with the provinces, an obligation which was 
               <br />
               not applied to the provinces when any other 
               <br />
               new province came into confederation, and 
               <br />
               which therefore might be considered by the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland not as an honour, as 
               <br />
               was suggested by a member last night, but 
               <br />
               almost as an affront. It would be subjecting 
               <br />
               them to a constitutional procedure which was 
               <br />
               not adopted in the case of any other province 
               <br />
               on its entrance into confederation.

               But what is this obligation of consultation? 
               <br />
               What does it mean? Would it mean that the 
               <br />
               federal government would merely tell the 
               <br />
               provinces what we have done, and then after 
               <br />
               a decent interval go ahead and pass an
