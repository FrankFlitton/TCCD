               Sir HECTOR LANGEVIN. I was about to rise just now,

               <br />

               <br />
               hon. gentleman, I may say that the contract for the wharf 
               <br />
               or pier at Cape Tormentine was broken by the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment because the contractor did not proceed with the work 
               <br />
               quickly and evidently could not go on. Under those cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances we called for new tenders, and have given a 
               <br />
               new contract. The contract has been signed, and I under- 
               <br />
               stand that the contractors are men who are quite able to 
               <br />
               periorm the work, which will he proceeded with with all 
               <br />
               due vigor.

               <br />
               names. As to the boat, I cannot positively say, but, as far 
               <br />
               as I recollect, the intention of the Minister of Marine and 
               <br />
               Fisheries is to provide a new boat. In reference to the 
               <br />
               remarks of the mover of the motion, I may say, ﬁrst, that 
               <br />
               there will be no objection to bring down the papers, and 
               <br />
               second, that the survey made in 1886 was communicated to 
               <br />
               the House and hon. gentlemen know what was the result 
               <br />
               of that survey. The hon. gentleman complains that no 
               <br />
               work has been done in the direction of constructing a sub- 
               <br />
               way. I do not suppose he expected that we would pro- 
               <br />
               ceed in that way. He knew, and I think the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man who spoke last stated, that the Minister of Finance had 
               <br />
               made a statement that we would give our attention to that 
               <br />
               work, and that we would have new explorations made to 
               <br />
               see whether the work was a feasible one or not. Well, I 
               <br />
               am glad to say that the last survey, which was made in 
               <br />
               July and August, 1887, has given a much better result than 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst survey of 1886, and, if we go on in that way, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">impirloving</span> all the time, we shall ﬁnd the distance very
