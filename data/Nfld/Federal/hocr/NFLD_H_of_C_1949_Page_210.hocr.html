               Mr. Garson: In that sense it is true that you

               must state in the act that this is conﬁrmed 
               <br />
               notwithstanding the British North America 
               <br />
               Act. What does that mean? It means not— 
               <br />
               withstanding the fact that Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               not having a legislative body, was not in a 
               <br />
               position to present an address, this is con— 
               <br />
               ﬁrmed. Newfoundland did—I will not say 
               <br />
               the next best thing, but I think a better 
               <br />
               thing. It went back to the people themselves 
               <br />
               and then, with the result of the plebiscite 
               <br />
               in place of the address, it went to the three 
               <br />
               governments concerned. Under those circum- 
               <br />
               stances, of course, seeing that there was a 
               <br />
               procedural deviation from the terms of the 
               <br />
               act, it was necessary to say that this shall be 
               <br />
               so notwithstanding the British North America 
               <br />
               Act. But, sir, in no substantial or honest 
               <br />
               sense whatever can it be said that this is an 
               <br />
               amendment of the Canadian constitution. 
               <br />
               The obvious test of that is to ask whether 
               <br />
               there is anything in this section which is of 
               <br />
               general application to all the provinces of 
               <br />
               Canada, and the answer must be no. So when 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Calgary West (Mr. 
               <br />
               Smith) said he wanted to know whether this 
               <br />
               was an amendment of the constitution and 
               <br />
               I said the answer was no, this is my proof 
               <br />
               for the answer I gave. 
               <br />

               It would be very interesting to speculate

               thing against which the people voted in the 
               <br />
               plebiscite, to the end that then they would 
               <br />
               have a legislature which could adopt an

               Newfoundland

               mended; that is, that in the present state of 
               <br />
               affairs we should obtain the assent of the 
               <br />
               provinces, which section 146 does not require 
               <br />
               at all. If you did that would you require a 
               <br />
               majority of the provinces, and what would 
               <br />
               be the nature of that majority? The leader 
               <br />
               of the Social Credit party (Mr. Low) said 
               <br />
               he thought it might be a two-thirds majority. 
               <br />
               Suppose you had, as we did in the dominion- 
               <br />
               provincial agreements, seven provinces on 
               <br />
               one side and the two most populous on the 
               <br />
               other. Would you say that was a majority? 
               <br />
               Or would it have to be all the provinces but 
               <br />
               one? Or all but two? Or what would it be? 
               <br />
               In the meantime this agreement, which 
               <br />
               believe me has been achieved after long 
               <br />
               months of negotiation and not without some 
               <br />
               difficulty, would be placed in jeopardy. Under 
               <br />
               those circumstances I think it is not too much 
               <br />
               to say that, while hon. gentlemen opposite 
               <br />
               make a great profession about being in favour 
               <br />
               of this union with Newfoundland, if they had 
               <br />
               held the opposite View and were strongly 
               <br />
               opposed to that union they could not have 
               <br />
               adopted a more ingenious technicality or a 
               <br />
               better way of frustrating the union and 
               <br />
               stultifying the attempts to achieve it than 
               <br />
               that which they have now adopted.

               Mr. Stanley Knowles (Winnipeg North 
               <br />
               Centre): Mr. Speaker, there was one remark 
               <br />
               made by the hon. member for Calgary West 
               <br />
               (Mr. Smith) with which I am in agreement. 
               <br />
               I hope I state his point correctly; for, as I 
               <br />
               understood the hon. member, he feels that 
               <br />
               the main reason we have the kind of problem 
               <br />
               with which we are wrestling in this House 
               <br />
               of Commons today is the lack of any pro- 
               <br />
               vision in the British North America Act for 
               <br />
               its own amendment. I agree with him. As 
               <br />
               has already been suggested by my leader, 
               <br />
               the member for Rosetown—Biggar (Mr. Cold- 
               <br />
               well), this brings into bold relief the need 
               <br />
               for finding a formula for the amendment of 
               <br />
               the Canadian constitution within our own 
               <br />
               land.

               I confess, however, that there are two 
               <br />
               things about the debate today that bother me. 
               <br />
               First of all, it seems strange to me that we 
               <br />
               should have all these technical and legalistic 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               provision for amending the British North 
               <br />
