               The development of the ﬁshing industry in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland has not been one of continu— 
               <br />
               ous progress. Over the four centuries of its 
               <br />
               history there have been many ups and downs, 
               <br />
               and a number of remedies have been applied 
               <br />
               to bring about recovery. When the world 
               <br />
               economic depression struck in the early thir- 
               <br />
               ties, the economy of Newfoundland was 
               <br />
               unable to cope with the pressure exerted on 
               <br />
               it by falling markets for its principal export 
               <br />
               economy. In the period of 1926 to 1930 the 
               <br />
               codﬁshery yielded close to $13 million annually 
               <br />
               in value of exports, but from 1931 to 1935 the 
               <br />
               average was cut approximately in half to 
               <br />
               $6-4 million.

               In the face of these conditions, in 1936 the 
               <br />
               commission of government established the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland ﬁsheries board, and endowed it 
               <br />
               with wide powers over the production and 
               <br />
               marketing of salted codﬁsh. This was a 
               <br />
               drastic change in tactics made necessary by 
               <br />
               drastic economic conditions. The board was 
               <br />
               given authority not usually vested in such an 
               <br />
               organization in a democratic country; but as 
               <br />
               I have said, the desperate plight of the ﬁshing

               industry, and indeed the whole economy of 
               <br />
               the island, began a slow recovery. The value

               of exports of ﬁshery products, which stood at 
               <br />

               Before answering the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Cape Breton South (Mr. Gillis), I should like 
               <br />
               for a minute to give a brief outline of the 
               <br />
               method by which the ﬁsheries committee 
               <br />
               proceeded with its part of the program of 
               <br />
               bringing about union. It was felt that any 
               <br />
               time you tackled the ﬁshing industry you 
               <br />
               were tackling a very live nerve centre in the 
               <br />
               whole economy of both countries. Therefore 
               <br />
               it had to be dealt with in a spirit of good will 
               <br />
               on both sides. When the committee was set 
               <br />
               up, I asked them to come to my oﬁice. Mr. 
               <br />
               Walsh was the chairman of that committee. 
               <br />
               He and his associates visited the ofﬁce, and 
               <br />
               with the departmental ofﬁcials we sat down 
               <br />
               to consider the problems before us. Before

               <br />
               not consider them in the manner of horse 
               <br />
               traders. I said that I realized they were 
               <br />
               here to do a job—to negotiate—a job which 
               <br />
               they would want to live with, not only in 
               <br />
               the immediate future, but for years to come. 
               <br />
               I asked them to look upon us in the same 
               <br />
               way. I assure you that this was the spirit 
               <br />
               in which we approached the whole problem. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               At the beginning I suggested to them that 
               <br />
               we all knew, facing each other as we did, 
               <br />
               that there was one problem about which 
               <br />
               there would be some difﬁculty, and that was 
               <br />
               the ﬁsheries board and NAFEL. At that time 
               <br />
               I intimated to them I had had some experi- 
               <br />
               ence in the splitting of wood, and had found 
               <br />
               it was very desirable to put a wedge in at 
               <br />
               the knot to open it up, and that the rest of 
               <br />
               the block would then fall apart in an easy 
               <br />
               and fairly reasonable way. That is exactly 
               <br />
               what we did. We started immediately to 
               <br />
               discuss the things that we knew were going 
               <br />
               to be hurdles, and somewhat difﬁcult to get 
               <br />
               over.

               After spending two or three hours in 
               <br />
               exchanging views on this matter, we pro- 
               <br />
               ceeded by way of memorandum. We were 
               <br />
               given a list of questions which the delegates 
               <br />
               wanted us to answer. We answered these 
               <br />
               questions and then discussed our answers in 
               <br />
               another meeting. After various meetings, by 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a.</span> process of elimination, we ﬁnally reached 
               <br />
               a list of understandings which will be found 
               <br />
               in this pamphlet. I believe all hon. members 
               <br />
               have a copy of the pamphlet, and they will 
               <br />
               ﬁnd the questions on page 8. These were the 
               <br />
               questions this committee was ﬁnally able to 
               <br />
               submit to a committee of the cabinet and of 
               <br />
               which we were ﬁnally able to get approval. 
               <br />
               These questions then found their way into 
               <br />
               the pamphlet which we have before us. I 
               <br />
               want to show that never at any time were 
               <br />
               there any harsh words. At all times the mat- 
               <br />
               ter was viewed in a reasonable and business- 
               <br />
               like way and we are very pleased with the 
               <br />
               results.

               Some of the questions which were asked 
               <br />
               this afternoon have to do primarily with our 
               <br />
               own position, and the ﬁght between trawlers 
               <br />
               and shore ﬁshermen. I think those questions 
               <br />
               can quite easily be left to be dealt with when

               A question was raised about the ﬁsheries

               <br />
               fairly wide powers, I will grant you. In
