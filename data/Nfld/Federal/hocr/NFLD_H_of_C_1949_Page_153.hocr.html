               Mr. St. Laurent: That matter was carefully 
               <br />
               considered for a considerable period of time, 
               <br />
               but it was not found possible to devise any 
               <br />
               way in which the old age pension could be 
               <br />
               paid before there was in existence in New— 
               <br />
               foundland a provincial government respon- 
               <br />
               sible to a legislature. The act requires the 
               <br />
               making by a provincial government of a 
               <br />
               contract with the federal government, in 
               <br />
               order to recoup three-quarters of what it 
               <br />
               pays out for old age pensions, under its pro- 
               <br />
               vincial law, up to a maximum of $30 a month. 
               <br />
               Suggestions were made that, if the legisla- 
               <br />
               ture elected in Newfoundland passed a law 
               <br />
               of that kind, it might be made retroactive. 
               <br />
               It was desired to give the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland treatment as good as that which 
               <br />
               was given to Canadians of the other prov- 
               <br />
               inces. As the hon. member knows, in my 
               <br />
               province it was a matter of several years, 
               <br />
               after the dominion old age pension legisla- 
               <br />
               tion was passed, before the provincial gov- 
               <br />
               ernment passed its statute and took advan- 
               <br />
               tage of it; and there were no retroactive 
               <br />
               payments to the old people of my province at 
               <br />
               that time. It was felt that it would not do to 
               <br />
               be treating the people of Newfoundland in a 
               <br />
               manner different from that in which Cana- 
               <br />
               dians of the other provinces had been treated. 
               <br />
               The delegation from Newfoundland, there- 
               <br />
               fore, ﬁnally but most reluctantly came to 
               <br />
               the conclusion that the best thing to do would 
               <br />
               be to proceed as expeditiously as possible to 
               <br />
               elect their legislature, enact their old age 
               <br />
               pension legislation, and make their contract 
               <br />
               which would become effective as soon as it 
               <br />
               was made.

               Mr. MacInnis: I appreciate all the difﬁcul- 
               <br />
               ties that the Prime Minister has pointed out. 
               <br />
               With the best intentions in the world, per- 
               <br />
               haps it would prove impossible to devise a 
               <br />
               scheme that could accomplish what I men— 
               <br />
               tioned. But I do not believe that at the 
               <br />
               present moment Newfoundland is in the same 
               <br />
               position as were the other provinces before 
               <br />
               they took advantage of the Old Age Pensions 
               <br />
               Act. The act was there for them to take 
               <br />
               advantage of it; and if they did not do so, 
               <br />
               that was the fault of the provinces. But here 
               <br />
               we have coming into confederation a new 
               <br />
               province that did not have that opportunity. 
               <br />
               I had hoped there might be some way by 
               <br />
               which the dominion could make the payments, 
               <br />
               pending the time that a provincial act was 
               <br />
               passed.

               <br />
               this. If the dominion-provincial conference 
               <br />
               of 1945 had succeeded, and the plan to pay 
               <br />
               $30 a month to every Canadian over the age 
               <br />
               of seventy, without a means test, had been 
               <br />
               put into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect,</span> would that $30 a month go

               Mr. St. Laurent: In the hypothesis just

               mentioned by the hon. member, it would. 
               <br />
               Just as soon as a resident of Newfoundland

               became a Canadian citizen, with the required

               Newfoundlanders live in Toronto, many of 
               <br />
               them in Davenport riding. Many of them 
               <br />
               are quite old. For some time two Newfound- 
               <br />
               landers came to me to see whether 
               <br />
               I could assist them to get old age pensions.

               too has died. I know quite a number of 
               <br />
               others. The one who was eighty-four years 
               <br />

               The other had lived in Toronto for eighteen 
               <br />
               years. They were both away over the age
