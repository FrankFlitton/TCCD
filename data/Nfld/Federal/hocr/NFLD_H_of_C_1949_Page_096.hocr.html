               the event of Newfoundland’s'joining Canada, 
               <br />
               was enacted some thirty-three or thirty-four 
               <br />
               years ago. It was enacted at the same time 
               <br />
               as the provision was made that representa-

               which I have been reading and I have found

               Such documents as I have read would seem

               to suggest that Newfoundland may be ahead

               of Canada in her legislative provisions for 
               <br />

               tinue for another ﬁve years the arrangements 
               <br />
               that she now has. May I inquire whether

               the Department of Fisheries and the govern- 
               <br />

               methods employed in Newfoundland with the 
               <br />
               possibility, should it be found that theirs are 
               <br />
