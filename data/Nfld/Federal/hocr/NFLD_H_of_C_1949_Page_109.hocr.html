               On the revenue side of a proposed provin-

               cial budget, it was necessary to take account 
               <br />
               of the fact that union would effect a rather 
               <br />
               revolutionary change in the tax sources of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. Up to the time of union, the 
               <br />
               major sources of revenue were sources which 
               <br />
               either were exclusively within the purview 
               <br />
               of the federal government or would be shared 
               <br />
               by the federal and provincial governments.

               The major source of revenue in Newfound- 
               <br />
               land has always been the customs duty. This 
               <br />
               revenue would no longer be available to the 
               <br />
               new provincial government. Income taxes, 
               <br />
               corporation taxes, succession duties and the 
               <br />
               like are ﬁelds that are shared by the two 
               <br />
               governments. The difﬁculty in assessing what 
               <br />
               the revenues would really be was consider- 
               <br />

               It was, of course, realized by the New-

               foundland delegation and by the Canadian 
               <br />

               <br />
               necessary to develop new sources of revenue, 
               <br />
               in the light of those which are utilized in 
               <br />

               it would take some time to develop those
