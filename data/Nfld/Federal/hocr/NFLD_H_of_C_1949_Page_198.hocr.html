               In 1946, on the occasion of the debate on 
               <br />
               the matter of the address, an amendment was 
               <br />
               moved by myself which placed our views 
               <br />
               then before the Canadian people—and this 
               <br />
               amendment is almost a complete reiteration 
               <br />
               of. the 1946 amendment. I urged then, as I do 
               <br />
               now, the necessity for the preservation 
               <br />
               inviolate of rights under the constitution it 
               <br />
               there is to be unity in this land. At that time 
               <br />
               I quoted the words of Edmund Burke, which 
               <br />
               were applicable then as they are now, when 
               <br />
               he said: 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Our constitution is like our island, which uses and 
               <br />
               restrains its subject sea; in vain the waves roar. In
