               Mr. Caldwell: And what those concessions 
               <br />
               were, because the point I have in my mind 
               <br />
               is that Newfoundland is a country which 
               <br />
               will require some assistance from Canada. 
               <br />
               That is obvious from this agreement. It is 
               <br />
               also obvious from the agreement that its 
               <br />
               recovery may be somewhat prolonged. If a 
               <br />
               very large number of corporations are 
               <br />
               relieved of a portion of the corporation 
               <br />
               income tax, which is not to be levied by 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, of course that is a matter of 
               <br />
               concern to this parliament, and I think we 
               <br />
               should know what we are doing in this 
               <br />
               regard. If my information is correct, some 
               <br />
               corporations have made agreements with pre- 
               <br />
               vious Newfoundland governments under 
               <br />
               which they pay practically no taxes what- 
               <br />
               ever. That brings up two points: ﬁrst, the 
               <br />
               aid they will have to get from this parlia- 
               <br />
               ment, and second the position it places them 
               <br />
               vis-à-vis our own similar corporations, if 
               <br />
               there are any in Canada. That is the point.

               <br />

               <br />
               my hon. friend refers exactly the same

               amount of taxes we collect from any other

               tax agreement it will receive exactly the 
               <br />
               same amount. As my hon. friend himself 
               <br />
               indicated, if we saw ﬁt we could ask the

               seven provinces to repeal this ﬁve per cent

               <br />
               advantages in doing that. It was put on

               Mr. Knowles: It was suggested that I might 
               <br />
               ask my questions in reference to the Quebec, 
               <br />
               North Shore and Labrador Railway Company 
               <br />
               under section 31, since it mentions the New- 
               <br />
               foundland railway and other undertakings 
               <br />
               similar thereto. I should like to ask what is 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect,</span> both legal and practical, of the 
               <br />
               adoption of these terms of union on the prov- 
               <br />
               isions of chapter 80 of the statutes of 1947. 
               <br />
               That was the act which incorporated the 
               <br />
               Quebec, North Shore and Labrador Railway 
               <br />
               Company. That act gave the company pretty 
               <br />
               wide powers, rights and privileges. It can 
               <br />
               build a railway right up to the border of. 
               <br />
               Labrador and, if it secured permission from 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, could go on into Labrador. 
               <br />
               In addition to the right to build a railway it 
               <br />
               was given certain other associated rights, 
               <br />
               such as the right to develop electric and other 
               <br />
               kinds of power; the right to set up a telegraph 
               <br />
               and telephone system, to operate steamships, 
               <br />
               wharves, docks, hotels, parks, motorcars, pipe 
               <br />
               lines for the transportation of oil, gas and 
               <br />
               so on. All told, the powers given that com- 
               <br />
               pany in 1947 are quite extensive. In addition, 
               <br />
               when one realizes that the purpose of this 
               <br />
               railway is to tap an area extremely rich in a 
               <br />
               great natural resource, namely iron, it becomes 
               <br />
               readily apparent that the interests connected 
               <br />
               with this railway are given quite an entree 
               <br />
               into the development and exploitation of 
               <br />
               that wealth.
