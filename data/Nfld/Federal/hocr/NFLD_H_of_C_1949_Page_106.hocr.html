               Mr. Abbott: Perhaps we could answer that

               when we are considering Newfoundland’s 
               <br />
               debt. It is expressed in terms of dollars. The

               Newfoundland sterling debt is expressed in 
               <br />
               terms of dollars at $62 million. It has vary-

               ing maturities. Canada will have to service 
               <br />
               the debt until it is repaid, and in due course 
               <br />
               will have to provide for payment. In order 
               <br />
               to provide for payment Canada will have to 
               <br />
               acquire the necessary sterling; and it will 
               <br />
               acquire that sterling by giving to the United

               Kingdom treasury the equivalent amount in

               dollars. Presumably the dollars will be used

               as part of the general dollar reserve of the

               their laws provide. But I do not think

               union of these industries under one juris-

               <br />
               result in far—reaching beneﬁts for the industry 
               <br />

               <br />
               a separate jurisdiction, it is unavoidable that 
               <br />
               at the present time there are certain arrange-

               ments and regulations concerning the industry 
               <br />
               which are different from those under the 
               <br />
               Canadian jurisdiction as applied to the

               I believe it indicates a desire of all parties

               that these particular regulations and arrange-

               involved, and information which has been 
               <br />
               given in the committee. The industry as a
