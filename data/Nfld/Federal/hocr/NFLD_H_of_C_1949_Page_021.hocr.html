               I should like to say a few words about what 
               <br />
               I hope will be our new sister province—New- 
               <br />
               foundland. There is something ﬁne in this 
               <br />
               possibility, something great. It is expected 
               <br />
               that within a few months there will be inte- 
               <br />
               grated into the Canadian federation that ﬁne, 
               <br />
               old colony located in the gulf of St. Lawrence. 
               <br />
               In my youth, which was a long time ago, 
               <br />
               when I was attending a small rural school I 
               <br />
               was always bafﬂed that Newfoundland, which 
               <br />
               was so close to the American continent, geo- 
               <br />
               graphically speaking, and which was so close 
               <br />
               to the Canadian mainland, was not a part of 
               <br />
               Canada. To me the gulf of St. Lawrence 
               <br />
               seemed to have opened its mouth deliberately 
               <br />
               so that Newfoundland could come into 
               <br />
               Canada.

               It was a proud day for us and no doubt a 
               <br />
               proud day for Newfoundland when by a 
               <br />
               majority vote they decided to come into the 
               <br />
               Canadian confederation. They have prob— 
               <br />
               lems of their own and in my view it is the 
               <br />
               duty of every Canadian worthy of the name to 
               <br />
               study their problems, to try to know them, 
               <br />
               to sympathize with them and to help them 
               <br />
               in arriving at a solution. I believe that the 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders will fully realize what it 
               <br />
               means to come into the great Canadian

               their ﬁne sons and daughters to Canada to 
               <br />

               I make that suggestion in all sincerity. I 
               <br />
               wonder how many Canadians know the ﬁne 
               <br />
               qualities of the Newfoundlander? How many 
               <br />
               of us know their loyalty to British traditions? 
               <br />
               Perhaps the same thing could be said, 
               <br />
               although perhaps not as forcibly, of many 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders who have never had an 
               <br />

               not just a political question; it is bigger than 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               visit the other to tell them of their own. We

               I want to say a word or two about the 
               <br />
               St. Lawrence waterway. As a person who 
               <br />
               represents a section of Canada that, geograph- 
               <br />
               ically speaking, is really central, I may say 
               <br />
               that we are open-minded as far as the St. 
               <br />
               Lawrence waterway is concerned. The po-

               tential hydro power is needed at the present 
               <br />
               time in the province of Ontario. I do not say 
               <br />
               that in a critical way. It is because of the 
               <br />
               progress that industry has made. in the prov- 
               <br />
               ince. There are also the factors of immi- 
               <br />
               gration and transportation. I feel somewhat 
               <br />
               reticent about discussing the problem because, 
               <br />
               under Sir Wilfrid Laurier, a national rail link 
               <br />
               was built between the maritimes and Win— 
               <br />
               nipeg out of the federal treasury. Today, 
               <br />
               west of the town of Hearst, with one of the 
               <br />
               ﬁnest roadbeds on the North American con- 
               <br />
               tinent, the rails are practically rusty. We 
               <br />
               are in favour of the development of the St.
