               is nothing in the British North America Act

               <br />
               August 6, 1945, was the desirability of estab-

               lishing a clear division of responsibility, a 
               <br />
               clear division of legislative and administra- 
               <br />
               tive authority, and also ﬁnding a way in 
               <br />
               which we could actually deal with our own

               Mr. Drew: As was indicated earlier, and 
               <br />
               as I have already indicated this afternoon. 
               <br />
               there is almost complete if not complete 
               <br />
               unanimity in the desire to bring Newfound— 
               <br />
               land into Canada under terms that will be 
               <br />
               acceptable to that country and that will main- 
               <br />
               tain harmony and good will in that new 
               <br />
               part of Canada in the years that lie ahead. 
               <br />
               As has been pointed out on many occasions 
               <br />
               however, we in this house have a responsi- 
               <br />
               bility to make sure that the course we follow 
               <br />
               is in keeping with our own practice and our 
               <br />
               own constitution, and that it produces no 
               <br />
               precedents which may endanger the sanctity 
               <br />
               of that constitution; and also that we do 
               <br />
               nothing to weaken respect for our constitu- 
               <br />
               tion on the part of those whom we intend to 
               <br />
               welcome as members of the Canadian federa-
