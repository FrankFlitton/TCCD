               the best information I have is that Gander

               is a tremendous project, and that it is not

               Mr. MacNicol: Mr. Chairman, a few days 
               <br />
               ago I read in a newspaper an item advising 
               <br />
               that the only shoe factory in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               is going to close its doors—or has closed, I 
               <br />
               have forgotten which. In any event the ar— 
               <br />
               ticle pointed out that sixty employees would 
               <br />
               be thrown out of employment. I would 
               <br />
               suggest to the minister who has the required 
               <br />
               authority that he should try to keep that 
               <br />
               shoe factory in operation. I fully realize 
               <br />
               that with the duties removed they will ﬁnd 
               <br />
               it difﬁcult to compete with the big shoe fac- 
               <br />
               tories of Quebec and Ontario. I believe 
               <br />
               however that something should be done to 
               <br />
               protect those employees who own their own 
               <br />
               homes and who have families.

               I am not sure what procedure would be 
               <br />
               taken. However, in time other business will 
               <br />
               develop which undoubtedly would take care 
               <br />
               of those who may be laid off. In the present 
               <br />
               instance however criticism is appearing in 
               <br />
               the press because of the laying off of these 
               <br />
               people, and I would draw the attention of 
               <br />
               the government particularly to this shoe busi- 
               <br />
               ness in Newfoundland. If necessary some 
               <br />
               effort should be made to give them orders 
               <br />

               the necessary adjustment takes place.

               Mr. Howe: I am familiar with the situation,

               land last week. There are two shoe factories 
               <br />
               there. Three or four weeks ago one of them 
               <br />
               announced that they were going to close, but 
               <br />
               I am told that it is a matter of history that 
               <br />
               this factory closes every winter about this 
               <br />
               time. The other shoe factory has announced 
               <br />
               that it is going to specialize in a certain grade 
               <br />

               <br />
               I had none and that I had no use for a man

               who closed his plant before anything had

               this case the plant was fully depreciated and

               Mr. Caldwell: I understand that 75 per cent 
               <br />
               of the revenue in Newfoundland was obtained 
               <br />
               from customs duties; two and a half per cent 
               <br />
               from liquor; seven and a half per cent from 
               <br />
               income taxes; a total of 85 per cent from 
               <br />
               these three sources. I think it would be well 
               <br />
               to put on H ansa’rd just what is really involved 
               <br />
               in the loss of this revenue. I suppose some 
               <br />
               liquor taxes will be retained, but I presume 
               <br />
               most of them were in the form of excise 
               <br />
               duties and therefore would be of national 
               <br />
               interest to them. It should be indicated 
               <br />
               whether the island will have to raise revenue 
               <br />
               from other sources or whether ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               returns are being made for their entry into 
               <br />
               confederation. When people are trying to 
               <br />
               follow a debate right through in Hansard, 
               <br />
               that sort of thing should be on the record 
               <br />
               rather than hidden away among some docu-

               <br />
               at the moment, but I think it should be given 
               <br />
