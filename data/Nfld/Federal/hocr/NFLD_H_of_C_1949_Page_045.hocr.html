               Then, sir, the resources of Newfoundland

               have been referred to. They have great ﬁsh- 
               <br />
               eries. They have two great pulp and paper 
               <br />
               plants, one of them, Bowater’s, being the 
               <br />
               largest paper mill in the world. There are 
               <br />
               seventy—ﬁve ﬁrms constituting secondary 
               <br />
               industries, with some 3,500 employees; and 
               <br />
               in addition to the iron ore mines of Belle Isle 
               <br />
               there are various other mineral deposits. Our 
               <br />
               belief is that, properly explored and devel- 
               <br />
               oped, these resources of Newfoundland will 
               <br />

               <br />
               as well as historical, racial and geographic 
               <br />
               reasons for union.

               Our conviction is that it is in the interests 
               <br />
               of both countries that we should join together. 
               <br />
               Common experience is that generally speaking 
               <br />
               a marriage between fairly mature adults is 
               <br />
               likely to be successful, because they have 
               <br />
               gained something in the way of tolerance and 
               <br />
               understanding. Our hope is that that under- 
               <br />
               standing will help us over the difﬁcult times, 
               <br />
               because there will be difﬁcult times, in work- 
               <br />
               ing out the terms of our union. On the basis 
               <br />
               of our separate experiences, we will be able 
               <br />
               to build a better common life than either 
               <br />
               of us can separately. There is every reason 
               <br />
               for our supporting this measure. I am sure 
               <br />
               it will be a matter for the utmost gratiﬁca- 
               <br />
               tion to the people of Newfoundland, as well 
               <br />
               as to the people of Canada, that the debate 
               <br />
               on this subject should have been carried on 
               <br />
               in a way which recognizes to the full that this

               is an important occasion in the life of Canada.

               At the time of confederation, Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               D’Arcy McGee, who then represented part of 
               <br />
               the constituency I have the honour to repre- 
               <br />
               sent, said this:

               I see. in the not remote future one great nation- 
               <br />
               ality bound, like the shield of Achilles. by the blue 
               <br />
               rim of the ocean. I see it quartered into many 
               <br />
               communities, each disposing of its internal affairs, 
               <br />
               but all bound together by free institutions, free 
               <br />
               intercourse and free commerce. I see a generation 
               <br />
               of industrious, contented. moral men, free in name 
               <br />
               and in fact—men capable of maintaining, in peace 
               <br />
               and in war, a constitution worthy of such a country. 
               <br />

               I believe that that hope, Mr. Speaker, and 
               <br />
               that aspiration of D’Arcy McGee is now 
               <br />
               being realized in the union of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               with Canada, for the good of both our peoples 
               <br />
               and, we believe, to the beneﬁt of the people 
               <br />
               in other countries as well.
