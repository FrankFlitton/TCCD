               Mr. St. Laurent: With some of the premises 
               <br />
               mentioned by the hon. leader of the opposi- 
               <br />
               tion I am in full agreement, but of course I do 
               <br />
               not agree with the conclusion that he draws. 
               <br />
               First of all I should like to call the attention 
               <br />
               of hon. members to the language of section 
               <br />
               121. This section was drawn up by a 
               <br />
               gentleman who knew the rules of English 
               <br />
               grammar. It does not say that all articles of 
               <br />
               the growth, produce, or manufacture of any 
               <br />
               one of the provinces shall, from and after 
               <br />
               the union, be admitted “freely” into each 
               <br />
               of the other provinces. It says they shall be 
               <br />
               admitted “free” into each of the other prov— 
               <br />
               inces. That section has already been under 
               <br />
               consideration by the courts, and the courts 
               <br />
               have held that it meant that these articles of 
               <br />
               the growth, produce or manufacture of any 
               <br />
               one of the provinces shall, from and after 
               <br />
               the union, be admitted free of customs duties 
               <br />
               into any other province.

               The other premise cited by the hon. leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition is a paraphrase by the then 
               <br />
               chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada 
               <br />
               of language used in the decision in the case 
               <br />
               of Russell and the Queen. The hon. leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition probably remembers the 
               <br />
               late Lord Haldane, who perhaps argued more 
               <br />
               of the constitutional cases before the privy 
               <br />
               council than any other man of our genera- 
               <br />
               tion, and who afterwards became Lord Chan— 
               <br />
               cellor and sat on a great many of the con— 
               <br />
               stitutional cases. He stated with reference to 
               <br />
               Russell and the Queen that it was a tacit 
               <br />
               convention among lawyers who appeared 
               <br />
               before the privy council that they did not 
               <br />
               refer to Russell and the Queen, although in 
               <br />
               one instance, having had to refer to it, he 
               <br />
               said that the only ground upon which the 
               <br />
               decision of the privy council in Russell and 
               <br />
               the Queen could be justiﬁed was on the 
               <br />
               assumption that must have been made by 
               <br />
               their lordships in the privy council at that 
               <br />
               time, that the evil of drunkenness was so 
               <br />
               prevalent in Canada when the legislation was 
               <br />

               leader of the opposition that all possible 
               <br />
               arguments to support the jurisdiction of the 
               <br />
               federal parliament with respect to oleomar- 
               <br />
               garine were urged and were dismissed by a 
               <br />
               majority of the judges of the supreme court; 
               <br />
               and the decision there was that it was an 
               <br />
               undue interference with property and civil 
               <br />
               rights, in a matter which was local and 
               <br />
               private within the province, for the federal 
               <br />
               parliament to attempt to prohibit the manu- 
               <br />
               facture and sale of oleomargarine. So they 
               <br />
               did put it back in the same sphere, the same 
               <br />
               zone, that justiﬁed the actions of the provin—

               cial legislatures in dealing with the liquor

               <br />

               <br />
               by the chief justice—such jurisdiction as it 
               <br />
               may have in respect of the criminal law,

               I think that without violating any other

               because since those decisions there has been 
               <br />
               the decision—I think it was in the pharma—

               ceutical case, by the privy council—that 
               <br />
               criminal law did not involve any ethical or 
               <br />

               <br />

               est required a thing to be forbidden under 
               <br />
               penalties, he was the one to judge whether 
               <br />
               or not that was criminal. Some of us were 
               <br />
               surprised that the judgment went that far, 
               <br />
               but that was the ground upon which one of 
               <br />
               these constitutional cases was decided.
