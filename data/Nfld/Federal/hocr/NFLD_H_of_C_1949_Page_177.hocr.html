               <br />
               for eggs to be exported to the United States. 
               <br />
               I believe those export permits are given 
               <br />
               according to the percentage of the quota sup- 
               <br />

               The minister is again reported as saying 
               <br />
               that he sees no immediate likelihood of any 
               <br />
               change being made in the price of food. Quite 
               <br />
               obviously there is some reason for the con-

               cern which the poultrymen of British

               <br />
               think I am exaggerating if I say I think it is 
               <br />
               a sad state of affairs that we cannot distribute 
               <br />
               our goods to satisfy the needs of the people 
               <br />
               of the world. The reason seems to be that 
               <br />
               we are beset with quotas, licences, prohibi— 
               <br />
               tions and embargoes which hinder the free 
               <br />
               distribution of goods. There is also the mone- 
               <br />
               tary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculty</span> which now hampers production 
               <br />
               and distribution of our raw materials. This 
               <br />
               could be removed. It seems to me the sooner 
               <br />
               the government realize they cannot legislate 
               <br />
               or regiment Canada into an era of prosperity, 
               <br />

               what I think might be described as the

               <br />

               <br />
               servative estimate. Let us assume that a 
               <br />
               hen produces about $6.10 worth of eggs dur- 
               <br />
               ing the year. Feed in British Columbia for a 
               <br />
               hen that would produce eggs to that value 
               <br />
               would cost approximately $5.10, which would 
               <br />
               leave a margin of seventy cents to cover 
               <br />
