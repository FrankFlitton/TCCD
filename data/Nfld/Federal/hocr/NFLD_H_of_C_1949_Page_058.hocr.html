               The bill itself is simple and brief. It 
               <br />
               merely has the effect of approving the terms 
               <br />
               of the draft agreement which was settled by 
               <br />
               the representatives of the Canadian govern- 
               <br />
               ment and by those who had been appointed 
               <br />
               to represent Newfoundland in those discus- 
               <br />
               sions. In effect, the considerations before 
               <br />
               hon. members on second reading of this bill 
               <br />
               are very similar to those which were before 
               <br />
               them yesterday when they were dealing with 
               <br />
               the motion.

               The question before hon. members is really 
               <br />
               whether or not they wish to proceed with 
               <br />
               the arrangements which have been made to 
               <br />
               bring Newfoundland into confederation.

               I think it should be pointed out and remem-

               bered during the discussions that in a case 
               <br />
               of this kind there is not the latitude to suggest 
               <br />

               when a bill is in committee, any changes that
