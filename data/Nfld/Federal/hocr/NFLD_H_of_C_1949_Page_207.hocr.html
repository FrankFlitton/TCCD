               a distinction between the federation in the

               The minister quoted a Mr. McEvoy, K.C.,

               who apparently has some clients. In that he

               may be different from the Minister of National

               <br />
               was the position. What Mr. McEvoy said is 
               <br />
               quite true. That is not news to the various

               have been amazed because on a great number 
               <br />
               of occasions I have heard my hon. friend use 
               <br />
               one peg after another as something upon 
               <br />
               which to hang the hat of centralization. I 
               <br />
               have always found him exceedingly ingenious 
               <br />
               in supporting the positions he has taken. I 
               <br />
               do not suppose there is a man in the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada who is better at making 
               <br />
               the best of a bad case than the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition. I suppose it is quite appropriate 
               <br />
               that he should be the leader of the Conserva- 
               <br />
               tive party because he will no doubt get lots 
               <br />
               of practice.

               We have heard a great deal of rhetoric upon 
               <br />
               this subject, excellent in its way but exceed- 
               <br />
               ingly irrelevant. Of all the speeches in sup-

               gentleman who has just taken his seat was 
               <br />
               much the best. At least he got down to the

               real nub of the matter, which was more than 
               <br />
               was accomplished by the rhetoric uttered by
