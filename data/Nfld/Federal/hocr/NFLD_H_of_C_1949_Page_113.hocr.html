               hood of $2,400,000. The minister can correct 
               <br />
               me if I am wrong. Surely he knows what the 
               <br />
               experience is in operating the Newfoundland 
               <br />
               railway even with the high freight rates and 
               <br />
               passenger rates which we heard about, and 
               <br />
               possibly a lower wage scale than we have in 
               <br />
               Canada. What has been the experience there 
               <br />
               in the last few years?—because in the nature 
               <br />
               of things it is not likely that there will be 
               <br />
               too radical a change in a short time. What 
               <br />
               is the deﬁcit on the Newfoundland railway 
               <br />
               likely to be, if there is a deﬁcit? It may be a 
               <br />
               proﬁt, for all I know, but I want a ﬁgure on 
               <br />
               that. I want to know exactly what other 
               <br />
               items, including the cost of veterans allow- 
               <br />
               ances, will go to make up the ﬁgure of $50 
               <br />
               million more or less which will be the cost 
               <br />
               to Canada of the ﬁrst year of operation. I 
               <br />
               have not said a word about the revenues, 
               <br />
               which are estimated on the basis of 1947, I 
               <br />
               think, because that was applying the tax laws 
               <br />
               as they existed in Canada at that time, and 
               <br />
               we, representing the people of Canada, surely 
               <br />
               expect that the tax rates will be much less, 
               <br />
               therefore the tax revenues will be much less. 
               <br />
               However, I will not ask the minister to make 
               <br />
               any estimate in that regard just now. If he 
               <br />
               would throw some light on how the $50 mil- 
               <br />
               lion probable expenditures are made up I 
               <br />
               should be very grateful.

               Mr. Abbott: That question is fair enough. 
               <br />
               I am afraid I cannot give the information at 
               <br />
               once. The reason I gave the round ﬁgure of 
               <br />
               $50 million was that I asked the ofﬁcers of 
               <br />
               the various departments to segregate the 
               <br />
               expenditures in the different departments 
               <br />
               relating to Newfoundland. The other day 
               <br />
               I asked what the total of these estimates 
               <br />
               would be and I was informed that it was 
               <br />
               something of the order of $50 million or $55 
               <br />
               million. I have not the details here. I will 
               <br />
               get them. This discussion will probably go 
               <br />
               on for some time. The full detail of course 
               <br />
               will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be,</span> set out in the special supplementary 
               <br />
               estimate to which I referred a moment ago, 
               <br />
               but I cannot give my hon. friend a break- 
               <br />
               down of that here now.

               <br />

               <br />

               Newfoundland 
               <br />
               has indicated that the estimates of federal 
               <br />
               revenue in a year are, on the one hand, the 
               <br />
               Canadian estimate of $20 million, in round 
               <br />
               ﬁgures and, on the other hand, the New- 
               <br />
               foundland estimate of, shall we say, $27 mil- 
               <br />
               lion, in round ﬁgures. This means that, with 
               <br />
               those ﬁgures, the net cost to the federal 
               <br />
               treasury through union would be a minimum 
               <br />
               of $23 million per annum, and might run up 
               <br />
               to as high as $35 million, based on the 
               <br />
               assumption of the continuance of the present 
               <br />
               scale of economic activity, and also on the 
               <br />
               continuance of the present scale of federal 
               <br />
               taxation. If, as we sincerely hope, there is 
               <br />
               a substantial reduction in rates of taxation 
               <br />
               this year, the anticipated revenue from New- 
               <br />
               foundland would be reduced accordingly, and 
               <br />
               the net charge on the federal treasury would 
               <br />
               be increased accordingly.

               Would the minister comment upon that?

               According to my arithmetic the ﬁgures of cost

               would be somewhere between $23 million

               as the hon. member appreciates, those are 
               <br />
