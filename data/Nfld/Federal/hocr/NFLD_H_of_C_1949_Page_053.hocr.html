               The Newfoundland regiment was brought

               viantown was known in those days as Fair- 
               <br />
               ﬁeld. The Royal Newfoundland regiment 
               <br />
               remained under Colonel Proctor in the “right 
               <br />
               division” and took part in the engagements 
               <br />
               on the Maumee. They fought up as far as 
               <br />
               Fort Wayne. They also took part in the 
               <br />
               attack by Proctor on Fort Meigs. I do not 
               <br />
               know whether they were at Fort Stevenson, 
               <br />
               Sandusky, but I presume they were. After 
               <br />
               the retreat of Proctor, the members of the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland regiment retreated with him. 
               <br />
               The majority of the party were taken prisoner 
               <br />
               east of the present city of Chatham when the 
               <br />
               boat in which they were ascending the 
               <br />
               Thames river was captured.

               Later members of this regiment served in 
               <br />
               the vicinity of Toronto, then called York, and 
               <br />
               still later in the vicinity of Prescott in the 
               <br />
               attack on Ogdensburg. I shall not take the 
               <br />
               time of the house to enumerate all the points 
               <br />
               in which they served, but history records 
               <br />
               that on many ﬁelds a portion of the Royal 
               <br />
               Newfoundland regiment did a major job in 
               <br />
               Upper Canada and aided in preserving this 
               <br />
               part of Canada for the British empire.
