               quently of late, and I will tell hon. members 
               <br />
               why. It was done in 1946 when there was no 
               <br />
               reason to do it. I was as anxious as any man 
               <br />
               sitting in this house to see full justice done 
               <br />
               to my province, which had suffered in its 
               <br />
               representation. But to achieve that purpose 
               <br />
               it was not necessary to enact an amendment 
               <br />
               to the British North America Act any more 
               <br />
               than it was necessary here had it not been 
               <br />
               for the muddle which now exists in relation 
               <br />
               to this matter.

               I would go a little further. The Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister has told the country, if not the house, 
               <br />
               that it is the intention of the government to 
               <br />
               devise some means whereby the constitution 
               <br />
               may be amended. The fact is that there is 
               <br />
               no statutory method of amending the consti- 
               <br />
               tution. The constitution, whether it be called 
               <br />
               a pact, a contract or an agreement, was the 
               <br />
               result of men getting together and coming to 
               <br />
               an understanding; and that understanding 
               <br />
               must persist until parties thereto consent to

               it will be guilty of breach of faith. May I

               summon to the support of this thesis the fol-

               Why all these amendments to the constitu-

               tion? I had been wondering about that mat-

               ter until the Minister of Justice (Mr. Garson) 
               <br />
               had the kindness to tell us the answer the

               other evening, and I refer to his remarks as 
               <br />
               reported in Hansard of February 2. In sub- 
               <br />
               stance this is what the minister said: The 
               <br />
               Rowell-Sirois report did not ﬁnd favour with 
               <br />
               the provinces; we tried to get it through in 
               <br />
               1941 and failed, but we did get it into opera- 
               <br />
               tion as a result of the war. We all know what 
               <br />
               has been the effect upon the provinces of the 
               <br />
               Rowell-Sirois report, for that is name given 
               <br />
               by the minister to the war agreements 
               <br />
               between the dominion and the provinces. In 
               <br />
               good faith the provinces yielded up their tax-

               is the admission of Newfoundland. We are 
               <br />
               all anxious that that island, which stands as a

               <br />
               their place in confederation. The other ques-

               tion involved is the rape of the Canadian

               This afternoon I listened to agreeable gentle- 
               <br />
               men who told us what had happened in New-

               foundland. The facts are not very compli- 
               <br />
               cated. Newfoundland had a debt and the 
               <br />
               interest used to come due now and then. At 
               <br />
               a certain time Newfoundland asked Great 
               <br />
               Britain to take over its liabilities. It was a 
               <br />
               condition of the surrender of responsible gov— 
               <br />
               ernment that Britain assumed the debts of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, and set up a form of govern- 
               <br />
               ment which was not representative. Great 
               <br />
               Britain, by statute, set up what was called a 
               <br />
               special commission of government comprised 
               <br />
               of a governor named by Britain and six com— 
               <br />
               missioners named by Britain, three of whom 
               <br />
               came from the island and three from Great 
               <br />
               Britain. The statute said that this form of
