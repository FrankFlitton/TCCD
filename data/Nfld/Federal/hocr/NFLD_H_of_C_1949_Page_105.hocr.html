               Mr. Hazen: I notice that in subsection 2 of 
               <br />
               section 22 the words used are: “For a period 
               <br />
               of ﬁve years from the date of union”. That 
               <br />
               is a deﬁnite period. I presume it was put in 
               <br />
               at the request of the Newfoundland delega- 
               <br />
               tion. Was any consideration given to the fact 
               <br />
               that Newfoundland might apply prior to the 
               <br />
               end of ﬁve years, or within ﬁve years, for a 
               <br />

               “from the date of union” the governing 
               <br />

               inserted, “unless the province of Newfound-

               Last year an arrangement was made by the 
               <br />
               British government whereby it took over 
               <br />
               from Newfoundland the currency proceeds 
               <br />
               of sales of ﬁsh in those areas—escudos in 
               <br />
               Portugal, or lira in Italy—and gave to New- 
               <br />
               foundland blocked sterling for those other 
               <br />
               currencies. The Newfoundland government 
               <br />
               gave to the ﬁshermen equivalent amounts in. 
               <br />
               dollars to pay for the ﬁsh.

               The blocked sterling thus acquired was 
               <br />
