               I do not mean to insinuate that the confederate 
               <br />
               leaders are communists. Perhaps they are not. But 
               <br />
               I do say that they used communistic tactics to obtain 
               <br />
               the small majority they secured in the second 
               <br />

               <br />

               That gives us an inkling of the means used 
               <br />
               to secure a majority. In addition to that, 
               <br />
               reference was made to the trying conditions 
               <br />
               of 1933, when the people who were on relief 
               <br />
               were getting six cents a day. Then there was 
               <br />
               the lure of family allowances, and old age 
               <br />
               pensions, considerably higher in Canada than 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland. I believe that in Newfound- 
               <br />
               land the old age pension does not exceed $72 
               <br />
               per person and $120 per couple, while here it 
               <br />
               is at least $360 per person. The members of 
               <br />
               the imperial commission participated in the
