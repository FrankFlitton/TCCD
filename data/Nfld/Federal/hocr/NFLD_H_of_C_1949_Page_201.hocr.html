               able by men of good will. That has been

               British North America Act up to date. It is 
               <br />
               up to date. All that is necessary is to bring

               the thinking of the men of our country up to 
               <br />

               wisely and beneﬁcently for the advantage of 
               <br />
               all Canadians. As all hon. members will

               recall, those powers were given speciﬁcally

               I notice a stone wall of determined resist- 
               <br />
               ance on the part of many members of the 
               <br />
               Liberal party against any progressive con- 
               <br />
               sideration whatsoever of those two powers. In 
               <br />
               the B.N.A. Act the dominion government is 
               <br />
               given power over currency and coinage, over 
               <br />
               banking, the incorporation of banks and the 
               <br />
               issue of paper money. I maintain that, if those 
               <br />
               two powers are exercised wisely by the 
               <br />
               federal government, all the unhappiness that 
               <br />
               has existed as between the dominion and the 
               <br />
               provinces during the past twenty years will 
               <br />
               have no reason for recurring. Let the federal 
               <br />
               government pass enabling legislation, as the 
               <br />
               present government has been doing recently. 
               <br />
               Let the federal government render available 
               <br />
               to the provinces the ﬁnancial means they 
               <br />
               require to enable them to discharge their 
               <br />
               responsibilities under the constitution, and 
               <br />
               there will be no more difﬁculty.

               Let it be borne in mind that at the present 
               <br />
               time under the constitution of Canada the 
               <br />
               provinces are charged with responsibility in 
               <br />
               all matters pertaining to education, health,

               less unable to take care of themselves. It

               prices and markets. How can you guarantee

               should have power to control those two 
               <br />
               important factors in its life. Let the dominion

               <br />

               discharge its responsibilities in connection 
               <br />
               with property and civil rights, which I have 
               <br />
               just indicated. Then the dominion will have 
               <br />
               no further trouble with Nova Scotia or any 
               <br />
               other province, and the people of Canada will 
               <br />
               be happy and prosperous.

               <br />
               “Well, where are we going to get the money?”

               That is exactly the matter I referred to when

               considerable degree the present government

               great many difficulties will be avoided. Call

               a dominion-provincial conference to deal

               provinces and the dominion are jointly 
               <br />
               responsible. Then, after policy has been 
               <br />
               determined, let the federal government lead 
               <br />
               out, as it was set to do, and we shall have no 
               <br />
               more trouble in the dominion. All will then

               <br />
               to British Columbia itself. That conception
