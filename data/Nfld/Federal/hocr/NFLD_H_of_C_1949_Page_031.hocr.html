               From what I have been able to read in the 
               <br />
               press since the agreement was signed, there 
               <br />
               appears to be almost complete unanimity on 
               <br />
               the part of the Canadian public that this was 
               <br />
               a good arrangement to make, and that it is 
               <br />
               a good thing in this year 1949 to complete the 
               <br />
               original project envisaged by the fathers of 
               <br />
               confederation in 1864. From what I have 
               <br />
               seen of the editorial comment in the news- 
               <br />
               papers of the island, there are still those who 
               <br />
               would prefer to have had responsible gov- 
               <br />
               ernment re-established and the terms of con- 
               <br />
               federation discussed by and through that 
               <br />
               responsible government. In the referendum 
               <br />
               the majority decided otherwise, however; 
               <br />
               and even among the objectors I think there 
               <br />
               are now large numbers who feel there has 
               <br />
               been a sincere attempt to make a fair pro- 
               <br />
               posal, and that confederation with Canada 
               <br />
               has been made inevitable both by the 
               <br />
               Almighty in the distribution of the lands and 
               <br />
               waters of this northern half of the North 
               <br />
               American continent, and by the historic de- 
               <br />
               velopment of the people who have inhabited 
               <br />
               these two parts. They are not strangers to 
               <br />
               each other. They come from the same stocks. 
               <br />
               They have developed under the same system 
               <br />
               of responsible government, of love of indivi- 
               <br />
               dual freedom, of respect for the human being 
               <br />
               as more important than the state. They have 
               <br />
               developed in the view that the state exists 
               <br />
               for the individual, and not the individual for 
               <br />
               the state. It is my hope that this arrangement 
               <br />
               will commend itself to the Canadian parlia- 
               <br />
               ment, to the vast majority of the Canadian 
               <br />
               people and also to the vast majority of the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland. We are here now 
               <br />
               considering a matter of great moment. In 
               <br />
               the last two wars we realized how close we 
               <br />
               were to each other and how close we had to 
               <br />
               be in order to survive. In this troubled world 
               <br />
               I think we, both in Newfoundland and in 
               <br />
               Canada, feel that in this way our risks are 
               <br />
               more apt to be successfully met and any 
               <br />
               dangers overcome than was possible even 
               <br />
               with the non-constitutional union of spirits 
               <br />
               and hearts that united us during the last two 
               <br />
               wars. I earnestly hope it will be the view 
               <br />
               of this house that this union of Canada and 
               <br />
               Newfoundland is desirable in the interests 
               <br />
               of the people of these two lands, and as a 
               <br />
               lesson to the whole world of what can be 
               <br />
               accomplished by men of good will.

               of the agreement in any detail, because the 
               <br />
               agreement will be under discussion when the 
               <br />
               bill is before the house. I shall simply discuss 
               <br />
               the resolution before us, which will have the 
               <br />
               effect of bringing before hon. members the 
               <br />
               bill the government intends to introduce. For 
               <br />
               this reason I shall defer any comments I 
               <br />
               might make about certain references made 
               <br />
               by the Prime Minister to some features of 
               <br />
               the agreement, which to me suggest that care- 
               <br />
               ful consideration should be given to its full 
               <br />

               Perhaps I might go so far as to suggest 
               <br />
               that, before the bill is formally introduced 
               <br />
               and the agreement accompanying it is placed 
               <br />
               before the house, the government give con- 
               <br />
               sideration to the desirability of removing 
               <br />
               the section in regard to oleomargarine, for 
               <br />
               reasons which have nothing to do with the 
               <br />
               use of oleomargarine itself. The Prime Minis- 
               <br />
               ter said the completion of confederation is 
               <br />
               more important than the question whether 
               <br />
               or not Tom Jones in Newfoundland is to eat 
               <br />
               oleomargarine. The balance of importance 
               <br />
               unquestionably is in accordance with what 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister said; but there is a very 
               <br />
               important question that may be involved in 
               <br />
               the inclusion of that section, to which I think 
               <br />
               the government should give some attention 
               <br />
               before we are asked to discuss it. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               It is true that the section to which I refer 
               <br />
               was included in the draft terms of agree- 
               <br />
               ment before the Supreme Court of Canada 
               <br />
               had reached its decision as to the constitu- 
               <br />
               tional authority of the Canadian parliament 
               <br />
               to deal with restrictions on the use of oleo- 
               <br />
               margarine. The provision that the manu- 
               <br />
               facture of oleomargarine should be continued 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland related to the fact that 
               <br />
               already it was being manufactured there. 
               <br />

               I am not concerned with the circumstances 
               <br />
               which led to the inclusion of this provision. 
               <br />
               What I am concerned with is that a principle 
               <br />
               is put forward which, if accepted, might 
               <br />
               apply with equal force to other matters of 
               <br />
               trade and commerce, and with serious con- 
               <br />
               sequences. It suggests that it is an acceptable 
               <br />
               principle to create trade barriers between 
               <br />
               provinces of Canada. Serious consideration 
               <br />
               should be given by the government and by 
               <br />
               the house to the principle involved in the 
               <br />
               acceptance of this provision of the agreement, 
               <br />
               even though the Supreme Court of Canada 
               <br />
               by its decision may to some extent have 
               <br />
