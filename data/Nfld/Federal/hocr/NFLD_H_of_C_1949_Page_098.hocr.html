               <br />
               ther with this section may I make a brief 
               <br />
               statement. The information I gave the com- 
               <br />
               mittee last night about the recommendation 
               <br />
               I had received as to the distribution of posts 
               <br />
               of senators for the island of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               has created some uneasiness there. I said it 
               <br />
               had been represented to us that there were 
               <br />
               three main groups of the population, divided 
               <br />
               according to religious denominations among 
               <br />
               Anglican, Roman Catholic and adherents of 
               <br />
               the United church. That has been taken to 
               <br />
               mean that it would exclude the possibility of 
               <br />
               anyone not belonging to those three denom- 
               <br />
               inations being considered for a Senate 
               <br />
               appointment. That is not at all what I meant, 
               <br />
               nor was it the real meaning of the recom- 
               <br />
               mendation made to us. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The recommendation made was that there 
               <br />
               were these three groups, namely the Angli- 
               <br />
               cans, the Roman Catholics, the members of the 
               <br />
               United church and adherents of other denom- 
               <br />
               inations not forming part of the United church. 
               <br />
               The high commissioner reported that my 
               <br />
               statement might create a false impression and 
               <br />
               I feel it is desirable to have any false 
               <br />
               impression corrected. So I wish to say that 
               <br />
               those recommendations did comprise in the 
               <br />
               group described as the United church group 
               <br />

               Anglican nor Roman Catholic, and that would 
               <br />
               include Presbyterians, adherents of the Salva-

               ject matter now under discussion one of great

               <br />

               It seems to me that at this time it would be 
               <br />
               necessary for the Minister of Fisheries to give 
               <br />
               us a comprehensive statement about the 
               <br />
               whole industry. For example, according to a 
               <br />
               press dispatch it was stated that a ﬁsheries 
               <br />

               <br />
               That procedure took place in the United

               States. I understand eleven countries were 
               <br />
               represented, that Canada and Newfoundland 
               <br />
               are part of the set-up, and that this particular 
               <br />
               treaty deals with research. We are acting

               While I am not sure of the accuracy of my 
               <br />
               information, I am informed that the ﬁsheries 
               <br />
               board which regulates marketing in New- 
               <br />
               foundland is representative of the ﬁsh dealers 
               <br />
               only, and that the industry is not represented 
               <br />
               thereon. I am further advised that the com- 
               <br />
               mission of government as such has no repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives on the board. If that kind of 
               <br />
               marketing arrangement is to continue for 
               <br />
               ﬁve years in Newfoundland, I think it is 
               <br />
               wrong. If my information is incorrect, I 
               <br />
               would ask the minister to give the correct 
               <br />
               information. If what I say is the fact, then 
               <br />
               surely this section should be rewritten.

               My greatest concern, and the point about 
               <br />
               which I wish to be most speciﬁc, is the bounty 
               <br />
               now paid maritime ﬁshermen. This is a ﬁxed 
               <br />
               amount. If Newfoundland is now to be in— 
               <br />
               cluded in the bounty arrangement—and it 
               <br />
               would seem that it is—the result would be a 
               <br />
               reduction in the amount of money paid to 
               <br />
