               Mr. Isnor: I think there is one point we 
               <br />
               should bear in mind with regard 'to this ﬁve- 
               <br />
               year period. As I understand, the Newfound- 
               <br />
               land ﬁsheries board will operate as a federal 
               <br />
               agency under the control of the governor in 
               <br />
               council. If I am correct in that, it does away 
               <br />
               with some of the worries that the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber opposite has in regard to its operation. 
               <br />
               But I take a wider View of awards than did 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Cape Breton South, 
               <br />
               because that Halifax award applies largely 
               <br />
               to the inshore ﬁshermen. He also raised the 
               <br />
               question as to the operation of the ﬁshing 
               <br />
               industry. I think Canada and Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               or the maritime provinces including Quebec, 
               <br />
               will be in an exceptionally fortunate position 
               <br />
               having regard to the future ﬁshing industry 
               <br />
               of the world. We certainly will be able to 
               <br />
               take care of a population of 160 million, or 
               <br />
               all the consumers on the north American 
               <br />
               continent. In this ﬁsheries development, we 
               <br />
               should take a long-range view not only of the 
               <br />
               beneﬁts to Newfoundland, the new province, 
               <br />
               but of the effect it will have on our Canadian 
               <br />
               ﬁshing industry. I for one welcome the 
               <br />
               thought that we are going to be able to join 
               <br />
               our forces and export in still larger quan— 
               <br />
               tities than ever before. I do not expect any 
               <br />
               trouble between the maritime provinces and 
               <br />
               Newfoundland in regard to regulations, 
               <br />
               because they have already shown a willing- 
               <br />
               ness to co-operate in developing new and 
               <br />
               more extensive markets.

               May I say a word about the trawler? A 
               <br />
               number of years ago I was drawn into the 
               <br />
               trawler question. In fact I was almost cruci- 
               <br />
               ﬁed by certain groups and papers in the mari— 
               <br />
               times, but I am just as ﬁrmly convinced today 
               <br />
               as I was when I took my stand, in 1938, if I 
               <br />
               remember rightly, that the ﬁshing trawler is 
               <br />
               necessary if we are to develop a large export 
               <br />
               market. You cannot sell in small quantities 
               <br />
               in a proﬁtable way. It is all right for the 
               <br />
               inshore ﬁshermen. I am familiar with the 
               <br />
               inshore ﬁshermen. In the summer months I 
               <br />
               live right next door to them. I am friendly 
               <br />
               with them and am anxious to see them pros- 
               <br />
               per, but they can only prosper by developing 
               <br />
               and holding a market in central Canada and 
               <br />
               in foreign countries. Therefore the trawler 
               <br />
               is necessary. A continuity of supply must be 
               <br />
               maintained if we are to continue in any 
               <br />
               developed market. Because of that, I am 
               <br />
               sure that those who say the trawler must be

               tion to my remarks. I would ask him to

               wait a minute. It was not my intention to

               extreme west coast, but in all sections of the 
               <br />
               country. He has shown his interest by coming 
               <br />
               to the extreme east, and he has made himself 
               <br />

               <br />
