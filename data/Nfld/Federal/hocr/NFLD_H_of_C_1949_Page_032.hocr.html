               <br />
               met in Charlottetown on September l, 1864,

               <br />
               1858. It is well to remember the signiﬁcance 
               <br />
               of the fact that these proposals which were 
               <br />

               <br />
               create a federal union.

               <br />
               Macdonald’s renewed proposals of 1888 gave 
               <br />
               convincing evidence of the continuing hope

               that Newfoundland would join with the rest

               a decision whether the bill to bring about

               the union of Newfoundland with Canada is

               provisions of the bill will be and the course

               We are now simply discussing a resolution

               which, in effect, asks us to express our
