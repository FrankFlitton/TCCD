               Mr. Pearkes: What is the position of a

               war veterans allowance now that Newfound- 
               <br />
               land has been brought into confederation? 
               <br />
               Surely it must be a reciprocal agreement.

               What about the Newfoundlander who 
               <br />
               instead of going to Nova Scotia went to the 
               <br />
               United States, worked there for a year and 
               <br />
               then left the United States to join the Royal

               foundland navy, because there was no such

               entitled to a war veterans allowance until

               I think we are going to ridiculous extremes. 
               <br />
               It is time for us to say that any man who was 
               <br />
               domiciled in Canada and who served in any 
               <br />

               Newfoundland for the six or twelve months 
               <br />
               immediately before the outbreak of the war. 
               <br />
               This applies particularly to those Newfound- 
               <br />
               landers who had left Newfoundland for a 
               <br />

               decided to move to Newfoundland or Canada

               War Veterans Allowance Act to the men of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. I am told that to a large 
               <br />
               extent the veterans in Newfoundland own 
               <br />
               their own homes. A veteran, be it in Canada 
               <br />
               or in Newfoundland, is entitled to own prop- 
               <br />
               erty valued up to $4,000 and still be eligible 
               <br />
               for a war veterans allowance. But if for any 
               <br />
               reason that man should sell his property and

               put the $4,000 into an annuity or government 
               <br />
               bonds, he is immediately deprived of that 
               <br />
               beneﬁt. Quite frequently because of changed 
               <br />
               circumstances, perhaps the death of a wife 
               <br />
               or something like that, a man may decide to 
               <br />
               sell his home and place the money in bonds 
               <br />
               for the time being in the hope that at some 
               <br />
               future time he will be able to purchase a 
               <br />
               new home. That man ﬁnds himself cut off 
               <br />
               from the war veterans allowance. The ofﬁ-

               cials who administer the War _ Veterans

               <br />

               cannot draw a war veterans allowance until 
               <br />

               <br />

               This is another amendment which is

               urgently needed in View of the fact that many 
               <br />
               veterans in Newfoundland own their own 
               <br />
               homes. Having disposed of their home it may 
               <br />
               be that they want to put the money into some 
               <br />
               form of government bond. They will be told: 
               <br />
               “You cannot draw the war veterans allow- 
               <br />

               <br />
               give the most serious consideration to those 
               <br />
               three points. The ﬁrst point is to make the 
               <br />
               beneﬁts of the war veterans allowance avail- 
               <br />
               able to every man who has been domiciled at 
               <br />
               any time in Canada or in Newfoundland, who 
               <br />
               has served in any of His Majesty’s forces and 
               <br />
               has returned either to Newfoundland or to 
               <br />
               Canada. Secondly, I would ask him to take 
               <br />
               the opportunity now of including all our com- 
               <br />
               rades who served in the imperial forces, and 
               <br />
               who have lived in Canada or Newfoundland 
               <br />
               for a period of twenty years or more. The 
               <br />
               third point I wish him to give consideration 
               <br />
               to is the heartbreaking regulation which 
               <br />
               forces a recipient of the war veterans allow- 
               <br />
               ance to live on his capital until it has been
