               Mr. T. L. Church (Broadview):' Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               I wish to congratulate the house on the good 
               <br />
               temper which has been exhibited in this 
               <br />
               debate. Since I have been a member of the 
               <br />
               house I have seen the British North America 
               <br />
               Act rigged out in a coat of many colours. The 
               <br />
               last two speakers especially seem to show that 
               <br />
               they have a single View and" a single heart at 
               <br />
               the present time. I refer to the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice and the whip of the C.C.F. While 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice wishes to abolish 
               <br />
               appeals to the privy council, which is the key 
               <br />
               to the British North America Act, a prede- 
               <br />
               cessor of his in ofﬁce, Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, 
               <br />
               who was Chief Justice of Canada, counsel for 
               <br />
               Louis Riel in Regina many years ago, and a 
               <br />
               leading member of the bar, opposed the 
               <br />
               abolition of appeals to the privy council. So 
               <br />
               did Sir Allen Aylesworth, a brilliant lawyer 
               <br />
               and former Minister of Justice.

               How did the Minister of Justice ever win 
               <br />
               Marquette? He owes it to the Conservatives. 
               <br />
               I am surprised that today we have in Mani-

               <br />
               council. Let me say to the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               that he owes his election, as the hon. member

               then, as Prime Minister of that day, pro-

               ceeded to set up a committee. I was asked to 
               <br />
               serve on it, but I did not like to do so. This
