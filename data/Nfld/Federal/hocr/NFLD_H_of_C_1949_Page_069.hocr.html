               <br />
               however, that we have no real law reform 
               <br />
               in this country. For many years past I have 
               <br />
               been trying to get some. It is a forgotten 
               <br />
               subject here. We should have a committee 
               <br />
               to go over these legal bills and see that we 
               <br />
               get some reform. With the complexity of the 
               <br />
               law, with the maelstrom of red tape and the 
               <br />
               cobwebs in it, I can tell hon. members that 
               <br />
               it is a relic of other days. In England, as a 
               <br />
               result of the summary offenders act, half the 
               <br />
               prisons have been closed. How? The people 
               <br />
               are given time to pay. Yet we have no law 
               <br />
               reform in Canada of the criminal law which 
               <br />
               we are to pass on to Newfoundland according 
               <br />
               to this bill. In Toronto we built the Toronto 
               <br />
               jail, the jail farm on Yonge street for men 
               <br />
               and the jail farm for women three miles from 
               <br />
               there at Concord. The government here, 
               <br />
               through one of the departments, have taken 
               <br />
               those two new jail farms. I do not know 
               <br />
               why that was done. I can tell hon. members 
               <br />
               that 400 people have been crowded into the 
               <br />
               Toronto jail. It was built after 1867 for use 
               <br />
               only for remands, and is ﬁt for no more than 
               <br />
               200 persons. We have been trying to get 
               <br />
               something done, and we did get something 
               <br />
               done by establishing these two jail farms. If 
               <br />
               that is the kind of law reform that is to be 
               <br />
               passed on to Newfoundland, it is another 
               <br />
               matter. Having explained these matters, and 
               <br />
               pointed out the urgent need for law reform in 
               <br />
               this country, I suggest that we should have 
               <br />
               a legal committee to go over every one of 
               <br />
               these laws every year in order to see that we 
               <br />
               get some real law reform.

               seen that the dominion of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               would not have a responsible government in 
               <br />
               1949 when its entry into confederation was 
               <br />
               being considered. That is one of the points 
               <br />
               I wish to make. There is so much unanimity 
               <br />
               in this house on the desirability of New- 
               <br />
               foundland joining with Canada that I think 
               <br />
               it would be a mistake to indulge in criticism 
               <br />
               that can lead nowhere; because, in my 
               <br />
               opinion, there is nothing this parliament can 
               <br />
               or could do in the matters complained of. I 
               <br />
               am not attempting to defend the government 
               <br />
               in What it has done. It does not need my 
               <br />
               defence, because .it has plenty of supporters 
               <br />
               on its own side quite able to defend its 
               <br />
               actions. I do not believe it was up to this 
               <br />
               government to suggest to the government of 
               <br />
               the United Kingdom that it should restore 
               <br />
               responsible government to Newfoundland to 
               <br />
               enable it to negotiate with the government of 
               <br />
               Canada. I am not well versed in how these 
               <br />
               things are done, but I do not believe that it 
               <br />
               would be proper for the Dominion of Canada 
               <br />
               to make proposals of that kind to the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom government. There were two refer- 
               <br />
               endum votes taken on this question by the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland. According to the 
               <br />
               system of voting followed, both votes were 
               <br />
               opposed to the reconstitution of responsible 
               <br />
               government. The ﬁrst vote was on three 
               <br />
               questions: the commission form of govern- 
               <br />
               ment, responsible government and confed— 
               <br />
               eration. Responsible government received 
               <br />
               the largest vote. But it was stipulated that 
               <br />
               it would require to have an over-all major— 
               <br />
               ity. The ﬁrst vote then stood at 85,000 to 
               <br />
               69,000 against responsible government. In 
               <br />
               the next vote the situation was somewhat 
               <br />
               similar. Confederation carried by quite a 
               <br />
               reasonable majority. If an hon. member 
               <br />
               came to this house with as clear a majority 
               <br />
               as confederation received I believe he would 
               <br />
               think that he was quite justiﬁed in speaking 
               <br />
               for the electors of his constituency. There 
               <br />
               is only one logical conclusion to the criticism 
               <br />
               of how the negotiations were carried out, and 
               <br />
               I do not think any hon. member would want 
               <br />
               to accept that conclusion because, in the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               place, it would delay confederation and in my 
               <br />
               opinion the results would be the same as they 
               <br />
               are now. That conclusion is to have another 
               <br />
               referendum taken by the people of New- 
               <br />
               foundland with the exact terms of confedera- 
               <br />
               tion before them. They should be asked 
               <br />
               whether they want confederation or not. 
               <br />
               That is the logical conclusion to the criticism 
               <br />
               made by the hon. member for Lake Centre 
               <br />
               and the two hon. members from my own
