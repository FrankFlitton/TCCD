               Mr. Casileden: It is their legislation. It is 
               <br />
               the right of a people in a democratic country, 
               <br />
               through their legislature, to have some say

               about the terms of an agreement which they 
               <br />
               are to enter into. That, it seems to me, is 
               <br />
               not right, and Canada’s parliament should not 
               <br />
               be a party to an agreement under which such

               fundamental, basic, democratic rights are

               comed, as I know they will be, if they decide 
               <br />
               to come in. Let Newfoundland feel that we 
               <br />
               have stood here and fought for her demo- 
               <br />
               cratic rights. Let her feel that we welcome 
               <br />
               her as a sister in a great dominion. Let her 
               <br />
               be convinced of our belief that fundamentally 
               <br />
               her people should have the full and proper 
               <br />
               democratic right, the basic right, to some say 
               <br />
               as to whether or not they accept the terms of 
               <br />

               I hope I have made our position clear. We

               <br />
               she could come in. I think we could do it 
               <br />
               more wholeheartedly if we felt that all the

               people of Newfoundland and of Labrador had 
               <br />

               bers of the House of Commons, or the public

               taken to bring Newfoundland into confedera- 
               <br />
               tion is one which should have been taken 
               <br />
               many years ago. My understanding is that 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders are now being emancipated 
               <br />
               from a small group of ﬁsh merchants who 
               <br />
               have exploited them for the past three hun- 
               <br />
               dred years. As I said before, this is a step 
               <br />
               in the right direction.

               Let me now say something which has not 
               <br />
               been said before. For many years the people 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland were allowed to enter 
               <br />
               Canada freely and to take employment here. 
               <br />
               During the winter months when they were 
               <br />
               not able to ﬁsh—and that is about the only 
               <br />
               industry on the island—hundreds of New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders would come to Cape Breton 
               <br />
               island to work in the coal mines. They 
               <br />
               would ﬁnd employment there during the 
               <br />
               winter months, and then return to their ﬁsh- 
               <br />
               ing industry when the season opened. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Since about 1931 that has not been permit— 
               <br />
               ted. The coal mining regulations in Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia were amended so as to preclude them 
               <br />
               from going into the mines and taking employ- 
               <br />
               ment as coal miners. Consequently our 
               <br />
               immigration laws were amended so as to 
               <br />
               prohibit the entry of Newfoundlanders into 
               <br />
               Canada. They were treated almost as Euro- 
               <br />
               peans, or others coming from foreign 
               <br />
               countries. I thought that was a great dis- 
               <br />
               service to the people in my part of the 
               <br />
               country because, as has been suggested by one 
               <br />
               hon. member, they are good workers and good 
               <br />
               citizens. Not many of them are to be found 
               <br />
               on relief, and they can turn their hand to 
               <br />
               almost anything. They have had to develop 
               <br />
               that technique because of the conditions under 
               <br />
               which they have lived in their own country. 
               <br />
               They had to be jacks of all trades.

               quarreling with what happened in New-

               foundland. I believe that those who argue

               along the lines of responsible government 
               <br />
               are dealing with a misnomer. It is not
