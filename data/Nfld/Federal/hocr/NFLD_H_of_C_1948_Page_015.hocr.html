               Mr. HACKETT: I understand that the 
               <br />

               which would only require executive action to

               Mr. ST. LAURENT: It makes a difference 
               <br />
               as to the proper procedure to bring it about. 
               <br />
               The British North America Act contemplated 
               <br />
               that there might be union between Canada 
               <br />
               and Newfoundland on a joint address of the 
               <br />
               houses of parliament of Canada and the legis- 
               <br />
               lature of Newfoundland. That principle could 
               <br />
               be resorted to; but it would require, in order 
               <br />
               to be resorted to, the restoration of self- 
               <br />
               government in Newfoundland, and then joint 
               <br />
               addresses under the terms of section 146 of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act. On those 
               <br />
               joint addresses, union could be consummated 
               <br />
               by order of His Majesty in council without 
               <br />
               legislation in the parliament at Westminster 
               <br />
               or legislation in the parliament of Canada. 
               <br />
               But if that method is not. resorted to, the 
               <br />
               matter is not expressly provided for and 
               <br />
               would have to be accomplished by new legis- 
               <br />
               lation that could, I suppose, be adopted only 
               <br />
               by the parliament at Westminster if there 
               <br />
               were joint addresses from the houses of the 
               <br />
               Canadian parliament asking that it be done. 
               <br />
               The parliament at Westminster amends the 
               <br />
               British North America Act and makes pro- 
               <br />
               vision with respect to Canada, but only on 
               <br />
               the request of the houses of the Canadian 
               <br />
               parliament; and that could probably be the 
               <br />
               method adopted. The one provided for in 
               <br />
               the British North America Act would require, 
               <br />
               as a condition precedent, that self-government
