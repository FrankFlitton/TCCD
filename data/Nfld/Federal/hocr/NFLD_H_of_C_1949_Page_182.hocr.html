               As was appropriately said by the Prime

               Minister (Mr. St. Laurent) following the intro- 
               <br />
               duction of this resolution, there is a back- 
               <br />
               ground of common history which~brings the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland and Canada 
               <br />
               extremely close together, not only in geo- 
               <br />
               graphical association but in ties of blood and 
               <br />
               the intimate contacts which were the result 
               <br />
               of many joint efforts during the war. The 
               <br />
               Prime Minister said that amongst our com- 
               <br />
               mon traditions was an abhorrence of arbitrary 
               <br />
               action. I feel that this is something we 
               <br />
               should bear in mind. It is essential that in 
               <br />
               bringing about the fulﬁlment of the great 
               <br />
               vision of union we should do all in our power 
               <br />
               to prevent anything from happening which 
               <br />
               will fan the ﬂame of discontent, either in 
               <br />
               Newfoundland or in Canada. That such dis- 
               <br />
               content does exist, we all know. It is 
               <br />
               extremely important, therefore, that we exam- 
               <br />
               ine carefully the constitutional aspects of the 
               <br />

               We start with the proposition that this 
               <br />
               house has clearly indicated its desire that 
               <br />
               Newfoundland become a part of Canada. 
               <br />
               There has been full evidence of the warm 
               <br />
               sentiments of those who sit in this house, as 
               <br />
               representatives of the people of Canada, 
               <br />
               toward the people of Newfoundland, whom 
               <br />
               they are anxious to welcome as their blood 
               <br />
               brothers and sisters in this great venture of 
               <br />
               confederation. At a time, however, when 
               <br />
               democracy and all the processes of democracy 
               <br />
               are being tested as never before, it is essen- 
               <br />
               tial that we observe strictly the principles of 
               <br />
               democracy, and that in our desire to achieve 
               <br />
               the result we have in view, we do not dis- 
               <br />
               regard the constitutional background of this 
               <br />
               whole federal structure. In bringing about 
               <br />
               the fuﬂlment of this desirable result, we 
               <br />
               should not establish any principle which 
               <br />
               might weaken the constitutional structure 
               <br />
               upon which the strength of this nation must 
               <br />
               depend in the years ahead. We should not 
               <br />
               tamper lightly with our constitution, simply 
               <br />
               on the ground that the results are much worth 
               <br />
               while.
