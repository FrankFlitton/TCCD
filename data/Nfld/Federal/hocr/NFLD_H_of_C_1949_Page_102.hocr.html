               brief. Taking the long view, this union will 
               <br />
               be of strategic, economic and social advan-

               tage to both Newfoundland and Canada. 
               <br />
               Dealing speciﬁcally with ﬁsheries, I know

               True, the salt ﬁsh industry in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               is going to be, so to speak, on its own, to a 
               <br />
               certain extent for ﬁve years, but that is 
               <br />
               quite understandable. It takes a certain 
               <br />
               amount of time to adjust these things.

               <br />
               have ﬁshed out of Nova Scotia’s ports, and 
               <br />
               particularly out of the home port of the
