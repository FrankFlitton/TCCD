               Mr. Nicholson: That was December 2, 1943, 
               <br />
               In 1946 the commission of government passed 
               <br />
               the Convention Act, which was referred to 
               <br />
               this afternoon, and this national convention 
               <br />
               was in session for about a year. I believe the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister reported this afternoon that 
               <br />
               the convention senta delegation to London, to 
               <br />
               Ottawa and to Washington. My information 
               <br />
               was that a proposal was made to send a dele— 
               <br />
               gation to Washington to consider the question 
               <br />
               of linking up with the United States but that 
               <br />
               the proposal was defeated. Delegations went, 
               <br />
               however, to London and to Ottawa. While 
               <br />
               the delegation was in London, I am informed, 
               <br />
               the question of the type of plebiscite to be 
               <br />
               presented to the people was discussed with 
               <br />
               Lord Addison, who was then secretary of state 
               <br />
               for commonwealth affairs, and he was asked 
               <br />
               this question: If three forms of government 
               <br />
               were recommended to be put on the ballot by 
               <br />
               the convention, would all three go on? His 
               <br />
               reply was:

               His Majesty's government in the United Kingdom

               some members of the convention that the entry of

               Newfoundland into a confederation with Canada 
               <br />

               <br />
               His Majesty's government have come to the con-

               an impartial observer, I cannot see any good 
               <br />
               reason why the people of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               should not have had the ﬁrst opportunity to 
               <br />
               decide whether or not they wanted a continua- 
               <br />
               tion of the commission government or wanted 
               <br />
               to have responsible government. I refer to 
               <br />
               the large number, 71,334, who voted for 
               <br />
               responsible government as compared with 
               <br />
               78,323 who voted for confederation. I am well 
               <br />
               aware of the argument that in the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               referendum there was quite a small vote for 
               <br />
               the continuation of the commission govern- 
               <br />
               ment namely 22,311. But let me remind you, 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, that of those voting, the largest 
               <br />
               number voted for responsible government. 
               <br />
               There were 69,400 votes for responsible 
               <br />
               government and 64,066 for confederation. 
               <br />

               In the interval between the two votes, a 
               <br />
               great deal of propaganda was put out by 
               <br />
               those who wanted responsible government 
               <br />
