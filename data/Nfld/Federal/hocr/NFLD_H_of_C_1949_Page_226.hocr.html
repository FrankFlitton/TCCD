               The Minister of National Defence (Mr.

               Of the speeches in the debate on the motion

               larly impressed by the one made last evening 
               <br />

               his point with respect to the procedure by 
               <br />

               <br />

               would be adopted by their country in the

               choice was a fundamentally democratic and 
               <br />

               ernment in Newfoundland was announced in

               <br />
               1945. That policy can be brieﬂy summarized 
               <br />
               as follows: that the time had come when the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland were to be given 
               <br />
               the opportunity of deciding what form of 
               <br />
               government would be adopted in their coun— 
               <br />
               try in the future; that this question would be 
               <br />
               decided by a national referendum in which 
               <br />
               the people of Newfoundland would be given 
               <br />
               a free choice as to the form of government 
               <br />
               they desired to adopt, and that, preceding this 
               <br />
               national referendum, a national convention of 
               <br />
               elected delegates would be called together in 
               <br />
               order to permit of orderly discussion of the 
               <br />
               various types of government which might be 
               <br />
               suggested. This policy of the British govern-

               ment was duly promulgated in Newfoundland,

               convention under the policy laid down by the 
               <br />

               The ﬁrst business of the convention was to 
               <br />
               adopt and enact rules to govern its own 
               <br />
               procedure. This was done by an appointed 
               <br />
               committee which drafted a set of rules and 
               <br />
               brought them back to the convention for 
               <br />
               adoption. They were adopted unanimously. 
               <br />
               One of the rules which the convention adopted 
               <br />
               for itself by unanimous vote was that each 
               <br />
               member of the convention would have the 
               <br />
               right to make known to the British govern- 
               <br />
               ment his own personal recommendations as 
               <br />
               to the kinds of government which should go 
               <br />
               on the ballot, on the same basis as the decision 
               <br />
               of the whole convention, whether it was by 
               <br />
               a large majority or by a small one only. 
               <br />
               Therefore the convention decided for itself 
               <br />
               that each member had full rights to make 
               <br />
               recommendations on the same basis as the 
               <br />
               whole convention itself.

               It may be of interest to know that 130 
               <br />
               individuals were nominated to contest the 
               <br />
               election which was held to choose the mem-

               <br />
               having declared themselves to the electorate 
               <br />
               as to the kind of government which they 
               <br />
               favoured for Newfoundland. Two alone 
               <br />
               made public their opinions as to what the 
               <br />
               best form of government for Newfoundland 
               <br />
               in the future would be. One made it known 
               <br />
               to his people that he favoured confederation, 
               <br />
               and the other that he favoured the return of 
               <br />
               responsible government. I point this out to 
               <br />

               <br />
               who sent them there as to the kind of gov-
