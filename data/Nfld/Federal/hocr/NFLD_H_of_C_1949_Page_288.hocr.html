               a way to deal with this matter which does

               <br />
               Speaker, I was hoping that the remarks of the 
               <br />
               right hon. member for Glengarry (Mr. Mac— 
               <br />

               <br />
               a high tone and with unanimity; but I regret 
               <br />
               that we have now had a discussion, entirely 
               <br />
               out of order, dealing with matters which were 
               <br />
               voted upon and disposed of last evening. You 
               <br />
               know, there are some people who think of 
               <br />
               constitutions when it suits their convenience. 
               <br />
               There are constitutions that govern the rela- 
               <br />
               tionships of the various parts of a country; 
               <br />
               there are constitutions that govern bodies of 
               <br />
               men and women elected to public ofﬁce. We 
               <br />
               have in this house a constitution which lays 
               <br />
               down certain rules of procedure; and if we 
               <br />
               are going to respect constitutions generally I 
               <br />
               think all of us should set an example by 
               <br />
               observing the constitution of this house; for 
               <br />
               example is much better than precept.

               In the debate last night we disposed of 
               <br />
               certain aspects of the constitution. When the 
               <br />
               hon. leader of the opposition was. speaking, I 
               <br />
               was tempted to have something further to say 
               <br />
               about the attitude of the early fathers of 
               <br />
               confederation, and particularly Sir John A. 
               <br />
               Macdonald. Since that is not permitted by 
               <br />
               the rules of the house, I am not going to do 
               <br />
               so. I am not going to repeat what I said 
               <br />
               before about the entry of Newfoundland into 
               <br />
               confederation. It is a great event in our 
               <br />
               Canadian history. As the right hon. member 
               <br />
               for Glengarry (Mr. Mackenzie King) said a

               of the constitution that have been discussed 
               <br />

               tion those three particularly because I have 
               <br />
               been reading the newspapers. I have read 
               <br />
               that the allies of my hon. friends of the Con-

               servative party are undermining all three of 
               <br />
               those freedoms. Only this morning I read in 
               <br />
               my hon. friends’ newspaper, the Montreal 
               <br />
               Gazette, that the leader of L’Union Nationale, 
               <br />
               Mr. Duplessis, in the province of Quebec had 
               <br />
               advised retail merchants to exert pressure 
               <br />
               upon the newspapers to prevent a certain kind 
               <br />
               of publicity in that province. I say, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, that that kind of thing reinforces 
               <br />
               what the leader of the opposition said in 
               <br />
               1936, that there was a growing fascism in the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec. This undermining is 
               <br />
               done by the ally of my hon. friends.

               May I say, Mr. Speaker, that if we are 
               <br />
               going to build the kind of nation we wish 
               <br />
               Canada to be, then those problems that are 
               <br />
               of national importance can be dealt with 
               <br />
