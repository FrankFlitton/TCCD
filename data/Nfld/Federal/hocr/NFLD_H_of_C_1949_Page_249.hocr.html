               Take a quick glance at the record thus far. 
               <br />
               The government of the day has negotiated 
               <br />
               with representatives of Newfoundland an 
               <br />
               agreement under which Newfoundland will 
               <br />
               enter the Canadian confederation and become 
               <br />
               the tenth province. The government comes 
               <br />
               to this House of Commons and recommends 
               <br />
               that agreement. All last week we in this 
               <br />
               chamber debated the terms of union. 
               <br />
               Speeches were made by Conservatives as well 
               <br />
               as others; and without exception the right 
               <br />
               hand of Canadian brotherhood was extended 
               <br />
               to the people of Newfoundland. There was 
               <br />
               no indication last week that any of these 
               <br />
               expressions of good will were not genuine. 
               <br />
               The Tories seemed to be sincere. If they had 
               <br />
               a dagger for the agreement, they had it well 
               <br />
               hidden beneath their cloaks. Yes, it looked as 
               <br />
               if they wanted Newfoundland to come in. N 0 
               <br />
               person put forward any objection to the 
               <br />
               terms which were proposed and which were 
               <br />
               settled in this agreement. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               All that time, it was understood by every 
               <br />
               person that every step must be completed 
               <br />
               by March 31. March 31 was actually to be 
               <br />
               the date of Newfoundland’s crossing the 
               <br />
               threshold into the house of Canadian con- 
               <br />
               federation. On the basis of last week’s 
               <br />
               debate, not merely every person in this house 
               <br />
               but every person across Canada and every 
               <br />
               person in Newfoundland must have felt that 
               <br />
               the entry of Newfoundland into confedera- 
               <br />
               tion, on the terms which had been worked 
               <br />
               out in the agreement, was acceptable all 
               <br />
               round; indeed, that it was warmly welcomed 
               <br />
               by all parties and by practically every mem- 
               <br />
               ber in the house. It is important that all 
               <br />
               people should know that when the debate was 
               <br />
               going on last week, each member in this 
               <br />
               chamber, and every Tory who spoke, particu- 
               <br />
               larly the Tory leader, knew quite well what 
               <br />
               the next stage in these proceedings was to be.

               Mr. Speaker: Order. I will not stand for 
               <br />
               the reﬂection which has just been made by 
               <br />
               an hon. member to my left, if I understood 
               <br />
               him correctly. He said that I am tolerating 
               <br />
               something from one side of the house that I 
               <br />
               would not from the other. I would ask hon. 
               <br />
               members to be generous enough to listen to 
               <br />
               the hon. member who has the ﬂoor. Actually 
               <br />
               some hon. members have asked me to be very 
               <br />
               severe with the hon. member who has the 
               <br />
               ﬂoor. If I had been as severe yesterday as 
               <br />
               some members suggest I should be today I 
               <br />
               would have asked many hon. members to 
               <br />
               withdraw what they had said.
