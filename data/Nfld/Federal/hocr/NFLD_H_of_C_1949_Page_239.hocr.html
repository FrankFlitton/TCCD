               raised by the government’s resolution. Those 
               <br />
               questions appear to be twofold. I think every-

               <br />
               is another point, however, which is under

               debate, and it is set out in the resolution in

               That is the substance of the resolution. An 
               <br />
               amendment has been offered. I have not the 
               <br />
               difﬁculty in interpreting or understanding the

               clear language of the amendment that has 
               <br />
               troubled some hon. gentlemen opposite. That 
               <br />
               amendment suggests that before this resolu- 
               <br />
               tion is passed the provinces should be con-

               sulted. I ask you, Mr. Speaker, what the 
               <br />
               resolution means, because we have varying 
               <br />
               interpretations from the government. The 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice (Mr. Garson), supported 
               <br />
               by the Secretary of State for External Affairs 
               <br />
               (Mr. Pearson), contends that the resolution 
               <br />
               does not anticipate an amendment to the 
               <br />
               constitution. Well, if it does not a great many 
               <br />
               people, including the government of Great 
               <br />
               Britain, are labouring under a very serious 
               <br />
               misapprehension. I do not believe the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman who preceded me, the Secretary of 
               <br />
               State for External Affairs, will dispute the 
               <br />
               fact that the constitution was amended in 
               <br />
               1946 by a statute of the United Kingdom, 
               <br />
               which statute was enacted upon the prayer 
               <br />
               of this chamber and the other place. Is there 
               <br />
               any doubt that the constitution of Canada was 
               <br />
