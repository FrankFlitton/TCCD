               I do not intend to discuss the question

               whether confederation was a contract or a 
               <br />

               <br />
               reﬂection and on studying the remarks of 
               <br />
               speakers from the government side, and 
               <br />
               indeed from the C.C.F. party, it is obvious 
               <br />
               that many of them have missed the point. I 
               <br />
               refer particularly to the speeches of the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Rosetown-Biggar (Mr. Coldwell), 
               <br />
               the Minister of National Defence (Mr. Clax- 
               <br />
               ton), the Minister of Justice (Mr. Garson) and 
               <br />
               the Secretary of State for External Affairs 
               <br />
               (Mr. Pearson). The Minister of Justice made 
               <br />
               a great deal of what he said was the unfortun- 
               <br />
               ate necessity thrust upon him of having to 
               <br />
               deal with the obvious. He then proceeded to 
               <br />
               deal with the obvious. He dealt with mat- 
               <br />
               ters which were obvious to all hon. members 
               <br />
               in the house, and he dealt with them in an 
               <br />
               exceedingly obvious manner. But unfor- 
               <br />
               tunately he had missed the point, so while he 
               <br />
               did deal with what was obvious and dealt 
               <br />
               with it plainly and in a straightforward 
               <br />
               fashion, his remarks were not in fact a con-

               tribution to the point at issue.

               Brieﬂy, Mr. Speaker, the point at issue is 
               <br />
               this. The point of the amendment is not 
               <br />
               whether the present nine provinces should 
               <br />
               be consulted on the merit or otherwise of 
               <br />
               admitting Newfoundland into confederation. 
               <br />
               Rather it is whether they should be con- 
               <br />
               sulted on the very important and serious 
               <br />
               question, in which they have a direct interest, 
               <br />
               of the method and manner of amending the 
               <br />
               constitution. The question of admitting New- 
               <br />
               foundland into confederation, whether it is 
               <br />
               desirable and whether the terms are mutually 
               <br />
               advantageous, was settled, I take it, in the 
               <br />
               discussion which took place in this house last 
               <br />
               week. As the hon. member for Rosetown- 
               <br />
               Biggar himself pointed out, all parties then 
               <br />
               were in agreement that this was a desirable 
               <br />
               objective, and that generally speaking the 
               <br />
               terms were just and fair. But what we are 
               <br />
               discussing now is whether the procedure by 
               <br />
               means of which that objective is to be 
               <br />
               attained is something which can be supported 
               <br />
               and particularly whether it is something 
               <br />

               Last evening the Minister of Justice devoted 
               <br />
               the major portion of his remarks to the prop- 
               <br />
               osition, which he described as obvious, that 
               <br />
               the procedure followed here does not involve 
               <br />
               an amendment of the constitution. Inci- 
               <br />
               dentally, during his remarks the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice said the leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               should be congratulated because, as he put 
               <br />
               it, he had made the best of a bad job. That 
               <br />
               remark was not altogether generous, because 
               <br />
               after reading over what the minister himself 
               <br />
               said one cannot fail to be impressed by the 
               <br />
               fact that not only did he have a very bad job 
               <br />
               to deal with but that in fact he made a rather 
               <br />
               poor job of a bad job, which was a great 
               <br />
               contrast to the speaker to whom he was 
               <br />
               referring.

               I say that for this reason. The Minister of

               Justice, having stated it was obvious that no 
               <br />
               amendment of the constitution is involved 
               <br />
               here, then gave away his case when he 
               <br />
               pointed out—inadvertently, I presume—that 
               <br />
               in fact nothing more or less than an amend-

               has no legislative body and cannot pass an

               The constitution does not require assent from any
