               At this point may I interject that when I 
               <br />
               was premier of Ontario and was putting for— 
               <br />
               ward the position of my province, I did not 
               <br />
               refuse to deal with subsidies as part of the 
               <br />
               arrangement. I mention that because of cer- 
               <br />
               tain remarks made during the debate on the 
               <br />
               address prior to its adjournment last Friday 
               <br />
               evening. I would remind hon. members that 
               <br />
               the proposals I put forward at that time are 
               <br />
               a matter of record, and that we in fact pro- 
               <br />
               posed a system of subsidies on a basis which 
               <br />
               would adjust itself to the requirements of the 
               <br />
               provinces, with a national adjustment fund, 
               <br />
               which was the key recommendation of the 
               <br />
               Rowell-Sirois report. We stated that we 
               <br />
               wished to enter into arrangements of that 
               <br />
               kind under a transitional agreement which 
               <br />
               would also provide for an examination of the 
               <br />
               whole combined taxing system of Canada by 
               <br />
               competent experts of all the governments and 
               <br />
               other experts who would be brought in to 
               <br />
               examine this extremely important subject. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               We pointed out that there is only one group 
               <br />
               of taxpayers in Canada, who pay taxes to 
               <br />
               the dominion government, the provincial gov- 
               <br />
               ernments and the municipal councils. We 
               <br />
               pointed out that there is no magic by means 
               <br />
               of which money can be drawn from any 
               <br />
               obscure source. There is no question of 
               <br />
               generosity on the part of the dominion gov- 
               <br />
               ernment involved in any of these proposals or, 
               <br />
               if one chooses to use the term preferred by 
               <br />
               the minister of reconstruction (Mr. Winters), 
               <br />
               no question of beneﬁcence. There is nothing 
               <br />
               of that kind. The dominion government is 
               <br />
               merely the collecting body which draws from 
               <br />
               the people of Canada taxes for the purpose of 
               <br />
               undertaking certain responsibilities. If the 
               <br />
               dominion government requires more money 
               <br />
               for the purpose of making payments back to 
               <br />
               the provinces, the money comes from the very 
               <br />
               same people; it comes from the taxpayers of 
               <br />
               Canada as a whole. -

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               What we recommended then, and what I 
               <br />
               still recommend, is that there be an examina- 
               <br />
               tion of our whole taxing system so that the 
               <br />
               taxes required by the dominion government, 
               <br />
               the provincial governments and the munici— 
               <br />
               palities may be adequate for the responsibi- 
               <br />
               lities they are called upon to assume. In 
               <br />
               this way we may be enabled to establish in 
               <br />
               Canada the most scientiﬁc tax system possible, 
               <br />
               adjusted to meet the modern conditions in 
               <br />
               which we live, so that the taxes called for 
               <br />
               by these three levels of government may be 
               <br />
               imposed upon the people of Canada in a way 
               <br />
               that will place a less onerous burden upon 
               <br />
               them and place the least possible restriction 
               <br />
               upon personal effort and upon production 
               <br />

               I think it is appropriate that I should recall

               recommended. I also refer to that proposal 
               <br />
               because it has a very direct bearing on the 
               <br />

               <br />
               ment between Canada and Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               The representatives of Newfoundland have 
               <br />
               accepted terms similar to those which were 
               <br />
               placed before the provinces of Canada in 
               <br />
               this house in 1946. This restriction has, of 
               <br />
               course, been placed upon Newfoundland that 
               <br />
               they cannot apply for an adjustment in 
               <br />
               consequence of a subsequent adjustment with 
               <br />
               any other province. I suggest, Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               there is a particular reason for that restric-

               This agreement also does something that 
               <br />
               I recommended, and recommended very 
               <br />
               strongly as premier of Ontario at these 
               <br />
               dominion-provincial conferences. I urged 
               <br />
               that, in addition to the taxing systems we 
               <br />
               proposed and the subsidy payment provided 
               <br />
               by a transitional agreement, there be also 
               <br />
               an immediate recognition of the recommenda- 
               <br />
               tions in the Rowell-Sirois report that a 
               <br />
               national adjustment fund be set up. We 
               <br />
               urged that such a fund be set up on a basis 
               <br />
               very much higher, however, than that recom- 
               <br />
               mended in the Rowell—Sirois report. This 
               <br />
               would enable those provinces still needing 
               <br />
               additional ﬁnancial support, over and above 
               <br />
               the ordinary subsidy payments during the 
               <br />
               transitional period, to obtain funds from this 
               <br />
               national adjustment fund. Perhaps I should 
               <br />
               interject that it is a matter of record that 
               <br />
               I also said I was prepared to agree to any 
               <br />
               form of distribution of that fund, which was 
               <br />
               acceptable to those provinces receiving contri— 
               <br />
               butions from it. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I mention that for this reason. In the 
               <br />
               draft agreement with Newfoundland the 
               <br />
               principle of grants in aid, recommended by 
               <br />
               the Rowell-Sirois commission, is recognized. 
               <br />
               Over and above the ordinary subsidy pay- 
               <br />
               ments, there are substantial grants in aid 
               <br />
               which are related to the recognition of special 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial requirements. I ﬁnd it difﬁcult to 
               <br />
               believe it was not in the mind of the dominion 
               <br />
               government that, when this new province 
               <br />
               shall receive these special grants, there may 
               <br />
               well be demands from those provinces that 
               <br />
               have accepted these unsatisfactory terms. 
               <br />
               In some cases the provinces are not satisﬁed 
               <br />
               and there may well be a demand from them 
               <br />
               that they receive similar consideration. It 
               <br />
               would look as though the dominion govern- 
               <br />
               ment had decided that this type of horse 
               <br />
               trading would have to stop some place. 
               <br />
               Therefore they decided, after further negotia- 
               <br />
               tions, that they would say to Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               at that point it stops; you cannot claim any 
               <br />
               more.
