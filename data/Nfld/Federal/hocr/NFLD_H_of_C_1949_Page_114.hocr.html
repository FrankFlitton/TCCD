               Mr. Probe: Referring to this deﬁcit, which 
               <br />
               is estimated variously as running from $23 
               <br />
               million to $35 million annually, as of this 
               <br />
               year, would the minister indicate what the 
               <br />
               position will be in ﬁve, ten or ﬁfteen years. 
               <br />
               Some of these are non-recurring debts and 
               <br />
               expenditures as of this or next year. This 
               <br />
               ﬁgure, whatever it may be, of the present 
               <br />
               deﬁcit, will be sharply or gradually reduced 
               <br />
               to what ﬁgure in what time?

               Mr. Abbott: As I have often had occasion 
               <br />
               to say in the house, I claim no gift as a 
               <br />
               prophet; and anyone who could attempt to 
               <br />
               forecast what the revenues and expenditures 
               <br />
               of a province or of the dominion would be 
               <br />
               years ahead is a worker of miracles. It is 
               <br />
               absolutely impossible to make anything but 
               <br />
               a wild guess. But if one assumes that New- 
               <br />
               foundland develops and occupies a full place 
               <br />
               in the Canadian economy, I think it is fair 
               <br />
               to assume that its revenues will expand; and 
               <br />
               my experience as Minister of Finance has 
               <br />
               been that expenditures will also expand.

               Mr. Abbott: I should think that is bound 
               <br />
               to happen. Such matters as veterans affairs 
               <br />
               payments and transitional grants are both 
               <br />
               diminishing items. But I wish to take this 
               <br />
               occasion to say that I am never one who looks 
               <br />
               on the balance sheet of a Canadian province, 
               <br />
               the revenue from that province, or the federal 
               <br />
               disbursements in the province as a fair test 
               <br />
               of the contribution the province makes. We 
               <br />
               have “have” provinces in this country, and 
               <br />
               certain provinces which do not collect as 
               <br />
               much revenue. I am not one who accepts 
               <br />
               that as a criterion of the place that province

               Mr. Probe: In section 23 it is stated that 
               <br />
               Canada will assume certain debts of the

               <br />
               some of the remarks made by the minister. 
               <br />
               I do not think we should split hairs, or be too 
               <br />
               much alarmed by a consideration of what 
               <br />
               Canada is going to get at the present time or

               <br />
               not had the opportunity it should have had. 
               <br />
               I have made an exhaustive survey of the 
               <br />
               facts, and I am convinced that it can do much 
               <br />
               better than it has done. I believe we have

               nothing to fear in that regard.

               The railway has been mentioned. The ﬁrst 
               <br />
               thing I would suggest to the minister and the 
               <br />
               government would be a plan for reservicing 
               <br />
               the railway for standard-gauge cars. It is a 
               <br />
               narrow-gauge line, and much more time is 
               <br />
               required to go from Port aux Basques to St. 
               <br />
               John’s than should be required. The faster 
               <br />
               the trains could cover that distance, the more 
               <br />
               money would be made by the railway. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Therefore that is one of the ﬁrst suggestions 
               <br />
               I would make, namely that it be made a 
               <br />
               standard—gauge line. Then I would suggest 
               <br />
               further equipment for the port of Port aux 
               <br />
               Basques so that larger ships, capable of 
               <br />
               carrying cars, could be unloaded quickly and 
               <br />
               reloaded rapidly at Port aux Basques. I can 
               <br />
               see myself at some time in the future board- 
               <br />
               ing a train at Toronto, one properly equipped 
               <br />
               and having proper sleeping accommodation, 
               <br />
               and remaining on that train until I reached 
               <br />
               St. J ohn’s, Newfoundland. I do not see how 
               <br />
               the railway can be made to pay unless it is 
               <br />
               equipped so that people can travel on it in 
               <br />
               modern equipment. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               It will take a few years to have that done; 
               <br />
               but the sooner it is done the sooner that rail- 
               <br />
               way will be able to produce a revenue. At 
               <br />
               the present time the passenger trafﬁc on it is 
               <br />
               not as heavy as it should be. I have found 
               <br />
               the general service satisfactory, although the 
               <br />
               sleeping accommodation was a little cramped 
               <br />
               for me. However, a modern car would 
               <br />
               eliminate that difficulty. I found the meals 
               <br />
               quite satisfactory.
