               policy of the government is to encourage and 
               <br />
               assist its national <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ports</span> to the fullest extent, 
               <br />
               further, to use the facilities of our national 
               <br />
               ports to the maximum and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘to</span> increase those 
               <br />
               facilities when required. In evidence of this 
               <br />
               the government has spent from 1936 to 1946, 
               <br />
               for capital <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> reconstruction of our national 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nports,</span> approximately $18,000,000. This year’s 
               <br />
               estimate for the port of Saint John contains 
               <br />
               initial appropriations <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> will mean eventual 
               <br />
               expenditure within a year or two of approxi- 
               <br />
               mately $3,000,000. National harbours board 
               <br />
               informs me surveys are under way for further 
               <br />
               expansion. All of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> is an indication that 
               <br />
               government has very much in mind the develop-
