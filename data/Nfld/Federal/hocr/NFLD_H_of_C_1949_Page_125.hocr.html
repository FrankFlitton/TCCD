               Mr. St. Laurent: I listened as attentively as 
               <br />
               I could to the hon. member’s questions, and 
               <br />
               they are quite involved. I should like to 
               <br />
               be as accurate as possible in giving an answer, 
               <br />
               and I think it will be necessary for me to 
               <br />
               see and consider the context of his questions 
               <br />
               in order that I may supplement what I am 
               <br />
               prepared to say at this moment. I think the 
               <br />
               hon. member is under a false impression if 
               <br />
               he feels that any agreement was made in 
               <br />
               1947 between the applicants for a railway 
               <br />
               charter and the government of Canada. There 
               <br />
               was no such agreement. In conformity with 
               <br />
               the requirements of the constitution, and the 
               <br />
               requirements of the Railway Act, persons 
               <br />
               wanting to construct a railway connecting 
               <br />
               any part of Canada with another country, 
               <br />
               or which would be interprovincial, have to 
               <br />
               get a charter from this parliament. The char- 
               <br />
               ter they obtain from parliament does not 
               <br />
               give them rights in any property. It merely 
               <br />
               gives them the capacity to exercise the pow- 
               <br />
               ers of a railway company in accordance with 
               <br />
               the Railway Act. In 1947, when these appli- 
               <br />
               cants were given a railway charter, it was 
               <br />
               expressly provided that, although they would 
               <br />
               have the capacity to operate a railway out- 
               <br />
               side Canada, we were not giving them the 
               <br />
               right to operate one. We were just creating 
               <br />
               them as a corporation which would have the 
               <br />
               capacity to operate a railway in Newfound- 
               <br />
               land territory if it secured permission from 
               <br />
               Newfoundland to do so. We could not give 
               <br />
               them any rights in Newfoundland territory, 
               <br />
               but we could give them the capacity of a 
               <br />
               corporate body which might receive from 
               <br />
               the government of Newfoundland the right 
               <br />
               and privilege of operating a railway there.

               <br />
               have made with any company, and to provide 
               <br />
               that it will not be required in making a tax

               agreement to impose taxes upon corporations 
               <br />
               with whom it may have an agreement not to 
               <br />
               do so. The hon. member will remember that, 
               <br />
               in the tax agreements with them, the Canadian 
               <br />
               provinces were required to impose a ﬁve per 
               <br />
               cent tax on the income of corporations derived 
               <br />
               from business transacted within their limits. 
               <br />
               The Newfoundland delegation said, “We have 
               <br />
               certain agreements whereby we have com- 
               <br />
               muted the taxes of commercial corporations.” 
               <br />
               They said that they did not want to enter into 
               <br />
               an agreement that would require them to 
               <br />
               commit a breach of any previous agreement. 
               <br />
               Subsection 4 of section 27 was put in for that 
               <br />
               purpose, but it was not contemplated in any 
               <br />
               way that it would apply to running rights 
               <br />
               that may have been granted by the govern-

               ment of Newfoundland, over territory of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, to this railway company that 
               <br />
               was incorporated by parliament in 1947.

               the report of meetings between the two dele-
