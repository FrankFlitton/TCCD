               It is well known in this house and by the

               British North America Act of 1867 looking to 
               <br />
               the union of Newfoundland with Canada and

               and in fact for many years afterwards, to 
               <br />
               bring about that union—a procedure similar

               <br />
               proof that those who had participated in the

               ultimate destiny of the people of Newfound—

               able, another procedure had to be resorted 
               <br />
               to. The precedent which had been set when 
               <br />
               the parliament of Canada decided to hand

               Newfoundland. While under the Statute of 
               <br />
               Westminster this parliament has equal rights 
               <br />
               with the parliament of the United Kingdom 
               <br />
               to enact legislation having extraterritorial 
               <br />
               effect, it would not have been proper for 
               <br />
               this parliament, by legislation of its own, to 
               <br />
               attempt to bring within its jurisdiction terri- 
               <br />
               tory now under the legislative jurisdiction of 
               <br />
               the parliament of the United Kingdom.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               There is a second reason why procedure 
               <br />
               not expressly provided for in the British 
               <br />
               North America Act was resorted to. If that 
               <br />
               procedure had been followed there might 
               <br />
               have been some question as to its legal effect. 
               <br />
               I am sure that the last thing anyone in 
               <br />
               Canada or Newfoundland would desire would 
               <br />
               be any possible doubt as to the legal effect 
               <br />
               of the terms of union as agreed to and 
               <br />
               conﬁrmed.
