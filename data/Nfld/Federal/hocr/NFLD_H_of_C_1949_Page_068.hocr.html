               In a .radio address reported in the Daily

               Last night, I asked about the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span>

               of the lower courts expressed the opinion that 
               <br />
               nothing like it had been done since the time

               <br />

               <br />
               Naboth compensation for it. Of all the judges 
               <br />
               in England, there was only one county court 
               <br />
               judge who questioned these rules and regu- 
               <br />

               like to mention, and with that I shall con- 
               <br />
               clude. This matter came up in connection 
               <br />
               with the nationalization of a very important 
               <br />
               industry in Great Britain. A billion dollars 
               <br />
               of paper money was issued. It is turned out 
               <br />
               by printing presses and adds nothing to the 
               <br />
               national wealth of the country. After depre- 
               <br />
               ciating a person’s investment, the govern- 
               <br />
               ment compels him to take that particular 
               <br />
               type of money. What chance have the people 
               <br />
               in the law courts when the judges over there 
               <br />
               do not act?

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The other matter about which I wanted to 
               <br />
               speak was with regard to patents and inven- 
               <br />
               tions. The law regarding patents and 
               <br />
               inventions mentions a seal. The law is set 
               <br />
               out in the 15th chapter of Genesis, verses 
               <br />
               5 to 18. God made a covenant with Abraham. 
               <br />
               That was the authorship of that seal. What 
               <br />
               did the inventors get? They have been inter- 
               <br />
               fered with; something has been written into 
               <br />
               the law which should not have been put in. 
               <br />
               The patentees have been interfered with. 
               <br />
               The patentee was to get all the rights and 
               <br />
               privileges under the patent. Every patent 
               <br />
               had been granted by the king and the 
               <br />
               crown to the patentee. It is issued by the 
               <br />
               crown under the royal seal which goes with 
               <br />
               this patent or trade-mark, the patentee to 
               <br />
               have and enjoy the whole proﬁt and advan- 
               <br />
               tage from time to time accruing by reason of 
               <br />
               the said invention during the time of sixteen 
               <br />
               years. What is being done? Inventors are 
               <br />
               being driven out of Great Britain, and here 
               <br />
               in Canada they are being driven to the 
               <br />
               United States by the same factors, by the 
               <br />
               control system, income tax and surtax up to
