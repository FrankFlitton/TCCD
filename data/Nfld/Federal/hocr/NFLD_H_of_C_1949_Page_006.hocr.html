               <br />
               yesterday it would be unusual to require him 
               <br />
               to deal with it today, if he still feels that

               <br />
               Votes and Proceedings for yesterday was 
               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. Speaker: I must say to the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man that I shall look into the matter.

               Mr. St. Laurent: I can give an answer to 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition right away. As. 
               <br />
               I announced in the house yesterday afternoon, 
               <br />
               I gave notice of this motion, which is the last 
               <br />
               item on the Votes and Proceedings that the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman has just read, and when I got 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst issue of Votes and Proceedings this. 
               <br />
               morning I was surprised to ﬁnd it was not 
               <br />
               there. I communicated with the Clerk of the 
               <br />
               House, who veriﬁed the fact that he had it, 
               <br />
               but through some omission it had not gone 
               <br />
               to the printer. He told me that it was not 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst time that there had been an over- 
               <br />
               sight of this kind, and that he would see that 
               <br />
               the printer had the Votes and Proceedings- 
               <br />
               completed in time for the sitting this after- 
               <br />
               noon. 
               <br />

               I think I might take this opportunity to say 
               <br />
               that I have had representations from hon. 
               <br />
               members on both sides of the house, who, in 
               <br />
               spite of their realization of the urgency of 
               <br />
               proceeding with the Newfoundland terms of 
               <br />
               union so that we may have them dealt with 
               <br />
               by this parliament and subsequently by the 
               <br />
               parliament of the United Kingdom before 
               <br />
               March 31, feel they would like to have all 
               <br />
               next week devoted to the debate on the 
               <br />
               address. When this motion is called tomorrow,
