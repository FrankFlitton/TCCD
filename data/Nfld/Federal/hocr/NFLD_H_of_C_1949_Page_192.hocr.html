               In this connection I should like to draw the 
               <br />
               attention of the house to some of the conse- 
               <br />
               quences which might follow if the amendment 
               <br />
               of the leader of the opposition were adopted. 
               <br />
               What he has suggested is that this matter 
               <br />
               should be referred to the provinces. He said, 
               <br />
               if I recall correctly, that it would not hold 
               <br />
               up the consideration of this legislation by 
               <br />

               <br />
               I suggest that consultation would not be the 
               <br />
               serious step which any consultation of provin- 
               <br />
               ces must be—not only a matter of form—so 
               <br />
               that they might have the opportunity of 
               <br />
               voicing their views.

               Where would we be if we made that refer-

               ence today? What would happen if, for 
               <br />
               example, there were any authority whatever 
               <br />
               for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Views</span> expressed by the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Peace River (Mr. Low) that a two—thirds 
               <br />
               vote of the provinces should govern in the 
               <br />
               matter? That is an interesting suggestion; 
               <br />
               but there is no constitutional basis for it, I 
               <br />
               submit. And what Would happen if two- 
               <br />
               thirds of the provinces, let us say seven prov- 
               <br />
               inces, which expressed their opinion in favour 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland entering confederation, 
               <br />
               included all the provinces except, let us say, 
               <br />
               Ontario and Quebec? There is no authority 
               <br />
               anywhere, and no precedent, for the exercise 
               <br />
               of a vote; yet if consultation means anything 
               <br />
               it must give the provinces an opportunity not 
               <br />
               only to exercise their views, but also to make 
               <br />
               their will felt in some way or another.

               The speech of the leader of the opposition

               faces us with this situation. We have had a

               debate lasting a week on the terms under 
               <br />

               agreement of hon. members opposite in every

               did and do not hear them. We debated

               this matter for a week; we discussed all

               <br />
               the leader of the opposition was not raised at

               <br />
               since 1864 and before that. It has been 
               <br />
               worked for by a long line of statesmen, our
