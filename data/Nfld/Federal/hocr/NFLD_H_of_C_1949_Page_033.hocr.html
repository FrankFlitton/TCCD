               Newfoundland has a great and unique

               history. It was the ﬁrst part of the area of

               North America to be discovered. While other 
               <br />

               <br />
               the newly discovered Americas, John Cabot, 
               <br />
               who discovered the island in 1497, carried 
               <br />
               back to England and to Europe, not tales of 
               <br />
               gold but tales of immense shoals of ﬁsh off 
               <br />
               the Newfoundland banks, which revealed a 
               <br />
               new form of wealth. That wealth challenged 
               <br />
               the adventurous of those days, and it has con- 
               <br />

               have settled and built Newfoundland during

               of people whose paths cross at Gander or at 
               <br />
               Goose Bay. I recall seeing only a few months 
               <br />
               ago, at the great airport of Gander, one plane 
               <br />
               which had just arrived from India on its way 
               <br />
               to New York and another from New York 
               <br />
               putting down just afterwards on its way to 
               <br />
               the Mediterranean. There were also passen— 
               <br />
               gers who were already there from planes 
               <br />
               moving both ways between Britain and the 
               <br />
               United States and between Britain and

               Canada, and also between this continent and 
               <br />
               France and Italy. It is one of the most

               challenging pictures of the immense changes 
               <br />
               which have taken place within these past few

               Mining also has long been an important

               In two world wars the people of New-

               foundland wrote some of the greatest pages 
               <br />
               in their long island history, and I should 
               <br />
               like to refer to that contribution because it 
               <br />
               has a direct bearing on the subject we have 
               <br />
               under consideration today. In 1914 New- 
               <br />
               foundland had the distinction of being the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst of the dominions to commit itself to 
               <br />
               that vast struggle for freedom which ultim- 
               <br />
               ately enveloped the whole world. On August 
               <br />
               4, the very day on which war was declared, 
               <br />
               Newfoundlanders who had voluntarily joined 
               <br />
               the royal naval reserve were called to the 
               <br />
               colours. On August 7, only three days after the 
               <br />
               outbreak of war, the Legion of Frontiersmen, 
               <br />
               the only military unit then organized in New- 
               <br />
               foundland, volunteered for overseas service; 
               <br />
               and that unit became the base of a wider 
               <br />
               enlistment which ultimately took the form of 
               <br />
               the Royal Newfoundland regiment. On Octo- 
               <br />
               ber 4, 1914—a day that will be recalled by 
               <br />
               many hon. members of this house—the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               Newfoundland contingent sailed on the 5.5. 
               <br />
               Florizel from St. John’s to join the ﬁrst con- 
               <br />
               tingent of the Canadian expeditionary force 
               <br />
               off the island of St. Pierre. I happen to know 
               <br />
               that there are in this chamber those who will 
               <br />

               <br />
               the 5.5. Florizel joined the other ships which 
               <br />
               were then lying at anchor. On arrival in 
               <br />
               England the Newfoundland contingent was 
               <br />

               In August, 1915, the Royal Newfoundland 
               <br />
               regiment, as it had then become, sailed from 
               <br />

               <br />
               it took part in the terriﬁc battles which fol- 
               <br />
               lowed at that time, when we who were then 
               <br />
               opposed to them learned to respect the ﬁght-

               After the historic evacuation of Gallipoli, this

               <br />
               July 1, 1916, fought at Beaumont Hamel in 
               <br />
