               Mr. Brooks: I assume that the minister will 
               <br />
               explain this section. Certain parts are not 
               <br />
               clear, and certain questions might be 
               <br />
               answered. Reference is made to hospitaliza- 
               <br />
               tion. The committee would like to know, for 
               <br />
               instance, what hospitals there are in New- 
               <br />
               foundland at the present time for the accom- 
               <br />
               modation of veterans; the number of pension- 
               <br />
               ers in the island; and the probable number of 
               <br />
               those who might be eligible for the war vet— 
               <br />
               erans allowance. The section says that the 
               <br />
               Veterans’ Land Act, the Unemployment Insur- 
               <br />
               ance Act, the Veterans Business and Profes- 
               <br />
               sional Loans Act, and the Veterans Insurance 
               <br />
               Act will be extended to Newfoundland veter- 
               <br />
               ans who served in the second world war. As 
               <br />
               to the Veterans’ Land Act, of course, I do not 
               <br />
               think there is any time limit within which 
               <br />
               veterans need to make application, but I am 
               <br />
               not sure about that. Under the Veterans 
               <br />
               Business and Professional Loans Act applica- 
               <br />
               tion in Canada must be made within ﬁve 
               <br />
               years. If we use the same act, I think it will 
               <br />
               have to be amended in some way so that the 
               <br />
               veterans in Newfoundland can make applica- 
               <br />
               tion within the necessary time. Section 38 
               <br />
               says: 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               A re-establishment credit will be made available 
               <br />
               to Newfoundland veterans who served in the second 
               <br />
               world war . . . 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               That does not present much of a problem 
               <br />
               because under our act any veteran can apply 
               <br />
               for his re-establishment credit within ten 
               <br />
               years from the date of his discharge from 
               <br />
               the army. Since there are a number of years 
               <br />
               to run, the veterans of Newfoundland will 
               <br />
               have an opportunity to make application for 
               <br />
               this credit. I come next to the War Service 
               <br />
               Grants Act. I believe there is a time limit in 
               <br />
               which application must be made for the 
               <br />
               beneﬁts under that act. Perhaps the minister 
               <br />

               <br />
               ested in knowing what beneﬁts were given to
