               I take it that once union becomes a fact 
               <br />
               there will be no delay in the appointment of 
               <br />
               the six senators. Patents can be issued, and 
               <br />
               they can take their places in the Senate very

               quickly. But I am concerned about the tirne 
               <br />
               within which Newfoundland will obtain 
               <br />
               representation in the House of Commons, 
               <br />

               representatives. In the terms of union there 
               <br />
               is no time limit within which this election is 
               <br />
               to take place. I mention that fact because 
               <br />
               there is an interesting comparison in article

               <br />
               to raise is somewhat different. Not long ago 
               <br />
               we amended the British North America Act, 
               <br />
               and the representation in parliament was 
               <br />
               ﬁxed at 255. This amendment was brought 
               <br />
               about by an address 'to His Majesty. As I 
               <br />
               read this section, the number of members of 
               <br />
               parliament is now to be increased by seven. 
               <br />
               Therefore this will be contrary to the provis- 
               <br />
               ions of the British North America Act. Is it.

               <br />
               the representation, or will the British legisla-

               Mr. Jaenicke: I should like to ask the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister whether the procedure he out- 
               <br />
               lined would not be a departure from the 
               <br />
               established precedent concerning the manner 
               <br />
               in which the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">British»</span> North America Act is 
               <br />
               amended? In my opinion it can only be done 
               <br />
               by an address to His Majesty, and the parlia- 
               <br />
               ment of the United Kingdom would have to 
               <br />
               pass a special act in order to amend the 
               <br />
               British North America Act, or to change the 
               <br />
               representation in the House of Commons.
