               Mr. Stanley Knowles (Winnipeg <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North“:</span> 
               <br />
               Centre): The Prime Minister indicated that 
               <br />
               one of his aims was to avoid a debate on pro- 
               <br />
               cedure today, but it must be apparent to him’ 
               <br />
               that he has made the very move which is 
               <br />
               likely to produce a prolonged debate. Yet I 
               <br />
               suggest it is still possible to avoid a pro- 
               <br />
               cedural debate today if he will accept the. 
               <br />
               suggestion made by the leader of the opposi- 
               <br />
               tion (Mr. Drew) and the leader of this group. 
               <br />
               All he has to do is to withdraw the motion- 
               <br />
               he has made and make the motion that has 
               <br />
               been made on almost every occasion, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">namely,</span> 
               <br />
               that the debate on the address begin tomor— 
               <br />
               row and have precedence until it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con-‘</span> 
               <br />
               cluded. As the leader of the opposition has 
               <br />
               said, he can then give notice that on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Friday</span> 
               <br />
               it is his intention to move a motion to the 
               <br />
               effect that notwithstanding the order <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">01:</span> 
               <br />
               January 26 such and such shall be the case..- 
               <br />
               I would point out that not only was this done 
               <br />
               in that manner last year, but in many sessions 
               <br />
               the debate on the address has proceeded for a 
               <br />
               considerable period of time and has then been 
               <br />
               interrupted by a subsequent motion. I would 
               <br />
               suggest that the Prime Minister should make 
               <br />
               the usual motion. If he will accept that sug- 
               <br />
               gestion he will avoid a debate today.
