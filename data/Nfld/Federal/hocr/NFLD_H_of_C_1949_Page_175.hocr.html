               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, I wish to announce that Mr. 
               <br />
               Sam Carr is now in custody in Ottawa and 
               <br />
               will be brought before a magistrate in this 
               <br />
               city tomorrow. He will probably be remanded 
               <br />
               for one week. In anticipation of Mr. Carr’s 
               <br />
               return we had retained Mr. John Cartwright, 
               <br />
               K.C., of Toronto to act as government counsel 
               <br />
               in this case. The charge with which we 
               <br />
               propose to proceed is that of conspiracy to 
               <br />
               commit forgery. This is under section 573 of 
               <br />
               the Criminal Code, and carries a maximum 
               <br />
               sentence of seven years. The alleged offence 
               <br />
               occurred in connection with the renewal of 
               <br />
               a Canadian passport issued to one Witczak 
               <br />

               <br />
               Speaker, I shall not delay for more than a 
               <br />
               few moments the passage of this important 
               <br />
               and historic bill. I am fairly familiar with 
               <br />
               that magniﬁcent island which is to be our 
               <br />
               tenth province; yet I feel that I should speak 
               <br />
               very brieﬂy. Newfoundland was represented 
               <br />
               at the Quebec conference of 1864, when the 
               <br />
               four provinces of Canada, Ontario, Quebec, 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia and New Brunswick—decided to 
               <br />
               enter confederation. I often recall the words 
               <br />
               of Sir Ambrose Shea, who was one of the two 
               <br />
               Newfoundland representatives. So far as 
               <br />
               they were concerned they were satisﬁed with 
               <br />
               the proposals and would have joined the con- 
               <br />
               federation, but did not have the authority to 
               <br />
               do so at that time. Ever since 1864, well- 
               <br />
               wishers of confederation, both in Newfound- 
               <br />
               land and in Canada, have looked forward to 
               <br />
               this day. I am sure we are all happy indeed 
               <br />
               at the prospect that lies before us. I will not 
               <br />
               repeat the exact words of Sir Ambrose Shea, 
               <br />
               but he said that, looking into the future, he 
               <br />
               could hardly describe the great vista that 
               <br />
               opened before him, in the realization of what 
               <br />
               confederation would mean to his province 
               <br />
               and to Canada. 
               <br />

               Confederation has turned out to be some-

               <br />

               time British Columbia was not a part of 
               <br />
               Canada, nor were the three western provinces.

               If Sir Ambrose could have foreseen the 
               <br />
               Canada of today, of which Newfoundland will 
               <br />
               be the tenth province, he would have seen 
               <br />
               that we have one river, the Mackenzie, with 
               <br />
               the largest basin, all in the same country, on 
               <br />
               the whole continent of North America. Some 
               <br />
               will say at once that I am forgetting the 
               <br />
               Mississippi, but the basin of the Mississippi 
               <br />
               is not all in the United States; part of it is 
               <br />
               in Alberta and part of it is in Saskatchewan. 
               <br />
               The Mackenzie river is wholly in Canada. _
