               fact that ﬁrst it was the British government 
               <br />
               which decided to put the question as to 
               <br />
               whether they wished to enter confederation 
               <br />
               on the plebiscite which was put before the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland; and, secondly, that 
               <br />
               at the time, when a majority of the people 
               <br />
               answered yes, they had these terms before 
               <br />
               them, and those terms had been explained by 
               <br />
               representatives of the people, including the 
               <br />
               members of the convention who had sent 
               <br />
               representatives to discuss the terms here.

               That having been done, I submit this gov-

               ernment had no choice but to proceed to meet 
               <br />
               the representatives of the government of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. Once there was a plebiscite 
               <br />
               on whether or not Newfoundland should enter 
               <br />
               confederation, once the people with the terms 
               <br />
               before them had decided in favour of enter- 
               <br />
               ing confederation, then this government could 
               <br />
               not do other than express its willingness to 
               <br />
               entertain negotiations and to discuss the terms 
               <br />
               of union with the representatives of the New- 
               <br />
               foundland government. It really is as simple 
               <br />
               as that. Once the British government had 
               <br />
               allowed the question of joining confederation 
               <br />
               to be put before the people, then this gov- 
               <br />
               ernment had no choice whatsoever in the sub- 
               <br />
               sequent course it followed. In consequence, 
               <br />
               the government of Newfoundland, acting 
               <br />
               through the commission of government, 
               <br />
               appointed the seven gentlemen, whose names 
               <br />
               were given by the Prime Minister (Mr. St. 
               <br />
               Laurent), to come here to enter into negotia-

               <br />
               like to tell the house something of the course 
               <br />
               of those negotiations. We recognize that this 
               <br />
               is an historic occasion, and it may be useful 
               <br />
               for our own people, yes, and perhaps for

               Hansa'rd as to the way in which negotiations 
               <br />
               were carried on. As a member of the cabinet

               committee, I had something to do with those

               negotiations and as deputy chairman, when 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister could not attend, it was 
               <br />
               my responsibility to preside at the conference, 
               <br />
               and to do a good deal of the work of pre-

               paration and discussion at all stages.

               Mr. Claxion: The conference began to 
               <br />
               meet on the 6th of October of last year, and 
               <br />
               was continuously in session until the terms 
               <br />
               of union were settled. The conference had 
               <br />
               its ﬁnal plenary session in the Senate cham- 
               <br />
               ber, as it did its opening session, on the 11th 
               <br />
               December. Thus some two months were 
               <br />
               occupied in arriving at the terms. In addition 
               <br />
               to the plenary sessions of the conference, a 
               <br />
               number of subcommittees were set up. They 
               <br />
               are enumerated on page 81 of the report and 
               <br />
               documents which the Secretary of State for 
               <br />
               External Affairs (Mr. Pearson) tabled today. 
               <br />
               They included subcommittees on drafting, 
               <br />
               finance, ﬁsheries, transport and veterans 
               <br />
               affairs, which met in practically continuous 
               <br />
               session from the beginning to the end.

               ing a submission to the parliament at West- 
               <br />
               minster. Altogether the subcommittee on 
               <br />
               drafting produced not less than fourteen 
               <br />
               drafts of the terms of union after they had 
               <br />
               begun to be submitted to the plenary confer- 
               <br />
               ence, and also a number before. This work, 
               <br />
               as I say, continued night and day throughout 
               <br />
