               for asking for an interruption than it has had 
               <br />
               on any other occasion I can remember. When 
               <br />
               we ﬁrst saw the request made by the govem- 
               <br />
               ment we felt, particularly in view of the 
               <br />
               experience of last year, that we should hesi- 
               <br />
               tate and consider carefully whether we should 
               <br />
               consent to such an interruption. From time 
               <br />
               to time, however, it is necessary that those 
               <br />
               of us who are in opposition should view mat- 
               <br />
               ters of government convenience, particularly 
               <br />
               when they involve courtesy to another parlia- 
               <br />
               ment, in a broad way. I repeat that we have 
               <br />
               decided to support this amended resolution. 
               <br />

               I would remind hon. members that many 
               <br />
               weeks ago, in the autumn, we asked that par- 
               <br />
               liament be called to deal with matters of 
               <br />
               urgency, and of course this has become one 
               <br />
               of the matters that could have been dealt 
               <br />
               with had parliament been called before 
               <br />
               Christmas or earlier this month. This is the 
               <br />
               criticism I make of the government at the 
               <br />
               moment—that the session should have been 
               <br />
               called earlier. But it was not called earlier, 
               <br />
               and we are now faced with the necessity of 
               <br />
               giving consideration to union with N ewfound- 
               <br />
               land. After all, this is a most important 
               <br />
               event in the history of this country—the 
               <br />
               addition of a new province, something which 
               <br />
               was contemplated by the fathers of confedera— 
               <br />
               tion as long ago as 1867 and, in relation to 
               <br />
               what will be the tenth province, is about to 
               <br />
               be consummated in 1949.

               I say again that we dislike interruptions to 
               <br />
               the debate on the address. We believe that 
               <br />
               this interruption could have been avoided by 
               <br />
               calling parliament earlier. But since par- 
               <br />
               liament was not called, since the union of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland with Canada is an important 
               <br />
               matter which should be dealt with, and since 
               <br />
               we should give the British parliament ample 
               <br />
               time in which to deal with it and to plan its 
               <br />
               work, we will support the amended resolution.

               Mr. Diefenbaker: ln relation to anything 
               <br />
               having to do with our war effort, the words 
               <br />
               of the hon. member for Carleton were to that 
               <br />
               effect. During the war there were invasions 
               <br />
               of the rights of a free parliament, but we of 
               <br />
               the opposition intend to be assured that they 
               <br />
               shall not be continued in the days of peace. 
               <br />
               More than anything else the people of this 
               <br />
               country are asking that parliament be restored 
               <br />
               to the prestige that it enjoyed in the years 
               <br />
               prior to the war. They are asking that parlia- 
               <br />
               ment shall not continue in living stagnation 
               <br />
               while government by bureaucracy continues 
               <br />
               in this country. They are asking to have re- 
               <br />
               stored the right of the people’s representatives 
               <br />
