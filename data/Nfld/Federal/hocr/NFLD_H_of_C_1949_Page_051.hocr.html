               kind which have failed twice. In each case 
               <br />
               when the national government failed they 
               <br />
               had to turn to Great Britain for a commission 
               <br />
               government to administer the affairs of the 
               <br />
               island. Having failed twice with that kind 
               <br />
               of thing, I think it is unreasonable to ask the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland to go back to it. If 
               <br />
               it is responsible government they are looking 
               <br />
               for, in my opinion they are getting responsible 
               <br />
               government now for the ﬁrst time in the 
               <br />
               history of the island. Two votes were taken, 
               <br />
               and after they were taken there was still a 
               <br />
               majority of approximately 7,000 in favour of 
               <br />
               entering confederation. I do not think any- 
               <br />
               one can say that is undemocratic, because the 
               <br />
               whole population of the island is only equal 
               <br />
               to about three constituencies. After a lot of 
               <br />
               propaganda and educational work two votes 
               <br />
               were taken, and the majority of the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland who voted said they wanted 
               <br />
               to come into confederation with Canada. I 
               <br />
               think that is democratic. I think the pro- 
               <br />
               cesses employed in elections in Canada were 
               <br />
               followed in Newfoundland. The argument 
               <br />
               has been raised, what are you going to do 
               <br />
               about the 71,000 people who voted the other 
               <br />
               way? I should like to ask any member of the 
               <br />
               house, what are you going to do with the 
               <br />
               large number of people in your own riding 
               <br />
               who voted against you in the election? 
               <br />
               Whether they like you or not, they accept you 
               <br />
               as their representative. That is exactly the 
               <br />
               situation in Newfoundland. There was a 45 
               <br />
               per cent vote in favour of union. Under the 
               <br />
               circumstances, where the use of the franchise 
               <br />
               had been out of the hands of the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland since 1934, and where very 
               <br />
               little educational work had been done in the 
               <br />
               matter of the ballot, to get a 45 per cent vote 
               <br />
               in favour in a vote taken under the conditions 
               <br />
               that existed reﬂects a good deal of credit on 
               <br />
               the people who turned out to vote.
