               Prime Minister on February 12, 1947, about 
               <br />
               the principles which would govern the 
               <br />
               arrangements for military co-operation 
               <br />
               between the two countries. Those principles 
               <br />
               were agreed to by the two governments. 
               <br />
               They were announced simultaneously by the 
               <br />
               President and by the Prime Minister. I 
               <br />
               believe they have received pretty universal 
               <br />
               approval throughout the United States and 
               <br />
               Canada. It is our hope that in our negotia- 
               <br />
               tions with the government of the United 
               <br />
               States we shall have the actual exercise of 
               <br />
               the rights provided for by these leases 
               <br />
               brought into line with the principles which 
               <br />
               have been set out in this joint declaration. 
               <br />
               We hope that will be so because of the 
               <br />
               attitude of the two governments of Canada 
               <br />
               and the United States. Their practice has not 
               <br />
               been to deal with each other at arm’s length, 
               <br />
               but rather to try to make arrangements 
               <br />
               which would afford the most satisfactory 
               <br />
               method and degree of co-operation between 
               <br />
               the peoples of the two countries.

               that they might be put in the printing bureau,

               <br />

               <br />
               arise in providing additional buildings for

               government services in this capital district. 
               <br />
               There are urgently required in the capital

               Up to the present time it has been felt that 
               <br />
               it would be unfair to take any building 
               <br />
               materials or manpower which could be used 
               <br />
               for the provision of houses and devote them 
               <br />
               to the construction of government buildings. 
               <br />
               But there has been some easing in the supply 
               <br />
               situation. Hon. members are aware that for 
               <br />
               the last week or so there has been quite a 
               <br />
               controversy here in Ottawa as to where the 
               <br />
               additional buildings are going to be located.

               The matter was submitted to the federal 
               <br />
               district commission and to the planning com- 
               <br />
               mission. They were told that the three 
               <br />
               services that require new accommodation 
               <br />
               were the Department of Veterans Affairs, the 
               <br />
               Department of Trade and Commerce and the 
               <br />
               printing bureau. They looked over the ﬁeld 
               <br />
               and found two sites in Ottawa and one in 
               <br />
               Hull. One site in Ottawa was opposite the 
               <br />
               supreme court building on Wellington street 
               <br />
               and it was decided that that should be used 
               <br />
               for a building for the Department of Veterans 
               <br />
               Affairs. They recommended that the other 
               <br />
               site in Ottawa west should be devoted to 
               <br />
               the building for the Department of Trade and 
               <br />
               Commerce and that the printing bureau, 
               <br />
               which requires a large site—I am told it will 
               <br />
               have a frontage of seven hundred feet and a 
               <br />
               depth of three hundred and ﬁfty feet—should 
               <br />
               be located in the city of Hull.
