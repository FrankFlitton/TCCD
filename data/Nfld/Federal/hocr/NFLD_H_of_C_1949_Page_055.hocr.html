               Newfoundland 
               <br />
               someone said yesterday, there may be differ- 
               <br />
               ences of opinion, but there are differences of 
               <br />
               opinion about many matters of importance, 
               <br />
               and I shall not worry about that. I like the 
               <br />
               remarks made by my leader in that regard. 
               <br />
               I thought he handled the subject effectively 
               <br />
               and satisfactorily, as did the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Cape Breton South (Mr. Gillis.) We have an 
               <br />
               opportunity to do something for these people, 
               <br />
               to make them happy after Newfoundland 
               <br />
               becomes part of the confederation. 
               <br />

               In addition to the roadway I have sug- 
               <br />
               gested I would strongly recommend that we 
               <br />
               have a new boat for the service between 
               <br />
               North Sydney and Port aux Basques. The last 
               <br />
               time I went across the strait I remember that 
               <br />
               the boat was a small one. It was satisfactory; 
               <br />
               I have nothing but compliments for it, but a 
               <br />
               new boat should be constructed so that freight 
               <br />
               cars as well could be transported. The narrow 
               <br />
               gauge railway from Port aux Basques to 
               <br />
               St. John’s should be widened to standard 
               <br />
               gauge. I realize that it would take some time 
               <br />
               to do this, but it would make the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland happy that they had come into 
               <br />
               union with Canada. It would result in a 
               <br />
               great deal of business to them and to us also. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Let us consider Newfoundland as a tourist 
               <br />
               centre. We can say that every province in 
               <br />
               Canada is a magniﬁcent tourist centre, and 
               <br />
               so it is. Newfoundland is a tourist’s paradise. 
               <br />
               It has magniﬁcent bays all around the island. 
               <br />
               As my leader said yesterday, when John 
               <br />
               Cabot and his son ﬁrst reached Newfoundland 
               <br />
               . they were so strongly impressed by what 
               <br />
               they saw that they called the place Bonavista, 
               <br />
               which means “beautiful view”, and it certainly 
               <br />
               is a beautiful View. That name could be 
               <br />
               applied to any of the magniﬁcent bays about 
               <br />
               the island. Then up in the north, at the 
               <br />
               centre of the island, as those who have been 
               <br />
               there know, for two hours before you arrive 
               <br />
               you see high projections or peaks which they 
               <br />
               call the Topsails. They are named the Fore— 
               <br />
               sail, the Mizzen Topsail, the Main Topsail and 
               <br />
               the Gaff Topsail. The View which they pre— 
               <br />
               sent is a topographical wonder, well worth 
               <br />
               anyone’s trouble and expense to go to see; 
               <br />
               and so all over the island. It is a natural 
               <br />
               paradise. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Finally, Newfoundland has magniﬁcent 
               <br />
               ores, one of which I have mentioned, iron. 
               <br />
               Iron ore from that country is the basis on 
               <br />
               which the ﬁne city of Sydney has been built. 
               <br />
               I hope that every effort will be made to keep 
               <br />
               the Sydney plants in operation, using the iron 
               <br />
               ore which will now probably come in in 
               <br />
               larger quantities. It came in free of duty 
               <br />
               anyway. It is obtained at Bell island, not far 
               <br />
               from St. John’s. I have been there. It is a 
               <br />
               very high grade ore, and a resource which 
               <br />
               can help to build up eastern Canada. We must 
               <br />
               do all we can to build up eastern Canada.

               I am pleased at having had some small part

               in creating favourable sentiment towards 
               <br />
               union, both in Canada and in Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               I have been given some credit for that in the

               that I have had some small part in bringing

               about this sentiment in Canada, in relation

               Labrador was given to Newfoundland by a
