               false apprehension if he felt that nothing 
               <br />
               could be done for the requirements of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Greber plan and approved by the national 
               <br />
               capital planning committee. There are many 
               <br />
               projects being considered individually and 
               <br />
               being dealt with on that basis. The reference 
               <br />
               was to a general report for the planning of 
               <br />
               the national capital, looking forward for many 
               <br />
               years. Such a general report is now being 
               <br />
               considered by the national capital planning 
               <br />
               committee, and, as I stated a few moments

               ago, I will ask that committee to expedite its 
               <br />
               consideration of the report so that it may be
