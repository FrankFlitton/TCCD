               <br />

               Mr. St. Laurent: I think the suggestion of 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Lake Centre is that we 
               <br />
               consider the preamble of the schedule, not 
               <br />
               the preamble of the bill. I may be mistaken, 
               <br />
               but I have always taken it that standing 
               <br />
               order 76 referred to the preamble of a bill. 
               <br />
               Here the preamble of the schedule is part of 
               <br />
               a document which, coming to us in the form 
               <br />
               it does, has to be taken or rejected as it is, 
               <br />
               because it is an agreement made with another 
               <br />
               party which is submitted for approval. It 
               <br />
               can be approved or disapproved; parliament 
               <br />
               can say it will not approve this one but that 
               <br />
               it would be perhaps disposed to approve one 
               <br />
               that contained something else, but in that 
               <br />
               event the bill would be defeated and this 
               <br />
               agreement would not be approved. It seems 
               <br />
               to me there is some value in the suggestion 
               <br />
               of the hon. member for Lake Centre, because 
               <br />
               I think the facts alleged in the preamble help 
               <br />
               us to understand the terms of the agreement. 
               <br />
               Even if it were necessary to have unanimous 
               <br />
               consent to do so, I would suggest that such 
               <br />
               unanimous consent might be given and that 
               <br />
               we take up the preamble of the schedule
