               that would be an advantage to their trade, the 
               <br />
               revenue of course, would correspondingly de- 
               <br />
               crease, and the Finance Minister would not 
               <br />
               have at his disposal the convenient mode of 
               <br />
               equalizing the revenue and expenditure which 
               <br />
               the Government of Newfoundland now exer- 
               <br />
               cised, by adding 30 per cent to the duties when 
               <br />
               it suited their discretion. The Finance Minister 
               <br />
               said that last year the revenue was estimated 
               <br />
               at $450,000, and actually reached $600,000. 
               <br />
               But how was this affected? By the simple 
               <br />
               process of adding 30 per cent to the duties. He 
               <br />
               thought it could not be doubted that in carry- 
               <br />
               ing out this bargain the Dominion would have 
               <br />
               to pay a very large sum in excess of what it 
               <br />
               would receive. If his hon. friend could show 
               <br />
               him that those ﬁgures were not correct, and 
               <br />
               that the arrangements were of a better char- 
               <br />
               acter than he supposed, no one would be 
               <br />
               more delighted to be convinced of that. He 
               <br />
               could see, however, no such pressing neces— 
               <br />

               <br />
               justify us in the present state of our ﬁnances, 
               <br />
               in making a bargain, by which we would 
               <br />
               have to pay a much larger sum <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"than</span> we would 
               <br />
               receive; a bargain by which we would pay a 
               <br />
               large sum in order to bribe Newfoundland to 
               <br />
               join us. He should like the Finance Minister 
               <br />
               to deal with these ﬁgures which made out a 
               <br />
               prima facie loss on our part, and if he could 
               <br />
               not set them aside to show why we should 
               <br />
               encounter that loss. He (Mr. Blake) was pre- 
               <br />
               pared to encounter some reasonable degree of 
               <br />
               loss. He wanted to be liberal towards New- 
               <br />
               foundland, but he did not want that liberality 
               <br />
               to assume so gross a form, as that it could be 
               <br />
               said that we had bribed and bought that 
               <br />
               Colony. (Hear, hear).

               member for Westmorland, who stated that all

               we would receive from Newfoundland, after 
               <br />

               would have to pay about $600,000. Now, what 
               <br />
               were the facts as to the revenue? He would 
               <br />
               show what had been the Customs revenue 
               <br />
               during the last eight years, under lower rates 
               <br />
               of duty, except in 1868, than now existed in 
               <br />
