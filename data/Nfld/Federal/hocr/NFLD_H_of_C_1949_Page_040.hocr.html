               When I was speaking last week on the 
               <br />
               address, I noted that there are difﬁculties 
               <br />
               ahead, difﬁculties which have been obscured, 
               <br />
               postponed or minimized because of the post— 
               <br />
               war demands and the European recovery 
               <br />
               program. Our whole economy is, indeed, very 
               <br />
               vulnerable. An imaginative plan for the 
               <br />
               development of Canadian resources, including 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, in the interests of all parts of 
               <br />
               Canada and particularly in the interests of 
               <br />
               the depressed or potentially depressed parts 
               <br />
               of Canada, should be formulated and begun. 
               <br />
               As I have said before, I think that is a 
               <br />
               challenge to this house and an opportunity 
               <br />
               which the entry of Newfoundland into con- 
               <br />
               federation brings forcibly before us. So far 
               <br />
               as we in this party are concerned, we are 
               <br />
               prepared to co—operate in accepting that chal—

               Is there any other reason, Mr. Speaker,

               <br />
               on the island, Monsignor Sears, who spoke

               of the ﬁne agricultural possibilities in western
