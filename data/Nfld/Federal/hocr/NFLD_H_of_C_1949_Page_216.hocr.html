               It appears that the provincial governments had 
               <br />
               two main demands to make. First of all they wished 
               <br />
               to have the wording of the section proposed by the 
               <br />
               conference of 1929 revised so as to make quite 
               <br />
               certain that the passing of the statute would not 
               <br />
               alter the method by which the British North 
               <br />
               America Act was amended. In the second place 
               <br />
               they wished to have the fetter imposed by the 
               <br />
               Colonial Laws Validity Act upon provincial legis- 
               <br />
               lation removed. In other words they wished the 
               <br />
               provisions which came to be enacted as section 2 
               <br />
               of the statute to apply to the provincial legislatures 
               <br />
               as well as to the dominion legislature.

               <br />
               conference we had which sought to imple- 
               <br />
               ment the Sirois report and put all the debt 
               <br />
               on the two central provinces. It was not 
               <br />
               that kind of haphazard policy. They are 
               <br />

               <br />
               needed at the present time. My late leader, 
               <br />

               <br />
               they were proposed. in section 7 of the statutes. 
               <br />
               The extension to the provincial legislatures of Can- 
               <br />
               ada of the powers granted to the legislatures of the 
               <br />
               dominion by section 2 of the statute was carried out 
               <br />
               in subsection 2 of section 7. The subsection enacted: 
               <br />
               “The provisions of section 2 of this act shall extend 
               <br />
               to laws made by any of the provinces of Canada and 
               <br />
               to the powers of the legislatures of such provinces." 
               <br />
               This is the most startling innovation inserted in the 
               <br />
               terms of the statute between the drawing up of the 
               <br />
               schedule by the imperial conference of 1930 and the 
               <br />
               enactment of the statute in 1931. The proposal had 
               <br />
               not been discussed at the conferences of 1926. 1929 
               <br />
               and 1930. The provinces had not been represented 
               <br />
               at these conferences, any more than had the states 
               <br />
               of Australia. But it is probably not true to say that 
               <br />
               the extension of the terms of section 2 to the 
               <br />
               Canadian provinces at the last minute. so to speak, 
               <br />
               was unauthorized by the conference of 1930.

               <br />
               point out to the people of the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec that, as I believe, minorities have the 
               <br />
               same rights under the British North America 
               <br />
               Act that majorities have. I believe that it 
               <br />
               would be a mistake to abolish appeals to the 
               <br />
               privy council. Under section 133 of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act the people of the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec need have no fear as 
               <br />
               long as the privy council is there. Their 
               <br />
               rights are protected. I am very much sur- 
               <br />
               prised at the views which have been expressed 
               <br />
               by various ministers. Since I have entered 
               <br />
               this house I have had many ﬁne friends 
               <br />
               among members from the province of Quebec. 
               <br />
               I admire and respect them, and I can tell 
               <br />
               them that if it were not for section 133 of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act the situation 
               <br />
               might be quite different. I can refer them 
               <br />
               to what happened in Louisiana.

               Let me warn the house now, as I warned 
               <br />
               it before when this matter was up in 1925 
               <br />
               in connection with a motion which I offered, 
               <br />
               and on which Mr. Lapointe spoke about 
               <br />
               parliamentary reform. At that time I was 
               <br />
               urging a British North America Act for the 
               <br />
               living and not for the dead. Again in 1935 
               <br />
               a committee of the House of Commons was 
               <br />
               appointed to study the whole British North 
               <br />
               America Act, and they validated everything 
               <br />
               that I had said. I can tell the people of the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec that they will have to be 
               <br />
               careful not to lose, by abolishing the great 
               <br />
               legal protection the privy council gives them, 
               <br />
               their rights under section 133 of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act. We do not know what 
               <br />
               kind of people will be in parliament in the 
               <br />
               future. We cannot tell what is going to 
               <br />
               happen in 1950 or 1955 to the Dominion of 
               <br />
               Canada. We have had two wars, and there 
               <br />
               are threats of another world war at the 
               <br />
               present time. We cannot predict what is going 
               <br />
               to happen in the Canada of the future. If 
               <br />
               we have the British North America Act it 
               <br />
               will mean a great deal, particularly the vari- 
               <br />
               ous sections I have named. We should not 
               <br />
               allow it to be made a scrap of paper only. 
               <br />
               What kind of government are we going to 
               <br />
               have in Canada? We do not know. There 
               <br />
               has been talk about abolishing the Senate, 
               <br />
               and all that kind of thing. There was a 
               <br />
