               The fact is that by the Statute of West— 
               <br />
               minster Newfoundland was given the status 
               <br />
               of a dominion and had conferred upon it the 
               <br />
               various provisions, provided the necessary 
               <br />
               steps were taken to bring her under those 
               <br />
               terms. In point of fact sections 2, 3, 4, 5 
               <br />
               and 6 of the Statute of Westminster were 
               <br />

               <br />
               foundland is a dominion. Section 10 relates 
               <br />
               to certain things that ﬂow from that. Sec- 
               <br />

               <br />

               there was not time within which to do it, but 
               <br />
               I would point out that the Statute of West- 
               <br />
               minster came into effect on December 11, 
               <br />
               1931, and the government of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               was not changed until the commencement of 
               <br />
               1934. In the interval there was ample time 
               <br />
               for Newfoundland to have adopted the 
               <br />
               Statute of Westminster, had she wanted to 
               <br />

               The position of Newfoundland was altered 
               <br />
               in 1934 when the powers of its two houses 
               <br />
               were vested in a commission. From that time 
               <br />
               on, the powers of the legislature have been 
               <br />
               exercised by the commission. I point out that 
               <br />
               the opportunity for the return of responsible 
               <br />
               government to Newfoundland was promised 
               <br />
               by the government of the United Kingdom at 
               <br />
               such time as the affairs of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               might be in order, and subject to the will of 
               <br />
               its people. Following that an election was 
               <br />
               held for the appointment of forty-ﬁve repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives to the commission which was set 
               <br />
               up to discuss the position of Newfoundland. 
               <br />
               After discussion they decided to have a 
               <br />
               referendum on two subjects, whether they 
               <br />
               would have responsible government or a 
               <br />
               continuation of the commission form. Some 
               <br />
               seventeen out of the forty-ﬁve representa- 
               <br />
               tives voted also for the inclusion of a 
               <br />
               reference to the people of the subject of 
               <br />
               confederation. Consequently a referendum 
               <br />
               on the three questions was ordered by the 
               <br />
               British government, and it was expressly 
               <br />
               provided at the time that, if a majority of 
               <br />
               those voting did not vote in favour of any 
               <br />
               one of the three alternatives, there would be 
               <br />
               a second vote. A ﬁrst vote was held, and 
               <br />
               there was not a majority for any one of the 
               <br />
               three. Then there was a second vote, and a 
               <br />
               majority of those voting voted in favour of 
               <br />
               entering confederation with Canada.

               That was done by the action of the British 
               <br />
               government. The decision was made by the 
               <br />
               will of the people of Newfoundland. The

               <br />
