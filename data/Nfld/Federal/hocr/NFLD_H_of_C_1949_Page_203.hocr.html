               I believe, Mr. Speaker, it will be found that 
               <br />
               another depression is the thing that is worry- 
               <br />
               ing the provinces. The provinces are con- 
               <br />
               cerned about how they will manage their 
               <br />
               affairs during a period of depression. Look 
               <br />
               at what happened to the provinces during the 
               <br />
               last depression. Even the provinces of 
               <br />
               Ontario and Quebec, with their vast amount 
               <br />
               of industrialization, became impoverished to 
               <br />
               a painful degree. The four western provinces 
               <br />
               and the three maritime provinces were 
               <br />
               reduced to the point of extreme poverty. 
               <br />
               Prices fell, but debts remained. Falling prices 
               <br />
               caused debts which were owing before the 
               <br />
               depression to almost treble, but the debts 
               <br />
               remained and the interest was still charged. 
               <br />
               Men were dispossessed from their farms and 
               <br />
               homes. All this time the dominion govern- 
               <br />
               ment sat supinely, disregarding the whole 
               <br />
               matter.

               As soon as Premier Aberhart was elected in 
               <br />
               the province of Alberta and began to defend 
               <br />
               the homes of the people in that province, he 
               <br />
               encountered opposition from this federal gov- 
               <br />
               ernment. It is easy to state that such a thing 
               <br />
               will not occur again. Furthermore, all during 
               <br />
               that depression adverse freight rates con- 
               <br />
               tinued to place a most iniquitous burden on the 
               <br />
               western provinces and the maritimes. Nothing 
               <br />
               was done by the federal government to cush- 
               <br />
               ion the impact of those freight rates on the 
               <br />
               economic life of these provinces. Adverse 
               <br />
               tariff conditions prevailed, but again nothing 
               <br />
               was done to cushion the impact of those tar- 
               <br />
               iffs on the people of the provinces. If the 
               <br />
               provinces face such conditions again, they will 
               <br />
               need constitutionally guaranteed powers 
               <br />
               which have not yet been granted to them. 
               <br />
               The provinces need recognized constitutional 
               <br />
               powers so that they can act to meet depress— 
               <br />

               The provinces must have a constitutional

               power to resist any centralization moves of 
               <br />
               the federal government. An example of this 
               <br />
               we saw in the Sirois report, a matter which 
               <br />
               I do not propose to discuss at the present 
               <br />
               time. The Liberal government at Ottawa 
               <br />
               proposed to act on the Sirois report, which 
               <br />
               was designed to utterly destroy the ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               independence of every province in this 
               <br />
               dominion. For example, Mr. Speaker, in con- 
               <br />
               nection with adjustment grants—hon. mem- 
               <br />
               bers will recall that the provinces were to 
               <br />
               receive these grants—Quebec was to receive 
               <br />
               $8 million a year. The rest of the provinces 
               <br />
               combined were to receive only $6 million. 
               <br />

               whom are now sitting on the treasury benches 
               <br />

               sidered by the party which now controls this

               Let me make the stand of the Social Credit

               pathetic things in public life in this country, 
               <br />

               in this house and his political opponents will

               go all over the country declaring he said

               Crediters in this matter. We did support the

               principle of the union of Newfoundland with 
               <br />

               lying. We still support that principle, and 
               <br />
               we shall do so. We did support the proposed

               terms of the agreement, after careful con-

               sideration of all the details presented to the
