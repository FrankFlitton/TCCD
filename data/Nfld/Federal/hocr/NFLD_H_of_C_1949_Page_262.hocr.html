               That is my position in the matter. I am 
               <br />
               awfully sorry that in this day and age, living 
               <br />
               in the world as it is now, where there is 
               <br />

               <br />
               ﬁnd ourselves on shifting sands, this House 
               <br />
               of Commons has not given the people of 
               <br />
               Canada a demonstration that we are honest 
               <br />

               I think the action taken by the government 
               <br />
               at this time is not only good for the Cana-

               <br />
               Newfoundland because it will relieve human 
               <br />

               Mr. Solon B. Low (Peace River): I desire 
               <br />
               only two or three minutes, Mr. Speaker, in 
               <br />

               <br />
               Quebec-Montmorency (Mr. LaCroix). I do 
               <br />
               not desire to go into any lengthy refutation 
               <br />

               my hon. friends of the C.C.F. In that regard,

               I will conﬁne my remarks to the argument

               Breton South (Mr. Gillis), who has just spoken. 
               <br />
               Without question, it is another clear demon-

               stration of the arguments one sees when 
               <br />
               someone tries to make the end justify the 
               <br />
               means; that is the old socialist, communist 
               <br />
               argument. It does not hold good within the 
               <br />
               boundaries of a free parliament. He may 
               <br />
               just as well carry it to its logical conclusion, 
               <br />
               as my hon. friend the member for Vancouver 
               <br />
               East (Mr. MacInnis) says. On the basis of his 
               <br />

               I should like to say the Social Credit party 
               <br />
               has given most earnest and careful considera- 
               <br />
               tion to the submissions of all the learned 
               <br />
               gentlemen who have spoken in this debate. 
               <br />
               We have weighed the arguments to the best 
               <br />
               of our ability and according to our lights. We 
               <br />
               have concluded that the procedure adopted by 
               <br />
               the government in this ﬁnal step does, beyond 
               <br />
               any reasonable doubt, constitute an amend- 
               <br />
               ment to the British North America Act. This, 
               <br />
               therefore, introduces a new and tremendously 
               <br />
               important element into what, until yesterday, 
               <br />
               was nothing more than a clearly desirable 
               <br />
               objective, namely, the bringing of Newfound- 
               <br />
               land into confederation. In our view, that 
               <br />
               objective is still a desirable objective. We 
               <br />
               think it should be consummated at the earliest 
               <br />
               possible time. But, in the process of com- 
               <br />
               pleting confederation, we do not propose to 
               <br />
               lend our hand to an amendment to the British 
               <br />
               North America Act by a simple majority vote 
               <br />
               of this house. We believe the constitution is 
               <br />
               much too sacred to be constantly subjected 
               <br />
               to the possibility of repeated changes by such 
               <br />
               means, particularly in this day when indi- 
               <br />
               vidual and minority rights and freedoms— 
               <br />
               yes, and human life itself—are valued so 
               <br />
               cheaply and are even held in utter contempt
