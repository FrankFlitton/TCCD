               will have been one of the great historic 
               <br />
               developments of any year in the history of 
               <br />
               Canada. And what is more, its importance 
               <br />
               transcends even our own national interests 
               <br />
               and our own national hopes, because this is 
               <br />
               one of the few occasions in recent years on 
               <br />
               which it is possible to speak of union rather 
               <br />
               than disunion, of construction rather than 
               <br />
               destruction. And when we see, as we have 
               <br />
               seen around the world, disunion, revolution 
               <br />
               and disorder, it is a great forward step that 
               <br />
               we in Canada and our neighbour Newfound— 
               <br />
               land should be able to point to this as a 
               <br />
               constructive achievement in the completion 
               <br />
               of confederation. But further, too, it is 
               <br />
               signiﬁcant that this union should be coming 
               <br />
               at a time when we are looking forward to 
               <br />
               the consummation of a pact—also a union— 
               <br />
               of north Atlantic nations in the proposed

               It is something more than a coincidence 
               <br />
               that these two great events in the history of 
               <br />
               our country should be brought about at the 
               <br />
               same time and for reasons which contribute 
               <br />
               one to the other. We can point to this work 
               <br />
               of union, this work of good will, this work 
               <br />
               of construction. The only other kinds of

               unions that have been consummated in recent 
               <br />

               <br />
               force and by revolution. Our union today is 
               <br />
               being brought about by co-operation of men 
               <br />
               of good will, of men who have the same

               traditions, the same historical background, 
               <br />
               the same racial origin, and who also, as long 
               <br />
               as there has been any knowledge of North

               It is interesting, too, that we should consider 
               <br />
               this proposal against the background of 
               <br />
               the act of confederation itself; for union 
               <br />
               will be the ﬁnal achievement of what was 
               <br />
               begun in 1867. Confederation was brought 
               <br />
               into being in consequence of the discussions 
               <br />
               between the representatives of the various 
               <br />
               colonies in British North America, begun at 
               <br />
               Charlottetown in 1864 and continued at 
               <br />
               Halifax, Saint John and Fredericton, and 
               <br />
               then carried on again at Quebec with repre-

               sentatives there from the colony of New— 
               <br />
               foundland. It is greatly to be regretted 
               <br />
               that it was not possible at that time to con- 
               <br />
               summate this union. But it was possible there 
               <br />
               to make the beginning of the great nation of 
               <br />
               Canada, and so we saw added to the original

               The Prime Minister (Mr. St. Laurent) 
               <br />
               referred to some of the differences in the 
               <br />
               nature of the problem that faced the repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives of the governments of Canada and 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland when we sat down in 1947 
               <br />
               and again in 1948 to discuss the terms 
               <br />
               together. Just imagine how conditions have 
               <br />
               changed since 1905. This brings into focus the 
               <br />
               new factors that have to be determined, the 
               <br />
               additional complexities and the new and 
               <br />
               greatly extended functions of government. In 
               <br />
               1905 there was no social security, there were 
               <br />
               no old age pensions or pensions for the blind, 
               <br />
               there was no unemployment insurance, there 
               <br />
               were no family allowances and there was no 
               <br />
               veterans charter. On the material side there 
               <br />
               was no civil aviation and there was no broad- 
               <br />
               casting, nor was there any income tax.

               These matters that I have mentioned repre-

               sent the irnmense change that has taken place 
               <br />
               in the functions and in the scope of govern-

               ment, but they also show an immense increase 
               <br />
               in the complexity of the subjects that had 
               <br />
               to be dealt with in the discussions with repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives, ﬁrst of the convention, and then 
               <br />
               of the government of Newfoundland. These 
               <br />
               discussions started, as has been said by the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister, in 1947 when representatives 
               <br />
               of the cabinet met for several months with 
               <br />
               a committee representing the convention. In 
               <br />
               consequence of that discussion a proposal was 
               <br />
               produced headed “Proposed arrangement for 
               <br />
               the entry of Newfoundland into confedera- 
               <br />
               tion”. The subheading is very important. 
               <br />
               It reads as follows: “Terms believed to con- 
               <br />
               stitute a fair and equitable basis for union 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland with Canada should the 
               <br />
               people of Newfoundland decide to enter into 
               <br />
               confederation.” It is dated October 29, 1947. 
               <br />
               By a letter dated the same day it was for- 
               <br />
               warded to His Excellency, Sir Gordon Mac- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               W. L. Mackenzie King. These terms for 
               <br />
               proposed arrangements had been worked out 
               <br />
               by the committee representing the convention 
               <br />
               under the chairmanship of Mr. F. G. Bradley, 
               <br />
               K.C., and by the Canadian government under 
               <br />
