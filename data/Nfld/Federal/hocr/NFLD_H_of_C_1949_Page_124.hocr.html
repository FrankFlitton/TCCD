               As hon. members of the committee are 
               <br />
               well aware, costs as" well as revenue have 
               <br />
               risen since 1947, and for much the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">smc</span> 
               <br />
               reason. For example, the tax agreement 
               <br />
               payments are expected to be at least $1 mil- 
               <br />
               lion higher than the 1947 estimate. Athird 
               <br />
               reason why costs are higher—I am referring 
               <br />
               here to expenditures which are a cost to the 
               <br />
               dominion treasury—is the fact that the terms 
               <br />
               of union extend to Newfoundland certain 
               <br />
               additional beneﬁts which were not in the

               original proposals, such as re-establishment 
               <br />
               credits to veterans. It is also provided that 
               <br />
               Canada will take over certain services which 
               <br />
               it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was'originally</span> contemplated would remain 
               <br />
               with the new province. In that regard I am 
               <br />
               thinking particularly of certain fisheries ser- 
               <br />
               vices. Then the Canadian government has 
               <br />
               introduced a system of health grants in which 
               <br />
               Newfoundland would undoubtedly participate 
               <br />
               on a major scale.

               On looking over the estimates which have

               been submitted to me this year by the various

               comparable with the estimates prepared in 
               <br />
               1947. In one case, that of the Department of 
               <br />

               Mr. Church: I should like to ask the min- 
               <br />
               ister a question with reference to the Quebec, 
               <br />
               North Shore and Labrador railway and the 
               <br />
               many natural resources to be found in that 
               <br />
               part of the country. My question relates 
               <br />
               particularly to section 23, section 24 and 
               <br />
               section 27, subsection 4. First with regard 
               <br />
               to section 23. There was some discussion in 
               <br />
               the British house regarding this matter shortly 
               <br />
               after the decision of the privy council in 
               <br />
               connection with Labrador had been handed 
               <br />
               down. At that time Newfoundland did not 
               <br />
               have a government of its own; it simply had 
               <br />
               a governor and a trusteeship. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Was any survey made under section 23

               <br />
               with the Loan Act of 1933 and the sinking 
               <br />
               fund established under that act? Certain 
               <br />
               parties in the parliament across the waters, 
               <br />

               <br />
               was not in a liquid state, and Canada assumes 
               <br />
               a debt accordingly. That is in so far as 
               <br />
