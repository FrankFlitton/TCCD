               <br />
               of “the Monroe Doctrine”; the representatives 
               <br />
               of these Provinces should have taken upon

               themselves, so solemnly to re-assert as fun-

               damental constitutional propositions, the 
               <br />
               sovereignty of the English Crown, over all 
               <br />

               <br />
               this way in 1840, and in 1799, was done by 
               <br />
               others; but these declaratory clauses are our 
               <br />
               own work. I do not say that we are free to 
               <br />
               take any other course; I do not pretend that 
               <br />
               we could have raised, even if we would, the 
               <br />
               question of Sovereignty, in 1864 or in 1867; I 
               <br />
               only speak of the cardinal fact as I ﬁnd it, 
               <br />
               that we have here, by our own act, selected 
               <br />
               the monarchical form of Government for our- 
               <br />
               selves and for our children; that for them 
               <br />
               and for ourselves, we have entered into this 
               <br />
               solemn compart to uphold the constitutional 
               <br />
               monarchy in this country; and that the 
               <br />
               Queen, and her Imperial Parliament and 
               <br />
               Government, have, on their part, by the pas-

               sage of this Bill with these provisions, with 
               <br />
               equal solemnity, constituted themselves par-

               ties to this compact and agreement. (Hear, 
               <br />
               hear.) I do not desire, sir, to dwell at present, 
               <br />
               on all the corrollaries and consequences likely 
               <br />
               to ﬂow from this formal and solemn estab- 
               <br />
               lishment of monarchy on this Continent, by 
               <br />
               the voluntary act of four millions of its 
               <br />
               inhabitants, but this is the path which by this 
               <br />
               Act, we have voluntarily chosen to enter—by 
               <br />
               this path, if we are not to abandon it, we are 
               <br />
               to journey on into the future, and whither it 
               <br />
               leads there we must follow. Sir, for one, I can 
               <br />
               truly say, that I saw and felt all along the 
               <br />
               solemnity of the selection we were called 
               <br />
               upon to make, but I never doubted, no not 
               <br />
               for one instant, that we had decided well in 
               <br />
               choosing to afﬁrm so unmistakably as we 
               <br />
               have done the principles of Constitutional 
               <br />
               and responsible monarchy, for these Prov- 
               <br />
               inces. I am fully aware of the intense propa- 
               <br />
               gandist force which resides in the democratic 
               <br />
               idea. I know there are democratic fanatics 
               <br />
               who damn all other sects in politics, but their 
               <br />
               own; but looking back to the venerable cen- 
               <br />
               turies of Christian civilization which have 
               <br />
               preceded us, I am not taught, that it is best 
               <br />
               for the pe0ple, that the headship of the State 
               <br />
               should be frequently elective. Our Republican

               long procession of the Illustrious Princes, his 
               <br />
               ancestors! Sir, I certainly cannot agree with 
               <br />
               the honourable member (Mr. Howe) that the 
               <br />
               time or the means chosen, ought to subject us 
               <br />
               to the displeasure of our Republican neigh— 
               <br />
               bours. This Union project is a very old 
               <br />
               one—as old as the country, and though has— 
               <br />
               tened by recent events among them and 
               <br />
               among ourselves, it certainly dates long 
               <br />
               beyond the ﬁring by Beauregard on Fort 
               <br />
               Sumter. No question of Sovereignty was 
               <br />
               raised by us; we merely embodied and re- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁirmed</span> a power that already existed, and 
               <br />
               which the Republic always recognized as ex- 
               <br />
               isting in North America. If we had sought to 
               <br />
               plant a despotism by their side—without rep- 
               <br />
               resentative institutions—without securing 
               <br />
               the common rights of free men, sprung from 
               <br />
               the same source as their own; then, indeed, 
               <br />
               they might have cause for suspicion and 
               <br />
               displeasure. As it is I deny that we have 
               <br />
               given them any such cause, and I submit that 
               <br />
               such an argument, or assertion ought not to be 
               <br />
               advanced on the ﬂoor of a Canadian Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment. (Hear, hear.) The honourable member 
               <br />
               opposite (Mr. Howe) also bestowed a good 
               <br />
               deal of his ready ridicule on the expression so 
               <br />
               often used in His Excellency’s Speech—of “a 
               <br />
               new nationality.” He was not precise in stat— 
               <br />
               ing his objections to the use of that expres- 
               <br />
               sion; but I inferred that he thought it prema- 
               <br />
               ture as to time, and inconsistent with the 
               <br />
               continuance of the Imperial connection. He 
               <br />
               talked of walking upon stilts, and having “the 
               <br />
               stilts knocked from under us,” as if our 
               <br />
               increased stature as a people in 1867, was a 
               <br />
               forced and artiﬁcial increase. I need not surely 
               <br />
               remind the honourable member, that in the 
               <br />
               year 1800 including Newfoundland and Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island, with the British mainland 
               <br />
               we were less than 400,000 souls altogether; 
               <br />
               and when the Sydenham Union was carried, 
               <br />
               about two millions, While we are now, includ- 
               <br />
               ing the same Provinces, fully 4,000,000. (Hear,
