               In the pursuit of my inquiries I learned 
               <br />
               of course about the battle of Moraviantown— 
               <br />
               or, as it is called in American history, the 
               <br />
               battle of the Thames—which was fought on 
               <br />
               the 5th of October, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.1813,</span> about three miles 
               <br />
               east of the present town of Thamesville in 
               <br />
               Kent county. During the last ten years I 
               <br />
               have made extensive studies in that part of 
               <br />
               the country, because, Mr. Speaker, in 1950 we 
               <br />
               expect to hold an international commemora— 
               <br />
               tion service at the site of Moraviantown. We 
               <br />
               hope the President of. the United States will 
               <br />
               attend, along with the governors of the states 
               <br />
               of Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Michi— 
               <br />
               gan. At the battle of Moraviantown the 
               <br />
               governor of Michigan was present, Governor 
               <br />
               Cass. General Meigs, the governor of Ohio, 
               <br />
               was not on the battleﬁeld, but was on his 
               <br />
               way there. Many of his troops served in 
               <br />
               that battle. Governor Shelby of Kentucky 
               <br />
               was on the ﬁeld. I assume that the present 
               <br />
               governors of these states will attend the com- 
               <br />
               memoration service. The American com- 
               <br />
               manding general at that battle was General 
               <br />
               W. H. Harrison, who later became President 
               <br />
               of the United States. I expect that President 
               <br />
               Truman will attend this service next year; 
               <br />
               also the governor of Pennsylvania, from 
               <br />
               which state many of the soldiers came, as 
               <br />
               well as many of the citizens of Moraviantown.

               More than ﬁfteen years ago, in the pursuit 
               <br />
               of the studies I was making, I decided to go 
               <br />
               to Newfoundland. While there I made an 
               <br />
               exhaustive survey of What will soon be our 
               <br />
               tenth province. The names of places in New- 
               <br />
               foundland are interesting, because the people 
               <br />
               are nearly all from the Channel islands, Ire- 
               <br />
               land, or England. Not many of them are 
               <br />
               from Scotland. Even in St. John’s I could 
               <br />
               hardly ﬁnd a church of my own persuasion 
               <br />
               to which I could go on Sunday, because there 
               <br />
               are few Scots on the island. Quite a number 
               <br />
               of the people there are from France, or from 
               <br />
               the northern provinces of Spain, called the 
               <br />
               Basque provinces.

               The names are beautiful. The ﬁrst port at 
               <br />
               which one lands from Canada is Port aux 
               <br />

               <br />
               tive name. Then there is a port called St. 
               <br />
               Georges. and as you go round the coast you 
               <br />
               come to a place called Curling. There is 
               <br />
               Corner Brook, in which the big paper mills 
               <br />
               are situated; and there is Twillingate, from 
               <br />
               which so many Newfoundlanders left to come 
               <br />
               to Canada. As I said yesterday, perhaps a 
               <br />
               thousand of them now live in the riding of 
               <br />
               Davenport. I am well acquainted with many 
               <br />
               of them and know of their splendid qualities, 
               <br />
               their ﬁne character, their ability and their 
               <br />
               industry. Naturally I am pleased indeed that 
               <br />
               their homeland is to become a province of 
               <br />

               he did not remain in Newfoundland; per-

               haps it would have been better for that 
               <br />
               country had he done so. All around the

               I made a thorough survey of the resources 
               <br />
               of the country, of which there are many. I 
               <br />
               was greatly interested in the iron mines, hav- 
               <br />
               ing been in the iron smelting business

               <br />
               land as many as several million tons a year 
               <br />
               of raw high-grade iron, all of which I believe 
               <br />
               went to the furnaces at Sydney, Nova Scotia. 
               <br />
               I hope it will continue to go there so that 
               <br />
               that great port in Nova Scotia may be kept

               After my return home I read an article in 
               <br />
               Collier’s, the issue of April 12, 1941, which 
               <br />
               argued that Newfoundland should become 
               <br />
               part of the United States. I always found 
               <br />
               Newfoundland to be intensely British and 
               <br />
               intensely loyal to British institutions and 
               <br />
               traditions. It will be perhaps the most 
               <br />
               British province in Canada, and will be a 
               <br />
               welcome addition to that sentiment here. 
               <br />
               When I spoke on this matter in 1941 I quoted 
               <br />
               this paragraph from the article in Collie'r’s 
               <br />

               There are one or two statements in this 
               <br />
               quotation of which we might take particular 
               <br />
               notice. One is “build roads.” We must do 
               <br />
               that to help them out. I made a careful sur- 
               <br />
               vey in the south part of the island, and it 
               <br />
               struck me that we would have a golden 
               <br />
               opportunity to make the island happy by 
               <br />
               building a road directly through from St. 
               <br />
               John’s to Port aux Basques. I do not believe 
               <br />
               you can now motor across the island at all. 
               <br />
               But if the road followed the railway it would 
               <br />
               have to run away up north from St. John’s to 
               <br />
               Grand Falls and ﬁnally come to Port aux 
               <br />
               Basques, a distance of over ﬁve hundred 
               <br />
               miles. A road straight across from St. 
               <br />
               John’s to Port aux Basques would shorten 
               <br />
               the distance to be traveled and would speed 
               <br />
               up transportation between the various parts 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland and St. John’s, and from 
               <br />
               the Avalon peninsula to Canada. The con- 
               <br />
               struction of such a road is one thing we 
               <br />
