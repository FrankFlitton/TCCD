               operations to the island of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               are threefold. First, there are the operations 
               <br />
               of Trans-Canada Air Lines; they are to be 
               <br />
               continued and perhaps expanded after the 
               <br />
               union. Then there are the commercial air 
               <br />
               services other than T.C.A. and Newfound- 
               <br />
               land has been told that they will be permitted 
               <br />
               to continue operation without interruption. 
               <br />
               Finally, there are the international air ser- 
               <br />
               vices which operate through the port of 
               <br />
               Gander. Those services are performed by 
               <br />
               international companies enjoying landing 
               <br />
               rights by virtue of the international air

               the government of Newfoundland has also 
               <br />
               entered into. After union it is the intention

               Mr. George A. Drew (Leader of the Opposi- 
               <br />
               tion): Perhaps the minister would permit me 
               <br />
               to clarify the question which is raised by 
               <br />
               the explanation he has given on the third 
               <br />
               point. What he has said on the third point 
               <br />
               is in conformity with the information I have 
               <br />
               received and which led to the question yes- 
               <br />
               terday, namely, that communications had been 
               <br />
               conveyed through ofﬁcial channels which 
               <br />
               indicated the revision of existing commercial 
               <br />
               landing rights at Gander in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               as of and after April 1. The statement the 
               <br />
               minister has made, that these arrangements 
               <br />
               are to be brought into conformity with exist- 
               <br />
               ing arrangements in Canada, indicates an 
               <br />
               important change in the situation which I 
               <br />
               think should be noted and followed up. I do 
               <br />
               not intend to pursue the matter now, but the 
               <br />
               minister will ﬁnd that the result will be to 
               <br />
               limit the landing rights of those international 
               <br />
               carriers to what are described as technical 
               <br />
               landing rights as distinguished from com- 
               <br />
               mercial landing rights. The limitation will 
               <br />
               
            </p>
