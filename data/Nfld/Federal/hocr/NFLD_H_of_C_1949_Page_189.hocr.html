               I intended this afternoon to deal to some 
               <br />
               extent with other aspects of our constitution, 
               <br />
               but I am not going to do so. I will change what

               I intended to say and more or less let rest 
               <br />
               what I have already said. I feel that, at the 
               <br />
               moment. the challenge this amendment places 
               <br />
               before the house is indeed grave. It is a grave 
               <br />
               challenge to the rights of this parliament 
               <br />
               under the British North America Act. It is a 
               <br />
               grave challenge to the constitutional pro- 
               <br />
               cedures that have hitherto been adopted in 
               <br />
               this country. If we agree that, in a matter of 
               <br />
               this description which does not touch the 
               <br />
               provinces except as component parts of this 
               <br />
               dominion, we are going to say that one prov- 
               <br />
               ince perchance may say no or the majority of 
               <br />
               the provinces perchance may say no, or two— 
               <br />
               thirds of the provinces perchance may say yes 
               <br />
               and one-third say no, then we are placing our 
               <br />
               constitutional procedure in this country in 
               <br />
               a state of chaos. For who then shall make 
               <br />
               the decision? I do not propose, Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               to take any part in bringing about chaos in 
               <br />

               I want to see our procedures properly carried 
               <br />
               out. I want to see this democratic institution 
               <br />
               operate in a democratic manner. I want to pre- 
               <br />
               serve it. In 1936, I remember, my hon. 
               <br />
               friend the leader of the opposition sang 
               <br />
               a different song from the one he now sings. 
               <br />
               He then said that we in this country were 
               <br />
               in grave danger, and he pointed out that 
               <br />
               there was a growing fascism in the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec. Having read that, I presumed the 
               <br />
               growing fascism in Quebec at that time was 
               <br />
               the election of Mr. Duplessis as premier of 
               <br />
               that province, with the padlock law and 
               <br />
               the kind of labour code about which we have 
               <br />
               been hearing recently. So then, Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               so far as I personally am concerned—I have 
               <br />
               not been able to consult my friends but I 
               <br />
               rather expect I speak for them in this regard

               <br />

               I must confess, Mr. Speaker, that, as I 
               <br />
               listened to the arguments presented by the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition this afternoon, I 
               <br />
               was much moved because I found that those 
               <br />
               arguments were exactly the arguments that 
               <br />
               this group has been using in this house ever 
               <br />
               since we came here. If you look back 
               <br />
               through Hansard, you will ﬁnd at least 
               <br />
               twenty—ﬁve different speeches, if not more, 
               <br />
               given by members of this group expressing 
               <br />
               views almost identical with those stated by 
               <br />
               my hon. friend the leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               this afternoon. Now, whatever the past sins 
               <br />
               of the leader of the opposition may be, I 
               <br />
               must say that in respect to his concern over 
               <br />
               the constitution and the rights and privileges 
               <br />
               of the provinces of this great dominion, he 
               <br />
               is now back on the right track. I will chal—

               lenge anyone to look back over any state- 
               <br />
               ments we have made, on the hustings, in this

               house or anywhere else, that will give the 
               <br />
               lie to what I have just now been saying 
               <br />
               about our position. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I regarded as completely specious the argu— 
               <br />
               ments made by the leader of the C.C.F. party 
               <br />
               this afternoon concerning the case put by 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition. In this house, 
               <br />
               ’at this time, we are not concerned over what 
               <br />
               Newfoundland does, but the provinces of Can- 
               <br />
               ada are certainly concerned about the kind 
               <br />
               of bedfellows they have. I do not say that 
               <br />
               in any derogatdry sense. Surely the provinces 
               <br />
               who occupy the bed should have something 
               <br />
               to say about any other bedfellows who wish 
               <br />
               to come in. The provinces of Canada already 
               <br />
               occupy the Canadian bed. We contend that 
               <br />
               those Canadian provinces, since they will be 
               <br />
               very vitally affected by anything that is done 
               <br />
               about sharing the bed, should be consulted. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I do not think this position is any grave 
               <br />
               challenge to our constitution at all, as was 
               <br />
               contended by the leader of the C.C.F. If we 
               <br />
               have been following a certain procedure over 
               <br />
               the years and that procedure has been wrong, 
               <br />
               then certainly there is no justification for 
               <br />
               continuing to follow it merely because we 
               <br />
               followed it in the past. So far as I can see, 
               <br />
               the argument presented by the leader of the 
               <br />
               C.C.F. is the typical argument that a cen- 
               <br />
               tralizer would advance. We are not central- 
               <br />
               izers. We have always been and shall always
