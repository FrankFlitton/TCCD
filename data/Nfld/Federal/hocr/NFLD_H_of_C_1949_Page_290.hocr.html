               in the House of Commons, I do not see how 
               <br />
               we can adopt the motion without an amend- 
               <br />
               ment to the effect that it has not yet been 
               <br />
               adopted by the Senate. The wording of the 
               <br />
               motion is wrong. If we vote in favour of that 
               <br />
               motion, we approve a procedure which has 
               <br />
               not been rightly drafted. My point of order 
               <br />
               is that the motion should be amended 
               <br />
               accordingly or the debate should be adjourned

               read the resolution. It is a resolution that

               vents any amendment of the main motion. 
               <br />
               The previous question having been moved,

               nothing else can be decided but the main

               vious decision on the previous question. The 
               <br />

               Mr. Graydon: I am not sure, Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               that the Prime Minister has fully appreciated 
               <br />
               the point that is involved here. The debate

               to which I referred when I was moving the 
               <br />

               <br />
               July 5, 1943, bears out, I think, my under- 
               <br />
               standing that the motion then was on all 
               <br />
               fours with this, both as to the substance of 
               <br />
               the resolution and as to the procedure. I 
               <br />
               think the Prime Minister will readily see 
               <br />
               that there are two matters to be disposed of. 
               <br />
               One is the motion I made, seconded by the

               hon. member for Vancouver South (Mr. 
               <br />
               Green), that the question be now put. If the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister will turn to page 4367 of 
               <br />
               Hansard of July 5, 1943, he will ﬁnd that the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst motion put there was the motion of the 
               <br />

               <br />

               unless there is a petition, there cannot be a 
               <br />
               bill in the parliament of the United Kingdom. 
               <br />
               And unless there is a bill in the parliament of 
               <br />
               the United Kingdom, receiving the royal 
               <br />
               assent before March 31, 1949, all the work 
               <br />
               that has been done up to this time falls by the 
               <br />
               wayside and must be started over again. The 
               <br />
               second point I wish to make is this. I would 
               <br />
               ask Mr. Speaker, when putting the main 
               <br />
               motion, to call for the yeas and nays so that 
               <br />
               all members of this house, on this historic 
               <br />
               occasion, may have the privilege of standing 
               <br />
               up and letting their fellow members in this 
               <br />
               house and their fellow Canadians know what 
               <br />
               their position is.
