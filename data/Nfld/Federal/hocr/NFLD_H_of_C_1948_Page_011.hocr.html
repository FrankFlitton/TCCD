               amendment permitting other provinces to 
               <br />
               impose bans. So shortly we may have 
               <br />
               Ontario banning British Columbia apples, 
               <br />
               British Columbia banning Alberta coal, Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia banning Prince Edward Island potatoes, 
               <br />
               thus breaking down the economic heart of 
               <br />
               confederation. Such however, is the power of 
               <br />
               the butter industry in this country.

               Now getting away from the principles 
               <br />
               behind this ban, or rather the lack of principles 
               <br />
               behind it, let me turn now and look at the 
               <br />
               various groups involved. Who are against 
               <br />
               margarine? Just one group: the dairy inter- 
               <br />
               ests of Canada; and for just one reason: they 
               <br />
               feel that the sale of margarine will affect 
               <br />
               their pocketbooks. One reason, a purely selﬁsh 
               <br />
               one, is behind this ban. They, of course, 
               <br />
               expand this reason into a much bigger sphere. 
               <br />
               They say it is more than that. They say the 
               <br />
               sale of margarine would depress the sale and 
               <br />
               price of butter. They say butter is the 
               <br />
               cornerstone of our dairy industry, so that it 
               <br />
               will depress the dairy industry. Then they 
               <br />
               say the dairy industry is the cornerstone of 
               <br />
               our agriculture, so that it will depress agricul— 
               <br />
               ture; and agriculture is the cornerstone of 
               <br />
               Canadian industry, so the eventual result of 
               <br />
               the lifting of the ban on margarine will be a 
               <br />
               national depression.

               <br />
               much is the fact that for years we have wit- 
               <br />
               nessed crocodile tears on the part of the dairy 
               <br />
               industry about the money they lost on butter. 
               <br />
               They were always losing money on butter. 
               <br />
               If butter was such a money loser one would 
               <br />
               think the dairy industry would welcome a 
               <br />
               chance to get rid of this loss leader by the 
               <br />
               importation and manufacture of margarine, 
               <br />
               letting margarine take that loss and leaving 
               <br />
               the dairy industry free to go into the more 
               <br />
               lucrative ﬁeld of the production of milk, ice— 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               What is the truth of the matter? The truth 
               <br />
               is that the sale of oleom-argarine in Canada 
               <br />
               would have very very little effect upon butter 
               <br />
               sales or butter prices. In the United States, 
               <br />
               for example, butter sells at about a dollar a 
               <br />
               pound and margarine at from thirty-ﬁve to 
               <br />
               forty—ﬁve cents a pound. The great sale of 
               <br />
               oleomargarine is to people who today are 
               <br />
               either not buying butter because they can- 
               <br />
               not afford it or not buying all the butter they 
               <br />
               would like. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               More than that, the manufacture of oleo- 
               <br />
               margarine is naturally complementary to 
               <br />
               butter making, since it uses the skim milk 
               <br />
               which is a by—product of butter. More than 
               <br />
               that, the dairy industry gains from the 0160- 
               <br />
               margarine manufacture, because there is more 
               <br />
               oil cake which comes as a by—product of the 
               <br />
               increased production of vegetable oils which 
               <br />
               will be necessary. The records of Canada also 
               <br />
               show that, because between 1917 and 1923, 
               <br />
               when we had oleomargarine, butter production 
               <br />
               and consumption in Canada gained each year.

               I turn then to their second defence, the 
               <br />
               argument of protection. I shall deal with
