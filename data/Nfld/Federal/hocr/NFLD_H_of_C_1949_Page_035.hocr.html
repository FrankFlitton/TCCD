               I have touched only brieﬂy on the many 
               <br />
               reasons why Canadians will welcome New- 
               <br />
               foundland into confederation, as was intended 
               <br />
               under the original provisions of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act. But it would be folly 
               <br />
               for us to disregard the criticism which has 
               <br />
               been directed to the methods which have 
               <br />
               been employed in bringing this about. It is 
               <br />
               not only in Newfoundland that very severe 
               <br />
               criticism has been directed against the way 
               <br />
               in which this has been done. Many New-

               restored to the people of Newfoundland and 
               <br />

               <br />
               are to bring Newfoundland within confedera- 
               <br />
               tion. They contend that the commission of 
               <br />
               government, appointed by the government of 
               <br />
               the United Kingdom, has no right to negotiate

               such terms either directly or through 
               <br />

               met the Newfoundland delegation appointed
