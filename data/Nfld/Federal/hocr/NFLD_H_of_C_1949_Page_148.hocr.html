               Mr. Gillis: The hon. member for Royal

               <br />
               Let me remind him that the house passed a 
               <br />
               bill, as recommended by the last committee 
               <br />
               on veterans affairs, in which the land require— 
               <br />
               ment was ﬁxed at one acre. After that was 
               <br />
               done the provision-was rescinded, and the

               land requirement was stepped up to three

               veterans in Canada. I thought the hon.

               <br />

               <br />
               We are now going to extend to Newfoundland 
               <br />
               veterans all the beneﬁts Canadian veterans 
               <br />

               <br />
               a large number of imperial veterans who 
               <br />
               came here after the ﬁrst war. They have 
               <br />
               been residents of this country; they have 
               <br />
               been producers and they have been taxpayers. 
               <br />
               But we have never seen ﬁt to extend to them 
               <br />

               <br />
               'veterans legislation is concerned. I suggest 
               <br />
               the house should give serious consideration to
