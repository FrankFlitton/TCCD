               <br />
               confederation was a pact, a treaty, a contract 
               <br />

               other way; I believe that any arbitrary action in 
               <br />
               the matter would simply defeat its own purpose and

               <br />
               was in the nature of a treaty. It was the result of 
               <br />
               different provinces getting together and agreeing 
               <br />
               upon a solution that would lead them out of their
