               <br />
               member for Quebec South (Mr. Power). Con-

               cerning this government and its attitude to 
               <br />
               such matters, he spoke words from which

               hon. members opposite would do well to 
               <br />
               proﬁt. I will quote, Mr. Speaker, from a 
               <br />
               speech of the hon. and esteemed member for 
               <br />
               Quebec South, as reported in the Ottawa 
               <br />
               Journal of August 9, 1948. It happens that 
               <br />
               this speech was delivered before the national 
               <br />
               convention of the Liberal party. In review- 
               <br />
               ing some of the things to which I have 
               <br />
               alluded, the bureaucratic complex of this 
               <br />
               government and its tyrannical and irrespon- 
               <br />
               sible attitude towards the House of Commons, 
               <br />
               he said this: 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Without the existence of an almost all-powerful 
               <br />
               bureaucracy, it is unlikely that we would have had 
               <br />
               budget by radio, restraint of trade by embargoes 
               <br />
               and prohibitions, bungling of freight rates, and a 
               <br />
               snarling of interprovincial relations.

               Let me say again, Mr. Speaker, that is just 
               <br />
               what this government has attempted to do. 
               <br />

               been hints that from high places from now on all 
               <br />
               would be well; that things would be different in the
