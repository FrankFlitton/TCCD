               Mr. Timmins: I do not think it would be 
               <br />
               inappropriate to say that a good number of 
               <br />
               the young men from Newfoundland have 
               <br />
               found their way up to Ontario to seek their 
               <br />
               education. The - Secretary of State for 
               <br />
               External Affairs will bear me out when I say 
               <br />
               that he and I, as students at Victoria col-

               lege in Toronto, had with us many young men 
               <br />
               from Newfoundland, a good number of whom 
               <br />
               have become professors in Canadian univer-

               sities. One of them was also a delegate who 
               <br />
               came from Newfoundland to consult with our 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               in the past, and I think that in the future 
               <br />
               we will welcome more and more of these

               The Prime Minister has said that the terms 
               <br />
               of the Newfoundland delegation with regard 
               <br />
               to their educational system were something 
               <br />
               they themselves wanted, and that the Cana-

               dian delegation agreed to them because the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland delegation wanted them. That 
               <br />
               means that there is a departure from the 
               <br />
               regular practices under the British North 
               <br />

               <br />
               Newfoundland, when union takes place, will 
               <br />
               not need to appeal to His Excellency the 
               <br />
               Governor General—or to the lieutenant

               —for any changes in connection with the

               agreement. That may be all right. Tradi-

               tionally, Newfoundland undoubtedly wants 
               <br />
               that. They are accustomed to it. But did the

               Canadian delegates consider seriously the

               can have any effect on the educational system 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland or in Canada. It is a modi- 
               <br />
               ﬁcation of the guarantees of minority rights 
               <br />
               set out in the original British North America 
               <br />
               Act. In the acts which created the provinces 
               <br />
               of Alberta and Saskatchewan there were 
               <br />
               made for those two provinces special pro- 
               <br />
               visions which were somewhat ditferent from 
               <br />
               the terms set out in the original British 
               <br />
               North America Act. The hon. member sug- 
               <br />
               gests the possibility of some province wishing 
               <br />
               to have these or similar terms instead of 
               <br />
               having the terms that are now in the British 
               <br />
               North America Act. I do not know how an 
               <br />
               an amendment of that kind could be brought 
               <br />
               about. I think it would be a relief to all of 
               <br />
               us in Canada if these matters could be dealt 
               <br />
               with by the courts of justice whenever there 
               <br />
               was any feeling that a minority right had 
               <br />
               been violated, instead of being dealt with 
               <br />
               by means of an appeal to a political body. 
               <br />
               The experience of the Canadian public with 
               <br />
               respect to appeals that have been taken under 
               <br />
               section 93 of the British North America Act 
               <br />
               is really an unhappy one. It has created 
               <br />
               disunion, and whatever disposition was made 
               <br />
               by the governor in council, there was a large 
               <br />
               section disappointed and dissatisﬁed with 
               <br />
               the decision. They are apt to consider that 
               <br />
               the decision is not really a judicial but a 
               <br />
               political one. In these matters where there 
               <br />
               are to be constitutional safeguards it is better 
               <br />
               to have them sanctioned by judicial decisions 
               <br />
               than by decisions which many people feel 
               <br />
               are more of a political than of a judicial 
               <br />
