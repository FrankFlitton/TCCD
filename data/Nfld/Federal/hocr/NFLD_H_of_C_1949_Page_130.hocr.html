               <br />
               one-third of the surplus is set aside and is to 
               <br />

               <br />
               of the Newfoundland delegation. According 
               <br />
               to last estimates, the surplus expressed 
               <br />

               <br />
               $26,243,035.06. That is being retained by the 
               <br />

               <br />
               difﬁculty of accurately estimating provincial

               the Newfoundland delegation felt it would

               expenditure or development, or whatever may 
               <br />
               be desired. The representatives of New-

               Mr. Hazen: I suppose the public services 
               <br />
               referred to are those which would come 
               <br />

               in his assumption. What is contemplated here 
               <br />
               is a possible deﬁcit in the early stages in 
               <br />
               provincial budgets, from the provision of

               services falling within the constitutional

               not relate to services which have to be taken

               Mr. Jackman: I do not quite understand

               this provision. I presume, in the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               instance, it is placed in the agreement at the 
               <br />
               request of the delegation from Newfound-

               land. No doubt there are different points of 
               <br />
               view in Newfoundland, and also different 
               <br />
               points of view in the delegation itself. New-

               some that whatever group formed the ﬁrst
