               sidered, as I am sure did all those who had

               participated in the long negotiations, was a

               well deserved tribute to the former Prime

               Minister who had had the responsibility for 
               <br />
               initiating the proceedings. I venture to take

               the time of the house to read into the record

               <br />
               as pleased as his former colleagues that Mr. Mac-

               Mr. King had the main responsibility on the Cana-

               dian side for the beginning of the negotiations which 
               <br />
               we have now completed. We have reached an agree-

               ment for the entry of Newfoundland as a province 
               <br />

               behalf of Newfoundland by the members of the 
               <br />

               There was a rather agreeable incident to 
               <br />
               which I called attention at that time in the

               I should like to ask those who are to sign the 
               <br />
               agreement between Canada and Newfoundland if 
               <br />
               they would use the inkstand which has been placed 
               <br />
               on the table for the purpose. Perhaps I might ex- 
               <br />
               plain why this request is being made. The inkstand 
               <br />
               was left to the Canadian nation by the late Major 
               <br />
               R. A. C. Kane, V.D., who inherited it from his 
               <br />
               grandfather, Sir Etienne Pascal Tache. The ink- 
               <br />
               stand was used at the famous Quebec conference in 
               <br />
               1864 by the original fathers of confederation, and 
               <br />
               was subsequently presented to Tache. who presided 
               <br />
               over that conference. It is particularly ﬁtting, there- 
               <br />
               fore, that it should be used at the signing of the 
               <br />
               agreement to complete confederation.

               terms of union of Newfoundland with Canada.

               clusion that these terms should be approved

               by a statute of the Canadian parliament, the 
               <br />
               adoption of the addresses to His Majesty the 
               <br />
               King will become a mere formality, because 
               <br />
               the matter is already covered by the terms 
               <br />
               of union, which by that time will have 
               <br />
               received the sanction of the parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada by a Canadian statute. Therefore I 
               <br />
               would hope that there would not need to be 
               <br />
               much debate upon the joint address. After 
               <br />
               the parliament of Canada has come to the 
               <br />
