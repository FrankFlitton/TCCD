               I do not propose to traverse the checkered 
               <br />
               story of the island’s political and economic 
               <br />
               history up to 1931. That was done in part 
               <br />
               this afternoon by the Prime Minister (Mr. 
               <br />

               <br />
               leader of the opposition (Mr. Drew). In 1931, 
               <br />
               when the. loss of markets and world-wide 
               <br />
               depression brought into bold relief the des-

               <br />
               terrible suffering among its people, some— 
               <br />
               thing had to be done. In response to appeals 
               <br />
               from the people of Newfoundland a royal 
               <br />
               commission was set up under Lord Amulree. 
               <br />
               I am not going into the details of its report. 
               <br />
               I am going to say, however, that I have read 
               <br />
               very carefully the report of that royal com- 
               <br />
               mission, which I think was published in 1934, 
               <br />
               and I was shocked at the conditions which

               were revealed in it.

               As we have heard this afternoon, the

               result was the suspension of the constitution

               this afternoon that a ﬁnancial surplus has 
               <br />
               been piled up, and that the country is now 
               <br />
               relatively prosperous. It has accumulated a 
               <br />
               substantial surplus. Indeed, the reason why 
               <br />
               we are discussing this problem at the present
