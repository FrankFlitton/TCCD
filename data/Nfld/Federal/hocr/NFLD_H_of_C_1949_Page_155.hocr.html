               Mr. St. Laurent: There is, in the present 
               <br />
               act. The present act merely provides for 
               <br />
               operation in the future, and it would require 
               <br />
               special legislation to implement my hon. 
               <br />
               friend’s suggestion. The matter was given 
               <br />
               very careful consideration by the delegation 
               <br />
               when it was here. There were members of 
               <br />
               the delegation who were most anxious to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               some way by which old age pensions could 
               <br />
               become payable at the earliest possible 
               <br />
               moment. They even gave consideration to 
               <br />
               the possibility of the commission of govern- 
               <br />
               ment enacting, while still in oﬂice, a system 
               <br />
               of old age pensions, and providing for the 
               <br />
               payment of the old age pensions in the budget 
               <br />
               that it will make for provincial purposes. 
               <br />
               But we were informed that, after giving the 
               <br />
               matter serious consideration, the members of 
               <br />
               the commission of government felt it was 
               <br />
               something that it would not be proper for 
               <br />
               them to do. It was something of very great 
               <br />
               consequence, and it was felt that the responsi- 
               <br />
               bility for doing it should be taken by a legis- 
               <br />
               lature elected by the people of Newfoundland.

               I may say quite frankly they were told 
               <br />
               that, if there could be found any way that 
               <br />
               would make it possible to have that done, 
               <br />
               without creating the obvious situation that 
               <br />
               the people of Newfoundland were being 
               <br />
               treated better than Canadians had been 
               <br />
               treated in that regard, we would be happy to 
               <br />
               give it very sympathetic consideration. But 
               <br />
               they came to the conclusion that their com- 
               <br />
               mission of government would not take the 
               <br />

               Mr. Drew: Of course, I think it would be 
               <br />
               appropriate to explain at that point that this 
               <br />
               is one of the reasons why some objections are 
               <br />
               being raised in Newfoundland to the proce- 
               <br />
               dure being followed. If there had been a 
               <br />
               legislature, then it would have been possible 
               <br />
               for that legislature to set up the social service 
               <br />
               organizations which could have handled pay- 
               <br />
               ments of this kind, which called for certain 
               <br />
               provisions of supervision under the dominion 
               <br />
               act covering this and similar payments. 
               <br />
               Through the fact that no legislative authority 
               <br />
               exists, it is at the present time impossible to 
               <br />
               set up that supervisory organization. And I 
               <br />
               think perhaps it is well that we do realize 
               <br />
               that this is one of the reasons why in New- 
               <br />
               foundland there is some objection to the pro- 
               <br />
               cedure. While that is not a responsibility of 
               <br />
               ours within this House of Commons, it does 
               <br />
               explain one of the grounds of criticism of 
               <br />
               the procedure which has been followed.
