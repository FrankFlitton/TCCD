               Mr. St. Laurent: -—the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Peace River (Mr. Low). After those hon. 
               <br />
               members have been heard, then the debate 
               <br />
               would continue in such order as might be 
               <br />
               arranged by the Whips, in the usual manner. 
               <br />

               I had intended at this _time to move that 
               <br />
               afterwards, from Monday, January 31, until 
               <br />
               and including Friday, February 11, matters 
               <br />
               having to do with the entry of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               into confederation should have precedence 
               <br />
               over other matters. But I was told by some 
               <br />
               hon. members that that did not appeal to 
               <br />
               them as being the proper procedure, that 
               <br />
               there would be debate on a motion of that 
               <br />
               kind, and that it would be preferable not to 
               <br />
               have the debate which would be expected 
               <br />
               this afternoon in view of the fact that other 
               <br />
               engagements had been made. I am therefore 
               <br />
               giving notice that I will make that motion 
               <br />
               on Friday. The purpose of the motion will 
               <br />
               be that on and from January 31 until Friday, 
               <br />
               February 11, the matters dealing with the 
               <br />
               entry of Newfoundland shall have precedence. 
               <br />
               However I am not making that motion at the 
               <br />
               present time; I am putting a notice on the 
               <br />
               order paper.

               Mr. Drew: Mr. Speaker, I do think that 
               <br />
               hon. members should recognize the effect of 
               <br />
               the motion in the form in which it is pre- 
               <br />
