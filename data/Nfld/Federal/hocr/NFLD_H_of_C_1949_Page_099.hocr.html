               Quebec and maritime ﬁshermen. Surely it is 
               <br />
               time the Fisheries Act was amended to pre- 
               <br />
               clude any such results. For the beneﬁt of

               <br />
               the bounty was established might be in order. 
               <br />
               I am aware that most ﬁshermen know very 
               <br />
               little about it and I confess that I did not 
               <br />
               myself until a few days ago. I am indebted 
               <br />
               to the Department of Fisheries for the in- 
               <br />
               formation that I have received and I think it 
               <br />
               should be a matter of record.

               This bounty to the ﬁshermen is known as 
               <br />
               the Halifax award. It was established by 
               <br />
               the treaty of Washington which was entered 
               <br />
               into in 1871 between the United Kingdom 
               <br />
               and the United States. Under that treaty 
               <br />
               United States ﬁshermen were permitted to 
               <br />
               take ﬁsh off the coast of the maritime prov- 
               <br />
               inces, Quebec and Newfoundland for a cer- 
               <br />
               tain term of years. For that privilege the 
               <br />
               United States paid $5,500,000 to the British 
               <br />
               government. The British government then 
               <br />
               paid $1 million of the award to Newfound- 
               <br />
               land and $4,500,000 to Canada.

               had been deducted as expenses the net

               As in practically every industry, a ﬁght 
               <br />
               is going on now in the ﬁshing industry. It 
               <br />
               has reached the stage where mechanization 
               <br />

               on between the shore ﬁshermen and the 
               <br />

               <br />
               depleting and destroying the industry. That 
               <br />
               is the assertion that has been made to me 
               <br />
               and if it is true it is the responsibility of 
               <br />
               the government to see that the industry is 
               <br />
               not destroyed.

               important food industry and deserving of

               Mr. Mayhew: Mr. Chairman, I shall not at 
               <br />
               this time attempt to answer the hon. member
