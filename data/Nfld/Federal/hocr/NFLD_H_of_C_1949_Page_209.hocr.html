               In the absence of a legislative assembly 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland that could pass an address 
               <br />
               which would have put this matter through 
               <br />
               without any question at all, they were thrown 
               <br />
               back upon what I would suggest to this 
               <br />
               assembly is a much more democratic pro- 
               <br />
               cedure than even an address of a legislature. 
               <br />
               They went back to the fountainhead of all 
               <br />
               authority under any democratic government, 
               <br />
               the people themselves. They submitted two 
               <br />
               plebiscites, the second of which presented 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the,</span> voters of that dominion a choice 
               <br />
               between responsible government on the one 
               <br />
               hand and union with Canada on the other. 
               <br />
               May I point out that it was only by voting 
               <br />
               for' responsible government that Newfound- 
               <br />
               land could put itself in the position in which 
               <br />
               it would have a legislature to pass an address 
               <br />
               to meet the objections taken by my hon. 
               <br />
               friends on the other side. That is precisely 
               <br />
               what the people of Newfoundland voted 
               <br />
               against. On the merits—going back to the 
               <br />
               fountainhead of democratic authority, the 
               <br />
               people themselves—they deliberately chose 
               <br />
               union with Canada as against that responsible 
               <br />
               government which alone would enable this 
               <br />
               matter to be resolved in the perfectly per— 
               <br />
               fectionist and constitutional manner that the 
               <br />
               legal experts opposite us would recommend. 
               <br />
               The people voted in favour of union, and I 
               <br />
               suggest that it is only by a very technical 
               <br />
               attitude that it can be argued that we have 
               <br />
               here any departure in substance from either 
               <br />
               the letter or the spirit of the constitution.

               The constitution does not require assent

               from any province. It is true the constitution 
               <br />
               requires an address. I am informed that at 
               <br />
               a very early stage of the proceedings the 
               <br />
               government of Canada made it clear that it 
               <br />
               would be glad to receive an overture from 
               <br />
               Newfoundland to come into union, but it 
               <br />
               would have no part whatever in any of the

               the hon. member for Calgary West, referred 
               <br />
               to a certain portion of the resolution reading 
               <br />
               as follows:

               Then he says that, because of those words

               beginning “notwithstanding”, he must as a 
               <br />
               lawyer hold that this must be an amendment 
               <br />
               to the British North America Act, because 
               <br />
               any time you use those terms in an act, unless 
               <br />
               it is merely for the extension of the act, it 
               <br />
               must be an amendment. Well, I think my 
               <br />
               hon. friend has a rather short memory, or 
               <br />
               perhaps he has not had much municipal 
               <br />
               experience. Anyone who has had experience 
               <br />
               of that sort can point to countless cases where 
               <br />
               municipalities come along with, say, a money 
               <br />
               bylaw. The circumstances are such that 
               <br />
               they cannot follow the procedure outlined in 
               <br />
               the municipal act, or there may have been 
               <br />
               some carelessness and they did not obey it. 
               <br />
               When they have committed this faux pas or 
               <br />
               omission, or if they ﬁnd it impossible to 
               <br />
               comply with the procedural provisions of the 
               <br />
               municipal act, the usual thing is that the 
               <br />
               municipal bylaw which otherwise would be 
               <br />
               defective is ratiﬁed. It is ratiﬁed generally 
               <br />
               in the ﬁrst place by order in council con- 
               <br />
               ﬁrmed later by a provincial statute; and in 
               <br />
               many cases that provincial statute is said to 
               <br />
               be an amendment to the municipal act. The 
               <br />
               statute books are full of them; but it is an 
               <br />
               amendment only in the sense of curing some 
               <br />
               procedural difﬁculty in that specific ad hoc
