               Canada and Newfoundland have much in 
               <br />
               common for a union. Both have the same 
               <br />
               heritage in freedom of action, speech and 
               <br />

               progress of the other. Both have realized 
               <br />
               that in a fast—moving world they need one 
               <br />
               another for their common defence. Both see

               land much in the way of trade, but we need 
               <br />
               also what Newfoundland has to contribute. 
               <br />
               Newfoundland has lumber and pulpwood; it 
               <br />
               has ﬁsh and sea foods. It has vast deposits of 
               <br />
               iron ore and other metals. But, more than 
               <br />
               anything else, we welcome the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland. We realize they are a proud 
               <br />
               people, of rugged nature, strong and indus- 
               <br />
               trious, anxious to take their full share of 
               <br />
               responsibility, and that they expect their full 
               <br />
               share of the gains. We Canadians are proud 
               <br />
               to become associated with them.
