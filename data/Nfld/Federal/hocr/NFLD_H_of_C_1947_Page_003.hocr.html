               Mr. CHURCH: I want to ask one question 
               <br />
               about section 7. We are giving the company 
               <br />
               the right- to build a railway and, as the Secre- 
               <br />
               tary of State for External Affairs said the 
               <br />
               other night, we can only give them jurisdiction 
               <br />
               in Canada, and only capacity to act. I would 
               <br />
               call the attention of the government to a 
               <br />
               meeting held today between ﬁfteen representa- 
               <br />
               tives of Newfoundland and the British govern— 
               <br />
               ment in London, England, regarding New— 
               <br />
               foundland’s future government. The repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives of Newfoundland were insisting that 
               <br />
               Labrador be part of that country, and said 
               <br />
               they are now to come to Canada in June and 
               <br />
               go into the question of the tenth province of 
               <br />
               Canada’s federation, Newfoundland <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and.</span> Lab- 
               <br />
               rador. and the whole future of it. Under 
               <br />
               section 7 the company is given power to act, 
               <br />
               capacity powers only as a corporation to con- 
               <br />
               struct within Canada. To proceed with con- 
               <br />
               struction beyond Canada. they will have to 
               <br />
               deal with Newfoundland. and Labrador. I under- 
               <br />
               stand that they dealt with them twenty years 
               <br />
               ago but spent only about $100,000. While I 
               <br />
               do not believe in railways and coal mines and 
               <br />
               electric distribution systems being taken over 
               <br />
               as is now being done in England, I believe that 
               <br />
               the Canadian National Railways should have 
               <br />
               had a survey made of this territory not only 
               <br />
               in Canada but in Labrador. The policy of 
               <br />
               our national railway in the past has been to go 
               <br />
               into territories far less proﬁtable than this 
               <br />
               proposition may turn out to be. While 
               <br />
               these mining men are going in at their own 
               <br />
               expense and surveys have been made under 
               <br />
               section 7, the fact remains that we are giving 
               <br />
               away public property. We have only the 
               <br />
               capacity to give the company railway and 
               <br />
               subsidiary powers to operate within Canada. 
               <br />
               For anything else the company wants outside 
               <br />
               Canada, hotels, power, highways, ocean services, 
               <br />
               vessels, elevators, wharves, it will have to deal 
               <br />
               with the provisional government of Labrador 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and»</span> Newfoundland. I would: ask the Secretary 
               <br />
               of State for External Affairs if that is not 
               <br />
               right?

               Mr. ST. LAURENT: I think the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman is quite right, though perhaps not 
               <br />
               quite complete. The purposes of this bill as 
               <br />
               I read it are two-fold. One is to incorporate a 
               <br />
               company, thereby giving it the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">capacity»</span> to 
               <br />
               acquire powers through any jurisdiction that 
               <br />
               may be willing to grant powers to it; and the 
               <br />
               other is to build a railway from a point on 
               <br />
               the St. Lawrence in Quebec to the border 
               <br />
               between Quebec and Labrador. That is some- 
               <br />
               thing which, under the British North America 
               <br />
               Act, can be granted only by parliament. There 
               <br />
               is no doubt that the parliament of Canada 
               <br />
               cannot grant the right to the company to build

               <br />
               the provincial authorities alone have the power 
               <br />

               truck, bus and automobile. In the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec, there are proper agencies having the
