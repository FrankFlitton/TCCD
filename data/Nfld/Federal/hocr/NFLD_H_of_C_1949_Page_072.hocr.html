               Here, Mr. Chairman, there is a third point 
               <br />
               I wish to make. As the cost of Newfound— 
               <br />
               land’s entry into confederation will no doubt 
               <br />
               come out of the present revenues of the Cana— 
               <br />
               dian government, it is clear that the govern- 
               <br />
               ment will draw from the income tax as well as 
               <br />
               from all other existing revenues, a consider- 
               <br />
               able part of which belongs to the provinces, 
               <br />
               and that is why we were and still are right 
               <br />
               in claiming that the provinces should have 
               <br />
               been consulted. The province of Quebec espe- 
               <br />
               cially should have been consulted, because of 
               <br />
               the marking of boundaries between Labrador 
               <br />
               and that province, which is a matter included 
               <br />
               in this bill. No doubt that is why the premier 
               <br />
               of Quebec used these words which I quote 
               <br />
               from a statement he made on November 8, 
               <br />
               1947:

               more important than national defence is 
               <br />
               something else which has not yet been pre- 
               <br />
               sented to this committee. I refer to the 
               <br />
               religious union that exists already between 
               <br />
               Canada and Newfoundland. I can give you 
               <br />
               a concrete example. The advisory board of 
               <br />
               the Salvation Army, of which I am a member, 
               <br />
               has jurisdiction over Canada, Newfoundland 
               <br />
               and Bermuda. Perhaps this is one of the 
               <br />
               indirect reasons why we are to have union 
               <br />
               at this time. I say that when the Christian 
               <br />
               church leads, all others can intelligently 
               <br />
