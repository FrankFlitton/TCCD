               Mr. St. Laurent: An attempt was made in

               agreements. These statements were in respect 
               <br />
               of matters which it was felt Were not proper 
               <br />
               to have put into the terms of union which 
               <br />
               would become the constitution of the new pro- 
               <br />
               vince. We were constantly being told by mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the Newfoundland delegation: Our 
               <br />
               understanding is such and so. I told them that 
               <br />
               I did not want them to understand anything 
               <br />
               that was not going to be brought before the 
               <br />
               houses of parliament when the terms of 
               <br />
               union were being conﬁrmed, that everything 
               <br />
               that they felt had inﬂuenced their attitude 
               <br />
               should be put in the form of statements that 
               <br />
               could be given to the houses of parliament. 
               <br />
               We could then assert to the houses of parlia- 
               <br />
               ment that all that was being undertaken in 
               <br />
               the form of constitutional obligations was in 
               <br />
               the terms of union; that in discussing the 
               <br />
               terms of union we had declared what would 
               <br />
               be the policy of this government but that 
               <br />
               that would not bind anyone but ourselves. 
               <br />
               Nevertheless we felt that it would be unfair
