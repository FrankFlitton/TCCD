               <br />
               the condition referred to by the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Vancouver East. In reply to an inquiry 
               <br />
               which I made, the regional superintendent 
               <br />
               of the unemployment insurance commission 
               <br />
               at Vancouver sent me a telegram advising 
               <br />
               me that in his opinion the principal reason 
               <br />
               for the increase in the number of unem- 
               <br />
               ployed was the large inﬂux of persons from 
               <br />
               other provinces, plus exceptional weather 
               <br />
               conditions which have retarded logging oper-

               ations and building construction projects. A 
               <br />
               greater number were getting unemployment 
               <br />
               insurance beneﬁts because of the expanded 
               <br />
               coverage and increase in the labour force of 
               <br />
               the province. But notwithstanding that, Mr.

               Speaker, I am sure my hon. friend will agree

               just said, may I give these ﬁgures. In Janu- 
               <br />
               ary, 268 families moved from Saskatchewan 
               <br />
               to British Columbia, 260 from Alberta, 77 
               <br />
               from Ontario, 64 from Manitoba, 12 from 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia and 5 from each of the provinces 
               <br />
               of Quebec and New Brunswick. These ﬁgures 
               <br />
               for one month give hon. members an indica- 
               <br />
               tion of the number of people who move into 
               <br />
               that province during the winter months. I 
               <br />
               would also point out that the amount of money 
               <br />
               paid out in November, December and January 
               <br />
               by the unemployment insurance commission 
               <br />
               was $2,650,954.81, of which $1,462,296.61 was 
               <br />
               paid out in the city of Vancouver.

               Last fall I made a radio broadcast, directed 
               <br />
               to Ontario and the prairie provinces, advising 
               <br />
               people not to go to British Columbia during 
               <br />
               the winter months. It was almost prophetic. 
               <br />
               I was not responsible for the weather there, 
               <br />
               which has been the reason for some of the 
               <br />
               present unemployment in that province. I 
               <br />
               must emphasize that people who go there in 
               <br />
               the winter months must do so on their own
