               would necessarily exclude the civilization

               they are realistic, and we believe that, if we

               ﬁeld which His Excellency says, in the speech 
               <br />
               from the throne, is the ﬁrst concern of his 
               <br />
               government. The second paragraph reports 
               <br />
               that, in spite of the unsettled and disruptive 
               <br />
               activities of international communism, the 
               <br />
               nations of western Europe are making pro-

               gress towards recovery, and that North

               America is contributing substantially to the

               been. From the elections that were held in 
               <br />
               Italy, we know what a partial restoration of 
               <br />
               economic activity in that country was able 
               <br />
               to do in repelling aggression from within.

               more than a sham, and that it is the 
               <br />
               expression of some desire by the rulers of 
               <br />

               At home the situation is one that the speech 
               <br />
               comments upon as being a cause for rejoicing 
               <br />
               and satisfaction. Just let me put three or four 
               <br />
               sets of ﬁgures on record in that connection. We 
               <br />
               say that the economy of the country is buoy- 
               <br />
               ant. Last year the gross national production, 
               <br />
               according to the best available statistics, was 
               <br />
               $15,500,000,000 as compared with something 
               <br />
               of the order of $5 billion or $6 billion in the 
               <br />
               years which preceded the war. The present 
               <br />
               estimates for 1949 are $16,550,000,000. The 
               <br />
               salaries, wages and supplementary labour 
               <br />
               income for 1948, or the amounts distributed 
               <br />
               to wage earners and salary earners, totalled 
               <br />
               $7,135,000,000. The estimate for 1949 is 
               <br />
               $7,810,000.000. The number employed in 1948 
               <br />
               in civilian employments was 4,890,000 and, 
               <br />
               in the armed forces, 35,000. The estimate 
               <br />
               for 1949 is 4,966,000 in civilian employments 
               <br />
               and 42,000 in the armed forces. Those are 
               <br />
               ﬁgures which are signiﬁcant of the activity 
               <br />
               which is prevailing in this country and they 
               <br />
               are, I think, a justiﬁcation for the further 
               <br />
               statement that progress towards social justice 
               <br />

               of people in Canada and perhaps quite a
