               Mr. Claxton: With regard to the incidence 
               <br />
               of certain health insurance taxation, the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition made an assertion 
               <br />
               which I think I should answer. He suggested 
               <br />
               that it was part of the federal government’s 
               <br />
               plan, as proposed at the 1945 conference, 
               <br />
               that there should be a poll tax of $12 to meet 
               <br />
               the cost of health insurance. The govern- 
               <br />
               ment’s plan with regard to health insurance 
               <br />
               was explained fully in the green book pro- 
               <br />
               posals and was amplified right through the 
               <br />
               conference.

               There was never any suggestion of a poll

               tax of $12 or_ $10 or any other ﬁgure. What 
               <br />
               was indicated as one of the conditions for the 
               <br />
               introduction of health insurance was that 
               <br />
               there should be a registration fee, but the 
               <br />
               way in which the provinces met their share 
               <br />
               of the cost of health insurance was left to the

               inion government. Certainly it was called a

               <br />
               of Ontario, I had pointed out that while we

               were discussing this it would be well if. we 
               <br />
               examined exactly what the whole picture

               was. I pointed out that this registration fee

               was a poll tax; call it any other name, it was 
               <br />
               a poll tax. I pointed out also that the min-

               <br />

               <br />

               reservation should have been imposed and 
               <br />
               he gave the minister full publicity. The 
               <br />
               report in the Toronto Daily Star said that 
               <br />
               Mr. Claxton had said that there was nothing 
               <br />
               in this. As the record will show, I pointed 
               <br />
               out to Mr. Claxton—I am using the name that 
               <br />
               appears in the record—exactly what the facts 
               <br />
               were. There was an ensuing discussion and 
               <br />
               the facts were just as I have stated.
