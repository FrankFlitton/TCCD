               Mr. Drew: Mr. Speaker, before any remarks

               are made in connection with this motion, I 
               <br />

               <br />
               sider it at the present time. I would point out 
               <br />
               that yesterday afternoon the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               said that in any event it was the intention of 
               <br />
               the government to proceed during the coming 
               <br />
               week with the debate on the address in reply 
               <br />
               to the speech from the throne. For that rea- 
               <br />
               son there is no evidence of any necessity for 
               <br />
