               in my hand a copy of Everybody’s magazine, 
               <br />
               published by a great man in England, Mr. 
               <br />
               Poke. In an article he refers to the present 
               <br />
               Prime Minister. The article is a laudable 
               <br />
               one, which I approve. I knew the present 
               <br />
               Prime Minister before he was a member of 
               <br />
               this house. I have always had a great admir- 
               <br />
               ation for him because of his many personal 
               <br />
               qualities, which have endeared him to a 
               <br />
               large number of people. In the city I come 
               <br />
               from he opened our winter fair, and he has 
               <br />
               been a welcome guest there.

               T. also wish to refer to the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition (Mr. Drew) because I have known 
               <br />
               him longer than anyone else in the house has. 
               <br />
               I knew his father: I knew our leader as a 
               <br />
               student at the university of Toronto. I did not 
               <br />
               like the reception the leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               met with here last Friday night, because he 
               <br />
               is a great Christian gentleman. He is a 
               <br />
               distinguished lawyer, and was an athlete. He 
               <br />
               is a kind-hearted man. I cannot speak too 
               <br />
               highly of the services which he gave to the 
               <br />
               glorious cause of education. I remember 
               <br />
               when he lived on Wellesley street. I lived 
               <br />
               around the corner from him, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he'was</span> a

               varsity rugby player, was killed by a burglar 
               <br />
               a few years ago. I have always been a great 
               <br />
               admirer of the leader of the opposition and 
               <br />

               Now I wish to say something about the 
               <br />
               merits of the proposed bill. I was a member 
               <br />
               of the house in 1941 when the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Davenport, the great traveler and dis— 
               <br />
               coverer, took a trip down there in the sum- 
               <br />
               mer of 1941. He made some discoveries about 
               <br />
               Labrador. The bill which was before us in 
               <br />
               1947 had to do with the Quebec, North Shore 
               <br />
               and Labrador railway. I was a member of 
               <br />
               the committee which dealt with that bill. 
               <br />
               Important matters came up in that connection. 
               <br />
               At that time we had no control over New- 
               <br />
               foundland. The sponsors of the bill Were 
               <br />
               proposing to deal with the natural resources 
               <br />
               of Labrador and to build railways in contra- 
               <br />
               vention of the Railway Act. At that time we 
               <br />
               inserted a saving clause which read: 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Provided that authority be obtained from New- 
               <br />
               toundland. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               That was a wise provision, because Labra— 
               <br />
               dor, I understand, is to have one member in 
               <br />
               the House of Commons and one senator. The 
               <br />
               ﬁnal discussion on Labrador took place on 
               <br />
               April 25, 1947, and I shall quote from page 
               <br />
               2433 of Hansard of that year. In connection 
               <br />
               with the bill many matters came up. The 
               <br />
               sponsors of the bill were asking for hotel ser- 
               <br />
               vices and railway services. At that time we

               <br />
               land to British Guiana, between Britain and the 
               <br />

               <br />
               sent of Canada. We have given to the United States 
               <br />
               leases on all the bases in the Atlantic ocean, includ- 
               <br />
               ing some on the shores of Newfoundland and 
               <br />
               Labrador. The bases are not all out in the ocean,

               <br />
