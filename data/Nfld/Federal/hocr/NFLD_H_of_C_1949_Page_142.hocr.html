               Mr. Coldwell: Something should be done in 
               <br />
               connection with soil surveys which might be 
               <br />
               carried out in co-operation with the new gov- 
               <br />
               ernment of Newfoundland. I know that in 
               <br />
               the west soil surveys have been of great 
               <br />
               value. While Newfoundland in large part may 
               <br />
               not have much soil, as I said the other day, 
               <br />
               the reports indicate the possibility of some 
               <br />
               agricultural development in western New- 
               <br />

               milk, vegetables and other products which are 
               <br />

               <br />
               possible soil surveys should be made. You

               In this regard I should like to quote brieﬂy 
               <br />
               from the report of the Nova Scotia royal

               <br />
               I may say to the committee that I do not do 
               <br />
               so to frighten the people of Newfoundland.
