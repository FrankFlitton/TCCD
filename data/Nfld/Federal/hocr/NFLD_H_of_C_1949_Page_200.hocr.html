               of a law with any of the enacting provisions 
               <br />
               in the preamble? Moreover, the leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition (Mr. Drew) knows very well 
               <br />
               that the Statute of Westminster is valueless, 
               <br />
               and that it changed nothing in the British 
               <br />
               North America Act. Therefore I do not know 
               <br />
               what I shall do about the motion of the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition, because his presenta- 
               <br />
               tion of it was too nebulous. I am against the 
               <br />
               entry of Newfoundland into confederation at 
               <br />
               the present time at least. Why should we be 
               <br />
               in such a hurry? We should take our time. 
               <br />
               We should see if Lord Jowitt was right or 
               <br />
               wrong. The Canadian people may blame all 
               <br />
               members of parliament because they accepted 
               <br />
               certain conventions blindly. In those circum- 
               <br />
               stances, and owing to the fact that Lord 
               <br />
               Jowitt has revealed to the House of Lords 
               <br />
               that it is a bad bargain for Canada, I do not 
               <br />
               see how we can be bound by such a conven- 
               <br />
               tion. There is something else that you must 
               <br />
               note also. Some of the representatives of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland who came here were the very 
               <br />
               commissioners appointed by the British 
               <br />
               government. One of the British cabinet 
               <br />
               ministers has spoken very clearly in the 
               <br />
               House of Lords, when he said that they were 
               <br />
               glad to get rid of Newfoundland. I ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               insulting to Newfoundland, but it is a good 
               <br />
               thing that we know what the situation is. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Every time that all parties of the house 
               <br />
               are unanimous about something I become 
               <br />
               suspicious. During the war I was suspicious 
               <br />
               about conscription. I was suspicious about 
               <br />
               the so-called gifts we made, and I am suspi- 
               <br />
               cious now about this bargain. I warn you, 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, and I warn my hon. colleagues, 
               <br />
               to take their time. There is no reason for 
               <br />
               them to swallow Newfoundland in one gulp. 
               <br />
               Take your time and think about it. Let us 
               <br />
               wait until we see the Hansa'rd of the House 
               <br />
               of Lords with the context of the remarks of 
               <br />
               Lord Jowitt. That is a most important thing 
               <br />
               to do. We hold a position of trust, and the 
               <br />
               people of Canada have the right to ask of 
               <br />
               each one of us, “what is the matter about 
               <br />
               Newfoundland?” 
               <br />

               <br />
               they been surveyed? We are told Labrador 
               <br />
               is a rich country. What are the delimitations 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland at the present time? That 
               <br />
               is a question which has not been discussed at 
               <br />
               all. We have no map of Newfoundland; we 
               <br />
               only have a script. I want a map; I want to 
               <br />
               know where Canada ends now, and what will 
               <br />
               constitute Newfoundland when Newfound-

               nothing more to add other than to say that

               I think Lord Jowitt has rendered a tremen-

               <br />

               Mr. J. H. Blackmore (Lethbridge): Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, there has appeared recently during 
               <br />
               the debate a noticeable tendency to quote the 
               <br />
               speeches of Colonel George Drew made in 
               <br />
               1937, when he was without experience, 
               <br />
               against the speeches of the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition (Mr. Drew) of 1949, after twelve 
               <br />
               years of experience, much of it gained as 
               <br />
               premier of Ontario in the administration of 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs</span> of that province. A man of ordin- 
               <br />
               ary intelligence and the honesty to face facts 
               <br />
               can learn a lot in twelve years. I judge from 
               <br />
               the way the leader of the opposition deports 
               <br />
               himself in this house that he is a man of 
               <br />
               ordinary intelligence, and that he has the 
               <br />
               honesty to face facts. Let us not be sur- 
               <br />
               prised then if the language which he uses 
               <br />
               today concerning dominion-provincial rela- 
               <br />
               tions is quite different from the language 
               <br />
               which he used when he was without exper- 
               <br />
               ience twelve years ago. Let the members of 
               <br />
               the present party in power take over the 
               <br />
               administration of one of the provinces of this 
               <br />
               dominion, and face realities as they are in 
               <br />
               Canada and as they have been during the last 
               <br />
               ten years. They will be different men entirely 
               <br />
               from the men they are now. They will have 
               <br />
               made a good many important discoveries that 
               <br />
               everyone in Canada ought to make concern- 
               <br />
               ing the responsibilities which rest upon the 
               <br />
               provinces, and the ﬁnancial difﬁculties which 
               <br />
               the provinces experience in endeavouring to

               discharge them. ‘

               <br />
               before the election of 1935 which swept

               Premier Aberhart into power in Alberta, and

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               doubt very much that the present leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition, with the experience he now 
               <br />
               has, would oppose the policies that Premier 
               <br />
               Aberhart was following in 1937. He has found 
               <br />
               how necessary they were.
