               you will accept my usual assurance it will 
               <br />
               not take very long. It seems to me that our 
               <br />
               whole difﬁculty may be summarized in the 
               <br />
               simple statement that, while great men 
               <br />
               brought about the passage of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act, they made no provision 
               <br />
               in that act for a method for revising our 
               <br />
               constitution. We therefore from time to time 
               <br />
               ﬁnd ourselves in the diﬂiculty which con- 
               <br />
               fronts this house today. From that day to 
               <br />
               this we have been obliged to rely on decisions 
               <br />
               made in the Supreme Court of Canada and 
               <br />
               in the privy council regarding matters of 
               <br />
               jurisdiction and amendment. So may I at 
               <br />
               once say that I agree—as I have always 
               <br />
               agreed—with what was stated in the radio 
               <br />
               speech made by the Prime Minister a short 
               <br />
               time ago, that we need a meeting of some 
               <br />
               kind to endeavour to ﬁnd a way to amend 
               <br />
               the British North America Act; to ﬁnd a legal 
               <br />
               . method, which will be without diﬁiculty and 
               <br />
               without cavil, of amending our constitution. 
               <br />
               But that has not happened as yet. From the 
               <br />
               speech made by the Prime Minister (Mr. St. 
               <br />
               Laurent) I gather that it is something which 
               <br />
               he has in mind, but he said that he had no 
               <br />
               intention of bringing that idea forward in 
               <br />
               the present session of parliament.
