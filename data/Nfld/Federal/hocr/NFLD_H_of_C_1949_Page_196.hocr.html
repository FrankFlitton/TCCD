               in connection with an amendment concerning

               redistribution. The advantages achieved were

               If I cannot convince by my own argument,

               some of the statements made by outstanding 
               <br />
               leaders in this country in 1925. I have already

               referred to the question that then came before

               country in the interests of our common

               One who spoke on the matter was the Hon.

               Mr. Lapointe, who in dealing with this matter
