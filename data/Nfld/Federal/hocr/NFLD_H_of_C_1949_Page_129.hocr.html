               Again I come back to the position I took 
               <br />
               before. It does not seem to me that Canada

               should be a party to an agreement which will 
               <br />
               sew things up in statute law for all time. I 
               <br />
               do not oppose the entry of Newfoundland into 
               <br />
               the confederation, because I believe it is a 
               <br />

               Mr. 31. Laurent: So that there may be no 
               <br />
               misunderstanding abroad I think I should 
               <br />
               correct the misapprehension under which the 
               <br />
               hon. member seems to be labouring. If he 
               <br />
               will read section 17 he will ﬁnd that there 
               <br />
               are none of the dangers that he seemed to be 
               <br />
               deploring. The control over education is left 
               <br />
               completely in the hands of the legislature of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, the legislature which exists at 
               <br />
               the present time and the legislatures which 
               <br />
               may come into being in the future. The only 
               <br />
               restriction on their power to legislate is that 
               <br />
               their legislation shall not discriminate against 
               <br />
               the denominational schools. At the present 
               <br />
               time the curricula for the schools in New- 
               <br />
               foundland are prescribed by their department 
               <br />
               of education. I do not know whether that is 
               <br />
               its exact name, but they have a department of 
               <br />
               the commission of government, and before 
               <br />
               that they had a department of government 
               <br />
               responsible to the legislature, which has the 
               <br />
               administration of the schools. The system 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland differs from that existing in 
               <br />
               the older Canadian provinces, inasmuch as 
               <br />
               there is very little municipal organization. 
               <br />
               The schools are directly administered by the 
               <br />
               central government. The restriction provided 
               <br />
               here is not that that government, or the legis- 
               <br />
               lature to which it will be responsible, could 
               <br />
               not set up other schools. Under this provision 
               <br />
               it would have the right to set up any other 
               <br />
               kinds of schools that it saw ﬁt to set up. The 
               <br />
               only provision is that if that happens the 
               <br />
               grants made for education will be distributed 
               <br />
               in such a way as not to discriminate against 
               <br />
               the denominational schools.

               upon the laws and regulations made by the 
               <br />

               the department of government which has

               control of the schools prescribes the curricula 
               <br />
               for all schools. I see nothing in this section

               which would prevent that from being done, 
               <br />

               be doing something prejudicial to the denom-
