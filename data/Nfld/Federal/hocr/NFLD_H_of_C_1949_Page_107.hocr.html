               <br />
               the United Kingdom debt, and that the 
               <br />
               government of the province of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               would retain the debt of approximately 
               <br />
               $9,500,000 as a debt incurred for purposes 
               <br />
               which would have been provincial. There 
               <br />
               was this slight discrepancy. In making the 
               <br />
               mathematical computation we arrived at $61.3 
               <br />
               million whereas the amount of the sterling 
               <br />
               debt was $62.5 million. It was pointed out 
               <br />
               to us, however, that in connection with the 
               <br />
               railways and the war, not only had there been 
               <br />
               capital expenditure of a federal nature, but 
               <br />
               that a portion of it had been incurred pre- 
               <br />
               sumably for the erection of public buildings, 
               <br />
               and that the public buildings were going to 
               <br />
               be distributed according to the space in them 
               <br />
               occupied for what would be either federal 
               <br />
               or provincial services. It was found therefore 
               <br />
               that the fairest approximate calculation that 
               <br />
               could be made would show that the amount 
               <br />
               of the sterling debt was just about as close 
               <br />
