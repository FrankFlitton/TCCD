               The motion that is before the house at the 
               <br />
               present time is one which has the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> of 
               <br />
               terminating the debate on the address before

               anyone in the house knows whether in fact 
               <br />
               it will still be going on next Friday. It is a 
               <br />
               very easy matter to examine the record of 
               <br />
               Hansa'rd and to ascertain that postponing the 
               <br />
               debate and then reviving it, and thereby bring- 
               <br />
               ing back the subject matter that was under 
               <br />
               consideration, inevitably prolongs the whole 
               <br />
               debate. But there are other reasons why 
               <br />
               this motion should not be accepted by hon. 
               <br />
               members Without a great deal more explana— 
               <br />
               tion than has been offered. The date on which 
               <br />
               agreement was called for between the parlia- 
               <br />
               ment of Canada and the representatives of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland, described in the agreement 
               <br />
               as the government of Newfoundland, was 
               <br />
               March 31. That date was decided on before 
               <br />
               the government had ﬁxed the date of the 
               <br />
               session. If there was any reason to believe 
               <br />
               that additional time was needed it would 
               <br />
               have been very easy to have ﬁxed an earlier 
               <br />
               date for the opening of the session so that 
               <br />
               the debate on the speech from the throne 
               <br />
               could have proceeded in an orderly way to 
               <br />
               its customary termination without interrup- 
               <br />
               tion, such as is now suggested.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               It is difﬁcult to imagine what the urgency 
               <br />
               is which suggests that it is necessary to have 
               <br />
               this bill considered a week from Monday, 
               <br />
               particularly when more than two months will 
               <br />
               still elapse between the date on which agree— 
               <br />
               ment is required and today. After all, there 
               <br />
               is no reason to suggest that any extended 
               <br />
               delay will be involved in presenting the views 
               <br />
               of this house to Westminster, because it is 
               <br />
               inconceivable that the government of Canada 
               <br />
               has not already presented all the facts to the 
               <br />
               government of the United Kingdom other 
               <br />
               than the appropriate indication of such deci- 
               <br />
               sion as may be reached by this parliament. 
               <br />
               That being so, the time that is suggested as 
               <br />
               being necessary for these proceedings seems 
               <br />
               to bear no relationship whatever to any 
               <br />
               reasonable requirements to deal with this 
               <br />
               matter in the ordinary way. 
               <br />

               There is of course another and very much 
               <br />
               more cogent reason why this motion should 
               <br />
               not be accepted by hon. members. The rules 
               <br />
               of this house are not different from the rules 
               <br />
               of any other house. Please do not think for 
               <br />
               one moment that I am unaware of the tactics 
               <br />
               that can be employed in delaying the con- 
               <br />
               sideration of a debate on the speech from the 
               <br />
               throne, because if it is delayed the govern- 
               <br />
               ment finds an opportunity to introduce a 
               <br />
               number of extraneous subject matters which 
               <br />
               in their opinion will divert public attention

               <br />
               if the striking omissions from the speech from 
               <br />
               the throne are supplemented by appropriate

               appear that the Minister of Finance (Mr.
