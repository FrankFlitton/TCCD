               <br />
               wants that state of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs?</span> As a matter of 
               <br />
               fact, if we are going to carry on in that way, 
               <br />
               then parliament will lose all its signiﬁcance 
               <br />
               as a national legislative body. Then again 
               <br />
               a great deal was said, particularly by my 
               <br />
               Social Credit friends, about the dangers of 
               <br />
               centralization, and the dangers of stateism, 
               <br />
               whatever that is. I imagine stateism means 
               <br />
               having things done by thestate. If that is a 
               <br />
               correct deﬁnition of stateism, I do not believe 
               <br />
               there are many people in Canada who are 
               <br />
               opposed to it, because almost every group in 
               <br />
               Canada is asking the state to do something. 
               <br />
               They are not all asking the state to do the 
               <br />
               same thing, but every one of them is asking 
               <br />
               the state to do something for them. 
               <br />

               Let us see how much is in all these warn- 
               <br />
               ings about the dangers of centralization. If 
               <br />
               we followed the argument of my Social Credit 
               <br />
               friends to its logical conclusion we would not 
               <br />
               have a confederation at all, because con- 
               <br />
               federation in itself is centralization. We 
               <br />
               have been told again and again in this house 
               <br />
               that the fathers of confederation, and particu- 
               <br />
               larly the greatest of the fathers, Sir John A. 
               <br />
               Macdonald, wanted a strong central govern- 
               <br />
               ment. Do we want a strong central govern- 
               <br />
               ment, or do we want a government which, 
               <br />
               whenever it wants to do anything of a na- 
               <br />
               tional character, must consult every province? 
               <br />
               Do we want a government that cannot act 
               <br />
               until every province says, “yes, go ahead”? 
               <br />
               Surely that makes nonsense of our preten- 
               <br />
               sions of nationhood. It makes nonsense of 
               <br />
               almost everything that has been said by the 
               <br />
               oﬁicial opposition and the Social Credit party 
               <br />
               during the past two days. There is always a 
               <br />
               danger that power will be abused, but the 
               <br />
               way to assure that it will not is not to create 
               <br />
               a situation where no one will have any power 
               <br />
               to do anything. The way to provide against 
               <br />
               that is to have an educated public opinion 
               <br />
               which will understand what is required and 
               <br />
               know when governments are going too far. 
               <br />
               Then the sovereign people on the one day 
               <br />
               that they are sovereign, election day, will 
               <br />
               take such action as will bring about the 
               <br />
               results they desire.

               I have been interested in the political 
               <br />
               affairs of Canada for some considerable time. 
               <br />
               I have watched legislation in the provinces, 
               <br />
               and I have watched legislation in the 
               <br />
               dominion parliament. I am bound to say 
               <br />
               that, as far as I can see, on the basis of the 
               <br />
               legislation that has been enacted by our 
               <br />
               provinces and the legislation that has been

               <br />

               hands of the parliament of Canada as it is in

               the hands of any of the provincial legisla-

               tures. Why be afraid then that a government 
               <br />
               has the power to do the things that the 
               <br />

               I should say any more. I think I have made 
               <br />
               it clear that in the ﬁrst place the resolution 
               <br />
               before us follows a precedent that has long 
               <br />
               been established by this parliament; and that, 
               <br />
               in the second place, the amendment if it were 
               <br />
               adopted, would create a new precedent and 
               <br />
               one which, in my opinion, is dangerous be-

               cause we do not know where it would lead. 
               <br />
               Where it would lead would perhaps depend

               upon the whim of the government of one

               ing to solve this problem since 1867. We

               to take about ten minutes because in the past

               couple of weeks, on this question of inter-

               national law, the British North America Act

               few people in this house know very much 
               <br />
               about it, and that the whole matter can be

               <br />
               make my position clear. When the hon.

               <br />

               during the debate on the speech from the

               debate, completely ignoring anything that was 
               <br />
               in the speech from the throne and saying very

               little about what was not in it. He decided
