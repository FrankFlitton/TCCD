               <br />
               we have been handed today, to the effect 
               <br />
               that if the new legislature of Newfoundland 
               <br />
               passes an old age pensions act at its ﬁrst ses- 
               <br />
               sion, and provides that payment shall be 
               <br />
               retroactive to March 31 of this year, then 
               <br />
               Canada will pay three—quarters of that pen-

               sion disbursement from the same date. I 
               <br />
               would point out to the Prime Minister that in 
               <br />
               Bill No. 12 there are amendments of a type 
               <br />
               similar to many of the Canadian statutes. I do 
               <br />
               not see why we could not make an amend- 
               <br />
               ment of that type to the Old Age Pensions 
               <br />
               Act. As a matter of fact, Bill No. 12 already 
               <br />
               contains one amendment to the Old Age Pen- 
               <br />

               The Prime Minister has said that both the 
               <br />
               Canadian delegates and the delegates from 
               <br />
               Newfoundland were anxious to do anything 
               <br />
               that could be done in order that the appli-

               The Minister of Finance compares the 
               <br />
               situation in Newfoundland with that in the 
               <br />
               other provinces. But there really is no com— 
               <br />
               parison at all. When the Old Age Pensions 
               <br />
               Act was passed by the dominion, each of the 
               <br />
               provincial governments was in existence. It 
               <br />
               was well known what the legislation was to 
               <br />
               be, and those governments had the choice 
               <br />
               of either accepting the legislation or not 
               <br />
               acting under it. Here the trouble is that 
               <br />
               Newfoundland has not a government. That 
               <br />
               is the only reason why the people there can- 
               <br />
               not get this pension as from March 31. I 
               <br />
               suggest therefore that the situations are not 
               <br />
               at all' parallel. I would ask the Prime Minis- 
               <br />
               ter why it is not possible to bring in an 
               <br />
               amendment to the Old Age Pensions Act 
               <br />
               under this Bill No. 12, providing that, when 
               <br />
               the pension is authorized in Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               Canada will pay three-quarters of it as from 
               <br />

               every single member in the house right now

               <br />
               having attained the age of seventy, of having 
               <br />

               <br />
               having made an application, of having the

               province make an inspection and then making 
               <br />
               an award which subsequently results in the 
               <br />
               federal government making its contribution 
               <br />
               of 75 per cent.
