               Recently the Canadian people passed 
               <br />
               through the exacting crisis of the war. During 
               <br />
               that time they raised a powerful army. Dur- 
               <br />
               ing that time they built up an efﬁcient war- 
               <br />
               time production machine. During that time 
               <br />
               they designed and put into operation an 
               <br />
               admirable system of price control, and other 
               <br />
               economic controls. The present government 
               <br />
               must be given credit for having done all 
               <br />
               those things. in co-operation with the prov- 
               <br />
               inces. In the process the members of this 
               <br />
               house and the people of the country have 
               <br />
               seen this magniﬁcent Canadian people carry 
               <br />
               on from coast to coast with scarcely a quiver 
               <br />
               or a creak, notwithstanding the fact that on 
               <br />
               many occasions this government encroached 
               <br />
               upon provincial ﬁelds, taking over powers 
               <br />
               that were obviously powers of the provinces. 
               <br />
               The provinces gladly acceded to the request 
               <br />
               of the dominion while the crisis continued, 
               <br />
               showing that there was no desire to interfere 
               <br />
               or to insist uncooperatively on provincial 
               <br />
               rights.

               <br />
               consult them. All that is necessary is to

               a particle how much power a province has;

               The thing that is worrying the provinces 
               <br />
               is that, if they lose the constitutional power 
               <br />
               to determine the way their people shall be 
               <br />
               governed, then when crisis comes and they 
               <br />
               need that power they will no longer have it. 
               <br />
               During the war we did not ﬁnd any sign of 
               <br />
               lack of unity, except perhaps between the 
               <br />
               two primary races in Canada, and I am not 
               <br />
               sure there was a great lack of unity there. 
               <br />
               Nor did we ﬁnd any sign of any kind of 
               <br />
               “balkanization.” I think one of the members 
               <br />

               <br />
               Territories. British Columbia, Prince Edward 
               <br />
               Island and Manitoba were not sovereign 
               <br />
               states. They had never become sovereign

               <br />
               Newfoundland has become. Newfoundland 
               <br />
               is a sister dominion. Consequently, the

               admission of Newfoundland to Canada 
               <br />
