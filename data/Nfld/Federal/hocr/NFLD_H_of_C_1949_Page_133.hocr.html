               Mr. Drew: As I understand it, a provision 
               <br />
               to that effect was incorporated to avoid any 
               <br />
               possibility of a constitutional dispute as to 
               <br />
               whether the tax was being imposed within 
               <br />
               the provincial or the federal ﬁeld. The prov- 
               <br />
               inces actually collect it, but it does not affect 
               <br />
               the total that is received by the dominion 
               <br />
               government before the subsidy payments are 
               <br />
               returned to the provinces. As I read this 
               <br />
               section it would mean that, although the 
               <br />
               dominion government undertakes to pay sub- 
               <br />
               sidies in accordance with the same terms that 
               <br />
               have been signed by certain provinces, the 
               <br />
               provincial government in this case might not 
               <br />
               be in a position to carry out the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under-'-</span>

               Mr. Abbott: That is possible. Of course, 
               <br />
               as my hon. friend appreciates, that provision 
               <br />
               was inserted in the agreements with the seven 
               <br />
               provinces in order to assure that as far as 
               <br />
               possible corporation taxpayers in non—agree- 
               <br />
               ing provinces would not be prejudiced. That 
               <br />
               was the sole purpose of including that pro- 
               <br />
               vision in the agreements with the seven 
               <br />
               provinces. The agreements contain a pro- 
               <br />
               vision that the dominion may at any time 
               <br />
               require those provinces to repeal the ﬁve 
               <br />
               per cent corporation tax. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               is quite right in saying that the net effect 
               <br />
               is that the provinces do not retain any more 
               <br />
               money. In fact, the dominion government 
               <br />
               gets the 35 per cent rate as a result of the 
               <br />
               combined effect of the federal tax and the 
               <br />
               provincial tax.

               Mr. Abbott: The practical effect is that the

               dominion government imposes at present 
               <br />
               rates a 30 per cent tax on corporations, but

               in the case of Newfoundland, if the province

               an obligation to c‘ollect a corporation tax, let

               us say of ﬁve per cent, as in the case of the
