               authorize the issuance of the letter in its

               The form letter referred to was sent out in 
               <br />
               all cases where dates of birth, including 
               <br />
               those of adopted children, could not be veri- 
               <br />
               ﬁed from provincial vital statistics records. 
               <br />
               In such cases the experience has been that the 
               <br />
               child’s birth had never been registered, and 
               <br />
               it is necessary for the family allowance 
               <br />
               ofﬁcials to request the help of the parents 
               <br />
               themselves in furnishing information as to 
               <br />
               the date of birth. Adopted children are of 
               <br />
               course eligible for family allowances on the

               same basis as any other children. In order 
               <br />
               that the correct amount may be paid, and

               it is necessary, of course, to establish the 
               <br />
               correct dates of birth. I may say that in all 
               <br />
               cases where parents had advised the family 
               <br />

               The purpose of the form letter was solely
