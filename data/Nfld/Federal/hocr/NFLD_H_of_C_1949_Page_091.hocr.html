               the province of Newfoundland to get a new 
               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. St. Laurent: With respect to education, 
               <br />
               the situation was different from that which 
               <br />
               existed at the time of the creation of the two 
               <br />
               new provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. 
               <br />
               At that time, this parliament had control 
               <br />
               over education in those territories. It could 
               <br />

               <br />
               control, subject only to certain guarantees 
               <br />
               of the rights of minorities. The delegates 
               <br />
               from Newfoundland were told we had no con-

               trol over their educational system at the 
               <br />

               make any provision it wished to make with 
               <br />
               respect to education. We also told them we 
               <br />
               had no right to insist upon any guarantee 
               <br />

               <br />
               they have complete jurisdiction themselves; 
               <br />
               but if, for the satisfaction of their own people, 
               <br />
               they felt it was preferable to have a guarantee

               written into the constitution, we could not

               the delegation from Newfoundland that it 
               <br />
