               undertaken by the Rowell-Sirois commission

               with a view to ﬁnding a suitable basis for

               the settlement of our ﬁscal problems. The

               power having informed the provinces of its

               views on procedure, the provinces refused to 
               <br />
               co-operate. As a consequence, I repeat that 
               <br />
               the conference was a total failure, and I

               Today the dominion government tells the

               up a central administration and united the 
               <br />

               from the arguments advanced, particularly as

               they relate to the amendment moved by my

               At the outset, may I say there is no one

               within the hearing of my voice more anxious 
               <br />

               have an appreciation of my country and, for 
               <br />
               many long years, I have visualized the advan—

               I submit, Mr. Speaker, there is nothing in the

               to the hon. Minister of Justice (Mr. Garson), 
               <br />
               and while I would hesitate to interpret any 
               <br />
               part of the law expounded by him, I was 
               <br />
               impressed with his reference to municipal

               cipal affairs, have a set of bylaws for which 
               <br />
               those municipalities are responsible. Over 
               <br />
               the years those bylaws have accumulated in 
               <br />
               number. I think it would be a tremendous

               task for the law ofﬁcer of a municipality to 
               <br />
               search those bylaws in order to determine

               whether something already in effect might 
               <br />
               react against a matter being passed by the
