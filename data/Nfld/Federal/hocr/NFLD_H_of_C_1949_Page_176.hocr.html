               square miles of Lake Superior are in Canada. 
               <br />
               We also have exceptionally high mountains. 
               <br />
               At the time of Sir Ambrose Shea, the St. Elias 
               <br />
               group of mountains between Yukon and 
               <br />
               Alaska, which rises to a great height, were 
               <br />
               not known to be in Canada. The highest 
               <br />
               mountain in that range is Mount Logan, with 
               <br />
               a height of 19,850 feet. Canada has inexhaust- 
               <br />
               ible resources. What would Sir Ambrose 
               <br />
               Shea have seen? He would have seen that the 
               <br />
               Canada of today is one of the largest national 
               <br />
               areas in the world. I believe we are exceeded 
               <br />
               only by Russia, including Siberia, but we are 
               <br />
               larger than European Russia. Together with 
               <br />
               Newfoundland’s 152,000 square miles, we shall 
               <br />
               now have approximately 3,750,000 square 
               <br />
               miles. Including Newfoundland and Labra- 
               <br />
               dor, the population of Canada will be very 
               <br />
               close to thirteen and a half million people.

               We have grown to be a very great state 
               <br />
               both in area and in population. Our cousins 
               <br />
               to the south have a larger population, but 
               <br />
               continental United States is more than 750,000 
               <br />
               square miles smaller than Canada. Including 
               <br />
               Alaska it is perhaps 150,000 square miles less. 
               <br />
               I do not know whether it is there now because 
               <br />
               the building may have been blown down in 
               <br />
               the late war, but I often think of the inscrip-

               tion on the money exchange building in Lon- 
               <br />
               don near the famous monument to the great 
               <br />
               ﬁre. The inscription is: “The earth is the 
               <br />
               Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.” When God 
               <br />
               made this part of the world he must have 
               <br />
               been thinking of the fulness of this country, 
               <br />
               because, interpreting fulness as material 
               <br />
               wealth, in many respects we surpass the 
               <br />
               whole world. For instance, there is nickel; 
               <br />
               in Canada we have approximately nine— 
               <br />
               tenths of all the nickel in the world.

               Newfoundland is joining one of the great

               think that from 1864 to 1949, a period of over 
               <br />
               eighty years, many efforts have been made 
               <br />
               to make confederation complete. When this

               bill passes the house, as it will, confederation 
               <br />
               will be complete. As the years roll on, those

               who come after us will refer to that great

               ington, I thought of something else the Prime

               Minister might take up when he is in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               I do not suppose he would have time to do 
               <br />
               it anyway, but on some future occasion he 
               <br />
               might consider negotiating with the United
