               It must not be forgotten that the British

               the attitude expressed this afternoon by the 
               <br />

               <br />
               on the advice of ministers responsible to his

               Charlevoix-Saguenay seems to be one of those 
               <br />
               who have lagged behind, and he is not willing

               to keep pace with the developments that time 
               <br />
               has brought about.

               The situation is that a statute will have

               ment was made that they would be returned.

               was concerned, and then conﬁrmed by an act

               of the parliament of the United Kingdom. 
               <br />
               That was necessary because it was a pro-

               Mr. Nicholson: I am sure the Prime Min-

               controversial question in Newfoundland. As

               I mentioned last night, I spent a week there

               embarrassing position as a Canadian. I was
