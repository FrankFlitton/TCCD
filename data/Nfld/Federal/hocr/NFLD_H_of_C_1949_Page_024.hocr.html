               Mr. St. Laurent: I am prepared to make 
               <br />
               the statement at the time which might best 
               <br />
               suit the convenience of hon. members. I 
               <br />
               can make it now on the motion that the 
               <br />
               Speaker leave the chair, or I can make it 
               <br />
               as soon as the Speaker leaves the chair, when 
               <br />
               we are in committee. I had thought it might 
               <br />
               better suit the convenience of hon. members, 
               <br />
               since no doubt more than one will be speak- 
               <br />
               ing on this resolution, to have everyone speak 
               <br />
               under the same conditions, where questions 
               <br />
               may be put and answered, if hon. members 
               <br />
               should ﬁnd it desirable. I am quite prepared 
               <br />
               to go on now, however, if it is the wish of 
               <br />
               hon. members that I do so while Mr. Speaker 
               <br />
               is in the chair.

               Mr. Drew: I think it would be appropriate

               <br />
               ter): Mr. Speaker, I think all hon. members 
               <br />
               will be of the view that the measure with 
               <br />
               which the house is now called upon to deal 
               <br />
               is of an epoch-making character. This ﬁfth 
               <br />
               session of the twentieth parliament has the 
               <br />
               historic task of considering the addition to 
               <br />
               Canada of the last segment in the original 
               <br />
               plan of the fathers of confederation. The 
               <br />
               bill to follow the resolution will ask parlia- 
               <br />
               ment to give approval to the terms of union 
               <br />
               with Newfoundland which were signed in 
               <br />
               Ottawa on the 11th of December last.

               or course this is not the ﬁrst time that the 
               <br />
               project of the fathers of confederation has 
               <br />
               received serious attention from the Canadian 
               <br />
               parliament and the Canadian public. It is 
               <br />
               well known to us all that two of the original

               members of the Quebec conference in 1864 
               <br />
               were from Newfoundland. They participated 
               <br />
               in the resolution which ultimately proved to 
               <br />
               be the basis upon which the British North 
               <br />
               America Act was drafted, submitted to the 
               <br />
