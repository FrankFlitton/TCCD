               Canadian forces and in allied forces. In the 
               <br />
               second world war, in the main, those who 
               <br />
               served from Newfoundland were enlisted in

               and in the Royal Navy. Of the veterans of 
               <br />
               world war I, those now living in New- 
               <br />
               foundland and those who served on behalf of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland and who may now be living in 
               <br />
               other parts of the world, 1,103 are in receipt 
               <br />
               of pensions. That includes dependents. Of 
               <br />
               world war II, in the same category there 
               <br />
               is a total of 642 in receipt of pension at the 
               <br />
               present time. I might add that in world war 
               <br />
               II the pensions are paid by the British 
               <br />

               <br />
               ever, it is the intention to bring these pen- 
               <br />
               sions up to the Canadian scale. It also 
               <br />
               appears that there may be others who may

               Those with whom we discussed the matter

               felt that under that act there would not be

               many applications for full—time farming. My

               date has yet been set under that act. It was

               expected that there would be some applica-

               are they to be given at college? Is a man to

               <br />

               So far as vocational training is concerned, 
               <br />
               that is pretty well completed in Canada, with 
               <br />
               the exception of those veterans who may have 
               <br />
               been in hospital continuously. To take one 
               <br />
               example, there are veterans who have been 
               <br />
               in hospital continuously since the end of 
               <br />
               the war, but who have now ﬁnished treat- 
               <br />
               ment and are able to get out on their own. 
               <br />
               In such cases there is authority to approve 
               <br />
               entry into a vocational training school, or 
               <br />
               to approve university training. That of course 
               <br />
               Will hold true in Newfoundland. So that, in 
               <br />
               vocational training, it was not expected there 
               <br />
               would be many who would qualify.

               there are.
