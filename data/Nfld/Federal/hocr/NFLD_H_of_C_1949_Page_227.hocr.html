               Mr. Speaker, I listened with much interest 
               <br />
               and quite attentively to the speech which the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Beauharnois-Laprairie (Mr. 
               <br />
               Raymond) has just delivered.

               <br />
               want ﬁrst of all to protect the interests of 
               <br />
               Canada.” I must say that all members who 
               <br />
               come from the province of Quebec agree with
