               Mr. 51. Laurent: The ultimate appeal

               the status quo for all time, but that is subject 
               <br />
               to some modiﬁcation. I understand the 
               <br />
               schools in Newfoundland are denominational 
               <br />
               schools, but under the present practice differ- 
               <br />
               ent denominations can amalgamate for a 
               <br />
               school district. The right to do that is pre— 
               <br />
               served. Moreover, there is a right in the 
               <br />
               legislature to set up other schools than those 
               <br />
               which exist at the present time, but it is 
               <br />
               provided that if they do set up other schools 
               <br />
               they must not discriminate against the 
               <br />
               denominational schools in the districts. Such 
               <br />
               was the desire of the delegates from New- 
               <br />
               foundland; and, as the hon. member has indi- 
               <br />
               cated, the sanction was to be an appeal to 
               <br />
               the courts, not an appeal to a political body.

               Mr. Kidd: May I direct a question to the 
               <br />
               right hon. the Prime Minister? It has to do 
               <br />
               with the education of veterans. I notice that 
               <br />
               veterans aﬁairs comes under section 38, but 
               <br />
               I do not see the word “education” mentioned 
               <br />
               in section 38, so I am taking this opportunity 
               <br />
               of asking my question. The Prime Minister 
               <br />
               may be familiar with the educational system 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland. There are no universities 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland and a student wishing to 
               <br />
               receive advanced education, after receiving 
               <br />
               ﬁrst or second year college, has to go to 
               <br />
               Dalhousie, McGill, Queen’s or varsity. The 
               <br />
               student ﬁnishes his education and takes his 
               <br />
               degree there. The result has been that a 
               <br />
               great many Newfoundlanders who came to 
               <br />
               Canada for their education remained in 
               <br />
               Canada. There were those, of course, who 
               <br />
               had to go back because of some business 
               <br />
               association in the island. I may say that 
               <br />
               Canada has beneﬁted during the past thirty 
               <br />
               or forty years from the large number of New- 
               <br />
               foundlanders who have remained here upon 
               <br />
               completion of their education.

               I should like to say just a word. Many 
               <br />
               tributes were paid in this house yesterday to 
               <br />
               the various groups and inﬂuences which, 
               <br />
               down through the years, have contributed to 
               <br />
               the drawing together of the old colony of 
               <br />

               I think one of the strongest and most 
               <br />
               important of those inﬂuences, which was not 
               <br />
               mentioned, is the number of young men and 
               <br />
               young women of Newfoundland who, through 
               <br />
               the years, have come to the universities and 
               <br />
               colleges of eastern Canada for the purpose 
               <br />
               of completing their education, and I refer 
               <br />
               particularly to the colleges and universities of 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia. It has been a delight to those 
               <br />
               institutions to have these welcome visitors 
               <br />
               who have made so signal a contribution to 
               <br />
               their academic life. When speaking a few 
               <br />
               minutes ago, one hon. member referred to 
               <br />
               the fact that, of those Newfoundland young 
               <br />
               people who came to Canada to complete their 
               <br />
               education, a great many stayed in Canada. 
               <br />
               Happily that has not been true in every case. 
               <br />
               Perhaps indicative of the importance of the 
               <br />
               bearing this has on the happy subject we 
               <br />
               are discussing tonight is the fact that four 
               <br />
               out of the six Newfoundland delegates, who 
               <br />
               came here to discuss with the representatives 
               <br />
               of the government of Canada the terms of 
               <br />
