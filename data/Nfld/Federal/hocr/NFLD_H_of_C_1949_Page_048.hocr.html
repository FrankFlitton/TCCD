               sure a great many members of parliament

               draws attention to the fact that, after the

               decision had been reached by the most 
               <br />
               democratic process that the people had had 
               <br />
               for many years, those who were in the minor-

               ity used the publicly—owned radio there to

               <br />
               the extent of some 50,000. On the other hand, 
               <br />
               the responsible government people point out 
               <br />
               that while they wanted to present their point

               of view in connection with appealing their

               <br />
               been denied access to the radio, and that they 
               <br />
               have not been given the same advantages as

               large sums of money came from outside New-

               <br />
               extremely serious charges, and I think that 
               <br />
               the people of Canada are entitled to informa-

               <br />

               When I was in Newfoundland on Decem-

               ber 20 my attention was drawn to a telegram 
               <br />
               which was posted in the post ofﬁce in Grand 
               <br />
               Falls, a notice asking people to ﬁll in their 
               <br />
               application forms for family allowances. I 
               <br />
               was later sent a form. At that time a great 
               <br />
               many people in Newfoundland were unwill- 
               <br />
               ing to accept the fact that Newfoundland was 
               <br />
               to be a part of Canada. They said to me: 
               <br />
               “By what authority are you Canadians com- 
               <br />
               ing into Newfoundland and distributing your 
               <br />
               propaganda?” A good deal was said about 
               <br />
               what family allowances were going to mean 
               <br />
               to Newfoundland, but while they were taking 
               <br />
               their case to the courts they thought it was 
               <br />
               quite unfair that Canadian family allowance 
               <br />
               forms should be circulated through the mail 
               <br />
               in Newfoundland, further aggravating the 
               <br />
               problem. I am aware of the justiﬁcation for 
               <br />
               this conduct. We had given a commitment 
               <br />
               to make family allowances payable after 
               <br />
               March 31, but some consideration should 
               <br />
               have been given to the feelings of the 71,000 
               <br />
               people who felt that circulating the family 
               <br />
               allowance forms and literature was dis-
