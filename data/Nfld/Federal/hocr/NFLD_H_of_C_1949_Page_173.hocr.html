               Hon. Douglas Abbott (Minister of Finance): 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, yesterday the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Rosedale (Mr. J ackman) asked Whether in 
               <br />
               view of the approval by the international 
               <br />

               <br />
               of newly-mined alloy gold to be used only for 
               <br />
               industrial or professional work at a premium 
               <br />
               of $6.50 a ﬁne ounce over the fund’s price of 
               <br />
               $35 a pure ounce, the government would 
               <br />
               extend the same right to Canadian gold pro- 
               <br />
               ducers. At that time I told him I had seen 
               <br />
               the press report but had no ofﬁcial informa- 
               <br />
               tion on the matter. I said I would make an 
               <br />
               inquiry. I have done so, and I ﬁnd that the 
               <br />
               international monetary fund has not in fact 
               <br />
               approved any speciﬁc sale of gold at a prem-

               The fund was consulted four months ago by the

               South African government with regard to a pro-

               trade in semi—processed gold which is contemplated 
               <br />

               considerable sales of gold at premium prices for

               other than legitimate industrial, professional or

               to dO‘ with production. They gave more 
               <br />
               direction in that regard than did the federal 
               <br />
               department of agriculture. At the beginning 
               <br />
               of the war however it was thought advisable 
               <br />
               that considerable direction should be given 
               <br />
               by the Department of Agriculture in Ottawa. 
               <br />
               Therefore we held conferences annually, 
               <br />
               beginning in 1939, with the provincial author— 
               <br />
               ities, farming organizations, the farm press 
               <br />
               and representatives of the federal Depart- 
               <br />
               ment of Agriculture, upon which occasions 
               <br />
               we discussed all questions relating to the 
               <br />
               necessity for greater production of one pro— 
               <br />
               duct as compared with another during the 
               <br />
               period of the war. That practice continued 
               <br />
               until two years ago, when we decided to hold 
               <br />
               conferences during the ﬁrst week of Decem- 
               <br />
               ber of each year and discuss the probable 
               <br />
               or possible program in connection with agri- 
               <br />
               cultural production for the succeeding year.
