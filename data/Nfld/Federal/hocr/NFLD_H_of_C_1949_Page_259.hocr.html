               Here is what Viscount Bennett said in regard 
               <br />
               to the method of making the change, as

               There has been a good deal of discussion about an 
               <br />
               amendment of the constitution being a political 
               <br />
               measure. Canada is the only one of the dominions 
               <br />
               in which a party majority can amend the constitu- 
               <br />

               Viscount Bennett was a man of consider-

               <br />
               ability and a well known Conservative. He 
               <br />
               makes it quite clear that a resolution by a

               majority in the houses of parliament in 
               <br />

               can hear the hullabaloo that would be raised 
               <br />
               in this house if the present government of 
               <br />
               Great Britain said that they would not pass

               lowed by other governments. Evidently, then, 
               <br />
               the purpose of the amendment moved by the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition is to create a new

               procedure, that in all matters the provinces 
               <br />
               must be consulted. We should examine the 
               <br />
               amendment very carefully, then. I think 
               <br />
               that was. done very well this afternoon by 
               <br />

               part of the amendment, which is really the 
               <br />

               <br />
               is: How much consent do we need; how much 
               <br />
               consent will we require; must we have the

               The matter of veto was mentioned this after- 
               <br />
               noon by the Secretary of State for External 
               <br />
               Affairs, and although I had referred to it 
               <br />
               when making my notes this morning I shall 
               <br />
               not refer to it now. But it is indeed important. 
               <br />
               Let me show how a precedent will be created 
               <br />
               if the amendment carries. I think it was 
               <br />
               the member for Macleod (Mr. Hansell) who, 
               <br />
               when supporting the amendment last night, 
               <br />
               made it mean so little that he did justice 
               <br />
               neither to himself nor to the amendment. I 
               <br />
               should like to quote a part of what he said, 
               <br />
               to be found on page 533 of Hansard, reading 
               <br />
               as follows: 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I call your attention. Mr. Speaker, to the wording 
               <br />
               of this amendment. The wording of this amend- 
               <br />
               ment does not ask that the provinces agree. It does 
               <br />
               not mention anything about a right or a wrong con- 
               <br />
               stitutional interpretation. As 1 read this amend- 
               <br />
               ment. it simply says to the government that we. as 
               <br />
               a parliament. are asking them to consult the prov- 
               <br />
               inces. After they have received the views of the 
               <br />
               provinces. then we will move an address to His 
               <br />
               Majesty. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Surely that is an over-simpliﬁcation of 
               <br />
               consultation. How does he know that we 
               <br />
               will move an address after consultation? 
               <br />
               Suppose all the provinces say, “No, we do 
               <br />
               not agree.” Are we then going to proceed 
               <br />
               with this address? If we are going to proceed 
               <br />
               with the address whether the provinces say 
               <br />
               yes or no, why consult the provinces at all? 
               <br />
               It is not as simple as the member for Macleod 
               <br />
               makes it out to be. Either consulting the 
               <br />
               provinces means something or it does not 
               <br />
               mean anything. If it means something it may 
               <br />
               affect what we will do here. If it does not 
               <br />
               mean anything, if we are going to do the same 
               <br />
               thing after we have consulted the provinces, 
               <br />
               regardless of what they say, as we would 
               <br />
               have done in the ﬁrst place, then we are 
               <br />
               merely spooﬁng the provinces.
