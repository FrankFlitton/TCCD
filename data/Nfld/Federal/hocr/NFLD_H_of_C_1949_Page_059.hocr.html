               But in this case it must be remembered 
               <br />
               that the government, acting on behalf of 
               <br />
               Canada, has signed a draft agreement which 
               <br />
               is now before us as an appendix to this bill. 
               <br />
               The same draft agreement has been signed

               by those who were called upon to represent

               Newfoundland, no matter what their status 
               <br />
               may have been. Therefore, the house must 
               <br />
               recognize that if the terms of union are to 
               <br />
               proceed they must of necessity proceed upon 
               <br />

               The principle involved is to agree or

               As I pointed out to the Prime Minister yes— 
               <br />
               terday, there is real objection to the inclusion 
               <br />
               in an agreement of this kind of a provision 
               <br />
               which, on the one hand, permits a province 
               <br />
               to do a particular thing and to carry out a 
               <br />
               particular type of production and, at the same 
               <br />
               time, places a limitation upon the sale of 
               <br />
               that product in other parts of Canada. It 
               <br />
               matters not that the particular provision may 
               <br />
               have no practical effect now that the decision 
               <br />
               of the supreme court has been given in regard 
               <br />
               to the constitutional authority of the parlia— 
               <br />
               ment of Canada to place restrictions on the 
               <br />
               manufacture and sale of oleomargarine. The 
               <br />
               fact remains that imbedded in this agreement 
               <br />
               is a principle which, if it were accepted as 
               <br />
               one which could apply to other types of pro- 
               <br />
               duction within Canada, would produce very 
               <br />
               unsatisfactory results. It could, in fact, pro— 
               <br />
               duce the very thing that confederation was 
               <br />
               intended to bring to an end; that is, any form 
               <br />
               of trade barrier between the provincial areas 
               <br />
               within Canada.

               For that reason I think this particular pro— 
               <br />
               vision might well be made the subject of 
               <br />
               discussion between the government of Canada 
               <br />
               and the representatives of Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               with the idea of deleting it so that a principle 
               <br />
               which may have very serious consequences 
               <br />
               in some other case might not be established 
               <br />
               as a precedent which would be contrary to 
               <br />
               the practice that has been so carefully fol— 
               <br />
               lowed ever since confederation. I strongly 
               <br />
               urge the Prime Minister (Mr. St. Laurent) to

               take this suggestion into consideration, 
               <br />

               I should like to point out also that in rela-

               tion to the ﬁnancial arrangements there is a 
               <br />
               restriction which does not apply to any other 
               <br />
               province. As I pointed out yesterday, there 
               <br />
               is a speciﬁc undertaking that, even though 
               <br />
               new ﬁnancial arrangements are made with 
               <br />
               other provinces, that is not to be taken as a 
               <br />
               ground for any claim by Newfoundland for 
               <br />
               similar consideration by way of adjustment 
               <br />
               of their position. Again, it seems to me, that 
               <br />
               is imposing a particular restriction on a single 
               <br />
               province, which is not consistent with the 
               <br />
               uniform type of arrangements which have 
               <br />
               applied to the other provinces of Canada.

               As Will be recalled, this provision is not 
               <br />
               something which can have only a theoretical 
               <br />
               importance. It is related to events which 
               <br />
               actually occurred in regard to the adjustment 
               <br />
               of ﬁnancial arrangements with other provin- 
               <br />
               ces during the past two years. When the 
               <br />
               then minister of ﬁnance, Mr. Ilsley, announced 
               <br />
               in this house in 1946 the terms the dominion 
               <br />
               government would put before the provinces 
               <br />
               as the alternative to the retention by the prov- 
               <br />
               inces of their major taxing powers, no 
               <br />
               provision was made for any changes to fol- 
               <br />
               low. But very shortly after those proposals, 
               <br />
               or I should say those arbitrary terms, had 
               <br />
               been stated in this house, negotiations took 
               <br />
               place between the dominion government and 
               <br />
               different provincial governments. As the result 
               <br />
               of arguments advanced by one provincial gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, some changes were made; and those 
               <br />
               changes were passed on to the other provin- 
               <br />
               ces. Then certain very advantageous terms 
               <br />
               were placed before British Columbia. I am 
               <br />
               not suggesting that those terms were not quite 
               <br />
               properly demanded by that province, because 
               <br />
               British Columbia has found even the present 
               <br />
               terms inadequate. Nevertheless there was an 
               <br />
               immediate demand from the premier of New 
               <br />
               Brunswick and other premiers that they 
               <br />
               should receive equally favourable terms, and 
               <br />
               so the bidding and the consequent adjustment 
               <br />
               went on. It was a form of horse trading 
               <br />
               between governments, such as had been 
               <br />
               anticipated by Sir Wilfrid Laurier so many 
               <br />
               years ago when be condemned this very prac- 
               <br />
               tice in such vigorous terms, saying that such 
               <br />
               arrangements usually were merely the pay- 
               <br />
               ment of a note given in return for political 
               <br />
               treachery. I remind hon. members that those 
               <br />
               are the words of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, not 
               <br />
               mine; but this type of horse trading over the 
               <br />
               subsidies that should be paid in return for 
               <br />
               taxing powers has produced precisely the 
               <br />
               result anticipated so many years ago by Sir 
               <br />
               Wilfrid Laurier.
