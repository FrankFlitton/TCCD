               <br />
               why that came about, which I think perhaps 
               <br />
               is worth mentioning. Lord Watson began the

               kind of judgment which reduced the central 
               <br />

               in the ofﬁce of- a gentleman named Judah P. 
               <br />
               Benjamin. This Judah P. Benjamin was a 
               <br />
               secretary of the confederate states, ﬁghting 
               <br />
               for states’ rights and to undermine union in 
               <br />
               the United States. He ﬂed the country and 
               <br />
               went to England, where he established a law 
               <br />
               practice which soon became very large. He 
               <br />
               taught the constitutional views he held, which 
               <br />
               were those of the confederate states rather 
               <br />
               than of the fathers of confederation.

               Again, speaking entirely from memory, I 
               <br />
               would mention some of Lord Elgin’s letters. 
               <br />
               The one to which I am going to refer I read 
               <br />
               several years ago—I was going to say many 
               <br />
               years ago—and I have not read 'it very 
               <br />
               recently, but I think it is recorded in “The 
               <br />
               Makers of Canada.” If you will read that 
               <br />
               letter you will ﬁnd that Lord Elgin said he 
               <br />
               was very glad indeed the fathers of confedera- 
               <br />
               tion did not follow the American system of 
               <br />
               federation, because that system placed all the 
               <br />
               residuary powers in the hands of the local 
               <br />
               and sovereign states. Our constitution did 
               <br />
               the reverse, and he thought we had a better 
               <br />
               constitution than that which had been written 
               <br />
               in the United States. That was Lord Elgin’s 
               <br />
               considered opinion.

               where we stand in relation to some of these

               Apart from that, I think we should consider

               ways and means of bringing our constitution

               cism of the constitution as it affects these 
               <br />
               two houses of parliament. The ﬁnger of 
               <br />
               scorn is pointed at the other' place because, 
               <br />
               for thirteen years at least, no appointments 
               <br />
               have been made to that house to represent 
               <br />
               the sixty per cent of the voting population 
               <br />
               of this country who are represented on this 
               <br />
               side of the house. This brings the other place 
               <br />
               into disrepute. As my hon. friends know, 
               <br />
               we have always urged the abolition of the 
               <br />
               Senate. Perhaps I should qualify that by 
               <br />
