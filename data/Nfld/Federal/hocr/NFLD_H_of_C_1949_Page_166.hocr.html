               gesting again to the Prime Minister that 
               <br />
               these restrictions dealing with a commodity 
               <br />
               such as margarine do not bear any direct 
               <br />
               relationship to the subject of the judgment to 
               <br />
               which I have referred, and to the material 
               <br />
               considered in that judgment, and that it is 
               <br />
               not competent for the dominion government 
               <br />
               to place such a restriction upon the use of 
               <br />
               margarine under the broad provisions of 
               <br />
               peace, order, and good government. If that 
               <br />
               is so, then such a provision would contravene 
               <br />
               section 121 of the British North America Act, 
               <br />
               and difﬁculties might arise in connection with 
               <br />
               this provision. It might be suggested that in 
               <br />
               subsection 2 of section 46 of the agreement 
               <br />
               there is a loophole which might make this 
               <br />
               restriction unimportant in any event, but I 
               <br />
               should like to point out to the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               that the situation in which we now ﬁnd our- 
               <br />
               selves is that this restriction has become 
               <br />
               effective. Section 46, subsection 2, of the 
               <br />
               agreement reads:

               province has already taken steps to prevent 
               <br />
               the use of margarine therein. I refer to the

               If the dominion government have the right

               to permit the manufacture of oleomargarine, 
               <br />

               <br />
               be asserting a right on some other ground 
               <br />
               than that which was put before the Supreme 
               <br />
               Court of Canada at the time this argument 
               <br />
               was being heard. The Supreme Court of 
               <br />
               Canada has found in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">itsyjudgment</span> on the 
               <br />
               stated case that it is not competent for the 
               <br />
               parliament of Canada to place a restriction 
               <br />
               on the manufacture and sale of margarine. If 
               <br />
               that is so, then I do not know how the 
               <br />
               dominion government is exercising that 
               <br />
               authority now, by agreement or otherwise, 
               <br />
               because the agreement becomes part of an 
               <br />
               act of this legislative body, and ultimately, 
               <br />
               if approved, of the parliament of Canada. It 
               <br />
               seems to me that in this matter the govern- 
               <br />
               ment is on the horns of a dilemma. If they 
               <br />
               are going to assert the right to permit the 
               <br />
               manufacture and restrain the movement, then 
               <br />
               they are asserting a right to deal with this 
               <br />
               subject. If they have the right to deal with 
               <br />
               this subject, then it is no use saying to the 
               <br />
               provinces that they no longer have the 
               <br />
               right to deal with it. They should exercise 
               <br />
               that right if in fact they feel that the law 
               <br />
               which was in force should have been con- 
               <br />
               tinued in force. If they now assert that they 
               <br />
               have the right to deal with this under the 
               <br />
               provision of peace, order and good govern— 
               <br />
               ment, then that right should have been 
               <br />
               asserted at the time this argument was being 
               <br />
               dealt with by the Supreme Court of Canada.

               I repeat that the question under considera-

               permitting the manufacture and sale of oleo-

               <br />
               the provision, in section 121 of our consti-
