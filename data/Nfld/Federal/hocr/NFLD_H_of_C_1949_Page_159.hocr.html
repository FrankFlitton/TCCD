               would be quite different from the old age

               since been worked out by agreement with the

               different. Were we to make that different

               <br />

               <br />
               will be the tenth province.

               There are nine provinces which have made 
               <br />
               provision for old age pensions, and the plan 
               <br />
               is that the provinces shall administer them. 
               <br />
               The plan is that the provinces shall make 
               <br />
               agreements with the dominion. When there 
               <br />
               was no province it would surely have been 
               <br />
               quite wrong for us to have made an agree- 
               <br />
               ment with a commission of government, or 
               <br />
               any other agency which would have provided 
               <br />
               for those payments. Our hope is, however, 
               <br />
               that a province will be set up. That is why 
               <br />
               we are meeting here, and why we are dis- 
               <br />
               cussing this matter. Our hope is that just as 
               <br />
               soon as that province is set up they will make 
               <br />
               an old age pension agreement along the lines 
               <br />
               of the agreements made by the nine other 
               <br />
               provinces of Canada. As we discussed this 
               <br />
               with the representatives of Newfoundland it 
               <br />
               seemed to us to be evident to them, as well 
               <br />
               as to us, that this was the only fair and 
               <br />
               right way to do it in accord with the will of 
               <br />
               parliament as expressed in 1927.

               I~feel that the union of Canada with New- 
               <br />
               foundland is a matter of supreme importance. 
               <br />
               I believe everyone in this house does; but I 
               <br />
               must say that as this discussion has pro- 
               <br />
               ceeded it has become clear that, while every 
               <br />
               group in this house is keenly in favour of 
               <br />
               that union, somehow they would like to see 
               <br />
               it worked out to their own advantage, and 
               <br />
               they are making one suggestion or another. 
               <br />
               Our feeling is that the agreement made with 
               <br />
               the representatives of Newfoundland can be 
               <br />
               supported on the basis of what is good for 
               <br />
               Canada and what their needs are in New- 
               <br />
               foundland, and that it is an agreement which 
               <br />
               would commend itself as containing fair and 
               <br />
               equitable terms as the basis of union.

               Mr. Drew: Since the incoming province of

               <br />

               <br />
               taxation was set because the rate would depend on 
               <br />
               how much of the social security program was 
               <br />
               brought into force.”

               If the ”source" alone were the person to whom I 
               <br />
               feel called upon to pay attention, even this would 
               <br />
               be very objectionable because it is the very sort 
               <br />
               of thing that led me to move the motion in the co- 
               <br />
               ordinating committee last Thursday that we should 
               <br />
               go into open conference. As you will recall, I 
               <br />
               said at that time that amongst the reasons why I 
               <br />
               thought we should go into open conference was to 
               <br />
               prevent this very sort of thing.
