               mission has been sent from Canada to the 
               <br />

               that de facto recognition by Canada of the

               ever, that since we recognized de facto the 
               <br />
               state of Israel the government has had con-

               <br />
               should like to ask a question of the Minister 
               <br />
               of Finance with reference to the withdrawal 
               <br />
               of the Bank of Canada branch from Charlotte- 
               <br />

               ability of having proper accommodation 
               <br />

               Hon. Douglas Abbott (Minister of Finance): 
               <br />
               The hon. member was good enough to give 
               <br />
               me notice of his question. The situation in 
               <br />
               Charlottetown was this: The Bank of Canada 
               <br />
               was obliged to vacate the premises which it 
               <br />
               occupied, and was unable to ﬁnd any other 
               <br />
               premises with suitable vault accommodation. 
               <br />
               Pending the obtaining of such premises the 
               <br />
               bank has made arrangements with the East- 
               <br />
               ern Trust Company of Charlottetown so that 
               <br />
               the people of that city and of Prince Edward 
               <br />
               Island as a whole will not be inconvenienced. 
               <br />
               I understand my colleague the Minister of 
               <br />
               Public Works (Mr. Fournier), in the prepara- 
               <br />
               tion of the plans for the new public building 
               <br />
               in Charlottetown, is taking into account the 
               <br />
               needs of the Bank of Canada at that point.
