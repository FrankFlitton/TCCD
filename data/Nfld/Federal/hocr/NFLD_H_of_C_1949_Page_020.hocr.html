               in order to discuss at this time, parliament

               I would remind hon. members that the 
               <br />
               terms of union which have been tabled and 
               <br />
               which will be submitted to this house for its 
               <br />
               consideration—and, if it sees ﬁt, for its 
               <br />
               approval—were not arrived at in one or two 
               <br />
               days. Long and protracted negotiations took 
               <br />
               place in order to settle those terms. Those 
               <br />
               terms had been preceded by a fairly full pro- 
               <br />
               posal arrived at after months of delibera- 
               <br />
               tion last year. After the proposal had been 
               <br />
               approved by a majority vote of the people of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland in a referendum, the precise 
               <br />
               terms were under discussion here for 
               <br />
               upwards of two months, and the terms were 
               <br />
               not ﬁnally signed until December 11. I was 
               <br />
               the chairman of the Canadian committee that 
               <br />
               had to do with the negotiations with the 
               <br />
               representatives from Newfoundland; and I 
               <br />
               regarded the completion of that undertaking 
               <br />
               as something of consequence to the people of 
               <br />
               Canada, yes, and possibly of consequence to 
               <br />
               the people of the world. I felt that, so long 
               <br />
               as there was any hope that we could get that 
               <br />
               agreement into shape to have it for sub- 
               <br />
               mission at this ﬁfth session of the twentieth 
               <br />
               parliament, it was worth while working at it. 
               <br />
               We worked at it until December 11, and on 
               <br />
               that date we put our signatures to the docu- 
               <br />
               ment, subject of course to ratification by 
               <br />
               parliament.

               After December 11 it would have been 
               <br />
               rather difﬁcult, and not very convenient for 
               <br />
               the members of this house, if an attempt had 
               <br />
               been made to get them down here before

               got it for eleven. It is given from the year 
               <br />
               1938 to 1948 both inclusive, and, unless my 
               <br />
               counting is wrong, that is eleven years. There 
               <br />
               were ﬁfty-ﬁve cases in which appeals were 
               <br />
               asserted, or sought to be asserted, from judg- 
               <br />
               ments of the Supreme Court of Canada. In 
               <br />
               one case the appeal was withdrawn. In ﬁve 
               <br />
               the appeals were allowed. In forty-nine cases 
               <br />
               the appeals were dismissed and the judg- 
               <br />
               ments of the Supreme Court of Canada were 
               <br />
               afﬁrmed. In no one of the ﬁve cases in which 
               <br />
               the appeals were allowed was there any 
               <br />
               constitutional issue between the dominion 
               <br />
               and the provinces. That is the record for the 
               <br />
               last eleven years in these ﬁfty-ﬁve times 
               <br />
