               seek to impress upon the Prime Minister the 
               <br />
               desirability of giving consideration to the 
               <br />
               effect of the last part of section 27 (2). As he 
               <br />
               pointed out, the limitation on the review of 
               <br />
               a tax agreement would relate to the exercise 
               <br />
               by Newfoundland of the option to have its 
               <br />
               tax payments cover a period of eight years. 
               <br />

               To simplify the explanation given by the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister, it would seem to me that 
               <br />
               what he suggested was that, if Newfoundland 
               <br />
               was to have the advantage of this longer 
               <br />
               period of subsidy payments, it should not be 
               <br />
               open to them to have a reconsideration. I 
               <br />
               believe that argument might conceivably 
               <br />
               have some validity, if the payments over the 
               <br />
               eight—year period were on a higher level than 
               <br />
               in the shorter period. But the fact is that 
               <br />
               the subsidy payments are at the same level 
               <br />
               for either period.

               That being so, it does not seem to me that 
               <br />
               Newfoundland gains anything more or gets 
               <br />
               anything less by extending the period. It 
               <br />
               seems to me Newfoundland should be in pre-

               <br />
               might take the eight—year option, the inclu- 
               <br />
               sion of such a limitation might well cause 
               <br />

               I would remind hon. members that in spite 
               <br />
               of the repeated suggestions outside, and the 
               <br />
               suggestion made not so often in the house 
               <br />
               since I have been here, that it was only the 
               <br />
               province of Ontario, with a certain amount of 
               <br />
               support from the province of Quebec, that 
               <br />
               objected to the tax proposals, the fact is that 
               <br />
               the premier of Nova Scotia, at the time the 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia legislature was ﬁnally called 
               <br />
               upon to accept these terms, made it perfectly 
               <br />
               clear that the government of that province 
               <br />
               would not renew the present tax agreement. 
               <br />
               He made it perfectly clear that there must be 
               <br />
               a review of taxation, or there would be no 
               <br />
               continuance; and that he was doing it only as 
               <br />
               a temporary measure. I believe the premier 
               <br />
               of Alberta has been equally clear in the mat- 
               <br />
               ter, stating that the present arrangement is 
               <br />
               not satisfactory from their point of view. To 
               <br />
               use the exact words of the premier of Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia: The government has not seen the last 
               <br />
               of my bonnets and me.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               That being so, I think it is only inviting 
               <br />
               unnecessary dispute and discussion at the end 
               <br />
               of the three-year period the agreements will 
               <br />
               have to run for those provinces which have 
               <br />
               signed them if, in the terms given to a tenth 
               <br />
               province, there is a limitation which would‘ 
               <br />
               apply to their acceptance of a longer period. I 
               <br />
               would point out to hon. members that it is 
               <br />
               unlikely such an option would have been 
               <br />
               included, unless there had been a suggestion 
               <br />
               that it was desired. Obviously there must 
               <br />
               have been something to suggest this different 
               <br />
               arrangement with Newfoundland, and there 
               <br />
               would seem to be some likelihood that this 
               <br />
               option will be exercised. If it is exercised 
               <br />
               and if we are to take the word of Premier 
               <br />
               Macdonald and Premier Manning of Alberta, 
               <br />
               to say nothing of the fact that at the time 
               <br />
               there was such a discussion the other prov- 
               <br />
               inces would be considered, then I think it is 
               <br />
               most important that the province of New- 
               <br />
               foundland should be free at that time to dis- 
               <br />
               cuss without restraint or restriction the 
               <br />
