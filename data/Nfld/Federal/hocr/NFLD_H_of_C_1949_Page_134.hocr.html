               customs provisions, but respecting corpora- 
               <br />
               tion taxes, in the case of a company operating 
               <br />
               into the Ungava iron-ore ﬁeld, the amount 
               <br />
               involved might be quite substantial.

               Mr. Abbott: There is, I repeat, absolutely

               Mr. Knowles: It is very hard to discuss this 
               <br />
               matter without getting into the questions I 
               <br />
               have in mind about the Quebec, North Shore 
               <br />
               and Labrador Railway Company, but I will 
               <br />
               try at this time to stick to the taxation 
               <br />
               aspect of it. This parliament, over our vote, 
               <br />
               passed chapter 80 of the statutes of 1947 
               <br />
               incorporating the Quebec, North Shore and 
               <br />
               Labrador Railway, and enabling it to go up 
               <br />
               into the north country to the border of Lab- 
               <br />
               rador. If, on the basis of the rights and 
               <br />
               privileges this parliament gave to it, that rail- 
               <br />
               way company has in turn secured a special 
               <br />
               contract with Newfoundland which becomes 
               <br />
               of particular value when Newfoundland be— 
               <br />
               comes a province of Canada, under subsec- 
               <br />
               tion 4 it does seem to me it is a matter of 
               <br />
               importance.
