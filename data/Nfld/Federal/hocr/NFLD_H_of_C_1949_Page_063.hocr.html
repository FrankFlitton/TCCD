               Under the legislation administered by the

               leader of the opposition, it has been for a

               hon. gentleman was the premier for several 
               <br />
               years. That was not only something done by 
               <br />
               the provinces. So that it might be fully 
               <br />
               effective throughout the whole dominion, in 
               <br />
               spite of the fact that the dominion has juris- 
               <br />
               diction in interprovincial trade, there were 
               <br />
               introduced into the Canada Temperance Act 
               <br />

               <br />
               provisions which are now sections 168 and 
               <br />
               following of the Canada Temperance Act, 
               <br />
               which is itself chapter 196 of the Revised 
               <br />
               Statutes of Canada, 1927. That makes it 
               <br />
               an offence punishable under the terms of the 
               <br />
               legislation of the parliament of Canada to 
               <br />
               transport or have in one’s possession any 
               <br />
               intoxicant—and the word is deﬁned by the 
               <br />
               statute—contrary to the provisions of the laws 
               <br />
               of the province where the person happens to 
               <br />
               be. Therefore, in order to make effective this 
               <br />
               barrier to the trade in intoxicants produced 
               <br />

               <br />
               to be sold in other parts of Canada, the 
               <br />
               legislatures of the nine provinces of Canada 
               <br />
               and the federal parliament agreed in setting 
               <br />
               up this concurrent system which makes it an 
               <br />
               offence punishable under the laws of Canada 
               <br />
