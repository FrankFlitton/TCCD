               The colonies represented at the Quebec

               But between Canada and Newfoundland in 
               <br />
               1948 there were great differences in the

               system of taxation and in the administrative 
               <br />

               monized with the existing fundamental basis

               of our constitution, the British North America

               no substantial departures from the provisions

               guarantees is an appeal to the governor in
