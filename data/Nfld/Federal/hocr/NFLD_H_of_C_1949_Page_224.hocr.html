               The leader of the opposition has moved

               that the different provincial governments be

               <br />
               something better, I shall vote for it. At least 
               <br />
               it embodies the principle that the provinces 
               <br />
               should not be entirely ignored in connection 
               <br />
               with amendments to the pact of 1867. I hold, 
               <br />
               however, as I did last Tuesday, that not only 
               <br />
               should the government consult the different 
               <br />
               provinces which were parties to the pact, but 
               <br />
               should obtain their consent to any amend-

               justify our securing the consent of the prov-

               inces, especially of those which pay the cost of 
               <br />
               such union.

               considerable increase in our already too heavy 
               <br />
               burdens. The Prime Minister (Mr. St.

               <br />

               <br />
               the statement he made the other day. Some 
               <br />
               economists are unanimous in the belief that 
               <br />
               we are assuming heavy liabilities. And who 
               <br />
               is going to pay in the long run? The prov-

               The Canadian proposals in connection with the 
               <br />
               incorporation of Newfoundland “are not devoid of

               It can be taken for granted that for many years

               that it was a very good thing for Great Britain, 
               <br />

               Great Britain is more anxious than anyone 
               <br />

               ever generous towards Great Britain, has 
               <br />

               In the third place, I further object because 
               <br />
               the union compels us to increase our defence 
               <br />
               budget. According to statements which have 
               <br />
               already been made, our expenditures for 
               <br />
               national defence will be greatly increased this 
               <br />
               year. If we take into consideration the fact 
               <br />
               that Canada, with a population of only twelve 
               <br />
               and a half million people has just as much 
               <br />
               territory to protect as the United States whose 
               <br />
               population is now 150 million, we should not 
               <br />
               think of increasing our present territory. 
               <br />
               There will result increased expenditures

               Quebec taxpayer, who is already overtaxed. 
               <br />
               We would imitate the frog who tried to swell 
               <br />
               itself up to the size of an ox. We are heading 
               <br />
               for a blow-out.

               us into international conﬂict. We shall be
