               about that, but there is another point I wish

               to have an empire conference like the ones 
               <br />
               we used to have every ten years, to take up 
               <br />
               questions of trade, defence and migration. Sir 
               <br />
               Wilfrid Laurier had one while he was in power. 
               <br />
               He proposed a policy for this country that 
               <br />
               when Britain was at war, Canada was at war 
               <br />
               also. That was the policy we had in two wars. 
               <br />
               I have referred to the ﬁrst war when 3. mil- 
               <br />
               lion men went voluntarily, under their own 
               <br />
               status and autonomy, and 130,000 fell. In 
               <br />
               the second war the situation was the same, 
               <br />
               except that ten times the number went. That 
               <br />
               was the policy: when Britain is at war, Canada 
               <br />
               is at war. If we go into a third war I venture 
               <br />
               to say the policy will be the same.
