               Mr. Abbott: No valuation is placed on them. 
               <br />
               We take them over as an asset of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment of Newfoundland. As the Prime Minis- 
               <br />
               ter indicated a moment ago, we have assumed 
               <br />
               the payment of the sterling debt, a large por- 
               <br />
               tion of which was incurred in the building 
               <br />
               of the railway, among other things. We will 
               <br />
               own the railway as an asset of the Dominion 
               <br />
               of Canada. As I indicated, the offsetting 
               <br />
               liability is a portion of the debt. I might add, 
               <br />
               the arrangement provides that the railway 
               <br />
               will be left with adequate working capital,

               Mr. Jackman: After what my leader has 
               <br />
               said in welcoming Newfoundland into con- 
               <br />

               accept the young lady without any dowry 
               <br />
               whatsoever. But this committee is entitled 
               <br />
               to know just what revenues we are likely to 
               <br />
               receive from taxation in Newfoundland and 
               <br />
               also what the expenditures will be. The 
               <br />
               information which the Minister of Finance 
               <br />
               has given has been anything but illuminating. 
               <br />
               I do hope that he has not entered into a ﬁnan- 
               <br />
               cial transaction on the scanty basis of infor- 
               <br />
               mation which he has so far given to the com-

               The document which was given to hon.

               <br />
               conference series published in 1948. One

               <br />

               dealing with the federal revenues which we 
               <br />
               can expect from Newfoundland, that the

               ﬁrm of accountants—I am sure they were 
               <br />
               very capable—who upped these revenues to 
               <br />
               an estimated $26,922,000. Do we accept that

               revision of the estimate of revenue which we 
               <br />

               The delegation met here with our own repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives for weeks, if not for months. 
               <br />
               Surely there must be a very good idea in the 
               <br />
               minds of members of the government as to 
               <br />
               what a reasonable estimate is. I am asking 
               <br />
               a speciﬁc question. Is the reasonable estimate 
               <br />
               in the eyes of our own advisers and our own 
               <br />
               responsible ministers $20 million or is it 
               <br />
               nearly $27 million, which was the ﬁnal estim- 
               <br />
               ate of the Newfoundland delegation? That 
               <br />
               is a simple question. Surely the government 
               <br />
               holds at least a belief that it must be nearly 
               <br />
               one or the other. I know that when we 
               <br />
               apply our taxation laws to Newfoundland we 
               <br />
               get a certain ﬁgure. We do not know exactly 
               <br />
               what it is, but we must have made some 
               <br />
               estimate which we hoped would bear some 
               <br />
               accuracy, because it is simply amazing, when 
               <br />
               the budgets are brought down year after year 
               <br />
               and estimates are made running up to 
               <br />
               hundreds of millions of dollars, how accurate 
               <br />
               they sometimes are, although I admit that in 
               <br />
               the last few years the surpluses have been a 
               <br />
               little higher than the government could ever 
               <br />
