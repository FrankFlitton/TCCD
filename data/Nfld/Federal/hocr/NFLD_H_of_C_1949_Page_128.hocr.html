               Mr. MacNicol: I want to make an observa- 
               <br />
               tion arising out of the remarks made by the 
               <br />
               Minister of Transport. I do not do so by 
               <br />
               way of criticism, because I feel that the 
               <br />
               Newfoundland railway must be accepted as 
               <br />
               it is. Acting through the minister’s depart- 
               <br />
               ment, which will be directing the railway 
               <br />
               companythat operates the road for Canada, 
               <br />
               our duty will be to make an accurate surVey, 
               <br />
               as speedily as possible, of what must be done 
               <br />
               on the road from St. John’s to Port aux 
               <br />
               Basques to put it into better shape for 
               <br />
               operating speedier and better trains. For a 
               <br />
               year or two we would not be able to say 
               <br />
               much about the railway. I would hope the 
               <br />
               minister would ask the Canadian National 
               <br />
               Railways, when they become the authority 
               <br />
               for operating the road, to follow up that 
               <br />
               problem in a businesslike way, and make a 
               <br />
               thorough survey of all that is required to 
               <br />
               give the railway a chance to exist and to 
               <br />
               make some returns. It cannot do so today 
               <br />
               because it is in a run-down condition.

               Mr. Chevrier: I can tell my hon. friend that 
               <br />
               a preliminary survey has been made by two 
               <br />
               of the outstanding engineers of the Cana- 
               <br />
               dian National Railways who went down there 
               <br />
               and made a report. I have that report. It 
               <br />
               gives a general idea of the present position. 
               <br />
               It was from that report that I was able to 
               <br />
               give some of the information to the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Mackenzie. I agree, however, 
               <br />
               that a more complete report might be 
               <br />
               required after the railway is taken over. 
               <br />
               The report I have was one that was obtained 
               <br />
               for the purpose of ascertaining what the 
               <br />
               position of the railway was, the condition of 
               <br />
               the equipment, the stations, the line, and so 
               <br />
               on. My hon. friend knows that it is a smaller- 
               <br />
               gauge railway than the Canadian National 
               <br />
               railways. But he can rest assured that a 
               <br />
               more exhaustive report will be obtained of 
               <br />
               necessity.

               Mr. Bentley: I mentioned this matter before 
               <br />
               when we were on the section, and I pointed 
               <br />
               out that I was not satisﬁed with certain parts 
               <br />
               of it. Since then I have studied the replies 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister gave at that time. The 
               <br />
               Prime Minister pointed out that it was the 
               <br />
               wish of the Newfoundland delegates that the 
               <br />
               educational system of the new province be 
               <br />
               left in the hands of the denominational 
               <br />
               churches. As I pointed out at that time, this 
               <br />
               system is quite different from that in the 
               <br />
               other provinces. It was emphasized also by 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister—and I notice in the 
               <br />
               bulletin put out by the Department of Exter- 
               <br />
               nal Affairs that it is their interpretation of 
               <br />
               it—that it cannot be changed by any future 
               <br />
               legislature unless the denominations them- 
               <br />
               selves request it. That being so, it seems to 
               <br />
               me that Canada is being a party to an agree- 
               <br />
               ment which might become abhorrent to some 
               <br />
               future legislative body of that province, 
               <br />
               which body will be unable to deal with it. 
               <br />
               I do not want it to be taken that I have any 
               <br />
               disrespect for the clergy or the churches. 
               <br />
               I do not want anyone to think that I am 
               <br />
               protesting against any one church. I do not 
               <br />
               have any disrespect for them. On the con— 
               <br />
               trary, I have a great deal of respect for a 
               <br />
               great many of them. I am heartily in sup— 
               <br />
               port of everything that has been said about 
               <br />
               freedom of worship for the people, and all 
               <br />
               that. But I also want to point out that there 
               <br />
               have been times in the history of. the world 
               <br />
               when narrow and bigoted churchmen have 
               <br />
               attempted, successfully for long periods of 
               <br />
               time, interference with educational processes, 
               <br />
               particularly where their ideas came into con- 
               <br />
               ﬂict with new scientiﬁc discoveries or pro- 
               <br />

               A report written by an investigator from 
               <br />
               Britain indicates that 60 per cent of the

               nearly as I can ﬁnd out from the answers to 
               <br />
               the questions that I and others have asked, 
               <br />
               the legislature will have practically no con-

               division of some department is to have con- 
               <br />
               trol over education there? Who is to have the

               authority to lay down a curriculum for the 
               <br />
