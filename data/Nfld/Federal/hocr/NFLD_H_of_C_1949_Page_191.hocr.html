               were the provinces consulted? No; they

               which, through the Charlottetown conference 
               <br />
               of 1864, confederation was started, is in this 
               <br />
               House of Commons today, listening to this 
               <br />
               historic debate. I ask again: Were the prov— 
               <br />
               inces consulted over the entry of Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island? Again the answer is no.

               Then I ask: Did Canada become strong 
               <br />
               when the great western provinces of Alberta 
               <br />
               and Saskatchewan were formed in 1905? It 
               <br />
               was done by act of the imperial parliament, 
               <br />
               and by the provisions of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act, just as was the inclusion of 
               <br />
               Manitoba. It was done by a provision amend— 
               <br />
               ing the British North America Act, in exactly 
               <br />
               the same way that is being followed on this 
               <br />
               occasion.

               Were the provinces consulted? The answer 
               <br />
               is again no. The only ﬁve precedents we 
               <br />
               have are in accord with procedure we are 
               <br />
               following today. This is no thin edge that 
               <br />
               is going to break the Canadian constitution. 
               <br />
               This is extending the hand of friendship and 
               <br />
               of good neighbourliness to our sister island 
               <br />

               <br />
               objective which all of us have had in our 
               <br />
               hearts and in our minds for so long. This is not 
               <br />
               a work of destruction; this is not a challenge 
               <br />
               to the Canadian constitution. This is an 
               <br />
               exercise of the rights of this parliament, 
               <br />
               within its constitutional rights.
