               tion addressed to His Majesty the King ask- 
               <br />
               ing for conﬁrmation of an agreement which 
               <br />
               was unanimously adopted by this house. Per- 
               <br />
               haps I should qualify the word “unani-. 
               <br />
               mously” because I believe one voice, that of 
               <br />
               an Independent member of this house, was 
               <br />
               raised last week, when the motion was ﬁnally 
               <br />
               put, to call “on division”. Consequently the 
               <br />
               amendment, which has just been placed 
               <br />
               before the house by the leader of the opposi- 
               <br />
               tion (Mr. Drew), is an extraordinary one in 
               <br />
               view of the fact that last week all parties ‘ 
               <br />
               supported the agreement that was then before 
               <br />
               the house. It is, of course, a surprising move 
               <br />
               on the part of the ofﬁcial opposition. I sup- 
               <br />
               pose that none of us were quite prepared for 
               <br />
               a reversal of the opinion expressed by them 
               <br />
               last week in the House of Commons. That is

               precisely what it appears to me to be.

               that under the British North America Act,
