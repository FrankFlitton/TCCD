               Now, as to the theory of the confederation

               agreement or that of the statute, our oppo- 
               <br />
               nents tell us they want to put up a fence and 
               <br />
               set on one side of the fence those who favour 
               <br />
               confederation, and on the other side those 
               <br />
               who favour adherence to the statute. We 
               <br />
               are not concerned now, I think, with defend-

               ing an opponent or a bitter enemy of con-

               federation. We are merely speaking of those 
               <br />
               who favour confederation and of those who 
               <br />
               swear by the statute. The statute merely fol- 
               <br />
               lowed the agreement; the wording of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act is simply that of 
               <br />
               the confederation agreement.

               Now, may I ask you one thing? If we are 
               <br />
               to abide by the principle of the confederation 
               <br />

               <br />
               provinces that existed at the time of the 
               <br />
               initial pact, since the others had not yet 
               <br />
               entered? Everyone knows where that would 
               <br />
               lead us. Or should we consult all the prov- 
               <br />
               inces? This might bring about rather amus- 
               <br />
               ing results. On this point, I should like to

               An amendment which was almost identical to

               the one now under consideration was then

               <br />
               it was worded as follows:
