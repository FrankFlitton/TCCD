               tralization is essential. Already since the 
               <br />
               war we have seen serious unemployment 
               <br />
               affecting Halifax, Trenton, Cape Breton, and 
               <br />
               other maritime industrial centres. When the 
               <br />
               closing of the Trenton steel works and its 
               <br />
               removal to Montreal was being investigated, 
               <br />
               the president of Dosco defended it on the

               ground that to continue or expand the 
               <br />
               industry in Trenton would be uneconomical. 
               <br />
               Well, it is all very well to say, as the leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition said, that—— 
               <br />
               ——the great developments that have taken place in 
               <br />
               the nine provinces have very largely been the result 
               <br />
               of the wise and intimate guidance of the provincial 
               <br />
               governments in each of those provinces. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               But the function of the national government 
               <br />
               surely must be to give wise guidance to the 
               <br />
               national economy, so that all parts of the 
               <br />
               country may share in the development of our 
               <br />
               resources and the beneﬁts derived therefrom. 
               <br />
               In other words, this parliament should have 
               <br />
               a positive economic policy for all Canada. 
               <br />
               What is needed is a national policy to provide 
               <br />
               the maritimes, now including Newfoundland, 
               <br />
               with the means to supply opportunities for 
               <br />
               maritime youth in the maritime region, just as 
               <br />
               we should have a policy to provide oppor- 
               <br />
               tunities for prairie youth in the prairie region 
               <br />
               and for Paciﬁc youth in the Paciﬁc region. 
               <br />
               The centralization trend, economically and 
               <br />
               ﬁnancially, can be reversed only by the 
               <br />
               national government, which must have both 
               <br />
               the ﬁnancial resources and the power to 
               <br />
               achieve a positive development program.

               I suggest to the house that we might ﬁnd 
               <br />
               some inspiration in what has been done in the 
               <br />
               United Kingdom since the war to reverse a 
               <br />

               not only socialist theory but economic neces-

               sity which has caused the Labour government 
               <br />
               to nationalize some facilities and to propose 
               <br />
               the nationalization of some others, including 
               <br />
               the steel industry. By controlling the bank—

               British government has encouraged the build-

               <br />
               important factories, more than four hundred

               years before the war misery, poverty and

               The effect of this is also improved housing,

               improved health and a tremendous drop in

               the death rate, particularly the infant mor-

               <br />
               was 95-82 per thousand, far above the

               national average of 61-92. Last year, because

               Side by side with the decentralization of 
               <br />
               industry, requiring for our own country, 
               <br />
               incidentally, a program of housing, the ex— 
               <br />
               penditures on ill—health will drop sharply. 
               <br />
               The effects of malnutrition and overcrowding 
               <br />
               are minimized or largely prevented when 
               <br />
               you have industry, employment and all that 
               <br />
               goes with it. I say, then, that the entry of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland into confederation should be 
               <br />
               an occasion when this parliament should be 
               <br />
               considering policies that will give new hope 
               <br />
               to the maritime area. The problems of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland are similar to those of the 
               <br />
               maritime areas; transportation, economic de- 
               <br />
               velopment and the marketing of products. 
               <br />
               I say this is a challenge presented to this 
               <br />
               parliament at the present time, a challenge to 
               <br />
               adopt a really imaginative national policy.

               It is my contention that no single province, 
               <br />
               no matter how rich, can alone undertake this 
               <br />
               kind of thing successfully, for it requires a 
               <br />
               careful survey of the primary products and 
               <br />
               resources of the country so that a decision 
               <br />
               can be reached as to the types of industry 
               <br />
               which should be located in the several areas 
               <br />
               that are under—industrialized or depressed. 
               <br />
               Then, of course, an intelligent national plan 
               <br />
               for the utilization of our resources is required. 
               <br />
               Along with that a conservation policy should 
               <br />
               be formulated, adopted and indeed put into 
               <br />
               effect. I know that, when Newfoundland 
               <br />
               comes into this confederation, Newfoundland 
               <br />
               as well as our other provinces will need a 
               <br />
               policy of that description for the conserva- 
               <br />
               tion and intelligent use of resources. Along 
               <br />
               with that should go a national transportation 
               <br />
               policy which would serve the nation instead 
               <br />
