               <br />
               adopted on December 4, 1866. Later on, these 
               <br />
               resolutions were included in paragraph 146 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act, which said 
               <br />
               that when Newfoundland decided to join con— 
               <br />
               federation it could do so by the procedure 
               <br />
               provided in section 146. It is true that this 
               <br />
               section cannot be applied exactly today 
               <br />
               because Newfoundland has no legislature at 
               <br />
               the present time. That is a question of pro— 
               <br />
               cedure and not a question of right. I submit 
               <br />
               that when the three provinces interested at 
               <br />
               that time—because at that time Quebec and 
               <br />
               Ontario formed only one province known as 
               <br />
               the union of upper and lower Canada—agreed 
               <br />
               to form the confederation, they decided by 
               <br />
               the different articles of the resolutions which 
               <br />
               they sanctioned that Newfoundland could be 
               <br />
               added to confederation on equitable terms. 
               <br />
               The provinces were consulted and gave their 
               <br />
               consent in advance not only to the consulta- 
               <br />
               tion as provided by the amendment of the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition but to the fact that 
               <br />
               they would admit Newfoundland into con— 
               <br />
               federation at any time. What we are discuss- 
               <br />
               ing is only the terms and conditions provided 
               <br />
               for in the admission. As the resolution sets 
               <br />
               out, that admission must be on equitable terms 
               <br />
               to be decided on between Newfoundland and 
               <br />
               the different provinces of the country now 
               <br />
               known as the Dominion of Canada. When 
               <br />
               we say that we are amending the constitution, 
               <br />
               that we are changing the law which governs 
               <br />
               our country, we are saying something which 
               <br />
               is not true, because the provinces interested 
               <br />

               <br />
               not really amending the constitution; it is just 
               <br />
               a change in the procedure determined by

               <br />
               We are not being asked to change the British

               during this debate and I regret that there

               <br />
               not to try to convince anyone as to how they

               should vote on the motion and the amend-

               ments before us; it is simply to make my own 
               <br />
               position clear as to why I cannot vote for the

               amendment moved by the leader of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               vote for the motion.

               It is not contended by the supporters of 
               <br />
               the amendment that the terms of union are 
               <br />
               not satisfactory. I think the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Kamloops (Mr. Fulton) made that quite clear. 
               <br />
               It seems to me that the whole question is one 
               <br />
               of the procedure to be followed in seeking 
               <br />
               the amendment that will bring Newfoundland 
               <br />

               lution moved yesterday by the Prime Minister 
               <br />

               has been followed in the various amendments
