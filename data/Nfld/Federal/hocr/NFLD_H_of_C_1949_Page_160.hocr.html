               and perhaps that can be forgiven because of 
               <br />

               we were discussing this the dominion gov-

               the then Prime Minister of Canada put for-

               Mr. Ashby: Riding along here in the 
               <br />
               caboose it is almost impossible to accurately 
               <br />
               follow anything being said at the other end 
               <br />

               <br />
               the leader of the Progressive Conservative 
               <br />
               party. I do not know whether I correctly 
               <br />
               understood the minister when he spoke a 
               <br />
               short time ago, but I thought he asked 
               <br />
               whether anyone in this house believed social 
               <br />
               services could be rendered to the people by 
               <br />
               other than contributory means. If that was 
               <br />
               what he asked, let me say that I certainly 
               <br />
               know of other methods. If people are asked 
               <br />
               to contribute part of their earnings toward 
               <br />
               any social services whatever, it means they 
               <br />
               will have to go without something. In the 
               <br />
               case of workingmen it means they will have 
               <br />
               to go without a good roast of beef and eat

               repeated often enough beginning with little

               children, we can get university presidents,

               presidents of great manufacturing companies,

               many preachers and teachers to believe it, 
               <br />
               and then ﬁnally the people themselves. It is 
               <br />
               not true that the only source of money is 
               <br />
               from the pockets of the people, and it never 
               <br />
               has been true. Yet people actually believe 
               <br />
               that statement to be true. It is a gen- 
               <br />
               eral assumption, even right here in this 
               <br />
               house, that the only source of money is from 
               <br />
               the people. I have mentioned <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span> that 
               <br />
               people do not make money. People may earn 
               <br />
               it, but they do not make it. If the Imperial 
               <br />
               Oil Company want gasoline, they go to the 
               <br />
               source for it. They are drilling now half a 
               <br />
               mile from our farm in the hope of striking 
               <br />
               the source of gasoline. If we want money for 
               <br />
               any purpose, it matters not what that purpose 
               <br />
               may be, it is our duty to go to the source for 
               <br />
               money, not to impoverish the people.
