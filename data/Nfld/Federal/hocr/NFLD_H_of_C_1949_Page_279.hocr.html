               Mr. Diefenbaker: Mr. Speaker, what the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister has stated represents gener-

               <br />
               report of Mr. Greber may be expected. 
               <br />
               There is a great deal of interest in it. I

               understand that a committee has been sit-
