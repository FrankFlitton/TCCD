               had; therefore Confederation is out of the question. I have thus, Sir, given my opinion on 
               <br />
               a point which is sure to meet with popular disfavour, but I am proud to support the Executive 
               <br />
               when I think it is right; and I would share the responsibility of a measure which would make 
               <br />
               that Executive obnoxious to blame. I have no chronic feeling of opposition to Government. 
               <br />
               I have no objection to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">indiv‘duals,</span> nor do I impute to them sordid motives, but in the matter 
               <br />
               of Confederation the Executive of this Colony are in a false position; they act primarily, 
               <br />
               not for the good of the Colony, but for the good, or supposed good, of Great Britain; and 
               <br />
               they exercise the power of Government in a matter in which the interests of the Colony 
               <br />
               are mainly at stake to carry out, and effect an organic change of great importance to local 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interests.</span> It is somewhat unfair to me to say I impute motives to the Executive. 1 only 
               <br />
               quarrel with them when they place themselves in a false position, as in the question of 
               <br />
               education; and in this, as in education, I say they oppose their own views to the views <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of,</span> 
               <br />
               -the,well understood wishes of all classes of the community; and here the carry through a 
               <br />
               scheme of Confederation; they start the stone, and it is hard to see how or where it will roll. 
               <br />
               I sincerer feel for their position. The Colony will demand representative institutions, and they 
               <br />
               will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forced</span> to yield them or back out of the position they have undertaken. The answer of 
               <br />
               the Executive Government to this is as given by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Attorney-General. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Attorney-</span> 
               <br />
               General <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">says</span> that after Confederation we are bound to have what we require—Responsible 
               <br />
               Government. This is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">takingr</span> the matter for granted. It may be attained, but with a struggle. 
               <br />
               It is impossible to doubt that the Executive of the new Province will oppose representative 
               <br />
               Government or any diminution of their own rights or their own power. He says it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inoppor—</span> 
               <br />
               tune and beside the question. The Hon. Member for Cariboo (Dr. Carrall) says: “If the 
               <br />
               people of British Columbia want Responsible Government no power on earth can prevent their 
               <br />
               having it.” This is but a promise for the future, The Hon. Chief Commissioner says the 
               <br />
               community is not ﬁt for Responsible Government, but the matter is to be left to the new 
               <br />
               Council. Responsible Government will assuredly come with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation.</span> The Hon. Member 
               <br />
               for Victoria <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Dr.</span> Helmcken) says: “This is the argument of the Government. But something 
               <br />
               must counterbalance Canada, otherwise with a working majority in the House the Dominion 
               <br />
               Government will keep things as they are when we are a Province of Canada.”

               Hon. Mn. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HOLBROOK—er.</span> Chairman, I rise with some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dilﬁdence</span> to give my opinion 
               <br />
               as to whether we are fitted for Responsible Government or not, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">after</span> the able speeches that 
               <br />
               have been delivered by Hon. Members on the subject. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lion.</span> and learned Member for 
               <br />
               Victoria City <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Drake)</span> has afﬁrmed that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Responsible</span> Government would give the real 
               <br />
               government of the Colony to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Victoria.</span> This I believe is true. and if such were the case what 
               <br />
               injury it would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inflict</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on'h‘ew</span> Westminster and the Mainland generally. I feel that we are 
               <br />
               not yet fit for Responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Governmenti</span> but nevertheless, I think that the extent of the popu- 
               <br />
               lation is very much <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under-estimated.</span> It has been stated that after the most careful calculation 
               <br />
               that can be made the white population cannot be calculated at over 5.000 adults; but I think 
               <br />
               this is wrong, and no doubt it has been taken from the Government Accounts. which do not 
               <br />
               include Kootenay, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Big</span> Bend. or the settlements around New Westminster; and I would make 
               <br />
               the adult white population to be 10,000, besides <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">40.000</span> Indians; and these Indians ought not 
               <br />
               to be ignored. If they are not represented will it not be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁcult</span> to make them contented with 
               <br />
               the change from the Imperial Government to Canada? And it is for this reason that I have 
               <br />
               given a notice of motion in this House to show them that they are not forgotten. and that they 
               <br />
               may go on with their settlements and improvements in safety. But if we are to have Respon- 
               <br />
               sible Government I will not be answerable for the consequences. We are told the question is 
               <br />
               to be submitted to the people. I say let us wait for their decision. I have conﬁdence in 
               <br />
               Canada, and am content to take my chance of being well governed by the Dominion Govern- 
               <br />
               ment. rather than try something of the working of which we know nothing. I have no doubt 
               <br />
               that great agitation on the subject of Responsible Government will be got up by the press, and 
               <br />
               that many members will gain their elections by confusing the questions of Confederation and
