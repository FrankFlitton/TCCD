               <br />
               Government must be struck out. But if we allow them to be counted, there is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">still</span> a majority 
               <br />
               of six to three of the representative members in favour of Responsible Government; and I say

               that this resolution <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ought</span> to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">transmitted</span> with such explanation as is necessary. With regard

               to Responsible Government being in the hands of: the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> Council, Members will, we may 
               <br />
               presume, be elected for four years; consequently, the question will, in all probability, be post- 
               <br />
               poned <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> four years. And I say that those who keep back Responsible Government will run

               a great risk of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">having</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> defeated at the polls. Some Hon. Members may desire 
               <br />
               such a result. It so. I can understand the course they are taking. With regard to the

               individuals <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">going</span> on the Delegation, it we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are.</span> to take the general rumour, there is not one 
               <br />
               who will properly represent: the Mainland. There are two recent converts, and one open 
               <br />
               opponent of Confederation, an implacable and politically unprincipled enemy to Confederation, 
               <br />
               leagued with some power, I won‘t say with the eleven-footed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman,</span> but with some power 
               <br />
               to defeat Confederation. The people will not be satisfied. It is extraordinary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thumbs:</span> Governor 
               <br />
               should make such a selection, ignoring the whole Confederation party and the whole Mainland 
               <br />
               as a territory. 1' could not justify myselll it I voted for this resolution, which will virtually be 
               <br />
               voting for three island Members, two recent converts and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one—iNo,</span> no, from Dr. l-Ielnicken]—~

               well, I won’t say it again. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Laughter)</span> I can understand a Government dishonest at heart 
               <br />
               pursuing this course. but I cannot understand a Government that is true to the cause doing so.
