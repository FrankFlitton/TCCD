               Hon. Member for Victoria District (Mr. DeCosmos) seems to argue that we inserted it in order 
               <br />
               to secure the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advantages</span> which would accrue to special localities from way trailic. But I can 
               <br />
               assure the House that the Executive Council entertained no such idea in adjusting the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">details</span> 
               <br />
               of this great scheme; they have endeavoured to secure the utmost <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advantages</span> to the whole 
               <br />
               Colony. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">You</span> will observe, Sir, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the clause is most general in its. terms, and it was 
               <br />
               purposely made so. It does not attempt to deﬁne the line the road should take; it may have n 
               <br />
               terminus, as I distinctly stated before, at any place on the coast most convenient—at Bentinck 
               <br />
               Arm, Bute Inlet, or Burrard Inlet, or even by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">crossing,r</span> the ﬁords <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">between</span> Vancouver Island and 
               <br />
               the Mainland, it may come to Victoria or Esquiinalt. These details must be left to the parties 
               <br />
               constructing the line. The Executive <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Council</span> have avoided all through all sectional and local 
               <br />
               considerations. I stated <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">yesterday,</span> and I repeat it again. that I hoped the Railway would 
               <br />
               follow down the valley of the Fraser River to the seaboard; but the Government have purposely 
               <br />
               avoided any deﬁnition of any particular line, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> have made it as general as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possible</span> I also 
               <br />
               said that I did not think that the Dominion Government would make the line; and I said so 
               <br />
               because I am well aware that this is not the way in which great works of this character are 
               <br />
               generally <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">undertaken</span> in these times. I believe that a private company, with the assistance of 
               <br />
               the Dominion Government, and i hope the Imperial Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">also,</span> will construct the line. 
               <br />
               But this is merely surmise. I know no more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">01‘</span> my own actual knowledge than other Members 
               <br />
               round this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">board</span> But I come to this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conclusion</span> because I know that it is not considered 
               <br />
               feasible for Governments to undertake such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">works</span> It has been found to be a great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mistake.</span> 
               <br />
               Then why discuss the suggestions of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lion.</span> Member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constructing</span> a Railway from Yale 
               <br />
               to Kainloops, or try to ﬁx details which the spirit of the whole Resolution avoids, when we 
               <br />
               don’t even say the line shall pass Yale or Knmloops at all? It is a vast undertaking, and if 
               <br />
               undertaken at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all,</span> it will not be with n <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> to proﬁt, but with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> view to the future. and as 
               <br />
               part 01‘ the great responsibility of the Canadian Government in contracting alliance with this 
               <br />
               country. The strenuous desire of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canadian</span> Government is to make such a line. I think 
               <br />
               they are able to do it, and we know for certain that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> will do it if they can. I do not agree 
               <br />
               with the Hon. Member for Victoria City <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Din</span> Helmcken), that Confederation means a Railway; 
               <br />
               the Government do not say that there shall he no Confederation without a Railway.

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> CHIEF COMMISSIONER—I am glad to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> that set right. The Government

               believe that the Railway will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">made,</span> but th <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> do not make it a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sine</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">qua</span> mm; but if, on a

               calm view of the whole subject in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">negotiating</span> with Cunadu, it is found impracticable for Canada 
               <br />
               to commence to make the Railway at once, then I see alternative terms, which will not only 
               <br />
               suit Canada but the people of this Colony, who, you must remember, will have to pass upon

               <br />
               the idea that the insertion of so paltry a sum as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,000,000</span> will lend to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">postponement</span> of 
               <br />

               <br />
               well put by the Hon. Member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">how</span> W ninster yesterday. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">common</span> sense shows that it' 
               <br />
               would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> the interest of the part . <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">making,r</span> the line to prolong the work over a number 
               <br />
               of years. It can only he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">carried</span> on quic to secure any real profit. I again repeat what the 
               <br />
               Government Members stated yesterday so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">distinctly.</span> that the one million a year is not nearly 
               <br />
               the sum which will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">0</span> to be spent; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> amount <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stated</span> is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">only</span> intended to serve as a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">guarantee</span> 
               <br />
               or an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">earnest</span> that the work will be done. If we had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said</span> make it in so many years time, they 
               <br />
               could not have acceded to it. Certainly in three <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">year</span> _’ time the Dominion Government will he in 
               <br />
               a position to determine the line. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suggestion</span> oi the Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Member</span> is. in my opinion, wholly 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inapr</span> cable to this-scheme If admitted it would entirely remodel the Government clause, which 
               <br />
               is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«7an</span> a]. The suggestion is. that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">first</span> section should be made at some place on Fraser 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ii</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> I said before, we cannot tell whether the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway</span> will come down the valley of the 
               <br />
               Fraser RD’CL' at all. Those who spend the money have a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">right</span> to choose their line. As far as 
               <br />
               my own opinion goes, I should say that the Janadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> will determine the basis of 
               <br />
               the scheme on engineering considerations of the port best suited for pouri <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> in supplies, and for 
               <br />
               the cheapest construction of the road. Do not let us hamper so great a scheme by such minute 
               <br />
               details; let us leave it for those who have to construct the line to select their own route.
