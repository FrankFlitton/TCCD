               be aﬁfeoted by such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conduct.</span> The position of Canada is so great, beyond cavil and dispute, as 
               <br />
               not to, require any defender in this Council. Such remarks only recoil upon those who make 
               <br />
               them. .The versatility of spleen displayed by the Hon. gentleman who has just sat down, only 
               <br />
               shows the bitterness of the mind that conceived the remarks. The question now before us is 
               <br />
               as to Clause 8, and upon the discussion of this clause another question has arisen, or rather 
               <br />
               has been dragged in, namely, that of the ability of Canada to fulﬁl the condition of this 
               <br />
               particular clause, and it is said that this is to be made a test question. With regard to the 
               <br />
               idea of any future Canadian Ministry repudiating this condition, I wish, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Chairman, to 
               <br />
               refer you to English history, and to ask whether you have ever known an instance of an 
               <br />
               incoming Ministry. whether Whig, Radical, or Tory, repudiating the plighted troth of their 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">predecessors</span> in oiiice? Such a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thing</span> is never done to my knowledge, and so far as my 
               <br />
               experience of history goes, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">never</span> has been done. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l“</span> Hear, hear,” from Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Attorney-General]</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ihave</span> yet to learn an instance where a loan guaranteed, or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anything</span> else <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">undertaken</span> by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> 
               <br />
               Government, has been repudiated by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">an</span> incoming Ministry. We might just as well suppose 
               <br />
               that the guarantee for the loan for the Inter-colonial Railway <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might</span> be withdrawn by Gladstone, 
               <br />
               because it was given by the late Ministry, as that any future party in Canada might entertain 
               <br />
               the idea of going back from the promises of the present Government. History forbids such an 
               <br />
               idea. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> Hon. and learned Member for Victoria (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Drake)</span> says he wants a guarantee. 
               <br />
               Well, let him want it. I am perfectly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">willing</span> that he should want it. For my part, I look 
               <br />
               upon the Queen’s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Proclamation</span> as the guarantee which will make the whole thing inviolable. 
               <br />
               I point to the fact, that every compact entered into with the Maritime Provinces is being 
               <br />
               fulﬁlled. Can anyone point to any act of repudiation? No, Sir, Canada has gone beyond her 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">promises.</span> I repudiate, on behalf of myself and others, the assertion that any member of the 
               <br />
               confederate party has stated that he would accept Confederation without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conditions.</span> I never 
               <br />
               heard the Hon. Member for Victoria <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">District,</span> or the Hon. Member for New Westminster, who 
               <br />
               have taken a prominent part in this great question, make any such statement. I have the 
               <br />
               honour of being one of the Executive Council who framed these Resolutions,- and I believe 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terms</span> will be acceptable to a large majority of the people. Those who say that there can 
               <br />
               be no Union without a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway,</span> speak a fallacy. Railways follow. Look at San Francisco 
               <br />
               and the Eastern States of America. Look <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> Scotland and England. I am well aware that 
               <br />
               British Columbia wants <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:1</span> Railway, and I know that 'Canada wants <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">am</span> sanguine enough 
               <br />
               to believe that it will be made. I am assured that the money is ready, if the desired guarantees 
               <br />
               can be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">obtained.</span> The Hon. Mr. Wood. in his discursive remarks, ﬂew around like a humming- 
               <br />
               bird buzzing round a rose, and amongst other things touched on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assailabil’ity</span> of the Railroad. 
               <br />
               I say that the American people have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railways</span> of their own, and we do not intend to have from 
               <br />
               henceforth daily warfare. With regard to the course of the Railway, the Hon. Chief Commis- 
               <br />
               sioner has told you that the advantages of the line are greater than those of the existing Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               line. It is well known that the American Paciﬁc Railway, after passing Omaha, passes through 
               <br />
               a wild and most dilhcnlt country, through miles of wilds and sage-brush. [“ No, no.” from Mr. 
               <br />
               DeCosmos.] The North-West Territory is more fertile than any portion of the route of the 
               <br />
               American Paciﬁc <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway.</span> The Hon. Mr. Wood says he will make <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> a test question. I say 
               <br />
               the whole terms are a test question, and no one part of them more than another. The Canadian 
               <br />
               Government are to be asked what they will do, and the ﬁnal test will be for the decision of 
               <br />
               British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subjects</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> Colony. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">No</span> one thing is a test more than another. The people have the 
               <br />
               sole right to say whether <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">willing,r</span> to take the terms as ﬁnally offered, or not. I have 
               <br />
               already spoken twice with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Representative</span> Institutions, which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«the</span> Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Wood 
               <br />
               regrets are not made a condition. Either l must fail to put my ideas <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clearly,</span> or Hon. Members 
               <br />
               misunderstand <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">me.</span> I have said, over and over again, that the people must decide this question. 
               <br />
               His Excellency says that if the newly constituted Council asks for Responsible Government, 
               <br />
               under the Organic Act, they will get <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> What need is there to drag in the question into these 
               <br />
               Resolutions? The Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3’</span> ' Wood cannot, dare not, say <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the majority of the British subjects 
               <br />
               in British Columbia are in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">flavour</span> of Responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government.</span> I may be found in the minority 
               <br />
               upon this question when it comes before the people, but I speak from conviction; and, moreover, 
               <br />
               I say that when once we are in the Dominion, if the people desire Responsible Government, no 
               <br />
               power on earth can prevent them from having it.
