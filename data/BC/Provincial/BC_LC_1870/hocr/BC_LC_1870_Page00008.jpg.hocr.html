               1 go on to brewers, and these interests, though in point of fact small, are in proportion as 
               <br />
               large with us, as larger interests would be to a larger population; moreover, we, having so small 
               <br />
               a population, cannot afford to risk a change, because we cannot recuperate quickly. Under the 
               <br />
               Canadian law a brewer must take out a brewer’s and maltster’s license, and has to pay one cent 
               <br />
               per pound on all malt made, and as there is an average amount <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1,248,000</span> pounds of malt 
               <br />
               consumed in the year, the average duty would amount to $12,680 per annum, in addition to 
               <br />
               which they will have to pay a maltster’s and brewer’s license. The duty upon that amount of 
               <br />
               malt now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is'$3,750.</span> Confederation therefore will increase the malt duty by nearly $9.000.

               Brewers would probably buy all their mail: from abroad or cease to brew, especially when we

               take into consideration the annoyances connected with the bonding system. You will see, Sir, 
               <br />
               that this quantity of malt would take 500 acres of land to raise it, so that in addition to 
               <br />
               injuring the brewers, the farmers are also injured. .
