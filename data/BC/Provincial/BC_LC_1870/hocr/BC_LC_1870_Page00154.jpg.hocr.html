               united piece of territory from our boundary to Mexico. With <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span> to the northern <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Anglo</span> 
               <br />
               Saxon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">racewto</span> which we belong—we ﬁnd that they possess all the north except Alaska. If 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">United</span> States have a single and compact piece of territory to the south, we want the same 
               <br />
               in the north. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Look</span> at history as regards the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">acquisition</span> of territory by nations: Lorraine by 
               <br />
               France, Poland <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[by</span> Russia, Scotland by England, Texas and Alaska by the United States. How 
               <br />
               has this been brought about but by a national pol‘ v, For hundreds of years it was the policy 
               <br />
               or" <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">France</span> to acquire Lorraine; so it was with Russia and Poland. It hasheen said that republics 
               <br />
               cannot have a national policy as monarchies can; I say that they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> a policy with regard to 
               <br />
               land, And I say that we should have a policy of the same kind. Let us lay down this principle, 
               <br />
               that we intend to create a great nation, and intending to do so, we should have all territory north 
               <br />
               of the United States. I have no objection to the United States gaining territory to the south, 
               <br />
               but I do object to her coming north or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">holding,r</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Alaska.</span> Let us glance at Alaska for one moment. 
               <br />
               The country is similar to our own. It has coal. ﬁsh, and lumber, as we have, and its contiguity 
               <br />
               to our country ought to induce us to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">believe</span> that there is a natural alliance between us. We 
               <br />
               all know how much the purchase of this piece of territory cost the United States in hard cash. 
               <br />
               Then its annual cost is nearly two million dollars. or forty millions to support it as a United 
               <br />
               States Territory for twenty-ﬁve years, Then look at the population, a mere nothing; and its 
               <br />
               revenue, hardly worth taking into account. It is said by many that America is sick of her 
               <br />
               bargain, and that Russia sold the United States. I think this is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">favourable</span> time to bring it 
               <br />
               up. Canada can well aiford to pay for an extended frontier on the Paciﬁc Coast. If we 
               <br />
               purchased Alaska the Americans could still come in to ﬁsh and gather furs; so. commercially, 
               <br />
               there need be no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculty.</span> I believe we could <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">get</span> along smoothly; therefore, I have to move 
               <br />
               this resolution :—

               <br />
               only objection I can see is, that perhaps it is a little premature. "hat Canada will ultimately 
               <br />
               acquire it, I can have no doubt. In supposing that the acquisition of this Territory, and the 
               <br />
               consequent hemming in of British Columbia would have the effect of leading the people of Canada 
               <br />
               to believe in the ultimate destiny of the British American possessions being drawn. into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">annexe,</span> 
               <br />
               tion, or absorption, the Hon. W. H. Seward made an egregious blunder; he did it in his ignorance 
               <br />
               of the Canadian character. It is not necessary for Canadians to get up and show their loyalty 
               <br />
               daily, they are ready and able to occupy their position oi’ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">important</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">limpcrio.</span> There may be 
               <br />
               some people in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> who do not like the Government. In what country are there not some 
               <br />
               uneasy spirits? The United States has them, and England is not free from them. I shall 
               <br />
               decidedly support the Hon. member. although, I think, he is, perhaps, a little in advance of 
               <br />
               American statesmen as to the acquisition of territory.
