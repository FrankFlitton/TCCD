               ment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Resolutions</span> was not governed by sectional <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prejudices.</span> The Executive Council took the 
               <br />
               broad view that is was for the interest of the Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> to build this Dock, because 
               <br />
               if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Victoria</span> prospers under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation,</span> it will be so much better <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> the Dominion revenue. 
               <br />
               If the wor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> is a benefit to Victoria, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">through</span> bringing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">labourers.</span> it will benefit the whole Colony, 
               <br />
               and our position will be improved, and therefore we shall become a more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">important</span> part of the

               the concluding words of the Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Wood.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1</span> say yes, so far as this: that the whole of the 
               <br />
               conditions of this scheme were intended to benefit the whole <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the Colony. As a Member of 
               <br />
               the Executive <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Council,</span> I repudiate entirely the narrow motives which have been suggested by 
               <br />
               the Hon Mr. Wood. The Executive Council were actuated by no sectional views; their object 
               <br />
               was to make the whole of the Resolutions not only palatable, but beneﬁcial, to the Colony. The 
               <br />
               merits of Esqnimalt as a site for the Docks are in themselves a suiﬁcient reason to advance in 
               <br />
               favour of the Executive opinion being correct. I shall vote for the clause as it stands.

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> .Mk. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">DECOSMOS—l</span> am one of those who think it proper to have the locality for 
               <br />
               the Docks named; and I think the Government would have made a blunder it they had left 
               <br />
               out the word “Esquimalt.” It would have been wrong, in my opinion, if the Government 
               <br />
               had framed the Resolutions with any sectional views. But it appears to me whilst they are 
               <br />
               likely to do the Colony good generally, they have been framed with a tendency to create the 
               <br />
               popular vote, and I do not see much harm in that. The point which I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wont</span> to hear about is, 
               <br />
               whether £100,000 will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sufﬁcient</span> to construct a good Dock, and what sort of a Dock it is to 
               <br />
               be? It is possible that a large Stone Dock may not be of so much use as a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Potent</span> Slip. I 
               <br />
               have visited the Floating Docks in the Arsenals of the United States, to take such observa- 
               <br />
               tions as would serve an unprofessional man: and I confess that if it is to be a Stone Graving 
               <br />
               Dock in Constance Cove, to admit of one ve <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&gt;1</span> at n time, I am inclined to the opinion that it 
               <br />
               would not be as good, nor as much public utility, as a Patent Slip. I shall support the item, 
               <br />
               or a larger sum than £100,000 I believe that a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Dock.</span> or a Patent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Slip,</span> at Esqnimalt. will 
               <br />
               attract ships from Puget Sound. It is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">21</span> step in the right direction. There is a feeling abroad 
               <br />
               that the Colony would have to construct this Dock. This would be a mistake; but to get 
               <br />
               Canada to endorse the scheme, by giving a guarantee for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> interest, is, in my opinion, the 
               <br />
               right course to pursue.

               <br />
               Clarke’s Patent Slip, with hydraulic lift, would be the easiest worked, as it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Would</span> be the

               cheapest. It could probably be erected for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">£75000,</span> whereas a cut stone Graving Dock would 
               <br />
               cost more. One of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advantages</span> of the latter would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> there would be more money
