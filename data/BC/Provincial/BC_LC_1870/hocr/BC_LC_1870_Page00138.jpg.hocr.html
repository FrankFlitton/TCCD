               <br />
               Canadian Parliament will deem it desirable, for their own interests, that a special tariff should 
               <br />
               be framed for this part of the Dominion. There is no law against this. It would not he a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(inferential</span> duty; it cannot be objected to on this ground. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Differential</span> duties are where the 
               <br />
               same articles from two different countries are charged differently. If the Canadian tariff was 
               <br />
               applied here taxation would he lessened. We must not lo. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sight</span> of that fact. It would proh- 
               <br />
               ahly be lessened to the extent of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$100,000</span> a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">year.</span> I have estimated the difference upon one 
               <br />
               quarter‘s revenue, and I believe the difference to be at least $20,000 for the quarter. For all 
               <br />
               that, I think the tariff should be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">changed.</span> A special tariff is required. I mentioned yesterday 
               <br />
               horses and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cattle.</span> I think the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$15</span> on a horse and $10 on cattle would be a great hardship on 
               <br />
               this Colony; it would amount to a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prohibition</span> Last year 1,700 head <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> cattle were imported 
               <br />
               into this c ; are we prepared for the difference that the Canadian tariff would make in this 
               <br />
               item? I think this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">large</span> duty would be most objectionable. With a tariff made especially to 
               <br />
               protect the farmers, over <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">40,000</span> pounds of butter were last year imported. If the Canadian 
               <br />
               tariff of four <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cents</span> a pound were applied, 1 do not. know that much more could come in. I 
               <br />
               think that the farmers must have sold all they had. I think that advocates of protection do 
               <br />
               not apply the principles of protection to farmers of the upper country, but those of Vancouver 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Island.</span> The farmers will feel the weight of the protecting tariff without receiving any of its 
               <br />
               They will not feel the difference in the duty upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hutter.</span> I think that there will he

               <br />

               on produce. I don't care for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cool;</span> they take as much as we can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">supply.</span> I would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suggest</span> that 
               <br />
               this Council should send forward to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> a recommendation that we believe a special 
               <br />
               tariff desirable, nay, almost imperative I do not believe that our eight members in the House 
               <br />
               of Commons, and four in the Senate, of Ottawa, will have no weight; if so, they had better come 
               <br />
               back. What in God’s name good will they do? I think the question may be safely left to the 
               <br />
               Canadian Government and our representatives at Ottawa.
