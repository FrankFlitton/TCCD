               out the discussion of this question. and perhaps intentionally. I refer to the subject of 
               <br />
               Responsible Government [“ Hear, hear,” from Mr. DoCosmosl, which has up to this stage been

               I remember that in opening this debate, the Hon. Attorney-General invoked the Divine

               blessing upon the work upon which we were then entering. This was high-sounding, and a 
               <br />
               very nice picture to look at, but it does not wear well without that strict attention to the 
               <br />
               divine rights <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the people, which is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inalienable</span> from true political economy.

               1 have a distinct recollection of most Hon. Members now occupying an othcial position at 
               <br />
               this Council Board, and of the positions which they occupied when ﬁrst they came to this 
               <br />
               Colony. I have often asked myself what entitles these Hon. Members to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern</span> this Colony; 
               <br />
               but I have never been able to answer myself satisfactorily. I am perfectly ready to admit the 
               <br />
               ability of Executive Members as individuals. The learned <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eloquence</span> of the Hon. Attorney- 
               <br />
               Goneral has always, since I have had the honour to sit at this Council Board, impressed me 
               <br />
               with a deep sense of the advantage of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thorough</span> forensic training; and the power and force of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> reply of the Hon. the Chief Commissioner has ever and again made me i'eel with especial 
               <br />
               force the utter hopelessness of combating stern <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁcial</span> reticence with even the most brilliant 
               <br />
               powers of oratory. Yet, Sir, whatever our admiration for individual excellence, however great 
               <br />
               our estimation of personal worth, the question has still remained unanswered, and, in my 
               <br />
               opinion, unanswerable. What is there in the collective wisdom of these Honourable Ofﬁcial 
               <br />
               Members that entitles them to arrogate to themselves the right to rule? Are they, I ask, the 
               <br />
               dominant race, and are the people serfs?

               We have heard a great deal about absorption, and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">danger</span> of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">larger</span> body swallow-

               ing up the smaller. I think about as much of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> danger <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> I do of the other evil threatened 
               <br />
               in such earnest and thrilling language by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon</span> Member for Victoria, namely. that our 
               <br />
               salmon would be under Confederation, and the protection from salmon nets that would be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extended</span> to them, increase and multiply to such an extent that they would absorb all the 
               <br />
               smaller ﬁsh. I, however, to speak seriously, doubt very much if the Hon. Member can cite 
               <br />
               a single example in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">history/of</span> the larger <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">absorbing</span> the lessor, unless the larger possessed
