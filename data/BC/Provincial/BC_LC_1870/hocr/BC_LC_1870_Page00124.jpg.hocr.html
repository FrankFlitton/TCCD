               were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">encountered,</span> and many mistakes characterized the earlier working of Responsible Govern- 
               <br />
               ment in that fine Colony; but it would be most unfair to charge all these to the possession <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 
               <br />
               such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">institutions,</span> Nay, most <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> them had their origin in a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> political system. As <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> 
               <br />
               Jamaica, Hon. gentlemen must be aware that it never possessed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Responsible</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government.</span> A 
               <br />
               mixed representative system it had; and the chief cause of failure was the absence of responsi- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bility.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> was just because those who administered the affairs <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> that unfortunate Colony were 
               <br />
               not responsible to the people that the opposition, led by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ill‘fated</span> Gordon—~a man of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unquestionable</span> ability, although, perhaps, somewhat deﬁcient in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">judgment—ovals</span> induced ﬁnally 
               <br />
               to assume the extreme attitude which resulted so fatally. The Hon. and learned Attorney- 
               <br />
               General made an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">etfort,</span> not altogether warranted by facts, to force the advocates of Responsible 
               <br />
               Government into a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">false</span> and disadvantageous <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">position,</span> in relation to the Government pro- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gramme;</span> but Hon. gentlemen will recollect how anxious I was, at the beginning of this debate, 
               <br />
               to meet the views and adopt the suggestions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> that Hon. and learned gentleman, in respect to 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">particular</span> time and mode of approaching this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question.</span> My desire to give the Government 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a’general</span> and strong support upon the great question of Confederation is no secret in this 
               <br />
               House; and I think I can speak with equal conﬁdence in regard to the views and intentions 
               <br />
               of my Hon. friend on my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">left</span> (the Member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Yale).</span> But enough has already been said upon 
               <br />
               this point; and I have only to add that I utterly refuse to occupy the position in which the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lion.</span> and learned Attorney-General appears desirous of placing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">me.</span> That <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon,</span> gentleman 
               <br />
               was content to give the same answer to the main objection as that given all round the Govern— 
               <br />
               mont end of the table, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">viz”</span> that the Organic Act provides the necessary and ready means of 
               <br />
               obtaining what we seek; and he further tells us that, inasmuch as Responsible Government: 
               <br />
               relieves Governors of responsibility, n Governor would naturally be ready to make the conces- 
               <br />
               sion. Such, however, is not the accustomed working of human nature. Such is not the lesson 
               <br />
               of history. The ruler hugs power as the miser does his gold, nor parts with it only as it is 
               <br />
               extorted piecemeal by the people. I am charged with having used <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">threats—~threats</span> of blood! 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> Sir, I must plead “ not guilty” to this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">charge,</span> While carefully avoiding everything in 
               <br />
               the nature <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ot'threat</span> and prediction, I asked the Government to read carefully those lessons 
               <br />
               written in blood around us, and implored them to take warning from the errors and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proﬁt</span> by 
               <br />
               the successes of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">others,</span> We were told by the Hon. and learned <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Attorney‘cheral</span> that the 
               <br />
               Governor is powerless to grant what the Resolution asks; but might not the same objection be 
               <br />
               raised to almost every recommendation passed in connection with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation“?</span> His Excel- 
               <br />
               lency in asking Her Majesty’s Government for power to give us a new Constitution. The 
               <br />
               Resolution merely suggests a more liberal Constitution than His Excellency proposes. There 
               <br />
               is. therefore, no weight in this objection. The Honourable gentleman next tells us that the 
               <br />
               Resolution implies want of confidence in the Canadian Government; that they will not listen 
               <br />
               to the cry ot the people for Responsible Government Now, the Hon. gentleman must be 
               <br />
               aware that Canada can only listen to our cry when it is heard in the particular form prescribed 
               <br />
               by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Constitution</span> The people can only cry through the Government it is proposed to give 
               <br />
               them under the Constitution foreshadowed in Ills Excellency's opening message; and I have 
               <br />
               already <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">endeavoured</span> to point out the probability that the new Government might refuse to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’</span> 
               <br />
               utter a cry in that direction at the desire of the people. rl‘here is no such expression of want 
               <br />
               of conﬁdence in the resolution. The Canadian Government could not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interfereﬂvould</span> have 
               <br />
               no power to give us Responsible Government—until asked. by our Local Government to do so. 
               <br />
               Such objections I must, therefore, regard as frivolous, and utterly unworthy of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> and 
               <br />
               le: 'ued Attorney-General. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Chief Connui ner followed with his accustomed ability, 
               <br />
               but,‘ i venture to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">think,</span> without his usual <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discretion,</span> That lion. gentleman set out by telling 
               <br />
               us that he quite understood it to be necessary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{or</span> certain members, in order to be consistent 
               <br />
               with pen and speech outside of this House, to bring forward this subject; that it was a logical 
               <br />
               necessity, inexorable fate. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> Sir, I cannot see into that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon,</span> gentleman’s heart, any more 
               <br />
               than I can into the mysterious Executive Chamber. l will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">therefore,</span> permit myself to 
               <br />
               impnte motives to that Hon. gentleman in his opposition to Responsible Government; but'he 
               <br />
               must permit me to be the best judge of those motives which have impelled me, with some 
               <br />
               degree of reluctance, to take a stand in opposition to the Government upon this question. lt‘ 
               <br />
               may appear necessary, in order to be consistent with word and pen, that I should advocate in 
               <br />
               this House great principles which I have advocated elsewhere; but it may be permitted me to 
               <br />
               say that, whether here or elsewhere, I advocate Responsible Government under Confederation,
