               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Mr. WOOD rose to resume the debate on Tariff, and said :—-\Ir. Chairman, in speak- 
               <br />
               ing to the motions now before the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House.</span> it will hardly be necessary for me to say that I think 
               <br />
               this question of Tariff the most important of all that have been introduced during this debate. 
               <br />
               My object is, as I have said, to reduce to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">utmost,</span> in the event of Confederation with Canada, 
               <br />
               the chance of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> with the Dominion; my objection to Confederation being that, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">however</span> 
               <br />
               much it may apparently and at ﬁrst tend to confer upon the Colony material beneﬁts, yet there 
               <br />
               is every fear of consequent reaction and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disaffection.</span> In <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dealing</span> with the matter it will be 
               <br />
               necessary to see whether the subject of Tariff now before us will have the effect of raising <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a.</span> 
               <br />
               direct question and difference between this Colony and Canada. Tari is not simply a mode of 
               <br />
               collecting taxes; it is a system with a double object. The object of obtaining revenue, and in 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">obtainingr</span> of that revenue the further object <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">015</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">promoting</span> domestic and home industries 
               <br />
               by a just discrimination between the subject-matter on which taxation is levied. The question 
               <br />
               of Tariff directly tends to promote or depress domestic productions and domestic trade; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conse»</span> 
               <br />
               quently, the chances of difference and reaction depend on whether our interests are identical 
               <br />
               with those of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada,</span> or whether there is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conﬂict.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> intended future Dominion of Canada 
               <br />
               is obviously divided, so far as this question is concerned, into two parts, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> which is to the 
               <br />
               east and that which is to the west of the Rocky <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mountainsw—the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Atlanti</span> - and Pacific portions of 
               <br />
               that Dominion; and to these several divisions there appertain distinct and several industrial 
               <br />
               interests, agricultu <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Val,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">manufacturing,</span> and commercial. Let us run through in our own minds our 
               <br />
               own, the Paciﬁc, interests, so to say,—-the interests, in fact, of this present Colony. First. we 
               <br />
               have the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agricultural</span> interests. This is a material interest, as 1' trust it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">always</span> will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con»</span> 
               <br />
               sidered in every Colony; it is an industry which a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> cannot well <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">avoid</span> materially to 
               <br />
               assist. I don’t say “protect.” but “assist,” and this whether <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agricultural</span> produce no a staple 
               <br />
               of the Colony or not. I may here rem; that I use the word “staple” in what I understand 
               <br />
               to be the received acceptation of the word—produce. exportable produce, raised in a Colony with 
               <br />
               advantage and at a remunerative rate to the producer, and capable of being <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exchanged</span> with 
               <br />
               advantage for the produce-of other countries in the markets of the world. Our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nex</span> material 
               <br />
               interests are our own staples, properly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sovcalled</span> as aheve'deﬁned—such, for instance, as the 
               <br />
               wool of Australia, gold <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">an}</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">here.</span> or ﬁsheries, as in Newfoundland. Our particular staples are- 
               <br />
               our ﬁsheries, our forests, and our minerals, to say nothing of certain aptitudes for shipbuilding 
               <br />
               and the repairing of ships. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Next,</span> we must take trade and commerce; our local and geographical 
               <br />
               position being such as to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> us seine <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advantage</span> in the distribution of goods, and, as such, is to 
               <br />
               be regarded as an element of wealth and one of our material interests. Let us now turn to 
               <br />
               Canada. Canada has n‘lanul’actm-es, but not by way of staples, because she cannot undersell 
               <br />
               the Old World in manufactured goods; but with a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population</span> of, I suppose, over three millions 
               <br />
               she can produce sufﬁcient manufactures of certain descriptions for her own use. Then her 
               <br />
               staples are agriculture, produce, lumber, and a certain amount of minerals. and perhaps horns 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fallow.</span> Agricultural produce is a staple in Canada: she exports it; therefore it requires no 
               <br />
               protection; it would be no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">good</span> to inmoso a tariff upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> In manufactures there is such a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariff</span> as will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">slightly</span> protect manufactures. as with us <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> give the same turn of the market 
               <br />
               to the farmer <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">slight</span> taritf on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agricultural</span> produce. Following <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> common <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">law</span> of self- 
               <br />
               intcrcst, British Columbia is bound to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">protect</span> her own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interests,</span> and Canada the same. Let us 
               <br />
               see <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whether</span> or not there is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">manifest</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tendency</span> to protection in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Dominion</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature.</span> It 
               <br />
               has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> stated in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">debate</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(,‘anada</span> is adverse to protection. that she wants to follow
