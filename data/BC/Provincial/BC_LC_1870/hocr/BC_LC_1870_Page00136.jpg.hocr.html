               communication shall have been established through the Dominion to the Paciﬁc. Until that 
               <br />
               takes place British Columbia must continue to occupy a position so isolated, and so exceptional, 
               <br />
               as to render the general <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariff,</span> however well adapted to the Provinces to the eastward of the

               <br />
               munication these exceptional conditions will, for the most part, disappear. Look, for instance, 
               <br />
               at California. What a complete revolution the railway has wrought in the condition of that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">State,</span> The moment the railway was opened, California was no longer separated from the great 
               <br />
               commercial centres of the Eastern States by thousands of miles of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sageAbush</span> and desert. It 
               <br />
               was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">practically</span> set down alongside of them; or, to use the words of another, time and space 
               <br />
               were annihilated, and California became, for the ﬁrst time. a ﬁtting subject of a common tariff 
               <br />
               framed at Washington, and enforced throughout the widespreading Union. Similar results 
               <br />
               will be realized in our own case. Upon the opening of the Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Paciﬁc</span> Railway British 
               <br />
               Columbia will practically be set down <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alongside</span> ot the Atlantic Provinces. We get over all 
               <br />
               constitutional <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculties</span> by approaching the subject in this way. I do not say that the 
               <br />
               Dominion Government will assent to the proposition to postpone the application of their tariff 
               <br />
               to this Colony until railw y communication shall have been established; but we will approach 
               <br />
               them with a much greater show of reason and success in this way than in the other. I shall, 
               <br />
               therefore, propose an amendment, or a recommendation, asking that the Customs tariff of the 
               <br />
               Dominion be not extended over the Oolony of British Columbia until railway communication 
               <br />
               therewith shall have been established. Should this be agreed to on the part of the Canadian 
               <br />
               Government, it would then become our duty, upon entering the Dominion, to remodel our 
               <br />
               tariff with a view to protecting local industries on the one hand, and building up our commercial 
               <br />
               and maritime inter s on the other. ‘anarla might, possibly, sacriﬁce a little revenue in the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst instance, but it would come back to her a hundred fold in the greatly enlarged prosperity 
               <br />
               certain to follow. In this way, also, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would’be</span> presented a living recognition of the necessity 
               <br />
               for railway communication, it not an incentive for the speedy consummation of that great 
               <br />
               desideratuin. The course which I propose will more fully meet the local necessities of the 
               <br />
               country, while it will be more acceptable to the people, and, I feel assured, more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lilter</span> to meet 
               <br />
               with the concurrence of the authorities at Ottawa. It possesses the advantage of accomplishing 
               <br />
               more good than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can.</span> possibly be attained in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">way,</span> proposed either by the Hon. Member for

               <br />
               clear of constitutional <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diliiculties,</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Hon. Mu. DECOSMOS—Sir, we have heard some very good and eloquent speeches. I intend 
               <br />
               to say a few words, and will begin with first principles. When the Confederation Delegates 
               <br />
               ﬁrst met, they proposed to adopt a tariff similar to that of the United States; that the Federal 
               <br />
               Government alone should have the right to impose customs duties; that there should be no sub- 
               <br />
               sidies, and that each Province should raise its own revenue by direct taxation; but it was found 
               <br />
               that Local Governments were not favourable to direct <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taxation.</span> At the Conference at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">West</span> 
               <br />
               minster it was at first proposed to give local legislatures power to make laws and impose direct 
               <br />
               taxation, but when the Organic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> was prepared that part was dropped <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out</span> I have desired to 
               <br />
               harmonize with the Organic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act.</span> Whatever we may do we should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">harmonize</span> with the Organic 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act;</span> by so doing we shall meet with less objection at Ottawa. In <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lookingy</span> at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1:</span> question I may 
               <br />
               come to the conclusion that there is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possibility</span> for the Local Government to raise taxes, but if 
               <br />
               it was referred to the Privy Council they might say it clashed. I will illustrate my meaning: I 
               <br />
               think the Legislature of Ontario voted an additional sum to one of the Judges; the Privy Council 
               <br />
               said it was unconstitutional to do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">so,</span> So it might be if the Local Government imposed a tax 
               <br />
               upon foreign produce and manufactures. But we must not clash with the Dominion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government.</span> 
               <br />
               In case the Dominion enacted customs laws lower than our own, we would have the privilege 
               <br />
               to put direct taxes on those articles so as to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> protection to them. Turning to the Year 
               <br />
               Book, I ﬁnd that in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Brunswick</span> the export dues on lumber amounts to $70,000. This is 
               <br />
               an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">export</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revenue</span> for a source of revenue. If the Government of New Brunswick was able to 
               <br />
               except this item from the operation of the Dominion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taritt',</span> why should we not be able to get 
               <br />
               the same sort of difference? The Canadian Revenue will not sut't'er; every article will have to 
               <br />
               pay the Canadian taritl‘, and Canada will benefit by any prosperity that we enjoy. 
               <br />
