               <br />
               as has been given to the Hon. Member for Victoria (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ilelmclceu).</span> Now, Sir, I am perfectly 
               <br />
               content that he should enjoy the credit, and the whole credit. In speaking brieﬂy he has 
               <br />
               quoted a word used by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">myself—3‘Expediency."</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> I again say that the whole thing is a 
               <br />
               matter of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expediency.</span> l have not heard anything, however, either from that Hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               or others who followed me, lo disturb the solid foundation of my scheme, resting as it does 
               <br />
               on truth and fact. and a plain out-spoken statement of our monetary requirements. I have 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">always</span> said that this question of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> was one of a monetary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">character—“that</span> it 
               <br />
               had a money value, and I maintain, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> l have always done, without shadow of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">turning.</span> that 
               <br />
               we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ought</span> to have a surplus revenue of about 00,000 on entering the Dominion. I have always 
               <br />
               said that we must have that surplus, or its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">equivalent,</span> with Confederation, or else no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederw</span> 
               <br />
               tion. That is the point round which I have been revolving. I have made no stride in advance, 
               <br />
               none to the rear, the lion. gentleman opposite to the contrary. I have ever kept before the 
               <br />
               public the same idea, that when the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terms</span> of union were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">negotiated,</span> they must bring that sum 
               <br />
               .in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> surplus revenue into our Treasury. It was a simple point that every one could under- 
               <br />
               stand and not forget. It is the sum that I asked at first; it is the sum that I ask now; and 
               <br />
               it is the sum that I propose new in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amendment</span> to the Resolution of the Government. The 
               <br />
               real surplus in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Government scheme is so far below what it ought to be, that it will be 
               <br />
               repudiated as an absolute failure, if ever it comes before the people for ratiﬁcation. They will 
               <br />
               reject it. It will create <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">just</span> as much <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dissatisfaction</span> here as there was felt in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nova</span> Scotia. I 
               <br />
               will now, Sir, as I promised, move the following as a recommendation to His Excellency, and
