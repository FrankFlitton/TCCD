               the Admiralty Court is badly managed. I have heard it insinuated that the Judges of the 
               <br />
               Admiralty Courts in this Colony have been inﬂuenced by fees to prolong the business of the 
               <br />
               Court and drag out Admiralty business to its utmost length, instead of pushing it through, as 
               <br />
               the business of the Common Law Courts is pushed through. There ought to be no fees. 
               <br />
               Admiralty practice in this Colony is likely, in case of war, to assume enormous proportions. I

               do not see why a condition should not be insorted to provide us with an Admiralty Court with 
               <br />
