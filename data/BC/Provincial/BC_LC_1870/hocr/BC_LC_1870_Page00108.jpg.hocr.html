               forward, it is a mistake to bring it up in a Council constituted as this is, especially when the 
               <br />
               Governor has so distinctly expressed his views in opposition to the inauguration of Responsible 
               <br />
               Government at. the present time, It would surely have been much more to the advantage of 
               <br />
               the cause they advocate for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Members to have postponed the consideration of the question 
               <br />
               for the more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representative</span> House shadowed forth in His Excellency’s speech. I say shadowed 
               <br />
               forth, for on reﬂection it must be plain to all Hon. Members that. His Excellency was not in a 
               <br />
               position to tell what the constitution of that House will be. He does not know. He has 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recommended</span> certain changes for Imperial sanction; they may or may not be favourably con- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sidered.</span> His Excellency does, however, tell you that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representative</span> element will be larger; 
               <br />
               and I think, therefore, that it would have been wiser on the part of the representative members 
               <br />
               who advocate Responsible Government to have left it to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">next</span> Council instead of bringing 
               <br />
               it forward while the present Resolutions are under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discussion</span> The subject, if not positively 
               <br />
               irrelevant, is not connected with this Resolution, which simply provides, as a matter of form, 
               <br />
               power to change the constitution, in accordance with the Organic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> when the people desire 
               <br />
               it. in common with the Hon. Attorney-General. I am surprised that Hon. Members who 
               <br />
               cordially support Confederation should be afraid to trust the Dominion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> upon this 
               <br />
               question, I am’ surprised at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inconsistency</span> of those who tell you that the people could not 
               <br />
               get Responsible Government under Confederation, and that the wishes of the people would not 
               <br />
               be allowed to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prevail.</span> I am surprised particularly at the Hon. Member for New Westminster 
               <br />
               expressing any doubt upon this subject. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1,</span> as an individual member of this community, would 
               <br />
               willingly leave the interests of the Colony to the guardianship of the Canadian Government. 
               <br />
               It I did not think that that Govermnent would exercise whatever power it might have for the 
               <br />
               beneﬁt of the people, instead of, as suggested by Hon. Members, for its own aggrandiscment, 
               <br />
               I would have no Confederation. If under Confederation there would be no chance of Respon- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sible,</span> Government, how can the Hon, Member expect to get it from a Council constituted as 
               <br />
               this is? However, as the subject has been brought forward for discussion, it behooves us to 
               <br />
               consider it upon its merits. There were two propositions before the House. "he Hon. Member 
               <br />
               for Lillooet has withdrawn his, which was in reality but a vague expression of an abstract ' 
               <br />
               opinion in favour of Responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government—a</span> recommendation in general terms. We have 
               <br />
               now to conﬁne our attention to the amendment of the Hon, Member for New Westminster; the 
               <br />
               preamble of which states that Confederation will not be satisfactory to the people without 
               <br />
               Responsible Government. The resolution itself, although embodying the same principle as the 
               <br />
               one which has been withdrawn, contemplates a practical step towards obtaining the object 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recommended</span> by addressing the Governor. The Hon. Member for New Westminster was 
               <br />
               careful to reserve his own opinion, but he very positive that Confederation without Respon- 
               <br />
               sible Government would not be acceptable to the people. Coming now to the subject and matter 
               <br />
               of the speeches of the two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Member</span> I ﬁnd that the arguments of the Hon. Member for 
               <br />
               Lillooct are simply invectives; his entire logic is abuse of the Government and the persons 
               <br />
               composing it. I have always <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">understood</span> that assertion is not fact. and that invective is not 
               <br />
               argument. It may he that my innb <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> to appreciate the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">force</span> of his remarks arises from my 
               <br />
               not poss sing the qualification which he told us _\vas essential to a proper understanding of 
               <br />
               the people and the people‘s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs</span> It may he that I have not “eaten and drunk and slept 
               <br />
               with the people." and cannot, therefore. rightly estimate the strength of den‘lonsl‘ration which 
               <br />
               general and indiscriminate abuse of Government otllcials may convey to some minds. As to 
               <br />
               the Hon. Member’s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">earnestness</span> of belief in his case, his conscientiousness in the discharge of 
               <br />
               his duty to his constituents and to the Colony, had we ever any doubt of it, his positive and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">repeated</span> assurances of the honesty <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> his intentions in this matter, of his uni-altering deter- 
               <br />
               mination to do his duty to those he represents. must have forced conviction upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us.</span> But, 
               <br />
               while <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1</span> ving him full credit for singlcness of purpose, I must take leave to remark on his 
               <br />
               singular mode of recommending ,the subject to the favourable consideration of this Council, 
               <br />
               since his argument in its favour is to heap general accusation and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vituperal‘ion</span> on the Ofﬁcial 
               <br />
               Members of this Council, whom he invites to join with him by voting in favour of his views,——to 
               <br />
               conﬁrm his view of their utter haseness and worthlessness. I shall not place myself in opposi~ 
               <br />
               tion to such a line of argument. But, Sir, the argument of the Hon. Member for New West~ 
               <br />
               minstcr is of a very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> character. I congratulate him, and I congratulate the House, on 
               <br />
               the manner in which the matter was treated by him, and especially as regards the ofﬁcials. I 
               <br />
               acknowledge the courteous manner in which he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">touched</span> on those points in his arguments which 
               <br />
               affected <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thc‘membors</span> at this end of the table. It is inseparable from the discussion of this
