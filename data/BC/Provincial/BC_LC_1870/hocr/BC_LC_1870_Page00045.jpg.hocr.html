               <br />
               must allude to what I cannot help calling the feeling of over-care and caution which has been 
               <br />
               displayed throughout this debate.

               I believe, Mr. President, that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">you</span> are an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Englishman</span> and as a nation I think you express 
               <br />
               too much caution, fear. and anxiety with respect to the course which Canada might pursue. 
               <br />
               I do not speak <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">personally,</span> but such appears to me to be the character c quality of English- 
               <br />
               men. and it has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">especially</span> cropped out <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">during</span> this debate. I say that I believe we are treating 
               <br />
               with a far-seeing, fair-dealing set of men who would never forfeit their word, statesmen who 
               <br />
               would be incapable of offering “ mean conditions,” even if we of British Columbia would accept 
               <br />
               them. They will give us terms to make us happy and contented. Another reason for our feel~ 
               <br />
               ing conﬁdence in the future is that we shall have under these terms, as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Member for 
               <br />
               Victoria District says, an enormous proportion of Representatives at Ottawa. and I presume 
               <br />
               that each of these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Representatives</span> will have a voice and the gift of speech.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               It is fair to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">augur</span> that the Dominion statesmen will give us what will make us contented 
               <br />
               and prosperous In touching upon this point, I should like to make an historical allusion, and 
               <br />
               for example I would refer to the present condition of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Union</span> between Great Britain and 
               <br />
               Ireland. {“Ilear, hear.” from Dr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lielmckenj</span> When Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentlemen</span> say “Hear, hear.” they 
               <br />
               may think I have given an unapt illustration. We, however know that the number of Ireland’s 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representatives.</span> amounting to something over one hundred, have enabled the Irish members at 
               <br />
               the B sh House of Commons to hold the balance of power and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hull:</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">patronage</span> between 
               <br />
               the great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contending</span> political parties. and by swaying between the Gladstonos and Disraelis, or 
               <br />
               other leaders of the day, they have frequently been able. to turn the scale so as to obtain what 
               <br />
               they desired. and to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">se</span> are a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">libc'al</span> share of the patronage to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">office.</span> I maintain, Sir, in this 
               <br />
               connection, that if Brit h Columbia found that by reason of her small repr <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">emotion—large</span> 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">comparison</span> with the representation of the different States in the Congress of America—I 
               <br />
               say, that if British Columbiun Members found that there. was any disposition to tyrannize in 
               <br />
               the Dominion llouse of Commons. which I do not for one moment fear, they could make common 
               <br />
               cause with other small maritime Provinces <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> Canada proper. To quote the words of the 
               <br />
               Hon. Chief Commissioner. I believe that British Columbia will be a pet Province of the Con- 
               <br />
               federacy. I try, Sir, to avoid <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speechanaking;</span> the time for that will be in Committee. I do 
               <br />
               not hope to sway a single vote by any remarks that I make. I believe that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">every</span> Hon. Member 
               <br />
               came here previously prepared to vote one way or the other, and I do not think any eloquent 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">orator-s.</span> and much less any feeble words of mine, will cause one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> them to change his opinion. 
               <br />
               But I make a speech in order that a record may be taken of it, and my constituents may be 
               <br />
               able to see that I was not dumb. I believe, I say, that all Ilon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Members</span> came down with their 
               <br />
               opinions formed, as to whether the amendment of the Hon. and learned Member for Victoria,

               <br />
               should be carried. I sincerely hope, however, that Hon. Members will join me in voting down
