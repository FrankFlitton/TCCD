               Hon. Mn. DnCOSMOS—Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Chairman</span> I do not intend to occupy the House for many 
               <br />
               minutes. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agree</span> with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Member for Lillooet, and I disagree with the Hon. Member 
               <br />
               for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> Westminster. 1 think, Sir, that we ought to have representative institutions and 
               <br />
               Responsible Government, irrespective of Confederation. The Hon. Member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> West- 
               <br />
               minster’s proposition unites it with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation.</span> I think this is a mistake; but it is of no 
               <br />
               matter, so long as we get it. I look upon Bri sh Columbia as a municipality under the British 
               <br />
               Crown. Under Canada it will be a municipality with less power. Anyone who knows anything 
               <br />
               ot’ municipal law knows that it is based upon three principles: territory, authority, and respon- 
               <br />
               sibility. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’_l(‘his</span> Colony has the ﬁrst two, and we are now asking for the third. and the terms 
               <br />
               sent down to the Council do not contain the elements of responsibility of the Executive to the 
               <br />
               people. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Everything</span> is tending to this point. Without responsibility, no matter how elective 
               <br />
               the new Council is, it will be a failure. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> people want Responsible Government and repre- 
               <br />
               sentative institutions under ‘any circumstances. I think the people would be traitors to 
               <br />
               themselves it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> accepted any form of Government which had not the element of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respom</span> 
               <br />
               sibility. I would rebel if there were enough like me in the Colony, and arrest every member 
               <br />
               of the Government that I thought was robbing mo of my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rights.</span> I would go to a further 
               <br />
               extreme. However, I shall not trouble the House with a long speech on this matter, as I 
               <br />
               consider it of little use. This question ended, I am contented to leave this Council and go to 
               <br />

               Hon. Dn. lARRALL—Mr. Chairman, I should like to ask what all this breeze is about? 
               <br />
               It is perfectly clear to all that as soon as we enter the Confederacy the people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> this country 
               <br />
               can have any form of Government they desire. I refuse to take up the issue without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Con~</span> 
               <br />
               federation, in a state of isolation. We are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dealing</span> with Confederation. I am, equally with 
               <br />
               the Hon. Member for New Westminster, aware of the priceless boon of responsibility which 
               <br />
               exists in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England,</span> which may fairly he called the standard~bearer of nations, and I am equally 
               <br />
               aware that the same rcsponsib ity does not exist in the I'nitcd States. During the late war 
               <br />
               I was in the United States army. Stanton. the then Secretary of War, was a most unpopular 
               <br />
               man. ’l‘hey wanted to get rid of him, but he could not be removed. When I took the ground 
               <br />
               that Responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> was not expedient. it was not because I did not approve of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">system.</span> It. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> I say, the wisest and best form <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Government, but it is too cumbrous for this 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colony,</span> I will repeat my objections: The Council contains no men of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">influence,</span> the con- 
               <br />
               stituencies are too remote, and the inhabitants are all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">engaged</span> in bread-seeking; there are few 
               <br />
               men of udependcnt means <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'who</span> would take part in Responsible Government. and, consequently, 
               <br />
               the direction of public affairs would fall <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">into</span> the hands of men who are not fitted, or qualiﬁed 
               <br />
               to govern the country, or otherwise into the hands of Victorians; neither of which I, for one, 
               <br />
               wish to see. How unfortunate it would be for Caribooites if the Hon. senior Member for 
               <br />
               Victoria (Dr. Helmcken) were elected for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Carillon.</span> I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">',</span> then. that it must fall into bad 
               <br />
               hands. or into the hands of Victorians. I offer that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ai..ument</span> as a British Columbian. The 
               <br />
               Executive Council do not care one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fig</span> what sort of Government the people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">take,</span> The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Executive</span> 
               <br />
               say the question is one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> the people to decide. We have a measure <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> responsib y now. 
               <br />
               The Hon. Member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> Westminster says that His <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Excellency</span> will do certain things. I 
               <br />
               take his speech as it reads, and I have no doubt that a majority of the people’s representatives 
               <br />
               will sit round the board; none know how great the majority will he. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[Attorlicy»Ge1ieralv—“Hear,</span>
