               <br />
               with the Dominion of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada.</span> I desire to consult the wish of the Council as to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">paI‘tiCUIal‘</span> 
               <br />
               mode in which the terms should be discussed. whether as a whole or in detail, paragraph by

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">paragraph.</span> But before doing so I think it right, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Sir,</span> to make a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">few</span> brief remarks on the 
               <br />
               Resolution as a whole. The conditions have been prepared with great care, and after the 
               <br />
               exercise of deep thought and mature <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deliberation</span> on the part of His Excellency the Governor 
               <br />
               and the Executive Council. The subject is one of so large a nature, and of such paramount 
               <br />
               importance, so many interests both here and in Canada are at stake, and the issues involved 
               <br />
               are so extensive. that I sincerely hope that all Hon. Members will bring to its discussion an 
               <br />
               earnest desire to combine their individual efforts to work out a successful result, and to throw 
               <br />
               aside, for such an occasion, all former prejudices and distrust; and as we have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unanimously</span> 
               <br />
               afﬁrmed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> principle, the House is committed to Confederation in the abstract [“ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">No,</span> no,” from 
               <br />
               Hons. Helmcken, Wood <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Drake}.</span> Well, I think so, and the House will think so too. It 
               <br />
               has so voted. However that may be, I hope <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> we can all now act harmoniously together, 
               <br />
               and see whether we cannot now turn out such a scheme as will work well in practice; he 
               <br />
               just and equitable to Canada, who will certainly be just and equitable to us, and yet be so

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">favourable</span> to this Colony as to insure the terms ratiﬁcation when submitted to the popular 
               <br />
               vote All Hon. Members, whatever <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> opinions, desire the same thing, namely, to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">get</span> the 
               <br />
               best terms practicable for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country;</span> and the proposition now sent down, which is based 
               <br />
               upon the “British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">America</span> Act, 1867,” contains, I submit, the best terms that can be 
               <br />
               devised, and will give the Local Government as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">large</span> an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">annual</span> balance of cash for local 
               <br />
               purposes as we can venture to ule There is one danger against which I think it my duty 
               <br />
               to warn <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon,</span> Members, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> I do particularly caution those who favour the idea of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confedera-</span> 
               <br />
               tion against attempting to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">weigh</span> the conditions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> additional suggestions and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recommendations</span> 
               <br />
               so as to overload <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> against suggesting alterations in the terms which could not be 
               <br />
               granted by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada,</span> I believe we are all equally anxious to gain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">good</span> terms, and we should 
               <br />
               be careful not to take away from the interest of the proposition before us by suggesting any 
               <br />
               other conditions that are not of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">material</span> importance. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1'</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> observed a report in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> newspaper 
               <br />
               of the previous proceedings of the Council. if I may be allowed to notice it without producing 
               <br />
               the paper, in which an Hon. Member is stated to have said, that any amendments of the 
               <br />
               Resolution would be accepted. I think it right to say, on behalf of the Government, that, 
               <br />
               while the Government cannot consent to imperil the unity of their scheme by amendments, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> will still be happy to receive, and fully consider, all suggestions of a practical and 
               <br />
               reasonable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">character:</span> and I invite Hon. Members to bring forward such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suggestions,</span> particu- 
               <br />
               larly such as will be calculated to remove any of the disadvantages of the scheme, and so to 
               <br />
               improve its working and insure its more general acceptance. As the majority of the Council 
               <br />
               seem to be in favour of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dividing</span> the Resolution into parts, and discussing it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">paragraph</span> by 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pal-ngrnph.</span> I will follow the suggestion. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">therefore,</span> now propose the adoption of the ﬁrst
