               The Vancouver Island Road Tax is a purely municipal matter, and so the Government has 
               <br />
               blundered in mixing up municipal with provincial revenue. The Yale-Cariboo Road Tolls are 
               <br />
               estimated as a permanent source of revenue at $50,000. This is another mistake. for the 
               <br />
               Road Tolls are falling off every year. In 1868 they were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3567,82</span> ; in 1860, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$46,500;</span> and in 
               <br />
               all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prohahilit;</span> will be much less in 1870; and as mining diminishes in the upper country, 
               <br />
               year by year, so will the Tolls. If ever the proposed Railway be built, away go the Tolls 
               <br />
               altogether, Besides that, the present Road Tolls are oppressively high. On the receipts of 
               <br />
               last year, they are equal to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$150</span> per waggon load of 6,000 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lbs,</span> or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">21/2</span> cents per <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lh.,—-an</span> enor- 
               <br />
               mous tax that no one in his senses would ever <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">think</span> of regarding as permanent. If any toll 
               <br />
               at all were levied permanently, it could not he ﬁxed at a higher rate than one- xth of a cent 
               <br />
               per pound. or $10 per load of 6,000 lbs, from Yale to Carihoo. At that rate the Road Tolls, 
               <br />
               instead of yielding $50,000 per year, would only produce $3,333, which for all practical 
               <br />
               purposes might as well be abolished. for the cost of collection would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exceed</span> the receipts. For 
               <br />
               another and all-important reason, I think a great mistake has been made in entering the Road 
               <br />
               Tolls as permanent revenue after union. It is this: the entire people of! the upper country 
               <br />
               have determined to abolish the Road Tolls as soon as possible. No compromise will he accepted. 
               <br />
               So, under this head our future revenue cannot he estimated higher than $3,333, or nothing. 
               <br />
               The revenue from Land Sales is also put higher than we are justified in ﬁxing it, In 1868, 
               <br />
               the receipts under the head of Land Sales were only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,200;</span> in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1860,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$5,504;</span> and as permanent 
               <br />
               revenue, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> all time to come. under union, at $6,000. Now, as it is alike our policy and our 
               <br />
               interest not to make Land Sales a source of revenue, I do not think that we would act judiciously 
               <br />
               in considering the terms of union if we estimate a higher amount of permanent revenue from 
               <br />
               this source than the receipts of 1800, $1,200. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Neither</span> Land Revenue nor Rents appear to he as 
               <br />
               uncertain in their returns as Land Sales; so I will pass on to the items of Miners’ Certiﬁcates, 
               <br />
               $11,000, and Mining Receipts, $12,500. Here again it appears to me another mistake has been 
               <br />
               made. Such gold mines as are worked in British Columbia will he worked out. Such diggings 
               <br />
               are sure to he deserted in a very few years. The white miners will retire, and the Chinese will 
               <br />
               take their place. When the Chinamau leaves, the mines are worked out. I can, therefore, see 
               <br />
               but little hope of permanent revenue from the gold <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mines,</span> Already the mining revenue has 
               <br />
               begun to fall <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">off.</span> In 1807, Miners’ Certiﬁcates yielded <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$13,645;</span> in 1868, $11,535; in 1869, 
               <br />
               $10,500; and is likely to be less in 1870, although the estimate is $11,000. In 1867, Mining 
               <br />
               Receipts were $22,208; in 1808, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$15,756;</span> in 1860, $11500; and yet for 1870 the estimate is 
               <br />
               $12,500. At the utmost, from all departments of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mining,</span> we cannot, in my opinion, estimate 
               <br />
               higher than $10,000 as permanent revenue, and but little of that amount will ultimately be 
               <br />
               drawn from gold-mining. Now, Sir, with respect to Spirit Licences, which have been estimated 
               <br />
               by the Government at $25,000 as permanent revenue, there could he no greater blunder made. 
               <br />
               The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> gentleman who framed these terms seems to have had no notion whatever of the 
               <br />
               syteins <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taxation</span> that obtain in the Dominion, and has consequently repeated his mistake of 
               <br />
               mixing Municipal taxation with Provincial. In the Dominion there are three forms of Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">viz;</span> Municipal, Provincial, and Dominional, and each has its own system of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taxation.</span> 
               <br />
               Here we have but Provincial and Municipal Governments, with their respective systems of 
               <br />
               taxation. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now</span> it appears that consideration has only been given, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">framing</span> these terms, to 
               <br />
               taxation under the Customs and Internal Revenue Laws of the Dominion. But Provincial 
               <br />
               Taxation ought also to have been considered, and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">starting</span> point should have been the 
               <br />
               equalization of our Provincial Taxes with the Provincial Ta <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3</span> of the Eastern Provinces. This 
               <br />
               is made very apparent with respect to Spirit Licences. Here the Provincial Government levies 
               <br />
               $200 per annum on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">retailers</span> in tow and in the country <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:30</span> per annum. In Ontario the retail 
               <br />
               spirit licence is $20 per annum in e s. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$17</span> in towns, and $10 in the country. In estimating our 
               <br />
               future revenue from this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">source,</span> we are not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">justified</span> in placing it higher than the rate of Ontario, 
               <br />
               and that would reduce the receipts from Spirit <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Licences</span> from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&amp;</span> o.000 to about $6,250 per <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">annuml</span> 
               <br />
               The excess above the latter amount, if levied, ought to he levied <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> Municipal purposes. The 
               <br />
               Trade Licorice here is also estimated too high. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">after</span> careful study of these sources of 
               <br />
               Provincial Revenue which it is proposed that the Colony, after union, shall eXClusively possess, 
               <br />
               I cannot make the permanent receipts higher than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$50,000</span> per aununl. The difference, therefore, 
               <br />
               between my estimate of Provincial taxation and that of the framer of these terms, is $101,050, 
               <br />
               or as $151,050 is to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$50,000,</span> If a larger amount than the latter be levied by our Provincial 
               <br />
               Government after admission, our taxes will be out of proportion to the taxes in the Eastern 
               <br />
               Provinces for Provincial purposes. Before propounding what I consider ought to be the ﬁnancial
