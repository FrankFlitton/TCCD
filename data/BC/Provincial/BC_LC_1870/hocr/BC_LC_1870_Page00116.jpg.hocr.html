               <br />
               I have never felt the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">weight</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responsibility</span> as I feel it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today.</span> I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feel</span> that I am about casting

               <br />
               that the intelligent portion of the community are in favour of Responsible Government, but 
               <br />
               there is a grave question in regard to its adaptation to the Colony. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> words coming from 
               <br />
               His Excellency are worthy of careful consideration; they contain strong reasons against the 
               <br />
               introduction of Responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government.</span> Public opinion is not settled on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Island,</span> The 
               <br />
               Hon. senior Ieinbcr for Victoria City has shown in his remar‘ s that there is a great want 
               <br />
               of settled principle in the Colony. The principal men of Victoria are averse to taking upon 
               <br />
               themselves the duties and labour of: legislating for the country. Men of standing and wealth 
               <br />
               stand aloof. ’l‘ho merchants, manufacturers, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">professional</span> men <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">talic</span> no interest in the 
               <br />
               matter of legislalion. There is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> di iculty in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">getting</span> good representative men. There 
               <br />
               are. I admit. many <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">good</span> reasons which might be urged against the measure, and I have no 
               <br />
               doubt that dissatisfaction, to some extent, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may</span> ensue. I, agree with the Commissioner of Lands 
               <br />
               and Works, in his remarks about the press <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">influencing</span> the public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unfavom‘nbly</span> to the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment; but the blame is not in the press, but in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">system</span> of Government which keeps the 
               <br />
               rulers <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">silent.</span> The members of the Government ought to be in a position {to defend themselves, 
               <br />
               both by pen and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speech.</span> I have glanced at a few reasons against the admission of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Responsible</span> 
               <br />
               Government, but I will now look at the other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">side.</span> Look at the fact of all the larger subjects, 
               <br />
               under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">['niou;</span> being dealt with by the Federal power. This <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fact,</span> of itself, is as strong an 
               <br />
               argument as we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">need.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">What</span> Hon. Member can go to his constituents and tell them that he 
               <br />
               thinks the local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">busint.</span> s of this Colony could be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">managed</span> better at Ottawa than it can be by 
               <br />
               ourselves? The Ofﬁcial Members of this Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will.</span> no doubt, avail themselves of the 
               <br />
               retiring pension. and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appointees</span> from Ottawa will take their places. Will those latter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">officials</span> 
               <br />
               have to be pensioned off by ibis Colony when we adopt Responsible Government? This is a 
               <br />
               strong <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">objection</span> to entering the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Union</span> under a system like the present. This Colony may 
               <br />
               be asked to pension another set of ofﬁcials. Will the people be satisfied with this sort of 
               <br />
               Government if we are to have appointees from Ottawa? There are a class of men who oppose
