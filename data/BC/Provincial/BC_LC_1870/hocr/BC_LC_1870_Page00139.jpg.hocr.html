               <br />
               may send agricultural produce. Butter. I believe, comes from cows; it costs money to huy a 
               <br />
               cow; there is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dlii‘eronce</span> between raising <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agricultural</span> produce and cattle. if butter could 
               <br />
               be grown from the ground I don’t suppose that forty tons would have been imported. Farmers 
               <br />
               are poor: they have not money to buy stock. Keep up protection and they will have money 
               <br />
               bye and bye to purchase cattle. Experience of the agriculturalists in this Colony has taught me 
               <br />
               that farmers with capital come out at the wrong end of the stick, whilst those who have gone 
               <br />
               in to work <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> themselves have made money. I know most of the farmers on Vancouver Island, 
               <br />
               and I ﬁnd that those who began with nothing are doing well. The Hon. Collector of Customs 
               <br />
               said that farmers in the upper country don’t require a tariff. I went into that question 
               <br />
               yesterday. I think they will want it.

               and that we might <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> up the farming. interests of this Colony for it. Now, Sir, this Council 
               <br />
               said last year, almost unanimously, that agricultural interests must be protected. Why should

               Hon. Members think that we should require anything different under Confederation? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> Hon.

               Now, Sir, what have we been trying for? What has been our policy? Why, to protect industry. 
               <br />
               I am told that the Dominion Government will not admit any alteration in our tariff; and the 
               <br />
               example of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">United</span> States is cited. It has been said that California wanted to alter her 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariﬁf,</span> and was not allowed to do so. I say, in reply, that Californiawas one and a part of 
               <br />
               the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States,</span> British Columbia is not yet Contederated. so we are still in a position to 
               <br />
               make terms. California would have made terms if she could, but could not; and it was for 
               <br />
               a time a question whether she should not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">secede.</span> It was only large subsidies and steam

               communication that kept California in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Union.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">There</span> is this peculiarity in the Organic Act,
