               <br />
               agricultural population. It Confederation comes, and brings the Canadian tariff, we destroy the 
               <br />

               a market for. They must <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">find</span> an outlet, which must be where the consumers are. If the duty 
               <br />

               had a lower scale upon some other goods I should think it an advantage. 1 support protection 
               <br />
               to the agricultural interest, and the throwing open of our ports to other things. The latter part
