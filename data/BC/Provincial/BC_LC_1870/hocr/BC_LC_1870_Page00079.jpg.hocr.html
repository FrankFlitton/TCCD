               <br />
               regarded as a part of the transcontinental line, and in my opinion it would do more to build

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">practicable.</span> I, therefore, move a recommendation to His Excellency that the construction of 
               <br />
               a Railway from steamboat navigation on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Fraser</span> River to Kaniloops Lake be inserted in

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon,</span> CHIEF <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">COMMISSIONISRWSU‘,</span> I approach the consideration of this clause with 
               <br />
               a great sense of the magnitude of the work which we propose to the Government of, that 
               <br />
               Dominion with which we propose to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confederatcd.</span> My mind seems somewhat to shrink 
               <br />
               before the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contemplation</span> of its magnitude; and it is only when the reﬂection is gradually 
               <br />
               forced upon me, that the union can never be a reality until the Railway is commenced in our 
               <br />
               own territory, and that it is necessary, that I can bring myself to believe that it should be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">done.</span> That it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">practicable</span> is undeniable, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> needs no argument. From all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">information</span> I 
               <br />
               have been able to obtain, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">comparing</span> it with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difficulties</span> which have been overcome on 
               <br />
               the Paciﬁc line, I believe the proportion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> cost of the proposed line of Railway from the 
               <br />
               seaboard of British Columbia to Canada to be not more than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">two‘thirds</span> of the cost of the line 
               <br />
               already built from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">California</span> across the Sierra Nevada. There will, of course, be difﬁculties 
               <br />
               to overcome, which may inﬂuence the choice of the best line <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">route</span> I believe we are justi- 
               <br />
               fied in asking for the construction of the Railway, and I am satisﬁed, I may say I know, that 
               <br />
               there is a great desire on the part of those now in power in Canada to construct this Railroad, 
               <br />
               and if it be in their power to do it it will be done. To go to the terms: objections have been 
               <br />
               made to the time of commencement I would ask the House to consider what an amount of 
               <br />
               prospecting and survey will have to be done before any commencement can possibly be made 
               <br />
               in the work. I do not think that there is any delay suggested by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁxing</span> the time of three 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years.</span> I think it is the shortest time that could be named. The proper line could hardly be 
               <br />
               determined sooner. We do not presume to suggest the scheme, or the means. My opinion is 
               <br />
               that the Railway will be built by private enterprise, under a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">guarantee.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">As</span> the Imperial 
               <br />
               Government have shown a desire to encourage Confederation, I think we have a right to 
               <br />
               expect that they will render seine assistance in the building of the Railway. especially after 
               <br />
               Lord Granville’s despatch. [Hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bean]</span> I hope <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the Canadian Government will have 
               <br />
               the assistance of the Imperial Government in carrying out this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scheme,</span> It will be some time 
               <br />
               before the scheme can be developed, and then atleast two seasons must elapse, as an immense 
               <br />
               amount of reconuoitring and surveying will be necessary. Three years is not too much. The 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hour</span> Member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Victoria</span> District <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> DeCosnios) objects to the framing of this Resolution 
               <br />
               as too catching. I think his objection is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unfounded,</span> I believe that the beneﬁts will be real 
               <br />
               and substantial. The reason that so small a sum as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,000.000</span> is asked for is that it is only 
               <br />
               intended to be an earnest. so to speak, on the part of the Dominion Government that the 
               <br />
               Railway will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">made.</span> I believe that the expenditure <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> $1,000.000 upon the ﬁrst twenty 
               <br />
               miles will bring an accession of from 5.000 to 10,000 to our population. We have a right to 
               <br />
               ask that the Railway should be commenced here. It is desirable that it should be made here. 
               <br />
               It will be found that when once it is commenced here a nucleus of, population will be formed 
               <br />
               which will add considerably to the prosperity of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colony.</span> It has been argued that no 
               <br />
               profit can arise from the expenditure of the vast amount of capital that will be required to 
               <br />
               build this Railway. It will cost probably $20,000,000, and therefore is not likely to be 
               <br />
               proﬁtable for years to come. We cannot, in my opinion. expect any pecuniary return for 
               <br />
               years. It believes the Dominion Government, if they desire the prosperity of this part of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Empire,</span> to develop the resources of the estate which we are handing over. If they value it as 
               <br />
               we. do, and as we believe that they do. they will endeavour to realize the advantages at the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">earliest</span> possible date. This Railway will do so. when it is completed across the Rocky 
               <br />
               Mountains, and in my opinion not till then shall we have a population. Before concluding, I 
               <br />
               desire to say that it is intended, although it is not so stated in the terms, to give an assurance 
               <br />
               to the Dominion Government that any amount <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> land which they think reasonable will be 
               <br />
               given. This will be made a part of the scheme for the construction of the Railway, if thought 
               <br />
               desirable.
