               The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mn.</span> DRAKE, Junior Member for Victoria City, said :—Sir, .I do not think that 
               <br />
               the advantages to Canada have been fairly put; it has been said <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the sum of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$35,000</span> is an 
               <br />
               arbitrary“ sum similar to the subsidy allowed to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland.</span> From the expenses of carrying 
               <br />
               on the Government of this Colony in proportion to the expense of the Government of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New»</span> 
               <br />
               foundland, in comparison to the population. I say that the sum is out of proportion and too 
               <br />
               sniall for the requirements of this Colony. I would put it up to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$70000.</span> Canada will receive, 
               <br />
               after paying subsidies and expenses. $128,000. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lanada</span> will no doubt fund the debt at a smaller 
               <br />
               rate of interest.

               Hon. Mn. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">DRAKE—It</span> is a matter of assertion, but I am of o inion that she will, and with 
               <br />
               the payment of debts in ﬁve <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years,</span> Canada will pay out about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$53,000</span> only a year, therefore 
               <br />
               I move a recommendation to the Governor that “ $70,000 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"’be</span> inserted in the conditions, instead 
               <br />
               of “ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$33000.”</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The Hon. CHIEF <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">COMMISSIONER,</span> said :—Mr. Chairman, I shall be glad, speaking for 
               <br />
               myself as an individual member of this House, to accept any reasonable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suggestion,</span> and 
               <br />
               shall not oppose the recommendation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the Hon. Member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> Westminster. With refer- 
               <br />
               ence to the amount of our debt, the Government scheme gives the Colony the full beneﬁt of 
               <br />
               the debts to come in. I say that the debt of British Columbia, after Confederation, cannot 
               <br />
               be funded, or the greater part of it cannot, for this reason, the debt is payable in Debentures 
               <br />
               which fall due at certain dates. After Confederation the price of Debentures will go up, and 
               <br />
               Canada can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">get</span> no further beneﬁt by funding, except as regards the Floating Debt. With 
               <br />
               regard to the remark of the Hon. Mr. Wood, who says the Resolution is framed with reference 
               <br />
               to present gain and future loss, I say we may wait and the horse may starve while the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grass</span> 
               <br />
               is growing. When we enter Confederation we must do so in the expectation that" we shall 
               <br />
               participate in all the advantages of Confederation; any increase of revenue or population will 
               <br />
               bring its share to us; we must believe that Canada will deal fairly with us. Now, Sir, I 
               <br />
               followed the Hon. Member for Victoria District through his ﬁgures when he propounded his 
               <br />
               new scheme, and I must say that I am better pleased with the Government measure than I 
               <br />
               was before; ours comes out on a stronger basis than before, in contradistinction to his. By 
               <br />
               his scheme he proposes to ask a clear <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gift;</span> we ask much the same amount, but show the grounds. 
               <br />
               The Hon. Member has based his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">argument</span> on assumption more than the Government have. 
               <br />
               It is wrong to look upon the estimate of population as a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁction,</span> it is not so. it is based upon 
               <br />
               calculation. Call it an expediency it? you will, but it is no ﬁction. He seems to treat British 
               <br />
               Columbia as if it were an estate to be parted with for a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">quid</span> pro mm, which is not a fair way 
               <br />
               of treating the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subject.</span> If Canada sends us goods she will derive <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">greater</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advantages</span> from 
               <br />
               doing so than we shall, but nevertheless we shall <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">participate.</span> When our population increases 
               <br />
               rates of taxation will be reduced; a lower tariff. cheaper manufactured <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">goods,</span> and lower rents, 
               <br />
               are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amongst</span> the advantages that I look for out of Confederation. With <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span> to the Road 
               <br />
               Tolls, I look upon it as essential that they should be kept up to meet the expenses of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">main</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taining</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">roads</span> and keeping them in repair. It has been a question, and perhaps it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">still</span> 
               <br />
               open for debate, whether the care and maintenance of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Main</span> Trunk Road should not be 
               <br />
               thrown upon the Dominion Government; if we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span> the road as military work necessary for 
               <br />
               the defence of the country, its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">maintenance</span> may fairly be a charge upon the federal revenue. 
               <br />
               I think we shall be in a better position to uphold the terms <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alter</span> this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discussion.</span> I. believe 
               <br />
               that our future will be speedily prosperous, and I am quite satisﬁed that the Dominion Govern— 
               <br />
               ment should share in our prosperity. It will not do for us to depreciate our own future 
               <br />
               prospects.

               Hon. Mn. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HELMCKEﬂ—J</span> have not much to say in favour of Canada, but this much I will
