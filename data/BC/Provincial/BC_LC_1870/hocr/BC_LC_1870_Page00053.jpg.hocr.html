               we do not get Confederation we shall still have our own Representative Institutions. and once

               Now, I earnestly deprecate, on the part <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or</span> the Government, the unfair allegation which one

               I-Iou. Member has so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">improperly</span> insinuated that the Government or Government Oll‘lcials con-

               <br />
               utmost that has ever been said on this side <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">01?</span> the House has been that, under the present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cit»</span> 
               <br />
               cmnsimzccs of the Colony, it would be unwise, excessively costly—nay impracticable. As I 
               <br />
               have said before, and again repeat, the Governor has no power of himself to alter the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cousti»</span> 
               <br />
               tution. He can only refer it where it has already <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gone,</span> to the decision <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the Queen in 
               <br />
               Council, which we ought in common justice to await before bringing forward any Resolution 
               <br />
               for Responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> Now, how would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> country, if a unit on this point, get 
               <br />
               Responsible Government after Confederation? After Confederation the people can have

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Responsible</span> Government, if they desire it, under clause 92 of the “British North America
