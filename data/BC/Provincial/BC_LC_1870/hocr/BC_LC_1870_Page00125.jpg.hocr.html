               <br />
               mixed it up with the terms; but the Government has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mixed</span> the terms up with it; and if there-

               is any blame, any responsibility in this connection. it mus rest with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government,</span> and not 
               <br />
               with the Opposition The Hon. gentleman tells us that it is impossible to work Responsible- 
               <br />
               Government with a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population</span> so scattered; and in the same breath he tells us that we have-

               Itesponsible Government now,—~that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">officials</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">z</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*e</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responsible</span> to the Governor, and he to the 
               <br />
               Queen. Well, certainly. this is a sort of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responsibility;</span> but it is not precisely the kind we want. 
               <br />
               The responsibility now existing takes the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wrong</span> direction. It is not responsibility to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people,</span> 
               <br />
               but to the supreme <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">powein</span> in this sense the most despotic form of government in the world 
               <br />
               may be termed Responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government.</span> The members of the Government of the Czar <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>

               <br />
               Responsible Government! The Hon. gentleman must see the absurdity of his startling propo- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sitlon.</span> Ile next tells us that it‘ the people desire Responsible Government it is because they 
               <br />
               have been educated up to it by the press. There is more truth than argument in this. Doubt- 
               <br />
               less the press is in this, as in other civilized countries. the great educator of the people, especially 
               <br />
               in matters political. Have not the people of England been similarly educated up to every great 
               <br />
               political reform? Such constitutes a legitimate and important function of the press. But the- 
               <br />
               honourable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> goes further and tells us that if the present Government is unpopular 
               <br />
               with the people the responsibility resls with the press. which has by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">misrepresentation</span> created 
               <br />
               prejudice in the public mind. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">This</span> proposition I beg most. unqualifiedly to deny. The honour- 
               <br />
               able gentleman has confounded cause and effect. The press has opposed the Government because 
               <br />
               it is unpopular; and the Government is unpopular because it is not. a people‘s Government—— 
               <br />
               because it does not possess the principle of responsibility to the people. it must be remembered 
               <br />
               that the press subsists on popular favour; and in order lo subsist it must oppose an unpopular 
               <br />
               form <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Government. The press of this Colony has acted rather as the exponent than the 
               <br />
               moulder and leader of public opinion in its opposition to the present form of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">As</span> 
               <br />
               I have repeatedly said, it is not the ofﬁcials that are unpopular. so much as the system under 
               <br />
               which th administer. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\‘o</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">officials</span> can be popular under such a system. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> places them in 
               <br />
               a false position. The press is, therefore, not to blame; it is the faithful exponent of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">public»</span> 
               <br />
               opinion. The honourable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> on my left <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[Min</span> l—Iolbrooh} dissents from this view. It is 
               <br />
               the habit of some honourable gentlemen to affect to sneer at the press 0t this Colony. They 
               <br />
               admit that the pre s of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England</span> is all I claim for it; but they allude sneeringly to the press 
               <br />
               of this Colony. ow, I am free to admit that the leading journal of this Colony would lose 
               <br />
               by a comparison with the leading journal of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England.</span> It is smaller, and, perhaps, less ability 
               <br />
               is displayed in its editorial columns. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lint</span> would not such a comparison be unfair? Apply this 
               <br />
               rule to other institutions of the Colony and what would be the result? Taking the press of 
               <br />
               this Colony with all its imperfections, and l boldly assert that it will compare <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">favourably</span> with 
               <br />
               that of any other country of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">like</span> age and population. That is the way to institute the com- 
               <br />
               parison; and it is the only true way. When I hear honourable gentlemen indulging in sneers 
               <br />
               at the press I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">invariably</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all</span> ye at one conclusion: and I will not tell you what that conclusion 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is.</span> it will not be nec <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.l</span> for me to again allude to the improper use made of what I said 
               <br />
               about the hornv-hunded class, especially as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Mr. Walkem fully vindicated <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">me.</span> One more 
               <br />
               point and i have. done with the honourable the Chief Commissioner. That gentleman repeated 
               <br />
               the now stereotyped argument <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Dominion Govormnent. being based on liberal inslitu- 
               <br />
               tions. would not withhold Responsible Government if desired by the people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of:</span> British Columbia. 
               <br />
               That argument has been so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">often</span> met that I was surprised to hear it repeated by that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">honour»</span> 
               <br />
               able <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman.</span> Need I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say.</span> for the twentieth time, that it is not the prerogative of the

               <br />
               to regard the constant <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iteration</span> of those exploded arguments as evidence of the weakness of
