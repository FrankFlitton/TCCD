               Responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government.</span> I entirely concur with the lion. Mr. Wood in believing that more 
               <br />
               liberal representation will do much more for the good of the Colony than Responsible Govcrn~ 
               <br />
               ment. I believe in a good franchise being given, as foreshadowed by the Governor‘s Speech; 
               <br />
               and I think twelve elected and eight nominated members would give satisfaction and work 
               <br />
               well, although report makes the change more liberal than this, We are now on the eve of 
               <br />
               prosperity. Our quartz mining is still to be commenced, and we only want good roads to 
               <br />
               Kootenay, by way of Eagle Pass, to open our resources in this respect. I do not intend to 
               <br />
               enter upon the question of Responsible Government. I believe it would be bad for us and is 
               <br />
               not required by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people.</span> I shall support the Government in the clause now under discussion.

               Hon. Mn. DECOSMOS—Mr. Chairman, I had not expected to say anything more on this 
               <br />
               subject; but, on more mature reﬂection, I am satisﬁed that it is my duty to do so. The more 
               <br />
               the matter is argued, and the more the remarks of Government members are heard, the more 
               <br />
               I believe we are being asked to take a leap in the dark; for all I can learn is that the new 
               <br />
               House is to be partly nominative and partly elective—and not responsible. The proportions 
               <br />
               are not stated. It has also cropped out that there will be a qualiﬁcation for members. and 
               <br />
               also for electors. If the Government refer this matter to the people to know whether such a 
               <br />
               Constitution will suit them, I believe the people, to almost a unit, will reject it. The mass 
               <br />
               are opposed to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">altogether</span> unless they can get a more liberal representation than 
               <br />
               that proposed by the Government. At the outset I proposed a Committee of all parties to 
               <br />
               consider and report upon the whole matter; but the hasty judgment of the House, as I think, 
               <br />
               deferred the question. Now, Sir, I think <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">if,</span> the Committee had met and suggested, for the 
               <br />
               protection of the property element, that one-third of the Members of the Council should be 
               <br />
               elected for a longer period and hold property <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">qualiﬁcations,</span> the country would have been 
               <br />
               satisﬁed. I can conceive on some such proposition as that being laid before the House, it 
               <br />
               would have been eminently successful; as it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nor</span> stands it is matter of opinion. I think the 
               <br />
               Governor has been led into error if the utterances that occasionally drop from members of this 
               <br />
               House mean anything. I cannot conceive <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the people will accept such a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Constitution.</span> I 
               <br />
               should prefer that we should go into Confederation as a unit. I have made these few remarks 
               <br />
               to set my mind at rest, and to save myself trouble with my constituents if I should offer myself 
               <br />
               as a candidate again. I state that I believe the Government will jeopardise Confederation on 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> point.

               Hon. MR. DEWDNEY—Sir, the question now ,under consideration has been so fully gone 
               <br />
               into by Hon, Members of the Council, that I feel it will be useless for me to take up the time 
               <br />
               of this House to any great length. At the commencement of this debate I had several argn~ 
               <br />
               ments which I proposed to bring before your notice against Responsible Government, but I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that these have been ably <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">handled</span> by other Ilon. gentlemen far more ably than I could 
               <br />
               have hoped to do; and should I not have been convinced at the earlier stages of this debate, 
               <br />
               other arguments have been adduced which now completely set my mind at rest on the subject. 
               <br />
               I am opposed to the recommendations of both the Hon, Members for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> Westminster and 
               <br />
               Lillooet, particularly the latter, and in opposing them I do not feel I am injuring the cause of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation.</span> But while I feel, Mr. Chairman, that it is unnecessary for me to enter into 
               <br />
               the question of Responsible Government, I think I should not be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">doing</span> my duty were I to 
               <br />
               remain silent upon one matter connected with this debate—one upon which I consider I am as 
               <br />
               capable of giving an opinion as any Ilon. Member of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Councilmnamely,</span> the feelings of 
               <br />
               the inhabitants of the Mainland generally with regard to Responsible Government. I have 
               <br />
               travelled through this country as much as any Hon. Member of this Council, and I have been 
               <br />
               brought in contact with all classes, and have mixed with all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">classes.</span> and I have yet to meet the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst individual who has expressed to me his desire for Responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now.</span> Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, do you believe. does this Council believe, that the cry throughout this Colony is— 
               <br />
               down with the present form of Government, let us have Responsible Government? Hon. 
               <br />
               Members of this House are aware, I presume, that my avocations for some years past, in fact 
               <br />
               as long as I have been in the Colony, have necessarily brought me in contact with all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">classes”</span> 
               <br />
               and should this have been the cry, do you think I should not have heard it? I say distinctly 
               <br />
               again. I have yet to meet the ﬁrst individual who has expressed to me his desire for Respon~

               sible Government, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> feeling of my constituents is not in favour of Responsible Government; 
               <br />
               on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contrary,</span> it was distinctly expressed to me that they do not desire any change in the 
               <br />
               present form of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government.</span> All they want is money to keep their trails in order and a
