               more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«advanced</span> than the people on the Sound; to-day, on the Sound, trade has so far increased 
               <br />
               as to be almost equally as good, and I am told you can buy goods almost as cheaply as in 
               <br />
               Victoria, so I do not believe free port would restore our pristine prosperity. Under free trade 
               <br />
               it i . pposed that large stocks of goods will come by Panama. or by long sea route. But look 
               <br />
               at the altered condition of things resulting from the Pacific Railway, and the railway to 
               <br />
               Columbia River, and probably on to Puget Sound. Do you <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">imagine</span> anyone will send large

               stocks of goods to lie her <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘2</span> and will not people telegraph for whatever they may require, and. 
               <br />
               bring them across the continent by railway? 1 say that the same prosperity and trade that 
               <br />
               we enjoyed before would not come back. We are told that when the railway is made Asiatic 
               <br />
               trade will come across, but I doubt the railway being made in our time, and, if it is, ships 
               <br />
               will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">go</span> wherever the rail ' v terminus 1 and that will not be here. It would be an advan-

               <br />
               and we may do something. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">And</span> this brings me ‘to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">observation</span> of my Hon. friend on my 
               <br />
               right, that more frequent steam communication with the Sound would be productive of much 
               <br />
               good to trade. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">What</span> i want to say is that the persons going to negotiate these terms ought 
               <br />
               to be able to state that this Colony requires restrictions in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariff.</span> I do not intend to be 
               <br />
               factions, but I do intend to show to the Canadian Government what we consider best for this 
               <br />
               country, and that without certain terms we believe Confederation will be bad. What use is it 
               <br />
               to attempt to deceive Canada? She knows what is being done, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> it‘ not, there are those here 
               <br />
               who would tell her. It is our duty to show the Canadian Government that there are things 
               <br />
               we desire. Of what use is the country to Canada unless it is populated? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘She</span> wants people, 
               <br />
               not terms. We must show what will be the advantages of Confederation. If the tarifl’ of the 
               <br />
               Dominion must come here it will be unsuitable to us—an admitted evil. If this cannot be 
               <br />
               remedied, Confederation is likely to be put off for years. I merely mean to elicit the feeling of 
               <br />
               this House on the subject <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">01’</span> whether we can take off: certain duties. If commerce can be 
               <br />
               protected in the way we desire, as we shall see when the persons who go to arrange the terms 
               <br />
               come back, then it will be no use to oppose Confederation. If the evil is still to exist, then 
               <br />
               there will be opposition.
