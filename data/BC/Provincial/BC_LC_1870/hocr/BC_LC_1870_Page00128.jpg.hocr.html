               Hon. DR. CARRALL~S1r, on Friday last the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">honourable</span> member for New <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Westminster</span> 
               <br />
               spoke at some length upon this subject, and I replied as best I could, and it is in accordance 
               <br />
               with the eternal fitness of things that I should make a very few remarks. It is one of those 
               <br />
               happy things in nature that where the poison is there is the antidote always near. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Laughton)</span> 
               <br />
               I propose to give the antidote. I laid down two principles: First, that the Government did 
               <br />
               not believe that Responsible Government, as it is maintained in England, was applicable to this 
               <br />
               Colony. I hold to that. I maintain that no one has controverted this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposition;</span> no one has 
               <br />
               proved that it could be adapted to the requirements of this Colony; there has been burning 
               <br />
               eloquence and all that sort of thing, but no proof. But I say, Sir, that even now there is a 
               <br />
               measure of responsibility in this Government. 1 am responsible to my constituents, and if there 
               <br />
               is such an overwhelming force in favour of Responsible Government can I ever return here 
               <br />
               The utmost that the honourable member for New Westminster has proved is, that under Con— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">federation</span> it would take a great deal of time and much agitation to get Responsible Government, 
               <br />
               a minimum of ﬁve years and a maximum of ten years, and that as it would take that time it 
               <br />
               was better that we should have it at once. I say it‘ one proposition is correct the other must 
               <br />
               be incorrect. If there is such an overwhelming desire on the part of the people for it,_they 
               <br />
               will get it. If the majority even are in favour of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Responsible</span> Government there is no con~ 
               <br />
               stitutional power to prevent their getting it. There is' no desire on the part of the Government 
               <br />
               to withhold it. I say it is a want of responsibility of the Executive that has rendered them 
               <br />
               unpopular; but the people have never been asked to contrast the present form of Government 
               <br />
               with that shadowed out by His Excellency; and I say that heads <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or“</span> Departments under that 
               <br />
               system will he, to a certain extent, responsible. The present system is bad, but the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁcers</span> are 
               <br />
               good I say that the requirements of the Colony will be met by the system proposed by His 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Excellency.</span> Ii? it is not. then let the people say so, and get Responsible Government. The 
               <br />
               honourable member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> Westminster allows that i is only a question of time under the 
               <br />
               Organic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act.</span> If it should take ﬁve years, then my point that there is not such a strong desire 
               <br />
               for it is proved. I said, and I say again, that in Jamaica they could not work Responsible 
               <br />
               Government, or even representative institutions, and in Victoria it remains to this day a 
               <br />
               monument of stupidity and mismanagement. With regard to the assertion of the honourable 
               <br />
               member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> New Westminster, I say that it speaking and voting from conviction are false steps, 
               <br />
               and a bar to advancement in political life, then I don’t want to advance a step-further in that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">direction</span> I say that Responsible Government has not been made a distinct issue in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">elections.</span> 
               <br />
               The Government of the people was to be one of the consequences of Confederation; I hope we 
               <br />
               shall get a people‘s Government before <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> The present Executive Council is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oneethird</span> unofﬁcial; 
               <br />
               the worl; they have done has brought a shapeless, formlcss phantom into one harmonious whole, 
               <br />
               and they propose to precede Confederation with a form of Government which will enable the 
               <br />
               people to decide what form <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Government they will have. I coincide with the Honourable 
               <br />
               Chief Commissioner <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Lands and Works, that it was not necessary to introduce this subject 
               <br />
