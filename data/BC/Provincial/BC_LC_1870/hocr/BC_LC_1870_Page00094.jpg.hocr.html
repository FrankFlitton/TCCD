               included. The only thing we have to do is to fix a date. If we put the date back to a remote

               in that time, and be entitled to increased repi sentation.

               I-Ion. Mn. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">DECOSMOS—Mn</span> Chairman, during the previous debate an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Member referred 
               <br />
               to 120,000 as the basis of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representation.</span> as well as the basis of population. We ﬁnd this 
               <br />
               echoed by others, last, but not least. by the Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Attorney-General</span> himself. I am surprised 
               <br />
               to ﬁnd the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> and learned gentleman setting this up as a basis. For the basis of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">represen*</span> 
               <br />
               tation under the Organic Act was the basis of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representation</span> allowed [to Quebec, that is, 
               <br />
               one member for every <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">20,000.</span> it is proposed that we shall have eight members; then the popu- 
               <br />
               lation ought to be 160,000; but it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">only</span> set up as 120,000, which number would only entitle 
               <br />
               us to six members. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New,</span> Sir, i have no objection to getting eight members for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House</span> of 
               <br />
               Commons, and four for the Senate; but I do object to Hon. Members and newspapers spreading 
               <br />
               abroad statements which have no foundation in fact. I think our population has been over 
               <br />
               estimated. It is going abroad tliat_1,20,000 is the proper foundation for representation; I say 
               <br />
               it is not so. The honest straightforward and manly course is for our Government to say 
               <br />
               to the Dominion Government, that it is necessary for us to have a larger representation on 
               <br />
               territorial grounds. The whole thing resolves itself into expediency; beyond expediency I say 
               <br />
               that no one can ﬁnd a fulcrum for the assertion. I would cheerfully support twelve and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">six</span> 
               <br />
               so far as it goes. But I do denounce that want of principle and want of truth that surrounds 
               <br />
               this basis. There is another question about the representation to which due attention does 
               <br />
               not seem to have been given; it is this: the electoral qualiﬁcation in Canada is too high, and 
               <br />
               it will be most <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">objectionable</span> to have the same qualification thrust upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us.</span> The qualification 
               <br />
               of members may safely be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">leﬁt</span> to the Dominion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government.</span> But that of electors is too high, 
               <br />
               and will be a source of irritation, which the Government should endeavour to remove now. I 
               <br />
               should have moved a recommendation as to this, but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> the treatment which my amendments 
               <br />
               have received in this House, I am inclined to let it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">passuand</span> I shall move my amendments before
