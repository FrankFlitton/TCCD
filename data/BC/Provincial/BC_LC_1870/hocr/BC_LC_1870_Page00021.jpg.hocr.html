               <br />
               Town of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> Westminster, I have a right to speak in the name of its loyal inhabitants. I say

               that, allthougli Confederation with Canada meets with favour in some quarters, the feelings 
               <br />
               of the inhabitants are, and ever will be, thoroughly loyal to the glorious ﬂag of Great Britain, 
               <br />
               and feel proud of belonging to that ﬂag which represents honour, power, justice, and wealth, 
               <br />
               and which is stainless and uutarnished, whether unfurled in the face of an enemy and defended 
               <br />
               by its sons, or ﬂoating in peace over such a Colony as this. We have had our complaints on 
               <br />
               the Mainland, and we considered the removal of the Capital and centralization of business at 
               <br />
               Victoria an injustice to the rest of the Colony, for the reason, principally. that Victoria, .from 
               <br />
               its proximity to the United States. draws its supplies thence, instead of from the Mainland, 
               <br />
               to the gain of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">neighbouring</span> States, and consequent loss to the agricultural districts of the 
               <br />
               Mainland of some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$10,000</span> annually, in the article <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> beef alone; and for the reason that, by 
               <br />
               the Fleet being placed at Esquimalt, we of the Mainland were not only left without protection, 
               <br />
               but that the agricultural interests of Washington Territory and Oregon were being built up 
               <br />
               with the money expended by the Fleet in the purchase of supplies, which if spent in the 
               <br />
               Valley of the Fraser would, by this time, have given us there a population of some thousands. 
               <br />
               The people of my part of the Colony have favoured <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation,</span> in the belief that the resources

               We all acknowledge that population is required, and I think there is no reason to doubt 
               <br />
               that it will come. I do not attribute the depression, as some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Members have done, to 
               <br />
               bad Government. We merely followed the course of other gold countries in over trading, and 
               <br />
               placed all our dependence upon a single mining district, and when we did not ﬁnd another

               <br />
