               will do certain things for the Colony, amongst others, that she will build a Railway. If the

               <br />
               she need not ask the people of this Colony to be united. I would ask the people to hand <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them</span> 
               <br />
               selves together to demand that the terms shall be veriﬁed, and I hope they will take that stand.

               [“Hcar, hear,” from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr:</span> DeCosnios and Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Wood]</span> This Colony would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gust</span> as much 
               <br />
               isolated as ever after a paper union, without a Railway as one of the conditions. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">acknowledge</span> 
               <br />
               that we might have such union as exists with England now, with a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway.</span> We are a Colony 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England,</span> and I don’t know that many people object to being a Colony of England; but I say 
               <br />
               that verv many would object to becoming a Colony of Canada. As a Colony of England we 
               <br />
               have the right to legislate for ourselves; if we become a Colony of Canada, that power is taken 
               <br />
               away. [“No, no,” from Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">DeCosrnosJ</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[Hon</span> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tobson,</span> it will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> us more power] I 
               <br />
               say that the power of regulating our own commerce is taken away, and the only power left to 
               <br />
               us is that of raising taxes for Municipal purposes That is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> between being a 
               <br />
               Colony of Canada, and a Colony of England. The distance is so great between this Colony 
               <br />
               and Ottawa without any Railway and without any Telegraphic communication, that laws might 
               <br />
               be passed there, which would ruin British Columbia, without our having any notice of them. 
               <br />
               I do not consider that Canada expects or intends to attempt to make this Railway a paying 
               <br />
               institution of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">itselt‘.</span> There are a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> many institutions in this Colony which are not paying 
               <br />
               institutions. Canada takes the view that the Railway is necessary to complete the British line 
               <br />
               of communication between England and her Asiatic possessions, in order that the English people 
               <br />
               may share in the carrying trade to China and the East Indies with our American neighbours. 
               <br />
               Canada expects to inﬂuence Great Britain to guarantee the loan for the formation of the Rail— 
               <br />
               way. Great Britain may guarantee the loan for the purpose <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oi,~</span> having a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">check</span> on the American 
               <br />
               line of Railway, but, she would never guarantee it for Canadian purposes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">only.</span> The people of 
               <br />
               England would not tolerate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> I consider this an essential condition. Without it Confederation 
               <br />
               must not take place. This is one of those things which will he a vast beneﬁt to this Colony and 
               <br />
               to Canada, and therefore I regard it as a necessary condition. Why should this Colony join 
               <br />
               Canada except for the beneﬁt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">01'</span> both? We should be better off without Canada if we have no 
               <br />
               Railway. I say that this Colony had better stand alone than risk everything. without a Railway. 
               <br />
               What beneﬁt can Canada expect from Confederation with British Columbia without a Railway? 
               <br />
               Is she afraid <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of,</span> British Columbia being handed over to America? If Canada thinks she can hold 
               <br />
               British Columbia <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> her own purposes, and use it when she <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pleases,</span> and takes her own time to 
               <br />
               do what she likes with it, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">she</span> is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mistaken.</span> The Railway has been made a lever for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conl’edera‘</span>

               <br />
               to build <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">51</span> Railroad, and it will be necessary to have communication. The road might be used
