               words. What I contend for is Responsible Government. That honourable gentleman tells us 
               <br />
               that Canada did not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">get</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Responsible</span> Government till her population reached about two millions. 
               <br />
               Now, while that gentleman is greatly astray in his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁgures,</span> 1 cannot discover in his facts any 
               <br />
               evidence in support of the proposition he wishes to establish <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">They</span> may prove that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Responsible</span> 
               <br />
               Government was long <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wrongfully</span> withheld from Canada. I now come to my honourable friend 
               <br />
               the senior member for Victoria City. That honourable gentleman started out by telling us 
               <br />
               that he intended to support the Government scheme. and to support it strongly; but he added 
               <br />
               that he would not say much about Responsible Govermnent. Would that he had adhered to 
               <br />
               the latter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resolution.</span> It was but natural that, feeling himself on the wrong side of a great 
               <br />
               principle, he should be disposed to say little. But, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unfortunately</span> for himself, he has said much, 
               <br />
               a great deal too <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">much.</span> lle said some things which it would have been much better to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> left 
               <br />
               unsaid. He told us that Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for,</span> by, and from the people means Government for, by, 
               <br />
               and with the poli ' <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tans.</span> But he does not stop there. He tells this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House</span> that the advocates 
               <br />
               of Responsible Government will he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">willingr</span> to surrender all the other conditions in order to 
               <br />
               obtain that form of Government as a means of securing oﬂice. power, pickings! Now, Sir, let 
               <br />
               us look at the political history, and position of the honourable gentleman who presumes, with 
               <br />
               so much boldness, to judge of other people's motives I recollect <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">when.</span> some two years ago. 
               <br />
               that honourable gentleman was the most ardent of all Confederationists; when he desired to 
               <br />
               rush into an unconditional and blind union; when he urged the then Governor to negotiate union 
               <br />
               by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">telegraph,</span> At that time I was doubtful about the policy of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'i'nrmcdiale</span> union, regarding such . 
               <br />
               a step as somewhat premature and unreal. so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">long</span> as the immense intervening territory remained 
               <br />
               an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unorganized</span> and unopen waste. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Holding</span> these views I proposed to strike the word ‘imme- 
               <br />
               diate’ out of the resolution which had been moved by the Honourable Mr. DeCosmos; but so 
               <br />
               enthusiastic, so fanatical. was the honourable the senior member for Victoria City that he 
               <br />
               longed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1’0'</span> a stronger word than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘immediatei</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Subsequently</span> we saw that. honourable gentleman 
               <br />
               the most ultra. the most rabid <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Anti»Cont’ederate.</span> We saw him <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opposing</span> it in every way, both 
               <br />
               in the House and out of it, denouncing Canada as a most undesirable connection. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> what 
               <br />
               do we see? We see the Anti-Confederate Lion rampant suddenly metamorphosed into the 
               <br />
               Canadian Lamb <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pass-ant.</span> with his longing eyes fixed on Ottawa! Such has been the magic 
               <br />
               inﬂuence of the mysterious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Executive</span> Chamber. I do not, for one, regret the transformation; 
               <br />
               but I do object to that gentleman <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">turning</span> round so suddenly and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">denouncing</span> the motives by 
               <br />
               which others are actuated. Does not that honourable gentleman live in a ‘glass house’ in 
               <br />
               that sense which peculiarly disentitles him to throw stones? Is not he guilty of measuring 
               <br />
               other people’s corn in his own bushel? Did not be cast all his political principles to the winds 
               <br />
               and bolt in at the very ﬁrst opening to place and power that presented itself? And who knows 
               <br />
               but there may be at this moment a mission to Ottawa dangling <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">temptingly</span> before his eager 
               <br />
               eyes? ls this the man who is entitled to turn round and. looking down <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> his pinnacle of 
               <br />
               temporary power. judge others? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strutting</span> his hour of brief authority, he taunts us with seek— 
               <br />
               ing Responsible Government as a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">steppiilgestone</span> to power and pickings. l hurl back, with scorn 
               <br />
               and contempt, the accusation in his teeth! To pass. however. to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">so-calied</span> arguments put 
               <br />
               forward by that honourable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he</span> tells us that the resolution asks for a Government 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">like</span> that of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(minim—that</span> we should require <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">40</span> or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:30</span> members. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now.</span> Sir, it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁcult</span> to give 
               <br />
               him credit <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{or</span> sincerity, as ever honourable member must see that the resolution asks nothing 
               <br />
               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">kind.</span> It asks fo' a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cor.</span> tulion based upon the principle of Responsible Government as 
               <br />
               existing in Ontario. That honourable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> has attempted to make me inconsistent with 
               <br />
               myself in saying that we shall be under the heel of Canada without Responsible Government, 
               <br />
               and that Canada desires that we should have such institutions. Now. i see nothing inconsistent 
               <br />
               in this. Canada does desire that the people of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">British</span> Columbia should possess as full powers 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">managing</span> their own local affairs as the people of the other Provinces possess; but Canada 
               <br />
               will have no power to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grant</span> these institutions until asked to do so in a constitutional way 
               <br />
               through and by our Local Govermnent; and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">weight;</span> of my objection lies in the reasonable 
               <br />
               belief that. however desirous the people may be. the Local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> will be naturally averse 
               <br />
               to a change calculated to lessen its power. and weaken the tenure by which its members hold 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">office.</span> Again, we are told that the Governor would not be disposed to withhold institutions 
               <br />
               which would relieve him of responsibilitv. llowever plausible this proposition may appear in 
               <br />
               theory, it is scarcely borne out by experience. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">As</span> I have already stated. in reply to the honour— 
               <br />
               able and learned <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Attorney/General,</span> history presents rulers in a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> light. We are asked
