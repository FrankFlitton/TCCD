               my pocket, at the time, a despatch from a Canadian Cabinet Minister, which said that the

               Dominion Government would not negotiate until the questions then pending with respect to the

               soon as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Norfh‘West</span> Territory question was settled. then came a despatch to the Governor

               <br />
               I stand here not as a Canadian, but as a British Colombian; my allegiance is due ﬁrst to British 
               <br />
               Columbia. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sincerely</span> hope that these terms will be dealt with from a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">British</span> Colombian 
               <br />
               point of view [Hear. hear, hear, hear], and first as to the money value of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation.</span>

               [Hear, hear, from Dr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Helmekend</span> It may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grate</span> on the ear of the once Solicitor-General (Mr. 
               <br />
               Wood) to mention money: <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but.</span> Sir, I believe in the old <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">adage</span> that: “Money makes the. mare 
               <br />
               to go.” I do not intend to allude to the terms in the Resolutions at present, any further than 
               <br />
               to say, that I do not believe in going into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> without good terms. I believe that it 
               <br />
               would be traitorous to British Columbia to consent to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> without good terms; and 
               <br />
               that we would not do our duty if we did not insist upon getting them. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Attoriievaeneral</span> asks why we are not prosperous? In my opinion, Sir, the 
               <br />
               causes of our want of prosperity are various. "hey ﬁrst arose under the administratimi of 
               <br />
               Sir James Douglas in .1858, and have been perpetuated down to the present day. The people 
               <br />
               were then almost driven away, and down to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">present</span> time the Government have done 
               <br />
               nothing comparatively to induce population to settle in the Colony. Another reason is, that 
               <br />
               the country is somewhat rugged, and not so attractive for settlement as some others. The 
               <br />
               Hon. Member for Victoria City says that it is our proximity to the United States. I most 
               <br />
               respectfully deny it. Population would have come if greater efforts had been made to get it. 
               <br />
               The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">AttorneyGeneral</span> is consistent in one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thing.</span> He said in 1867, and he says in his 
               <br />
               speech now, that British Columbia is of vital importance to Canada. I cannot see it. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> 
               <br />
               cannot see why the Canadian Railway, if this was a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">foreign</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country</span> and our boundary 
               <br />
               coterminons with that of Canada, might not have run through to connect with our railway 
               <br />
               system, as the French railways connect with those of Belgium. 
               <br />
