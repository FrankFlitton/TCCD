               for New <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Westminster,</span> for Victoria District, and for Lillooet, tell you that the people desire 
               <br />
               Responsible Government; that they must have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> and will have it. I say, Sir, that if they do 
               <br />
               say so. which I very much doubt, it is because the population have been educated up to it by 
               <br />
               those who have agitated the subject through the press and through speeches. Some no doubt 
               <br />
               press for it from conviction, and some with a view to serving their own ends; but I believe, 
               <br />
               Sir, that what the people really want is such an administration of the Government as will 
               <br />
               tend to bring back prosperity to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colony.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">You</span> are told that the present oliicials have no 
               <br />
               sympathy with the people: that they are not of the people; that they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">more</span> in a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> sphere. 
               <br />
               and constitute a class by themselves. is this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trueJ—or</span> is it not rather the fact that persons 
               <br />
               who have ends to serve have put us in a class by ourselves? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> Hon. Member says that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> 
               <br />
               hands of the benefactors of the people must be callous with labour. Who. I ask, are those 
               <br />
               throughout the world who have laboured most for the people by speech and pen? I say that 
               <br />
               the great statesmen who have done most to advance the truest interests of the people, have 
               <br />
               not sprung <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> the ranks of those whom the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Member classes as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people.</span> The Hon. 
               <br />
               Member for New Westminster says that the present Government Ofﬁcials are well enough, 
               <br />
               able and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">honest.</span> but that they cannot enjoy the conﬁdence <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the people because they are not 
               <br />
               their officials; they are not elected by them. And, be as able as we might, and as honest, and 
               <br />
               work as we might, and do what we might for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people’s</span> good, we could not gain their con- 
               <br />
               ﬁdence because we are not directly responsible to them. And the Hon. Member sympathized 
               <br />
               with us for the position. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New,</span> Sir, if it be true, as he says, that the Government have not the 
               <br />
               conﬁdence of the community when, he says, they deserve it, whose is the fault? I say, Sir, it 
               <br />
               is the fault of those who, by voice and pen, have for years sedulously <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prejudiced</span> the public 
               <br />
               mind <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ol’</span> this community against that Government, not by pointing out faults to be remedied, 
               <br />
               but by general and indiscriminate fault <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁnding.</span> descending to personal abuse, and even to the 
               <br />
               verge of scurrility. We have striven to do our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">duty,</span> lion. Members do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advance-argu-</span> 
               <br />
               ments, but content: themselves with saying that we are unpopular. I tell you why: If false 
               <br />
               impressions have gone abroad on this point let the responsibility of those impressions rest 
               <br />
               where it ought; for I say that it has been the business of certain persons to prejudice the public 
               <br />
               mind against Government olﬁcials. Let them settle the question of motives with their own 
               <br />
               consciences and with the people. if the ofﬁcials in this House occupied the positions which 
               <br />
               would be held by ofﬁcials under party government, I could understand the persistent course of 
               <br />
               the opposition offered by some members present; but when I see the changed position, that 
               <br />
               there is no Responsible Government, and that our months are closed and our pens cannot be 
               <br />
               used in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selﬁdefence,</span> I feel that we have been struck in a cowardly manner, and let the public 
               <br />
               defend the motives of those who have attacked us. i invite all in this House, or out of it, to 
               <br />
               aid as to carry on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government.</span> and to act in a reasonable way in promoting the general 
               <br />
               interests of the Colony. Whether we are to have Responsible Government or not I don‘t know. 
               <br />
               i feel that it will come in good time, when the circumstances of the Colony are so changed as 
               <br />
               to admit of its adoption—I think sooner with Confederation than without it. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lint</span> whether we 
               <br />
               have it or not, I ask lion. Members to assist us instead of endeavouring to complicate matters 
               <br />
               and retard the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">progress</span> of the Colony. 1 ask them to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give.</span> us some credit for good <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intentions,</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> Sir, one remark in conclusion: the lion. Me nber for New Westminster, in his powerful 
               <br />
               oration, has not only allurod' us with the prospects of popular under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Responsible</span> Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, but he has, I will not s ' threatened, warned us of the lesult of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opposing</span> him in 
               <br />
               this matter. He tells us that unless Responsible Government be conceded the cause of Confed— 
               <br />
               eration will be ruined; that the people would not have Confederation without Responsible 
               <br />
               Government. This in fact is embodied in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[the</span> preamble of his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Resolution,</span> Sir, I have cordially 
               <br />
               supported Confederation because I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">honestly</span> believe <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> it will be for the beneﬁt of the local 
               <br />
               intcrcs s of this connnunity as well as for the security and consolidation of Imperial interests; 
               <br />
               but I believe that this community is not ready for Responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government,</span> 1 will not. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there:</span> 
               <br />
               fore, do what I consider <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wrong</span> that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">good</span> may come; I will not vote for Responsible Govern- 
               <br />
               ment for the sake of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gaining</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation.</span> l, for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one,</span> say, if the people won’t have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confedera»</span>

               object of Confederation; if they do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appreciate</span> the real <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advantages</span> of Confederation. let

               Confederation wait a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">while,</span> The Governm- <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hus</span> sent down Resolutions which he thinks can be
