               what measures of importance have been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">introduced</span> that have not been introduced by the 
               <br />
               Government? By this the honourable gentleman wishes, I presume, to convey the idea that 
               <br />
               the Government so fully meets the wants of the people as to leave nothing for representative 
               <br />
               members to do. In what singular contrast is this with his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">utterances</span> during past sessions. 
               <br />
               Here, again, we have the kindly bleating of the docile Confederation Lamb, instead of the 
               <br />
               terrific roar of the Anti—Confederate Lion of the past. \‘erily, the mysterious influences of the 
               <br />
               Executive Chamber must be potent. The honourable gentleman tells us that if we couple the 
               <br />
               question or Responsible Government with the conditions of union, the people will be willing 
               <br />
               to accept poorer terms in their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eagerness</span> to obtain it. Surely, it language means anything, this 
               <br />
               is an inadvertent admission ot‘ what the honourable gentleman has been so stoutly denying, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">viz:</span> that the people desire Responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govermnent.</span> Leaving the honourable gentleman to 
               <br />
               the lashings of his own conscience, and to the seductive influences of the mysterious Executive 
               <br />
               Chamber, we next come to deal with the Honourable the Registrar of Titles. The Honourable 
               <br />
               Mr. Alston announces himself in favour of Responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government,</span> but not the kind that would 
               <br />
               make the heads of Departments go in and out. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">He</span> holds all Representative Government to 
               <br />
               be Responsible Government. The honourable gentleman may be entitled to hold a theory pecu- 
               <br />
               liarly his own; but it is scarcely the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁtting</span> time to announce personal theor . We are now 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dealing</span> with the question of Responsible Government, as understood by political economists, not 
               <br />
               as understood by the honourable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> who has just propounded a political paradox. He 
               <br />
               has been reading John Stuart Mill, and he tells us that writer never mentions Responsible 
               <br />
               Government. I have not read Mill’s theory, but I have read enough to know that he goes even 
               <br />
               further than I am prepared to go in the direction <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ot'responsihility.</span> We have next the honour- 
               <br />
               able gentleman t‘or Kootenay <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">telling</span> this House that with all his experience in the Colony he 
               <br />
               never heard a man express a desire for Responsible Government, and that his own constituents 
               <br />
               were distinctly opposed to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> Now. so tar as that honourable gentleman’s constituents are con~ 
               <br />
               corned, I am prepared to think that his opportunities of learning their views upon that or any 
               <br />
               other subject have scarcely been such as to entitle him to express a very positive opinion; but 
               <br />
               when he tells this House that in all his experience in this Colony he has never heard a desire 
               <br />
               for Responsible Government expressed, I can only say that I am surprised. The honourable 
               <br />
               gentleman cannot but know. if he has not turned a deaf ear to politics altogether, that the 
               <br />
               question of Responsible Government has been a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘prominent</span> issue at more than one election, 
               <br />
               and that it has been used as one of the chief reasons for Confederation from one end of the 
               <br />
               Colony to the other. But, Sir, I fear I have already <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">notiﬁed</span> the House. Permit me to say, 
               <br />
               however. that throughout this protracted debate the efforts on the Government side of the 
               <br />
               House have been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">characterized</span> by a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hint</span> of argument, and by a sort of special pleading, a 
               <br />
               begging of the question almost painful to listen to. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Every</span> effort has been made to raise false 
               <br />
               issues and to misconstrue remarks coming from this side of the House. and a most <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unfair</span> 
               <br />
               attempt has been made to, place the whole question in a false and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disadvantageous</span> position: 
               <br />
               yet this is scarcely surprising. It was not to be expected that the unrepresentative members 
               <br />
               would approve the measure I feel, however, quite inditterent about their votes. We have a 
               <br />
               large majority of the representative members with us, and their vote must virtually carry the 
               <br />
               measure. The great proposition I desire to impress upon honourable members is this: The 
               <br />
               Colony is about to become a Province of the Dominion of Canada. No union can be equitable 
               <br />
               and just which does not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colony</span> equal political power—equal control over their own 
               <br />
               local affairs with that possessed by the people at the Provinces with which it is proposed to 
               <br />
               unite. I care not how <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">good</span> the other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conditions</span> may be: it the people of British Columbia are 
               <br />
               placed in a false political position they will not be content. and the inauguration of such a 
               <br />
               union will only prove the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">beginning</span> of new political discontent and agitation. Mistakes will 
               <br />
               doubtless result from the first workings of Responsible Government, but these mistakes were 
               <br />
               better made now than years hence, when the consequences <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might</span> be more serious The period 
               <br />
               of lisping. stammcring infancy must, be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">passed.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Surely</span> it is better to pass it now. while the 
               <br />
               political questions are to\' and simple. and the interests <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">comparatively</span> small, than to wait for 
               <br />
               great development. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Almost</span> every speaker on the Government side has accused me of want of

               confidence in the Dominion Government. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1</span> have no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vant</span> of confidence in that Government. 
               <br />
               I know the men who compose it too well for that. I know them as honourable. liberal, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">large~</span>
