               I move this Resolution, Mr. Chairman, as being the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">practical</span> bond of Union between the

               Dominion and this Colony. 1 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">leave</span> it to other members to discuss the details. I merely say 
               <br />
               that three years is the time deemed necessary to make preliminary surveys, and the expendi- 
               <br />
               ture of a sum of $1,000,000 is the best practical guarantee that the work will be done. The

               Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mn.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">DnC()S.\lOS-Sir,</span> I do not claim any honour in connection with the Resolu— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rtion</span> respecting the Railway. I am perfectly willing to accord the praise that is due to the 
               <br />
               originator of this clause, but think a portion of it a great mistake. I do not altogether like 
               <br />
               the way in which these Resolutions are got <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">up.</span> I don’t like the preamble as to “ real union." 
               <br />
               In all these Govermnont Resolutions there is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">something</span> of a “catching” character; little 
               <br />
               hooks to catch the popular vote. Material union can exist without railroads. Look at the real 
               <br />
               union between this Colony and Great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Britain.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">People</span> who were here in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">185%)</span> may recollect 
               <br />
               how safe they felt during the San Juan difﬁculty, and subsequently during the Trent affair. 
               <br />
               There was then a physical union; we felt that we should be protected by force if necessary. 
               <br />
               I believe that I was amongst the first or second of those who moved in the matter of the trans- 
               <br />
               continental coach road. But whilst on this Subject I will take occasionto do justice to the 
               <br />
               memory of the gentleman who proposed the Overland Railway through British America. 
               <br />
               It was during the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">administration</span> of Sir <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Robert</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Peel,</span> in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">18-1-1</span> or 1845, that A. W. Godfrey, a 
               <br />
               bookseller in Halifax, addressed letters to Sir <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Robert</span> Peel, about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3</span> Railway from Halifax to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Vancouver</span> Island. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Previously,</span> Whitney had proposed his scheme <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> a Railroad from Texas 
               <br />
               to the Pacific. Our worthy old citizen, Mr. Waddington, has been distinguished among those 
               <br />
               who have taken active measures <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in'favour</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Railway. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cl‘ill</span> Lord Granville‘s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">despntch</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arrived,</span> none of the railway agitators seemed to have made much headway. At the Conference 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Delegates</span> from British North America in London, an Overland Railway was considered and 
               <br />
               described <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> “ a subject of the highest importance, and one to be promoted at the earliest stage 
               <br />
               that the finances of the country would admit o “ The proposition before us shows how great a 
               <br />
               stride has been made in this matter since <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1867,</span> I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> no wish to claim any honour or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> 
               <br />
               detract from that which is due to others, but we must recollect that $1,000,000 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">21</span> year is not 
               <br />
               a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway</span> across the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Rocky</span> Mountains. I have, however, year after year, looked upon Rail- 
               <br />
               way communication,as the only means to settle up the interior of British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Columbia,</span> 1 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">never</span> 
               <br />
               could see how British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tolumbia</span> could be settled up without 21 Railway to connect Fraser 
               <br />
               River with Kamloops. I think, Sir, that a different course ought to be pursued by the 
               <br />
               Government with the Dominion than that proposed. Assuming that the Coach Road may be 
               <br />
               open in three yoars,-——Eor I am ready to admit that proposition,——when people some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> 
               <br />
               country from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Thompson</span> River to Osoyoos Lake the farmers must have the means of transport 
               <br />
               for their various <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">productions.</span> How are they to get them out? I maintain that the true 
               <br />
               course for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">development</span> of the resources of the country is to make a line <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Railway <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span>
