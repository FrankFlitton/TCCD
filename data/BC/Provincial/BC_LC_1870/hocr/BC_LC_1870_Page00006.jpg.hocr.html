               <br />
               to think that they know best what is for our interest, and it seems much as if they said to us 
               <br />
               “ You are a Crown Colony, and you ought to remain one. You are not ﬁt to govern yourselves; 
               <br />
               we do not want you; we will hand you over to Canada.” I would rather that we were governed 
               <br />
               from Downing Street. It is not, in my opinion, necessary or desirable that this Colony should 
               <br />
               be Confederated with Canada. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">And</span> now. Sir, let us glance at this Colony. I need not dilate 
               <br />
               upon what is known to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all.</span> I maintain, Sir, that this Colony is one of the richest portions of 
               <br />
               the world’s surface; that it has unlimited supplies of lumber and spars; that it possesses coal, 
               <br />
               gold, and other minerals in abundance; that her waters teem with ﬁsh; that it is rich in every- 
               <br />
               thing. Take the climate; it is far better than that of England, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> more temperate, far more 
               <br />
               bright and sunny, and, I may fairly add, far more healthy.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               We are asked by the Honourable the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Attorney-General</span> why the country does not get on; 
               <br />
               and I will now proceed to tell you. Sir. why the country has not. prospered as it ought to have 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">done.</span> It is because the Government has paid too little attention to the acquisition of population. 
               <br />
               One very great drawback to its progress and the settlement of its land, is its proximity to the 
               <br />
               United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States.</span> That proximity is one of the chief reasons that it has not been peopled as it 
               <br />
               would have been. When we look at the energy and enterprise <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there,</span> and at the ﬁeld which the 
               <br />
               United States <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offers</span> for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">emigrants</span> and the enterprising of all nations, how can we wonder that 
               <br />
               that country is preferred to ours, and that people when they become dissatisﬁed here should' 
               <br />
               leave for the United States. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">United</span> States hem us in on every side; it is the Nation by 
               <br />
               which we exist; it is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nation</span> which has made this Colony what it is; but, nevertheless, it 
               <br />
               is one of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">greatest</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">drawbacks.</span> We do not enjoy her advantages, nor do we proﬁt much by 
               <br />
               them; we do not share her <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prosperity,</span> and we are far too small. to be her rival. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> large body and a small body being brought into contact, is, that the larger will attract the

               as we do now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to'join</span> the Dominion. I say, Sir, that one cause of our want of prosperity has 
               <br />
               been the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">neglect</span> of acquisition of population, and particularly of agricultural population. The 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">next</span> cause is that we have driven people out of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colony.</span>
