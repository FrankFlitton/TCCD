               this early hour. I cannot, however, allow certain expressions which have fallen from the 
               <br />
               Honourable the senior Member for Victoria City to pass unnoticed. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">believe</span> the question for

               I am surprised to find an Honourable Member of this House, who is a Cabinet Minister, 
               <br />
               expressing his regret that this measure has come down to this Council as a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span>

               I was also surprised to hear the Honourable Member, who is a Cabinet Minister, say that

               Confederation would not be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the/only</span> issue at the polls, but that there was another place besides

               Ottawa to which we could go. "I had hoped that all allusion to this matter would have been

               <br />
               particularly when it is added that the United States will ultimately absorb British Columbia, 
               <br />
               and Canada as well. The Honourable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Member</span> evidently <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">means—Shall</span> we have Confederation,

               “Annexation”; but as the subject has been dragged in by a Member of the Government, I trust 
               <br />
               I shall be pardoned for alluding to it. I say, Sir. that if the Government really means to ask 
               <br />
               whether the people desire Confederation or another union, let us know it. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[“No,</span> no,” from
