               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon,</span> MR. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HUMPHKEYS—Out</span> of deference to the amendment offered by the Hon. Member

               for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Westminster</span> (Mr. Robson), I ask the leave of the House to withdraw my motion, so 
               <br />
               that the amendment, the latter part, of which I like better than my own, may stand.

               Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ATTORNEY-GENERAl’r-«I</span> regret very much that a discussion so inapposite, so 
               <br />
               totally unnecessary, should have been forced on by the other side of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House</span> at a time so 
               <br />
               inopportune. I am glad that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hour</span> Member for Lillooet has withdrawn his motion; it leaves 
               <br />
               the Council to deal with the amendment of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lion.</span> Member for New Westminster; and I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">V</span> 
               <br />
               deeply regret that the Hon. gentleman did not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accept</span> the invitation to give up a special ﬁeld 
               <br />
               day to the discussion of Responsible Government, as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suggested</span> by myself after we had passed 
               <br />
               clause 15 of the Terms. This, I stated at the time. the House was quite competent to do. Then 
               <br />
               Members on this side of the House <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might</span> have freely joined in the discussion; perhaps some 
               <br />
               might <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.haveysnpported</span> the principle. But nol The Hon. proposer of the amendment, with the 
               <br />
               light of battle in his eye, had refused every suggestion; and afterwards, when he began to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               out his mistake, it was too late; there was nothing for it but to go <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on.</span> The melee, had begun; 
               <br />
               the glove is down; the visors are closed, and the lists barred. It cannot be put off. If the 
               <br />
               Hon. Member for New <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Westminster</span> had been opposed to Responsible Government, he could not 
               <br />
               have devised a course more adapted, than mixing up the question with terms, for shelving 
               <br />
               Responsible Government for the session. One point which requires special notice and correction 
               <br />
               is, that nearly all speakers during the debate seem to think that the Governor alone could grant 
               <br />
               any alteration of Constitution that may be required, merely for the asking; but this is a mistake; 
               <br />
               he cannot. The Constitution can only be changed by the same power that created it—the 
               <br />
               Imperial Parliament and the Queen in Council. The Governor can only recommend it; it is 
               <br />
               for the Home Government to say what that change shall be. As to the able speech of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lion,</span> Member for New Westminster, the eloquenceof which I was forced to applaud in spite of 
               <br />
               myself, it was an argument based upon fallacious premises throughout, asserting that we should 
               <br />
               only have a. representative majority of one, which could only lead to a false conclusion; and I 
               <br />
               take it that the lion. Member is in favour of Responsible Government as a sine <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">qua</span> non. else 
               <br />
               why all this tall talking of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">blood,</span> wading knee deep in blood? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Why</span> this encouragement of 
               <br />
               rebellion in defence of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rights,</span> and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">like?</span> And yet I understood <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">theﬂon.</span> Member for 
               <br />
               New Westminster to say that he does not make Responsible Government a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sine</span> qua non for
