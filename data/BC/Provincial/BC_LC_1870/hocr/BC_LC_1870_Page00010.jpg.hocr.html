               <br />
               yet arrived for it. I was sent to this Council as an opponent of Confederation. I oppose it 
               <br />

               The question of Confederation has been advocated by certain parties for some years past, 
               <br />
               and why? Because there has been a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">general</span> feeling of dissatisfaction throughout the Colony, 
               <br />
               a general feeling of pressure from heavy taxation on a daily <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diminishing</span> basis. The people 
               <br />
               have been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suffering</span> under a desire for change; that is what is at the bottom of this discussion.

               Confederation has been discussed outside, in the public press, and in other places, and now, 
               <br />
               after years of agitation, by secret and unknown partizans, it has cropped up in this Council as 
               <br />
               a Government measure. I know, Sir, that I have no chance of carrying this amendment. I 
               <br />
               have not the slightest hope of carrying it, but I move it with the view <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> bringing the question 
               <br />
               fairly before the public. I should deeply <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ref’rot</span> that this Council should be able to bind the 
               <br />
               Colony for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ever,</span> The question is one of the _ 'eatest magnitude, greater by for than any other 
               <br />
               which has ever come before this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature.</span> I am glad that it must hereafter be referred to 
               <br />
               another Council, the majority of whose members will have to come before the people for election 
               <br />
               I think, however, that it is waste of time to bring this measure before this Council.

               There are some points in Confederation, I admit, which are worthy ol’ consideration, or 
               <br />
               would be under different circumstances. The idea of consolidating the British Possessions on 
               <br />
               this Continent, is an idea which is likely to carry people away. The idea of assisting to found 
               <br />
               a large and wide-spreading country might be dazzling to some. But if we are to be turned 
               <br />
               over to Canada with no change in our form of Government, no alteration in the management 
               <br />
               of our political alfairs, where is the advantage of any change. It will simply be a change from

               <br />

               of Politicians at Ottawa. [“No, no.” from Mr. DeGosmos.) <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">All</span> our political rights will be 
               <br />
               taken away, the whole <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the legislation will pass out of our hands into that of the Dominion 
               <br />
               at Ottawa; those laws upon which we shall be entitled to pass an opinion, will be much of the 
               <br />
               same nature as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tlioselupon</span> which a municipal ' or vestry may vote; but which are beneath the

               reminds me, for provincial purposes, we shall be subject to the provisions of the Organic Act, 
               <br />
               which we have no power to change. Any terms which we can impose, must be subject to the 
               <br />
               provisions of “ The British North America <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act.”</span> My position, therefore, is correct, when I say 
               <br />
               that our power will not exceed that of a nmnicipality. We are told that we are not ﬁt for 
               <br />
               Representative Institutions or Responsible Government. ’I‘hen we shall go into the Dominion 
               <br />
               as a Crown Colony—bound hand and foot. The few Members that will represent us at Ottawa, 
               <br />
               will not have the power to do anything for us 1 do not trust the Politicians of Ottawa. I do 
               <br />
               not desire to give them the power to raise money upon our vast and rich territory, whilst we 
               <br />
               should get nothing from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">return.</span> I would rather remain as we are, m h some change

               and modiﬁcation in our Government.

               I admit that Confederation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offers</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> advantages to those Provinces which are contiguous
