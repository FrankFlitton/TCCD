               Hon. MR. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ROBSOX—I</span> stated one reason why I thought it not desirable to put the two 
               <br />
               together. You <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cannot.</span> get the control of the tariff. I say we want free trade in certain articles, 
               <br />
               and I say we must have the tariff entirely re—modelled as to these articles. My difﬁculty is that 
               <br />
               we were last evening discussing protection, and how far we should have the power to deal with 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> I moved an amendment which was, I think, the only constitutional way of dealing with the 
               <br />
               question, and in answering certain propositions of Hon. gentlemen yesterday, I endeavoured to 
               <br />
               deal with protection, per <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">86,</span> I listened with interest to what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fell</span> from the Hon. Commissioner 
               <br />
               of Customs, and I do not like to set my opinion against his on matters of this kind, on which 
               <br />
               I know he is an authority. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">especially</span> when I ﬁnd him hacked by the Hon. Attorney-General and 
               <br />
               Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works. I instanced the United States of America, and said 
               <br />
               that they are a living instance of non-separation of tariff. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Commissioner of Customs 
               <br />
               did not. go so far as to say we could frame a tariff for ourselves, but that the Dominion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern»</span> 
               <br />
               ment would frame it for us. Now, Sir, I say that we must not run away with any such idea. 
               <br />
               If we were allowed to have a different scheme of revenue, Newfoundland would as the same; 
               <br />
               New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and other Provinces would all ask for exceptional tariffs, 
               <br />
               and the Federal fiscal policy would be broken up and destroyed. Depend upon it we ought not 
               <br />
               to run away with such an idea. The Dominion Government, cannot admit of exceptional or 
               <br />
               differential tariffs any more than the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">United</span> States can do so. Some Hon. Members say that 
               <br />
               we are not under the Organic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act,</span> and need not be under it, unless we choose; that there is a 
               <br />
               distinction between the relations of the Provinces that were Confederated under the Act and 
               <br />
               those that may hereafter come in. and that we can change the Organic Act <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> we think proper. 
               <br />
               I admit that any Province not prepared to come in under the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Organic</span> Act can stay out. The 
               <br />
               Act is not binding on us now, but it will be it‘ we go into the Dominion. I am surprised to 
               <br />
               hear some Hon. Members speaking lightly of a reciprocity treaty. Look at the single item of 
               <br />
               coal. We at present: only send <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">18,000</span> tons per annum to San Francisco. I have no doubt that 
               <br />
               under a reciprocity treaty, we should supply them with 50,000 tons a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">year</span> at least, to say nothing 
               <br />
               of anthracite coal. In the course of a few years, allowing time for trade to develop itself, this 
               <br />
               would bring in $900,000 or, say. one million dollars a year into the Colony. Mr. Chairman, we 
               <br />
               are now speaking of a single item, and t: , I believe, not the largest, which would bring in one 
               <br />
               million a your, and that calculation is based upon the present consumption of coal in San 
               <br />
               Francisco. and the consumption will no doubt increase In addition to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this,</span> look at the quantity 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shipping,</span> and the cheap commodities which these ships bring in, which could hardly be brought 
               <br />
               as a measure of commerce. There are objectors lo reciprocity. No doubt it would he very nice 
               <br />
               it‘ we could open the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">United</span> States <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ports</span> to our goods. and close our ports to their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">goods.</span> But 
               <br />
               this would not be reciprocity. There i in my opinion, only one answer to be given. I say, 
               <br />
               give the farmers good roads. and this will he protection for them. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> Sir, what does the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">development</span> of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cool</span> interests mean? It means extension of labour, and circulation of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">money</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Farme</span> have at once a full demand for their produce. Apply the same argument: to 
               <br />
               lumbe Its development would cause more money to be expended in the Colony. Every ton 
               <br />
               of coal brought to the bank, and every tree cut down, means <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">spending</span> of money. There, then, 
               <br />
               is another field opened up for what farmers have to sell. Give the farmers this development 
               <br />
               and good roads. and they would soon ﬁnd out that reciprocity would be like the handle of a jug, 
               <br />
               on the side of British Columbia. Depend upon it: we will come in under the reciprocity treaty, 
               <br />
               and the advantages will be so great on our side that it will hardly be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reciprocity.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nothing</span> can 
               <br />
               be more unfair than to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">supposewe</span> are to have a free market in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">United</span> States and they 
               <br />
               have none here.
