               that I have successfully shown that exceptions have been and can be made under the Organic

               Now, let us see what this horrible Canadian tariff is. It is too high on cattle for us; not 
               <br />
               high enough on bacon, butter, cheese. and lard by a few cents; and imposes nothing on hay, 
               <br />
               hops, and grain of all kinds. I explained the whole to my constituents, at eleven meetings, and 
               <br />
               they said, get these few alterations made to suit us, and we will support Confederation. So we 
               <br />
               must have an alteration. Why, Sir, under the English Constitution <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> tariffs can be 
               <br />
               imposed. Look at the (litter-once in the excise spirit duties that were levied formerly in Scotland 
               <br />
               and England, for instance. As a lawyer, not as a judge, I give my opinion that we can have one 
               <br />
               tariff in British Columbia, and another in the Atlantic Provinces, under the Organic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act;</span> and if 
               <br />
               the Act does not allow it, then we must alter it.

               I have already given notice of motion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respecting</span> protection for our farmers and manufac-

               <br />
               the Local Legislature to impose a tax on certain imports, in case the tariff be too low. With

               Member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> Westminster has answered the objection to the Dominion ﬁshery laws. As for

               The Honourable Member for Victoria City has said a great deal about centralization. But 
               <br />
               i say, Sir, that there must be a centre somewhere. We cannot have it in British Columbia, and 
               <br />
               a centre would be no worse in Ottawa than in Washington. IThe Paciﬁc Coast, so far as the 
               <br />
               United States are concerned, is represented at Washington, which is not so large a city as

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Representation</span> is one of the most important elements in free Governments; and as it has

               <br />
               Canadian Senate or Commons, and that our small delegation would be crushed and out-voted, 
               <br />
               I will brieﬂy examine the subject. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now.</span> Sir, the whole of the Paciﬁc States of the United

               <br />
               Representatives. California has two Senators and three Representatives; Oregon, two Senators 
               <br />
               and one Representative; Vashington <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territory,</span> one Delegate; and Nevada, two Senators and

               one Representative. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> it is proposed in the Resolutions to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grant</span> to Bri 'sh Columbia twelve

               tation of the Paciﬁc States, with 1,000,000 people, in the United States <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Congress,</span> Again, there 
               <br />
               are only five States that have more than twelve Members in Congress. They are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> York, 
               <br />
               Pennsylvania, Illinois, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Indiana,</span> and Ohio. Take another glance at the representation of the

               States most <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">remote</span> from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Washington.</span> Texas has ﬁve Members; Florida, three; Maine. seven; 
               <br />

               neither would British Columbia go to the wall in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Parliament</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada.</span> The Government 
               <br />
               of Canada is based on the popular will; and that is the highest of guarantee that we shall be
