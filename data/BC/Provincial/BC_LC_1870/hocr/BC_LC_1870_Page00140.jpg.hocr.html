               As for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reciprocity,</span> it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has.</span> in my opinion. to be based on existing industry. The most important 
               <br />
               treaty of reciprocity was between England and Portugal, under which English goods were 
               <br />
               admitted into Portugal and wines into England. Reciprocity to be successful must be based 
               <br />
               on existing industries. If we enter into a treaty of reciprocity with the United States, we must 
               <br />
               build up our industries, such as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">coal.</span> I take it that what our coal has to contend with is foreign 
               <br />
               and native coal in the San Francisco and Portland markets. Unless there is an extended market 
               <br />
               for cool it is impossible to increase the trade in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> Reciprocity would destroy the most per- 
               <br />
               manent interests; that, for instance, of agriculture, and we would gain nothing by it. I say if 
               <br />
               Canada thinks proper to negotiate a treaty of reciprocity with the United States, we should be 
               <br />
               at liberty to negotiate a separate treaty, or to insert special clauses in the treaty.

               <br />
               but I do not go quite to the extent of beliving it necessary, although I think it very desirable. I 
               <br />
               don’t think it of such importance as the Hon. Members for Victoria City and District, as to make 
               <br />
               it a vital question or a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sine</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">qua</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">non</span> of Confederation. I think it is desirable to continue 
               <br />
               protection under Confederation, and I do not see why we cannot. I think that the Dominion 
               <br />
               Government may. perhaps, be better able to provide the ways and means to effect that object 
               <br />
               than ourselves. We may not be able to provide a remedy, but we may advise. The protection 
               <br />
               that we ask for only partially affects the community. It is patent that it only affects Vancouver 
               <br />
               Island and the Lower Fraser at this time. [“No, no,” from Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">DeGosmos.)</span> I say that the 
               <br />
               farmers of the Interior have a geographical protection. The time is so distant when agricultural 
               <br />
               produce can come into the upper parts of British Columbia, or when the produce of the Upper 
               <br />
               Country can come into competition with the produce of the Island and of the Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Fraser</span> in 
               <br />
               these markets, without feeling the cost of transport as equivalent to a protective duty. that 
               <br />
               before that time arrives the tariff may be amended again and again. With regard to what has 
               <br />
               been said about the closer union with a foreign country. I said, and I repeat it, that if the 
               <br />
               interests of the farmers would be prejudiced under Confederation, they would be utterly 
               <br />
               annihilated under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Annexation.</span> I believe that if we were brought under the Dominion tariff 
               <br />
               they would be injured. I did not say that the Dominion would not give us separate tariff 
               <br />
               regulations. I think they will do so, but I say we have put ourselves out of a position to 
               <br />
               pro <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘rihe.</span> We have put before them a scheme, and we have left the tariff out of the scheme. 
               <br />
               We can now point out that we want. protection, and leave it for the Dominion Government to 
               <br />
               point out the means. We have virtually put it out of our hands to dictate the means approved 
               <br />
               by this Council. I cannot agree in thinking that clause 91 leaves us free to impose our own 
               <br />
               tariff. I say we have made the British North America Act apply under the scheme which we 
               <br />
               have adopted under clause 16.
