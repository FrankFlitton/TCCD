               <br />
               Helmcken). a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">change</span> which does honour to his head and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">heart.</span> He has begun to show some 
               <br />
               faith in the Canadian Government at last. He may be called the pattern of the distrustful 
               <br />
               party, and I augur favourably from his conversion. With regard to the local advantages of a 
               <br />
               Railway, I would point to the construction of the Intercolonial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway</span> Property in Hal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">i:</span> 
               <br />
               has gone up 40 per cent. since it was built. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fully</span> admit the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">desirability</span> and necessity of a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway,</span> but I cannot admit that Union <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cannot</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exist</span> without it; look at the Union which 
               <br />
               existed for so many years between California and the Eastern States of America without a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway.</span> I believe that Canada, for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Imperial</span> reasons, intends to undertake the construction 
               <br />
               of this Railway. As for the length of time allowed for the commencement, I think it could 
               <br />
               not be well less than three years. I believe with the Hon. Chief Commissioner, that the work 
               <br />
               will be undertaken by a private <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">company,»under</span> guarantee. If so, it would be hampering the 
               <br />
               Government of the Dominion to make them commence earlier. It might compel them to close 
               <br />
               with parties not in all respects eligible. It would put them in a false position. If the Colony 
               <br />
               had charge of her own Crown lands, there should be a power given to Canada to promise 
               <br />
               Crown lands in connection with the construction of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway</span> I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regret</span> that this has not 
               <br />
               been put in the Resolutions, but no doubt the omission can be remedied hereafter.

               <br />
               ment. this Railway is not likely to be completed in so short a period as I had hoped. The 
               <br />
               indeﬁnite nature of the clause is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unsatisfactory.</span> It contemplates <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nothing</span> more than the 
               <br />
               expenditure of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$000,000</span> per annum, which would no doubt he a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> boon, and would

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stimulate</span> various branches of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">industry</span> but that is almost all that can be said of it. The way 
               <br />
               that it has been put to the Colony heretofore, was that the Canadian Government would 
               <br />
               construct the road. It now turns out, from the statements of the Hon. Chief Commissioner of 
               <br />
               Lands and Works. that in all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">probability</span> the Canadian Government will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">get</span> some private'com. 
               <br />
               pany to carry out the work; and he adds “ that we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may"</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">get</span> a guarantee with grants of land 
               <br />
               in aid <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of,</span> the undertaking. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> Sir, from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁrst</span> I have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alwars</span> been careful not to bring 
               <br />
               forward the question of the Railway in connection with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation,</span> The London Conference 
               <br />
               favoured it only when the financial position of the Dominion admitted it. It must be quite a 
               <br />
               long time before connection by rail with the Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway</span> system can take place. I never 
               <br />
               believed the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canadian</span> Government would contr ct a debt for this purpose at the present. 
               <br />
               They are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all-ear</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">y.</span> in my opinion, too deeply in debt. and are taxed too high, to allow them to 
               <br />
               do so. According to my calculation, it will cost <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">10.000000</span> to complete the Railway from
