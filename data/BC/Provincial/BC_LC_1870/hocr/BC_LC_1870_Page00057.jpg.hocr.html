               <br />
               irresponsible—must have money. It is impossible for the most perfect political system to 
               <br />
               move without it. Ways and Means must be provided. Now, I have always said, and I still 
               <br />
               maintain, in view of Confederation, that the amount that ought to be placed at the disposal 
               <br />
               of our Local Government when we enter Union ought. to be an annual surplus of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$200,000,</span> 
               <br />
               or nearly so, after having provided for the animal current expenditure of our Local Govern- 
               <br />
               ment; that is, for all the offices and services that must be kept up at the expense of the 
               <br />
               Colony, in order to keep it moving <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> a Province of the Dominion. We know by reference to 
               <br />
               the Estimates what they are; but in addition, there must be a certain sum provided for 
               <br />
               keeping in repair public works, such as the Main Trunk Road from Yale to Cariboo, and our 
               <br />
               public buildings. After these expenses have been defrayed, I should expect a surplus to the 
               <br />
               credit of the Local Government of about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$200,000,</span>

               <br />
               Local Government to do anything towards developing the resources of the country. Now, 
               <br />
               Sir, how shall we get that surplus? By the proposition before us. for which the Hon. Member 
               <br />
               for Victoria City (Dr. Helmcken) gets the credit as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">originator?</span> No, Sir. But I will not 
               <br />
               anticipate the answer to these questions. Let us ﬁrst examine, the Government ﬁnancial scheme, 
               <br />
               of which the Hon. Member for Victoria is the ﬁnancier. The ﬁrst proposition made by the 
               <br />
               Government is that we shall assume for ﬁnancial purposes that our population is 120,000. 
               <br />
               Now, Sir, I am one of that number who do not believe in assumptions in matters of ﬁnance,— 
               <br />
               one of those who deem it to be dangerous to found ﬁnancial measures on ﬁction instead of fact; 
               <br />
               for in no department of Government ought there to be maintained a stricter regard for truth 
               <br />
               and fact than in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">department</span> of ﬁnance. The ﬁnancier who resorts to ﬁction, no matter 
               <br />
               how well-intentioued, nor how patriotic, may justly be doubted. It may be as the Hon. Chief 
               <br />
               Commissioner has said: that the assumption of a population of 120,000 may be illogical and 
               <br />
               untrue, yet the result may be equitable. But, Sir, I do not think that we ought to assume, 
               <br />
               neither do I see the necessity for assuming, that we have a population of 120,000 instead of 
               <br />
               40,000, as I believe it to be, as it is recognized to be, and as it is in fact. The magnitude of 
               <br />
               the subject, the historical aspect of the terms, the dignity of the contracting parties, the noble- 
               <br />
               ness of the work of nation-making, our own self-respect, ought to lift us above the atmosphere 
               <br />
               of assumption and ﬁction, ought to guide us by an accurate and genuine political standard, 
               <br />
               and ought to inspire us with such pure and lofty political sentiments as would stamp the 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial terms with the indelible marks of truth, fact, and statesmanship, and for ever shut 
               <br />
               out the possibility of posterity associating our public men with mere parish politicians, instead 
               <br />
               of ranking them with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enlightened</span> and able statesmen. At the utmost, our population does 
               <br />
               not exceed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">40,000,</span> including men, women, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">children—Whites,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Chinese.</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Indians—10.000</span> 
               <br />
               civilized, and 30,000 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">semicivilized.</span> It would be a mistake to estimate an Indian to be equal 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> white man as ll consumer; but when we consider that in our white population the males 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> largely in excess of the females, and that in this country they are very large consumers, it 
               <br />
               would not be incorrect to conclude that there isno unfairness in making our whole population— 
               <br />
               Whites and lndians—ns equal to 40,000 consumers in the Dominion. Starting, therefore, 
               <br />
               with a population of 40,000, we base our calculations on facts, and not on ﬁction, as in the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">governmental</span> assumption of a population of 120,000. I will now, Mr. Chairman, proceed to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deal</span> with the ﬁnancial proposition of the Hon. gentleman for Victoria City—which is the 
               <br />
               Government scheme—by which he proposes to get <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$152000</span> surplus revenue for the Colony 
               <br />
               after the Union. "be proposed sources of revenue to produce this surplus are four in number,

               120,000, and on that basis of population would yield $96,000; (2) a fixed subsidy of $35,000
