               Now, Sir, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Attorney-General</span> descanted at great length on the advantages of Union. 
               <br />
               He put that as the basis of the Government proposition. There is nothing like Union he

               says; this is a noble sentiment which all must join in. Everyone would welcome that compre-

               Member for Victoria alluded to the possibility of a prospective union with other Powers, he 
               <br />
               did not do so in the idea of this Colony abandoning its allegiance to the Crown; because 
               <br />
               he expressed a wish to see the desire of general union spreading, is no reason that he should

               Member for Victoria offering suggestions as to the possibility of any other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">union,</span> Why so?

               The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Attorney~Generul</span> himself <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gracefully</span> introduced <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> Why should not the English—

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               My position as Member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nanaimo</span> has been assailed in a cowardly way by what is 
               <br />
               called the Press. I have been accused of shrinking from my duty to my constituents at 
               <br />
               Nanaiino, because I echoed their sentiments <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> Confederation. I ask the indulgence of 
               <br />
               the House whilst I allude to what occurred at Nanainio at the last election. At that time the 
               <br />
               question of Confederation was rife throughout the Colony; people’s minds were agitated; the 
               <br />
               people of Nanainlo were almost unanimous against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> In what I said to them during the 
               <br />
               progress of the election, and also on the hustings, I told them that I agreed with their views 
               <br />
               against Confederation. but that when it came before the Council I should give it my best 
               <br />
               attention. It was not made a test question <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> my election. The people of Nanainio are still of 
               <br />
               their original opinion; and, therefore, I express their opinion now. against this measure; and 
               <br />
               say that their convictions are against Confederation, notwithstanding the “ No, noes ” of certain 
               <br />
               Hon. Members. There may be some amongst them, Canadians by birth and principle, who 
               <br />
               desire Confederation, who, though they are here, can say with the poet :— 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               “ Where ere I roam, whalever realms I see, 
               <br />
               My heart untravelled fondly turns to thee." 
               <br />
               Thus much for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nanainio.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&gt;</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now, I say. Sir, that the question of Confederation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ought</span> to be fully and amply discussed 
               <br />
               in this House, and to do this there should be a full House. I deny that it is the desire of 
               <br />
               the people to have Confederation, but i say let the people have an opportunity of expressing 
               <br />
               their opinions in this House. Let the disfranchised districts <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> ﬁrst restored to them the 
               <br />
               rights of which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> have been defrauded. The Governor has been betrayed into supposing 
               <br />
               that the people want Confederation, and assuming this to be true, he says I shall now give 
               <br />
               the people an opportunity to discuss the terms. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               But let the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Franchise</span> be restored. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">then</span> let the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">general</span> question of Confederation come 
               <br />
               before an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enlarged</span> representation; and I say that Confederation should be put alone, aye or

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">no.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Shall</span> we have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation”</span> and not upon what terms shall we have it. The proper 
               <br />
               course is to dissolve the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House,</span> issue new wr s, and let <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> people say whether they want 
               <br />
               Confederation; and after they have said yes. then descend into the particulars of it. A Govern— 
               <br />
               ment measure is now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposed.</span> we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> bound hand and foot, and handed over to Ottawa I say, 
               <br />
               Sir, that being so handed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">over.</span> we ought to let our masters settle the terms for us.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I, therefore. venture <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">again,</span> Mr. President. to repeat that if it is to go abroad that the 
               <br />
               people desire Confederation. then the House should be dissolved, and a fair vote taken.

               I ask how? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Through</span> newspapers? Conventions? Speeches? I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span> this is not the proper way. 
               <br />
               Let the people speak in this House, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">through</span> a full body of Representatives of their own choosing.
