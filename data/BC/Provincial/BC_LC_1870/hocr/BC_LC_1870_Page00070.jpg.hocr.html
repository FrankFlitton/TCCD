               <br />
               to say that the Government named Esquimalt especially with a view to the retention of 
               <br />
               the Fleet. Both the late Admiral and the late Governor agreed in reporting in favour of 
               <br />
               Esquimalt. We should, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">therefore,</span> have been remiss in not pointing it out. I think it hard 
               <br />
               that the Government should be twitted with the intention of catching votes. [“ Hear, hear,”

               from Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">DeCosmosfl</span> I scout the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">idea.</span> There is an Imperial Act, which only allows the 
               <br />
               Admiralty to lend a limited sum to Colonial Docks—the Act, of 28 and 29 Victoria, Cap. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">206‘</span> 
               <br />
               This Act allows a loan of £20000 from the Admiralty upon certain terms; it is a loan of so 
               <br />
               much money that is contemplated, and not a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">guarantee</span> of interest. Last year I stated to this 
               <br />
               Council that the Admiralty had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offered</span> to lend £20,000, at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">4.</span> per cent. The Company did not 
               <br />
               think it suﬂicient inducement. We hope to get Imperial assistance still; that is one reason 
               <br />
               for the locality being named. 1' stand here to say that Esquimalt is the place. I, am surprised 
               <br />
               that a Member from the Mainland should bring an accusation of. sectional proclivities against 
               <br />
               the Government in this matter, for the Railway will specially benefit the Mainland. I believe 
               <br />
               and hope it will follow down the Valley of the Fraser, and immediately beneﬁt the district from 
               <br />
               which the Hon. Member comes. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Fraser</span> River is the main artery <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> the probable course of 
               <br />
               the Railway. I did not, therefore. expect to hear of any sectional prejudice in the Resolutions 
               <br />
               from any Member from the Mainland. when, if there is any immediate benefit to any special 
               <br />
               locality, it will be to the Mainland of British Columbia.

               <br />
               successive Admirals who have been upon this station, and who can have no prejudices? I 
               <br />
               think it is a waste of public time to inipute motives. Esquimalt has been pronounced by 
               <br />
               engineers to be the proper place. I am not one of those who, like certain Hon. Members 
               <br />
               here, would constantly “pin their conscience on their sleeves for (laws to peck at.” Such 
               <br />
               motives as are suggested could never have entered into the minds of the Executive. They 
               <br />
               have been repelled by the Hon. Chief Commissioner, and why should we be accused of giving 
               <br />

               withdraw his motion. Consider how such a principle as that suggested by the Hon. Mr. Wood

               would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">work.</span> It in effect <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amounts</span> to this: “Because you have a local interest, you must retrain
