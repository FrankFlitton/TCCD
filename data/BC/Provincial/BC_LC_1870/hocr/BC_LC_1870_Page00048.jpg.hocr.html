               this Council, and I feel that I ought to apologise for detaining the House, even for a few minutes, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">after</span> the very exhaustive <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arguments</span> on both sides have been heard with such patient attention.

               to satisfy my own conscience, and as it is probable 1 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may</span> not: have another opportunity of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expressing</span> my opinion on the principle of Confederation with Canada, I must: beg leave to say

               It will be unnecessary to follow up the subject at any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">length,</span> as I believe that: the principle 
               <br />
               of Confederation has been virtually conceded. I give the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Member for Victoria District all 
               <br />
               the credit that may be due for the consistent way in which he has agitated this question for 
               <br />
               years past, and probably the reason why the matter was not earlier brought to a successful issue 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">through</span> that agitation, was that either he did the right <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thing</span> in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wrong</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">v</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3</span> or that he lived 
               <br />
               before his time. From 1867 to the present time, the question has been discussed in successive 
               <br />
               sessions of the Council, and it has been declared in effect that, at some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">future</span> time, Confederation 
               <br />
               would be of advantage to this Colony. The Imperial Government have now spoken out <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“IlﬂliS‘</span> 
               <br />
               takeably in the matter, and have decided that Confederation shall take place It seems that 
               <br />
               those who have the power to shape the destinies of this Colony have decided that it is to take 
               <br />
               a part: in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> scheme of Confederation of the Brit <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘h</span> North American Colonies, and have 
               <br />
               not hesitated to throw the whole <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">weight</span> of their enormous inﬂuence in the scale to effect this 
               <br />
               object; the Canadian Parliament manifestly urge this matter as a necessary part of the scheme; 
               <br />
               and last, thoth not least, a large portion of the people of this Colony cry aloud for it. as a 
               <br />
               panacea for all their ills. Downing Street has not hesitated to guide and control the opinions 
               <br />
               of Her Majesty‘s servants in this Colony. Whether this be wise or prudent on the part of the 
               <br />
               Secretary of State for the Colonies, in view of the present constitution of this Colony, it is not 
               <br />
               for me to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say,</span> but it is of no use <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">blinding,y</span> our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eyes</span> to the fact that they who have the power

               It: was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fitting,</span> then, that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Executive</span> of this Colony should take the initiative and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under»</span>

               that they have done so, and that the working out of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">b2</span> of arrangements has fallen into

               so able hands, for what other party have the power to do so? If <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> had not preoccupied the

               none. I would have voted against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them‘</span> or retired from this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Assembly.</span> But the Governor has
