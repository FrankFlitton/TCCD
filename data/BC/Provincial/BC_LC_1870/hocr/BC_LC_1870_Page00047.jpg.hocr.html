            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Before I close my remarks. Sir, I must allude to what fell from the Hon. Member for 
               <br />
               Victoria City, whose opinion and lightest remarks are always received and listened to by this 
               <br />
               House with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">greatest</span> deference and respect, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(we</span> v wrinkle of whose brow is a notch 
               <br />
               in the calendar of a well-spent life, for whose character as an individual i have the highest 
               <br />
               reverence and esteem. I cannot but say, however, that in my opinion, and I believe in the 
               <br />
               opinion of this House, what the Hon. gentleman did say about another possible issue was ill- 
               <br />
               timed, inopportune. and unhappy; and. Sir, I deem it my duty as a Member of the Executive 
               <br />
               Council to say. that if he did intend to toreshadow the idea that the other union, to which he 
               <br />
               made ill-timed allusion, could ever be an issue in this Colony, he entirely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">misrepresented</span> the 
               <br />
               views of the Executive Council. In this connection I desire to say that, in common with the 
               <br />
               Chief Commissioner, I feel a great respect for our neighbours of the Great Republic. I honour 
               <br />
               the country and its institutions; particularly I esteem the people of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">America</span> in the exercise of 
               <br />
               national and domestic relations. They are true Anglo-Saxons. They are at this moment lavish- 
               <br />
               ing an amount of hospitality on Prince Arthur, which would do honour to any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nation,</span> But, 
               <br />
               whilst professing great respect for the people and for the Government of the United States, I 
               <br />
               confess that I do not like their political institutions. I have many friends in America, and 
               <br />
               I have spent some time there myself, in their military service, but I left <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">America</span> a greater 
               <br />
               Canadian than ever. And I say, Sir, that I deem the action taken by certain foreigners here, 
               <br />
               in getting up a petition. which has perhaps been brought into more prominent notice than it 
               <br />
               was entitled to, exceedingly unhappy, and I know that I speak the sentiments of my constituents 
               <br />
               when I say so. These foreigners have received every hospitality, and have been treated with 
               <br />
               respect and liberality in this Colony. They enjoyed all the rights and privileges to which they 
               <br />
               would have been entitled in their own country, and perhaps more; they have acted foolishly 
               <br />
               towards the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬂag</span> that sheltered them. and have abused the hospitality which has been extended 
               <br />
               to them in getting up this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">petition,</span> If any British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subjects</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">signed</span> it, I consider them unworthy 
               <br />
               of the name; they would be better in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">chairrgang.</span>

               I must refer once again to the Hon. Member for Victoria City. He said that patriotism was 
               <br />
               dead in this Colony; that interest and self-interest was paramount, and that the dollar was 
               <br />
