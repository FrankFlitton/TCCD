               He said :—It is pretty <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">generally</span> known that a company was started for the construction

               place under a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">former</span> administration; but although both the Admirals <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> Governor Seymour 
               <br />
               had reported in favour of it, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thing</span> had fallen through. owing to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inability</span> of the company 
               <br />
               to obtain the necessary funds. They were, only able to get a small loan in aid from the

               Admiralty. The Dominion guarantee of 5 per cent. on £100,000 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sterling,</span> with a prospect of

               capital required, which has been variously estimated; but from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">preliminary</span> surveys and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">investi»</span> 
               <br />
               gations which have been made, the sum of £100,000 is deemed sufficient, and there is little 
               <br />
               doubt that if a company can get <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> guarantee for that amount, they can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">carry</span> out the under- 
               <br />
               taking on the largest practicable scale. I am aware that some opposition has been expressed 
               <br />
               to the locality; but it is to he supported on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">general</span> grounds. It will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">general</span> to the whole 
               <br />
               Colony. £100,000 cannot be spent in any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">part</span> of the Colony without beneﬁting the rest of

               they want repair. and the last point they leave when they receive sailing orders. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Captain</span>

               Richards, and all the Admiral from first to last, have reported in favour of Esquimalt for a

               <br />

               <br />
               interested as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ill</span> lion. Member round this Board in those places, I must say that they already

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">larger</span> share of beneﬁt from the l 'n ; for in my opinion the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Overland</span> Railway must

               <br />
               be a public benefit. I support the establishment of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Craving</span> Dock at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Esquiinalt.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">»</span>
