               1 am now brought to a subject which I should not have known how to approach, but for the 
               <br />
               bridge thrown over for me by the Honourable Member for Victoria yesterday. By that Honour- 
               <br />
               able Member the suggestion of a closer union with another country—with the United States, in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fact—«and</span> the possibility that at the next General Election such an union might be presented as 
               <br />
               an alternative to Confederation with Canada, was introduced in so palpable a manner, that I 
               <br />
               should feel myself derelict to my duty as a Member of the Executive and as a Member of this 
               <br />
               Council if I did not refer to it.

               Mr. President, I should do violence to my best feelings were I to refrain from availing 
               <br />
               myself of this opportunity of paying my humble tribute of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respecteer</span> esteem for the people 
               <br />
               of that. great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Republic.</span> [“Iiear, hear,” from all sides] No one can better appreciate than I 
               <br />
               do the high and eminent qualities which characterise that great Nation. and especially that 
               <br />
               national feeling—that love of country, so worthy of our imitation~for which they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">havemade</span> 
               <br />
               such sacriﬁces. it has been my fortune to pass several years in the United States, and to have 
               <br />
               formed there some of the most valued friendships of my life, so that my acquaintance with 
               <br />
               Americans has led me to form a most appreciative estimate of their social and domestic 
               <br />
               relations, of which I can not speak in terms of too much praise. But my experience of the 
               <br />
               political institutions of that country only led me to prize our own more highly, and made me 
               <br />
               more than ever an Englishman; and I rejoice at the opportunity now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afforded</span> me of raising my

               voice against any movement tending in the direction of incorporating this country with the

               United States.

               1 must now make passing allusion to a petition gotten up in some mysterious way, looked 
               <br />
               upon here at ﬁrst as a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">more</span> joke; so insigniﬁcant that it would not be worthy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> notice but 
               <br />
               for the use made of it elsewhere. It has been represented in other quarters as expressing the 
               <br />
               views of a great portion of this community. It has been so represented in very high quarters, 
               <br />
               and I therefore notice it; and in doing so I feel compelled to state that, so far as I could learn, 
               <br />
               it was signed by a very small number of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">peoplewt’orty-two,</span> I believe, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aha—many</span> of whom were 
               <br />
               aliens, and most of whom were foreign-born subjects, and who appear to have been generally 
               <br />
               actuated by prejudice, based upon a lack of information respecting Canada and the Canadians, 
               <br />
               and not by any regard <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> the permanent beneﬁt of the community. But as this petition has 
               <br />
               been followed up by the publication of letters and by a discussion in the newspapers, which we 
               <br />
               cannot blink, as to what has been termed the Annexation of this Colony to the United States; 
               <br />
               and as allusion was made to it, by an innuendo at all events, in this Council yesterday, I feel 
               <br />
               bound to express my opinion of what our position would be under any such union as has been 
               <br />
               hinted at. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span>

               if British Columbia were placed in the same position as Washington <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territory,</span> we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should—l</span>

               be absolutely without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re1&gt;resentati01i~for</span> that Territory has one representative in Congress, it 
               <br />
               is true, but he has no vote—and all our ofﬁcials would come from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Washington.</span> Annexation to 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">United</span> States would also entail on us largely increased taxation. and would most materially 
               <br />
               atfect an interest which the Honourable Member for Victoria told you would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suffer</span> most <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,J</span>

               direct competition with the farmers of Washington Territory and Oregon, and then our agri- 
               <br />
               cultural inter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“ts</span> would be indeed annihilated. Again, it this country were American <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territory</span> 
               <br />
               you would have the whole inﬂuence of San Francisco brought to bear against the mercantile 
               <br />
               interests of Victoria; no hope could we have of building up a port here to rival San Francisco; 
               <br />
               no, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sir,</span> you would never see a foreign vessel in these waters. I see no advantages in the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suggestion;</span> I have heard none pointed out, unless it be the questionable expectation that 
               <br />
               American capital might buy up the real estate in and around Victoria, and so give the present 
               <br />
               holders the opportunity of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">realizing</span> their property into money and then leave the country to

               its fate. But in this hope, Sir, I believe they would be egregiously <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disappointed.</span> I will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not’</span> 
               <br />
               pursue the subject any further. Annexation is entirely out of the question, and I should not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span> 
               <br />
               have dared to allude to it, but for the introduction of the subject by another Honourable Member 
               <br />
               yesterday. What do these foreign petitioners propose to transfer? Themselves? Their own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3</span>
