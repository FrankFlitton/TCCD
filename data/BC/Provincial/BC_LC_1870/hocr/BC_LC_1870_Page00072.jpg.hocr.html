               Hon. Du. HELMCKEN—The objections of the Hon. Member are not correct. When the 
               <br />
               Dock and Railway are built, I admit that some source of labour, and consequent interest, 
               <br />
               will be gone, but then we must look for other interests to arise. I admit that discontent may 
               <br />
               arise; it has frequently been so in England, when a large number of labourers have been 
               <br />
               thrown out of employment; but I say that the Dominion and Local Governments will have the 
               <br />
               power and the sense to remedy any such evils as they occur.

               guarantee the interest. I shall, therefore, move an amendment, in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shape</span> of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recommendzv</span> 
               <br />
               tion to His Excellency, that the sum of £100,000 be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">increased</span> to £150,000 in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conditions</span> I 
               <br />

               Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MR,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">PEMBIGR’i‘ON—I</span> would ask the Chief Commissioner of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lands</span> and Works 
               <br />
               whether it would be possible to connect the supply of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">water</span> with the Docks? London is 
               <br />
               supplied by a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">large</span> fresh water reservoir, and it is possible that the same course might be 
               <br />
               adopted as regards this city. If the course of the water in the valley of Victoria Arm were 
               <br />
               stopped, the Gorge being a natural valley, if it were possible to exclude the salt water from 
               <br />
               the whole of Victoria Harbour, a vast natural reservoir of fresh water might be formed, which 
               <br />
               would supply the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whole</span> city with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">water.</span> Being no engineer, I feel some dithdence' in putting 
               <br />
               it forward. I only put it as a suggestion to the Chief Commissioner, with the view of inquir— 
               <br />
               ing whether it could be done.

               Hon. CHIEF <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">COMMISSIONER~It</span> is impossible for me to offer an opinion upon the 
               <br />
               suggestion of the Hon. Mr. Pembertou. The supply of water upon the supposed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">plan,</span> would 
               <br />
               contemplate the expenditure of much more money than the sum required for Graving Docks. 
               <br />
               Besides the proposed place is too low, and would necessitate the water being pumped up to a 
               <br />
               second reservoir. Moreover, I am of opinion that the supply of water is too much of :1 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">local</span>
