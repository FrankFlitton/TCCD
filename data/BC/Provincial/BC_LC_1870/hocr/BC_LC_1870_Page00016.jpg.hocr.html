               (lucing this result, and you will ﬁnd many other and mightier reasons to account for it. Chieﬁy, 
               <br />
               I believe, with the Honourable Attorney-General. that this depression is attributable to the 
               <br />
               isolated position of the Colony, and to the cold shade thrown over us by the neighbourhood of 
               <br />
               the Territories of the United States, from whom we can never hope for aid in advancing the 
               <br />
               interests of this Colony whilst under the British Flag. The desire for some change is urgent, 
               <br />
               and if we wait for more prosperous <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">times.</span> under which to claim better ﬁnancial terms, we may 
               <br />
               realize the old proverb of the “Horse starving whilst the grass is growing." Besides, Sir, on 
               <br />
               reference to the terms now proposed for the consideration of this House by the Government, 
               <br />
               it will be found that they are based not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">altogether</span> on the present condition of the Colony, but 
               <br />
               somewhat on an anticipated increase of population and prosperity; and I suppose we might 
               <br />
               wait many years before such a measure of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prosperity</span> would accrue to us, as to entitle us to 
               <br />
               ask better financial terms than are included in these Resolutions. 
               <br />

               I believe, Sir. the Canadian Government are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">favourably</span> disposed towards us, and prepared 
               <br />
               to go to the utmost of their ability in all reasonable matters to enable us to joint the Confeder-

               <br />
               enunciated in Earl Granville’s despatch; and we are fortunate in having now at the head of 
               <br />
               the Executive a Governor admirably adapted by his ability and experience to take charge, on

               our behalf, of negotiations for our union with the Dominion, and to whom the interests of the

               And that brings me, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sir,</span> to this point: That in its ﬁrst introduction into this Council, this 
               <br />
               measure must necessarily be a Government measure. The constitution of this House renders 
               <br />
               it imperative that the initiatory steps should he taken by the Government, although the ﬁnal

               <br />
               points out the advantages to be thus obtained, and nothing that I could add would enunciate 
               <br />
               more clearly than that document. the grounds-on which Her Majesty‘s Government, on behalf

               This leads me to remark on the part that has been taken in reference to this question by

               the Ofﬁcial Members of this House, especially by the Executive <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Officers.</span> Our position has been

               stated that the Ofﬁcial Members have been obstructive to Confederation, with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">res'ard</span> to their

               <br />
               always felt that we could safely confide our pe onal interests to the care of the Imperial

               <br />
               we have shewn ourselves the truest friends of the Colony, even <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">though</span> we have not appeared 
               <br />
               to be the most enthusiastic advocates <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Confederation.
