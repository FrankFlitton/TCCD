               this subject is that the Colony will derive “material beneﬁt” from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation,</span> and the Colony 
               <br />
               has been ottered by the Executive certain material beneﬁts in the shape of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway,</span> a Dock, 
               <br />
               cash in hand, and freedom from debt, in return for the transfer of all legislation to the Dominion

               of Canada. 'I‘hese "material beneﬁts " being paraded before the eyes of the colonists, the 
               <br />
               bargain is afterwards to be accepted or refused by a Council composed mainly of Representative 
               <br />
               Members. This mode of operation, no less than the bargain itself, is equally <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">objectionable</span> in 
               <br />
               my e, es. The material <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">benefits—the</span> Dock, the Railway, the money <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">payments—are</span> in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ettect</span> 
               <br />

               I have no doubt that the Colony will accept the bargain. The Colony is a small one, the 
               <br />
               population not exceeding (5,500 adult white men, and of these many are gentlemen of Canadian 
               <br />
               proclivities, Canadians by birth, who are naturally, and I may say patriotically, in favour <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oi?</span> a 
               <br />
               union with their native country.

               There are many, also, who, in the present adverse condition of things in this Colony, are 
               <br />
               desirous of change of any kind, and eager for any opportunity of benefiting by operations which ' 
               <br />
               promise to throw population, capital, and enterprise into the Colony. We have suffered much 
               <br />
               from pecuniary depression, and when we have an offer from a great country to come and spend 
               <br />
               money among us, can you doubt that any one will fail to feel these advantages; while many 
               <br />
               more hope for political power and eminence in a system which they expect will carry with it 
               <br />
               Representative <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Institutions,</span> if not Responsible Government. Can we doubt that the vote will 
               <br />
               be in favour of Confederation? The people of this country will sell themselves for the con- 
               <br />
               sideration of the present, and posterity will hereafter ash indignantly what right had we to 
               <br />
               shackle them, and to deprive them of rights which cannot be sold. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               We shall reap the benefit, and those that come after us will reap the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disadvantage</span> and 
               <br />
               humiliation. It is not in the power of the present generation to dispose of the birthright of 
               <br />
               its descendants. Liberty and self-government are inalienable rights. The original vice of the 
               <br />
               matter still remains, and when once the material beneﬁts are enjoyed or forgotten, and the 
               <br />
               consciousness of disadvantage is apparent, reaction will set in; a party of repudiators and 
               <br />
               repealers will arise, who with great show of justice will clamorously demand the reversal of 
               <br />
               an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">organic</span> change, founded on political error and wrong. Although our masters at Ottawa may 
               <br />
               he ever so amiable and ever so pure, the moment we feel the yoke we shall repent; it is not in 
               <br />
               the nature <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Englishmen to submit to tyranny of any description; and dissent such as our 
               <br />
               posterity will express, will be on only too sound <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grounds.</span> I say, Sir, that this matter ought not 
               <br />
               to be brought forward now, when the country is in a state of depression, ready to catch at 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anything.</span> Recourse should not he now had to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l‘topresentntive</span> Institutions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> the first time, 
               <br />
               when the obvious effect is the acceptance by this Colony of a confederation which carries with 
               <br />
               it direct, immediate, pecuniary gain. Few have the self-denial to reject a bait so invitineg 
               <br />
               dangled before their eyes. If the Colonists are to be trusted with Representative Institutions, 
               <br />
               for the purpose of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effecting</span> so important and radical a constitutional change, why are they not 
               <br />
               to be trusted with Representative institutions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">altogether".i</span> It is notorious that the Colony is, 
               <br />
               probably with justice, considered by the Imperial Authorities unfit for full Representative Insti- 
               <br />
               tutions, and that a Council, with a predominant oilicial element within it, is the only fit body 
               <br />
               to deal with important questions. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Yet</span> this Council is to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differently</span> constituted, and the 
               <br />
               ultimate terms to be accepted by the people alone, for the sole purpose of forwarding the 
               <br />
               cause of Confederation. The whole scheme for effecting Confederation is but a scheme of 
               <br />
               temptation very difﬁcult to forego, though it must be admitted recourse is not had to actual 
               <br />
               or practical <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">force</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">obligation.</span>

               I have delivered my honest opinion on this matter, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">libcrwri.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">animam</span> wzcam. I fear at great 
               <br />
               length. But I have spoken according to my conscientious convictions and a spirit of the truest 
               <br />
               loyalty. I am desirous to promote the interests of the British Nation; and I believe the present 
               <br />
               movement puts them in great peril. I have given you the best proof of my sincerity. l have 
               <br />
               spoken against my own interests. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> material interests in this Colony which will greatly 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">benefit</span> by the movement which will ensue from the building of 21 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railroad</span> and a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Doc-1:.</span> The 
               <br />
               interests of friends and connections who are dear to me will be much beneﬁted; and those who 
               <br />
               know the world tell me that it would have been much better for me if I had bent before 
               <br />
               the storm which I cannot avoid; that the honours and rewards of my profession are not likely 
               <br />
               to be bestowed upon one who is no friend to a popular, an Imperial, and a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canadian</span> movement; 
               <br />
               but I cannot act against political conviction. 1 am here to give honest counsel, and I have done 
               <br />
               it, come what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may.</span>
