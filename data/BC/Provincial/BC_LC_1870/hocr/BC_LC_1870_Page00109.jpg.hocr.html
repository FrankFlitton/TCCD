               question in this House that it must to some extent partake of a personal character; it must 
               <br />
               almost mean a vote of want <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> conﬁdence in Government ofﬁcials. The smallness of the com~ 
               <br />
               munity reduces it almost to a question amongst individuals, and as the Government Members 
               <br />
               have been placed. unnecessarily and inexpediently, as I think, to some extent upon their defence, 
               <br />
               I must speak plainly on some points, but in doing so I must deprecate any idea of giving offence. 
               <br />
               I say, then, that Responsible Government is not desirable. and is not applicable to this Colony 
               <br />
               at present; is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">practically</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unworkable.</span> And here I would deprecate the impression which is 
               <br />
               being so sliudiously instilled into the people of this Colony concerning what has been said of 
               <br />
               the unﬁt’licss of the Colony for Responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government.</span> I-Iis <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">F‘xcellency</span> the Governor has never 
               <br />
               said, nor has any member of the Government ever said, that the people are unﬁt, individually, 
               <br />
               to govern themselves. 1 say that, man for man. this community will compare favourably with 
               <br />
               any people on this coast. [“l-lear, hear.” from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">AttorneyGeneral.'l</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nor</span> is it even the 
               <br />
               smallness <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of,</span> the population that I consider to be the great objection, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">although</span> I admit that 
               <br />
               this is a drawback; but it is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scatter-oil</span> charat <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’er</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> population. It would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">practically</span> 
               <br />
               impossible to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">organize</span> electoral districts so that they should propeer represent the interests of 
               <br />
               the separate parts, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or</span> the whole Colony. As Victoria is the centre of wealth, and intelligence 
               <br />
               also. it you will, under present circumstances the Government would be centralized in the hands 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Victorians,</span> who would thus rule the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">('lolou‘,</span> and this would be objectionable [“Hear, hear," 
               <br />
               from Mr. Holbrook]; and I say also that there would be a great difﬁculty in getting proper 
               <br />
               representatives to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">represent</span> the respective districts. I do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agree</span> with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lion.</span> Member who 
               <br />
               has stated that only the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">chaff</span> of the people is blown into this House; for 1 say, Sir, that this 
               <br />
               Council, constituted as it is. has proved that men fit to represent the people do come here. 
               <br />
               Responsible Gov 'nmcnt will come as a matter of course when the community is ﬁt for it; but 
               <br />
               that form <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> government is not ﬁtted for communities in their infancy. It has never been so 
               <br />
               considered. Look abroad into the world and you will ﬁnd large populations without Responsible 
               <br />
               Govermnent. There is no necessity to look far off to see whether the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Anglo'Saxon</span> race must 
               <br />
               necessarily have Responsible Government. Look across the Straits, where there is a population 
               <br />
               of, I suppose, 30,000 people. and there they have neither Responsible Government nor representa- 
               <br />
               tive institutions. Look at Oregon, also with no representation until the population exceeded 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">45,000.</span> Look at the Red River Settlement, also with a population larger than ours; they do not 
               <br />
               apply for Responsible Government. It does not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">follow,</span> according to the rule of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Anglo»Saxon</span> 
               <br />
               minds, that this form of government must prevail. I do not think the sort of responsibility 
               <br />
               which is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advocated</span> would be suitable to this Colony at present, or would promote its true 
               <br />
               interests. If T did think it desirable I should be found amongst its most cordial advocates, as 
               <br />
               this is a matter open for discussion without Government direction. But I think, Sir, that our 
               <br />
               present form of Government is practically a more real responsibility to the people than that 
               <br />
               proposed by the Hon. Member for New Westminster; this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">form</span> which the Hon. Member for 
               <br />
               Lillooet <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Kinds</span> it so easy to animadvert upon. For we are in reality. if not directly, responsible 
               <br />
               to the people. We, as servants of the Crown, are directly and immediately responsible to the 
               <br />
               Governor, and the Governor is responsible to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Queen.</span> who is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">guardian</span> of the people‘s 
               <br />
               rights. This is no mere idea, for the fact of responsibility has been, over and over <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">again,</span> 
               <br />
               proved. If you have any good <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grounds</span> of complaint you know where to lay them and get 
               <br />
               redress. This responsibility which we owe is more real, less fluctuating. less open to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">doubtful</span> 
               <br />
               inﬂuences, and under it the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rights</span> of the whole count <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*</span> are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">secured</span> and protected. and not 
               <br />
               those of the majority, to the prejudice of the minority, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span> under the so-called Responsible 
               <br />
               Government. which really means Party Government, advocated so warmly by the Hon. Member 
               <br />
               for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> Westminster. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Why,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sir.</span> the Hon. Member has admitted to you that under that system 
               <br />
               the Government of lhe day <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might</span> come down to pass <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measures</span> bv unfair means.
