               It will not, in my opinion, make much difference where it is built; perhaps it would be better

               <br />
               to the naming of the locality, and I shall move that the word “Esquimalt” be struck out, 
               <br />
               and the words “ such place as the Dominion Government shall appoint” be inserted. I desire, 
               <br />
               if we are to have this organic change, that we should be free of sectional and local feelings 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">irritation</span> The naming of Esquimalt as the locality for the Dock seems to me to be an

               near the probable site of the Docks, and that, I confess, has a softening effect upon me; and 
               <br />
               though I do not allow it to inﬂuence my vote, it does inﬂuence my mind. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[Laughter]</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Con»</span>

               years, or $100 a month in rents. I do not believe that these terms will be submitted to, and 
               <br />
               if the inducements are taken away, I say the people will not have Confederation. If they do 
               <br />
               accept it under the inducement of material benefits, I fear that we shall very shortly see a 
               <br />
               strong feeling of reaction. Why should we name Esquiinal’t? Wbat right have we to do so,

               Esquimalt is named, it seems to me to tie down the Dominion Government to a locality of

               which they may not approve, and may be disadvantageous to the negotiation. The more that

               is left to the Dominion Government, the better is the chance of carrying out the negotiations
