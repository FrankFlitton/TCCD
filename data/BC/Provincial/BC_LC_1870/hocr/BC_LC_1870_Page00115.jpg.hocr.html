               <br />
               make a living by it. No one has said that it would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">economical—4t</span> would not be so. It 
               <br />
               would require at least thirty members to carry on party Government for six weeks at least

               <br />
               $20,000 a year. Then. I suppose, each Minister would require a pension when he went out. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> real Executive oﬂicers would remain then as now, and would have to be paid nearly as

               talk about voting away the people's money, but it must be borne in mind that a part of that 
               <br />
               money, under Confederation. will come from Canada, and she will have a right to see it 
               <br />
               properly expended. There is also a great deal of tall; about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lion.</span> Otlicial Members voting their 
               <br />
               own salaries. but would not the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thing</span> be done under Responsible Government? Have not

               Hon. Representative Members voted themselves salaries this present session? IIon. Members 
               <br />
               say that if Responsible Government is not granted we will agitate. I thought that everybody 
               <br />
               was so much in favour of it that the people would rise if it were not included in the terms; 
               <br />

               <br />
               that many of the people of Victoria desire it. and think that it can be carried out. Ask the 
               <br />

               <br />
               it. Political opinion does not run high in the Colony. I intend to support the Government

               think proper. I want to secure the material interests of the, Colony. Let the people say

               whether those material interests will be beneﬁted by Confederation, but not mix up the 
               <br />
               question of Responsible Government with it. I am perfectly willing to abide by the decision 
               <br />
               of the people on Responsible Government. and on Confederation on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Terms,</span> separately. My

               sole de <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> is to see this country materially <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">beneﬁted,</span> If the people want responsibility I will 
               <br />
               not say nay, but we must have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">good</span> terms. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">At</span> the polls Responsible Government might on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'y</span> 
               <br />

               <br />
               acted wisely in not allowing the terms to be clogged with Responsible Government. 1 say,
