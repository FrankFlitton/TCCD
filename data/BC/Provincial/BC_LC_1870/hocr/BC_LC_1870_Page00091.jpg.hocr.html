               Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">M12.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">WALKEMer,</span> Chairman, having been unfortunately absent during the early 
               <br />
               part of this debate, I have not been able, hitherto, to take part in it. I adopt the principle 
               <br />
               laid down by the Hon. Chief Commissioner with regard to this clause, but I think the clause 
               <br />
               is not general enough. It is true, that it is suiliciently general as to a part, but not as to 
               <br />
               the whole. Enough has been said about the spending of $1,000,000 to show what it means. I 
               <br />
               would leave out the one million. It would be enough, in my opinion, to say that it shall be 
               <br />
               constructed within a reasonable time. This would mean not an indefinite, but a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reasonable,</span> 
               <br />
               time; it would he so interpreted by the Law Cour I would leave out the deﬁnition of time, 
               <br />
               and I would leave out the one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">million.</span> I think it 'will do us injury with Canadian statesmen; 
               <br />
               they will say that this is the measure of our desire to he contederated, There is another point 
               <br />
               to which I would call attention. The language of the clause does not, in my opinion, imply 
               <br />
               that one million must <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessarily</span> be expended within the Colony. I conclude, after hearing 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">explanations</span> of Hon. Members, that it- is intended that the one million shall he spent here; 
               <br />
               but in my opinion it might, under these words, be expended on any part of the line. I thought 
               <br />
               that was the intention; it was so thought in San Francisco. There were newspaper articles 
               <br />
               upon it, and the idea of a million a year being spent upon the Railway for a hundred years 
               <br />
               was laughed at on all sides. I would suggest an alteration in the words. I am ready to leave 
               <br />
               the construction of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">English</span> to any schoolmaster. I say that they do not mean “ in the 
               <br />
               Colony.” With regard to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">remarks</span> of the Hon. Member for Victoria District, I would remark 
               <br />
               that this is not really a ﬁnal contract, and I agree with the Hon. Chief Commissioner that the 
               <br />
               clause ought to be general. The Canadian statesmen, with whom we are about to deal, are not 
               <br />
               mere tyros; and I say that the mention of this one million leaves it open to Canada to keep the 
               <br />
               time open. If they expend that sum upon any portion of the line, they will be able to prolong 
               <br />
               the building of the road as long as-they please. And, although it may be said that Canada will 
               <br />
               take care of us, I say we ought to take care of ourselves. Let us get as good terms as possible, 
               <br />
               not trusting to the Canadians, but looking after our own interests. We should, in my opinion, 
               <br />
               abstain from all mention of one million dollars, or any other sum; otherwise the Canadian 
               <br />
               Government may say that on payment or expenditure of that sum they will have completed 
               <br />
               their bargain, 
               <br />

               <br />
               after much consideration, in the ﬁrst place emanating from the Hon. Chief Commissioner of 
               <br />
               Lands and Works. I conceive that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'words——H</span> and that a sum of not less than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,000,000</span> 
               <br />
               “shall be expended in every year, from and after three years from the date of Union, in 
               <br />
               “actualy constructing the initial sections of such Railway from the Seaboard of British 
               <br />
               “Columbia. to connect with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">theRailway</span> system of Canada,” fully <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">convey</span> the meaning that 
               <br />
               it was intended they should. The language means that the expenditure should be within this 
               <br />
               Colony, and it can mean nothing else. The schoolmaster cannot have been where the Hon. 
               <br />
               Member has just visited, or he would not have so misconstrued this clause. I may conﬁrm 
               <br />
               what the Hon. Chief Commissioner says, that if in communication with the Canadian Govern- 
               <br />
               ment it is found that they will not consent to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway,</span> it is thought that we may obtain 
               <br />
               some equivalent. I must vote against the amendment of the Hon. Member for Victoria 
               <br />
               District (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">IleCosmos).</span> as it proposes to enter into details <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affecting</span> particular localities. I 
               <br />
               regret that the Hon. Member, who usually takes such large and extended views, should in this 
               <br />
               instance have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taken</span> so small and sectional a view of so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">large.</span> a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scheme</span> The whole country 
               <br />

               <br />
               Member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Victoria</span> City proposes a guarantee and a penalty, but he has not shown how he 
               <br />
               could enforce the penalty if, we cannot compel the fulﬁlment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terms.</span> I think that the 
               <br />
               self-interests of Canada will be so identified with those of British Columbia that we shall 
               <br />
               require no further guarantee. If more is required, as the Hon. Member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> Westminster 
               <br />
               says, we have the assurance of the Imperial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gorerunlentv—the</span> Queen’s proclamation. I cannot 
               <br />
               say that I think that the Canadian interests are purely commercial, I have lived in Canada 
               <br />
               for several years. and while there did not regret to see the country divided against itself. 'Now, 
               <br />
               there is a national feeling <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">growingr</span> up in that promising young country; her inhabitants are 
               <br />
               becoming more British in their feeling; I believe that Canada will, as she has heretofore done, 
               <br />
               carry out the terms she makes in honour and good faith. It will he to her interest to do so; 
               <br />
               it will be to her interest to satisfy the interests of British Columbia.
