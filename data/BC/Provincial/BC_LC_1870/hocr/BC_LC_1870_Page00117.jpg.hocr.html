               <br />
               had a population of 600,000. All the other Provinces were told the same thing. Must we wait 
               <br />
               for such an increase, or must we ﬁght as (lid Canada? Throw us on our own resources as a 
               <br />
               Colony, and we will soon learn valuable lessons in the science of Government. There were 
               <br />
               gentlemen of good families and of good education who came here in ear ' days, who had never 
               <br />
               suffered privations of any sort before they came here; sent out to make fortunes, or, at all 
               <br />
               events, homes for themselves; their roughing it was rough indeed. Bad news had come from 
               <br />
               the mines; the avenues of trade were closed; there were no agricultural pursuits for them to 
               <br />
               turn to; the consequence was they had to lie round hotels; after failing to get Government

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">employment,-for</span> which, as a matter of course, they applied,—~some kept bars whilst waiting 
               <br />
               for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">remittances.</span> The reason was that they never had been taught <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self-reliance.</span> We shall he 
               <br />
               in the same position'it we are constantly to have rulers from England, or Canada; but throw 
               <br />
               us on our resources and we shall succeed. Self-reliance is the best means of education in 
               <br />
               politics as in anything else. If our rulers are sent us from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England</span> or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ottawa</span> we will always 
               <br />
               lack <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seltlreliance.</span> Self-reliance is written on every line of the British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North</span> America Act. 
               <br />
               Rely upon yourselves, is the cry of the people of England. It is better to grapple with the 
               <br />
               difﬁculties now when the issues are small and comparatively unimportant; and should we make 
               <br />
               blunders they will not be so serious when our interests are small; and for what errors we do 
               <br />
               commit, the consequences will fall upon ourselves. We will, no doubt, blunder at ﬁrst, and 
               <br />
               there may be chaff blown <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">here.</span> If Responsible Government will bring the scum to the top, 
               <br />
               dross will go to the bottom. The scum will be ladled <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">olf—the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">chart</span> will be blown away by the 
               <br />
               breath of public opinion. The Governor’s promise of a majority will not satisfy the people, 
               <br />
               and we should, therefore. urge upon His Excellency to give us Responsible Government. I am 
               <br />
               not in favour, however, of making that condition a sine (I'ILCL <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">non</span> of Confederation. I would 
               <br />
               accept Confederation with good terms, even without Responsible Government. There may he 
               <br />
               a few arguments against it, but there are many in its favour. Under no circumstances would 
               <br />
               I like Confederation and Responsible Government to go to the polls together. I hope the people 
               <br />
               will sever the two. Let us have Confederation and we shall get Responsible Government.

               Hon. Mn. WOOD—In rising to address myself to the motion now before this Committee, 
               <br />
               I do so with a double object: I feel myself challenged to uphold my opinion on the subject 
               <br />
               of Responsible Government, as applied to this Colony, and I am desirous to add a few words 
               <br />
               on the bearing of the subject, in the matter of Confederation, now before the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Council!</span> First, 
               <br />
               with respect to the subject of Responsible Government. As to this, Sir, my views have been 
               <br />
               for a long time settled, and I shall endeavour to express them as clearly as I can. The result 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them</span> is expressed in a few words. I am in favour of the extension of representative <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">institw</span> 
               <br />
               tions little by little, to the utmost <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">verge</span> of safety; but I am opposed, in this community at 
               <br />
               least. to the establishment of what is called Responsible Government. These are my views 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shortly,</span> I believe them to be the settled convictions of most moderate and experienced men 
               <br />
               not bound to ﬂatter popular <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constituencies,</span> And I believe I am doing a service to society in 
               <br />
               upholding such moderate views against the popular error and the popular bias in favour of the 
               <br />
               rash application of Responsible Government in such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">communities.</span> I will start, Sir, at once 
               <br />
               from an historical point of view. The Hon. Member for New Westminster has, as I under- 
               <br />
               stand him. asserted that Responsible Government is the immemorial birthright ot‘ Englishmen, 
               <br />
               and that the principle of Cabinet Ministers <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">going</span> in and out with votes of a majority of the 
               <br />
               House of Commons is a principle of ancient date. My understanding of the history of. my 
               <br />
               country leads to a different conclusion; and however much it may be clear and obvious that 
               <br />
               representative institutions are our natural and inalienable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">birthright;</span> however much it may 
               <br />
               he established that the power of self-taxation resides and has always resided in the represent- 
               <br />
               atives of the country, in the Commons of England. carrying with it the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">overwhelming</span> power 
               <br />
               of the purse—it is, I believe, clearly admitted that the principle of Responsible Government, 
               <br />
               as now understood, has existed for little more than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">300</span> year <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~say</span> from the accession of 
               <br />
               George III. and the termination of Lord Bute's <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">administration.</span> 0 that I admit the Hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman’s proposition only so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">far</span> as this. Representative institutions are the birthright of 
               <br />
               the British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">naHons—representative</span> institutions and the privilege of taxing ourselves. Now, 
               <br />
               Sir, 1 believe the whole scope of representative institutions to be greatly misrepresented. It
