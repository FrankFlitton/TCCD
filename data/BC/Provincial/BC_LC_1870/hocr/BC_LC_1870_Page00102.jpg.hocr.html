               ment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> that people date <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> the inauguration of Responsible Government. The failure of 
               <br />
               representative institutions, formerly enjoyed upon this Island, is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">frequently</span> cited as an argument 
               <br />
               against Responsible Government: being introduced here. I admit the partial failure of these 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">institutions.</span> That failure was not, however, on account of the institutions being “ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representav</span> 
               <br />
               tive,” but because they were not “responsible” The essential principle was wanting. There 
               <br />
               was no constitutional connecting link—no bond of sympathy between those who sat by the will 
               <br />
               of the people and those who sat contrary to, and in deﬁance of, that will. The system, painted, 
               <br />
               though it was, in popular dress, was rotten at the core—proved a delusion and a sham. The 
               <br />
               people, sometimes in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">indifference</span> and contempt, permitted unsuitable men to be elected, and the 
               <br />
               whole <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thing,r</span> came to rack and ruin. It is to avoid a repetition of that unseemly farce that the 
               <br />
               people demand that any new constitution which may be conferred upon this Colony shall be 
               <br />
               based upon the only true principle of responsibility. This question should be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">finally</span> settled. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘The‘</span> Colony desires political rest. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(to</span> inaugurate a fresh political agitation with Union is most 
               <br />
               undesirable, and might lead to disastrous results. The possible consequences of a refusal to 
               <br />
               grant Responsible Government coincident with Confederation, is a part of the subject I almost 
               <br />
               hesitate to touch I would neither prophecy, predict, nor threaten; but I would ask the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment to read well and carefully the lessons written in blood in other countries Human nature 
               <br />
               is much the same on both sides of this great continent. Has the Anglo-Saxon race become so 
               <br />
               utterly degenerate here that it is prepared to barter away for mere money subsidies those rights 
               <br />
               which were purchased with so much blood elsewhere? I utterly refuse to think so meanly of 
               <br />
               this people. We have seen that even the half~breeds at Red River have too much of the old 
               <br />
               blood in their veins to permit a fancied political wrong. I am not going to predict a rebellion 
               <br />
               here. Heaven grant there may be none. But I do feel it my duty to warn the Government 
               <br />
               against unnecessarily provoking such a possible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contingency.</span> Why should there be such an 
               <br />
               unaccountable antipathy to investing the people of British Columbia with those political powers 
               <br />
               enjoyed under the British Constitution? Why is the present form of Government so unpopular 
               <br />
               with the people? I will tell you <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">why</span> It is just because it is not a people’s Government. They 
               <br />
               had no hand in making it. They had none in working it. They can have none in unmaking it. 
               <br />
               Only let the people have a hand in forming the Government, in selecting men of their own choice 
               <br />
               to rule over them. and we would ﬁnd a popular <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government,</span> a strong Government, strong in 
               <br />
               the heart and conﬁdence of the people. The very same gentlemen who are unpopular now, 
               <br />
               because ruling without the consent of the people, would be popular then, because ruling by 
               <br />
               the act and with the consent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the people. The people of British Columbia are naturally a 
               <br />
               conservative people. Restore to them their political rights, and no Government would need to 
               <br />
               fear an undue desire for change. The people know best how to manage their own local affairs. 
               <br />
               Depend upon it, Sir, the people are seldom wrong in their opinions; in their sentiments they 
               <br />
               are never mistaken. Those now in power have a great responsibility resting upon them. Upon 
               <br />
               the manner in which they acquit themselves in regard to this very question may hang the most 
               <br />
               momentous consequences Will they promote everlasting wellbeing. or precipitate untold evil? 
               <br />
               Heaven grant that they may do the right! I stand here <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> to advise and warn, not to 
               <br />
               threaten and predict. The Government has a very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grave</span> responsibility in this matter, and may 
               <br />
               well take a lesson from other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">countries.</span> The possible consequence of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">refusal</span> to grant a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l</span> 
               <br />
               reasonable request may he a repetition of the Red lliver <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trouble.</span> Let not the Government 
               <br />
               make a fatal mistake, or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> may ﬁnd themselves in a state of political agitation that may 
               <br />
               lead to the most serious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consequences.</span> I believe that, under circumstances analogous to what 
               <br />
               occurred in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lied</span> River ’l‘ to y. the Imperial Government would treat the inhabitants of 
               <br />
               this Colony with even more consideration. It would not be a question of bayoncts and fleets 
               <br />
               to coerce this Colony. but it would be a question of what concessions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ought</span> to be made. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span> 
               <br />
               that the Government have an opportunity now not only of shunning <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">evill</span> but of doing a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> 
               <br />
               work. On! let: not the Government make the fatal mistake of saying the people shall not 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">manage</span> their own affairs Do not let them make the fatal mistake of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">compelling</span> the people 
               <br />
               to reject these conditions at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">polls.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now</span> I have discharged a duty; I have said all I feel 
               <br />
               called upon to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span> at this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stage.</span> I have stated my own views and, I venture to think, those 
               <br />
               of an overwhelming <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ma~</span> ' of the people of British Columbia, as well as of my own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con—</span> 
               <br />
               stituents. I trust the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> will take care how they force a vote on this question, which 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affects</span> this whole commun <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> [“ Hear, hear.”l This is, in a sense, distinct from the conditions, 
               <br />
               and it is probable that the Governor must obtain what we are now asking from a different 
               <br />
               quarter. But, obtain it from where he will, it must, I say, be obtained.
