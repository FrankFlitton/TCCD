               A new election ought to have been called before this question was brought on; but there 
               <br />
               is one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfaction</span> left us, it is that Her Moje 'y’s Government have left the terms to the Colony.

               Now, Sir, in the first place, it is necessary for the people to see that Confederation must

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I believe it to be most inopportune. It is believed by most people that this Colony is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">0116903</span> 
               <br />
               the verge of great changes. That the new gold discoveries will bring a large population <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to’D</span> 
               <br />
               this Colony, and that the slight despondeucy which now exists will be swept away, and that 
               <br />
               this Colony will once more enter upon an era <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> prosperity not inferior to that which belonged 
               <br />
               to it a few years ago. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I say, Sir, that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> is an inopportune period to bring this question up, because when that 
               <br />
               population which is expected arrives, our position to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">negotiate</span> for terms will be much better, 
               <br />
               because with a larger population and greater prosperity, we may demand far better terms than 
               <br />
               now; and, Sir, it is my firm conviction that if prosperity comes shortly the people of. this 
               <br />
               Colony will not desire to change certainty for uncertainty. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Another reason there is that we ought to wait until after 1871. In that year Canada <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has@</span> 
               <br />
               to take a census of the population. and when that is taken we shall know the amount of the 
               <br />
               debt per head. 1 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> no doubt it is greater now than when Confederation was first inaugu- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rated,</span> It is increasing, and I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">believe</span> that instead of 122 cents per <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">head</span> it will now be 25 cents. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I should like, then, to wait until after <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1871,</span> because we shall then <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> a better opportunity 
               <br />
               of knowing the ﬁnancial condition of those with whom we would connect ourselves

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               It is inopportune, also, for the reason that the present dill‘iculties in the Red River Settle-® 
               <br />
               nienl: are sufﬁcient to cause us great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anxiety:</span> I will not take up the time of this House by 
               <br />
               inquiring whether the people of that Territory are right or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wrong.</span> I know not, and shall not 
               <br />
               discuss the question; but this 1 do know, that if they induce the Indians to join them it will 
               <br />
               cause a great delay in the settlement of that country; and we do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">even</span> yet know that the 
               <br />
               Red River Settlement will prove so inviting to emigration as is reported. Again, Sir, I may 
               <br />
               state that Confederation, so far as it has at present gone, is but a mere experiment. It is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nothingr</span> more or less than an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">experiment,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">And</span> I believe that considerable dissatisfaction has 
               <br />
               resulted from it. If we wait a little longer before seeking to enter within its pale ourselves, 
               <br />
               we shall know better about the faults of its machinery, and perhaps be able to learn what are 
               <br />
               its drawbacks, and how we can best avoid them. These, Sir, are good and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sufficient</span> reasons 
               <br />
               for delay. it is absurd to attempt to ally ourselves with a people 3,000 miles away, without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~</span>
