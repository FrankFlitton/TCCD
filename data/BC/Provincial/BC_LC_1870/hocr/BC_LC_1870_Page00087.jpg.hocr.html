               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Mr. WOOD—1 understood the Hon. Member to say that Government did not consider 
               <br />
               it essential. I fear that it is delusive to hope that the Imperial Government would give a 
               <br />
               guarantee for this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway.</span> They could only do so on military grounds; but I am convinced 
               <br />
               they would never guarantee three thousand miles of an exposed line of Railway within a few 
               <br />
               miles of the territorial boundary, a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thing</span> which courts assault and would be so perilous to 
               <br />
               maintain, seeing that it could he cut in two in a hundred places by hostile forces from 
               <br />
               the United States. It requires little reﬂection to see that Colonial undertakings are seldom 
               <br />
               guaranteed now. Canada’s interest in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway,</span> on the other hand. is purely commercial. 
               <br />
               For such a Railway to pay, it must pass through populous districts—places like Omaha and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States</span> towns. It is monstrous to suppose that England would supply the capital 
               <br />
               for such a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scheme.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">No</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">capitalists</span> in the world would advance their money for such an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under»</span> 
               <br />
               taking. The matter has been talked threadbare in the public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prints.</span> It is out of the question 
               <br />
               to suppose that there would be any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">material</span> trade in bulky goods this way. [Ilear, hear, 
               <br />
               hear, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear]</span> Canada, ﬁnding the thing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁcult,</span> will refuse the terms. [“No, no,” from 
               <br />
               Dr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Carroll.)</span> I say the money will not be spent. I back my knowledge of: the world and 
               <br />
               experience of men <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> things against the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“No,</span> no ” of the Hon. Member, and I believe the 
               <br />
               result will be that the Canadian Government will refuse this item; and in refusing will say, 
               <br />
               “We do the best we can; it is our interest to do the thing. but it is impossible to get the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">guarantee</span> through Parliament.” I believe the Canadian statesmen who have the conduct of 
               <br />
               this matter will sav to our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Delegates,</span> or to His Excellency, “Don’t you think you can do 
               <br />
               without this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railw</span> ? You must take our desire to do it for the deed itself. By and bye, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perhaps,</span> it can be accomplished, and by no means so effectually as by becoming a part of our 
               <br />
               Dominion.“ And so a quiet go-hy will be given to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway,</span> and the terms will come back 
               <br />
               again shorn of this item. If, as the Hon. Chief Commissioner says, these terms are to come 
               <br />
               before the people—mind I say the people alone—I believe there is a feeling that Confederation 
               <br />
               is a movement which promi s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">something,</span> and this feeling will lead to these terms being 
               <br />
               passed. So weak are commercial and agricultural interests in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> Colony at the present time, 
               <br />
               so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">small</span> is the population, and the mass of the people are doing so badly and are so dissatisﬁed 
               <br />
               thnlt, in my opinion, they will vote for anything that will give change and a chance of bettering 
               <br />
               themselves. I intend, Sir, to move an amendment, with the view of making this Railway a 
               <br />
               test question :——"That without a substantial guarantee for an Overland Railway, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confedersv</span> 
               <br />
               tion should be rejected by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Delegates</span> from this Colony.” It is obvious that this motion 
               <br />
               will be defeated, but I am desirous to test the opinions of the representative members of this 
               <br />
               Council on so liiateri-al a point <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this,</span> The Hon. Chief Commissioner says that these terms 
               <br />
               are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> be decided, eventually. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> the representative members <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alone—of</span> course, without the 
               <br />
               ofﬁcial vote. And here I may ask, are the official members, in the event of its ultimate 
               <br />
               discussion, to retire from the Council, and leave the question to the representative members 
               <br />
               alone? If we are fit for representative institutions. why not give them to us now? Having 
               <br />
               promised the Colony terms, I think the Executive are bound to pr <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘ent</span> terms which are good, 
               <br />
               in the sense of being productive of permanent good and quiet en. ylnent. I cannot forbear to 
               <br />
               say <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> in place of terms simply providing for pecuniary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">benefit,</span> I should have preferred to 
               <br />
