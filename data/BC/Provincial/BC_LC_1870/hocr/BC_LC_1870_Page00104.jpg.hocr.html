               <br />
               [“ It has ”—~\Ir. DeCosmosl The Hon. Member says that it has; I say it has not. It has 
               <br />
               been named with Confederation, but not by itself; and until it is made a separate question, 
               <br />
               my advice to the Governor will be not. to grant it. The Governor has left you to choose any 
               <br />
               Government you deem best. Do you think it would be better to have as permanent heads of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">departments</span> two or three gentlemen who are familiar with the wants of the Colony, or a 
               <br />
               moveable Ministry going out on a question <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> repairs to Cowichan <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Rodd,</span> or something of that. 
               <br />
               kind? "hese are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amongst</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">things</span> that you have to consider, and if, after due <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consideration,‘</span> 
               <br />
               the people desire Responsible Government, they will have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> I am here to state that His 
               <br />
               Excellency the Governor has no wish or desire to keep hack Responsible Government; if he had 
               <br />
               any such desire, is it likely that he would have reconstituted his Executive Council so as to 
               <br />

               <br />
               they'ask for Responsible Government; they have not probably considered the failures that have 
               <br />
               been made in respect of Responsible Government There have been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some</span> failures, as, for 
               <br />
               instance, in Jamaica and in Victoria. A class of people get into power under Responsible 
               <br />
               Government whom no person would like to have as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rulers.</span> There are petty interests mixed. 
               <br />
               up with politics in small communities, which prevent the system working so well in them as 
               <br />
               in large countries like Great Britain, where there is a healthy tone and a vast population, and, 
               <br />
               consequently, great questions of national importance. I maintain that after Confederation the 
               <br />
               questions connected with local affairs will be so small, and so entirely connected with particular 
               <br />
               localities, that a staff of permanent heads of departments will be far better for the Colony than 
               <br />
               Responsible Government. I make this statement from conviction. I am perfectly free to take 
               <br />
               any course I like, notwithstanding I am an Executive Councillor. My position has not in any 
               <br />
               way curtailed my views. I could have advised Responsible Government if I had thought proper, 
               <br />
               and would have done so if I had thought it desirable for this Colony. If anyone believes that 
               <br />
               the Organic Act does not allow Responsible Government to be obtained at any time, let him 
               <br />
               move to make clause 19 specially applicable to this Colony.

               <br />
               proposes it. We know what His Excellency’s intention is with regard to giving representation 
               <br />
               in the new Council, but we do not know the measure of it. If there is an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">overwhelming</span> 
               <br />
               majority for Responsible Government in all districts, electors will take care to send Responsible 
               <br />
               Government Members to the next Council. It' the people are determined to have this “ priceless 
               <br />
               boon,” let them send men who will say they will have it. I feel impelled to administer a soft 
               <br />
               and gentle rebuke to the Hon. Member for New Westminster, who has, I must confess, won 
               <br />
               my esteem by his manly, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Straightforward</span> support of these Resolutions; but I must take 
               <br />
               exception to his language: it has been too emphatic—iiniiitentionally, of course—because led 
               <br />
               away by the subject. He has used inﬂammatory language which he had better not have 
               <br />
               uttered, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">language</span> which was not exactly in accordance with what I conceive to be correct. 
               <br />
               That clause in the Governor‘s speech which speaks of our not being lit to govern ourselves: 
               <br />
               Governor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Musvrave</span> has never said so; if he had, I should have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taken</span> it as a personal insult. 
               <br />
               I say, as a British Columbian, I am capable of governing myself ; and if we can, individually, 
               <br />
               govern ourselves, it is fair to suppose that the Colony, as a whole, can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern</span> itself. It you 
               <br />
               had the whole population comeatable altogether. so that they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Could</span> be parallel like an army, 
               <br />
               and you could make them give expression to their views, and out <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">01’</span> that get a Government, it 
               <br />
               might be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">practicable;</span> but instead of that, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">here</span> we are with a scattered population, isolated 
               <br />
               centres sepalatcd from each other. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">majority</span> are here for the sole purpose of making 
               <br />
               money, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> they don't feel that anxiety that has been represented about Responsible Govern— 
               <br />
               ment; they want to be governed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as.</span> cheaply as possible. If I am wrong, if it turns out at 
               <br />
               the polls that even a triﬂing majority are in favour of Responsible Government, they can have 
               <br />
               it. The iron heel of Canada is all nonsense. Governor Musgrave is the man we have to deal 
               <br />
               with, and I say that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Responsible</span> Government is a relief to any Governor, for it comes between 
               <br />
               him and the people. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lovornor</span> Musgrave says that it is (I paraphrase) “ my duty, with my 
               <br />
               “experience, to give fair and frank advice to the people; to tell them what I think is for their 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“good.</span> If they determine differently to my advice, the fault is with them." Supposing that 
               <br />
               Governor Musgrave had put Responsible Government in as a condition, and had thrust it upon 
               <br />
               the people, would not the respectable minority who are against it have said—or possibly, and 
               <br />
