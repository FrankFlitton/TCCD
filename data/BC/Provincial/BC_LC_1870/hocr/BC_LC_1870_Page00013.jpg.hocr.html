               that is to say, Confederation on proper terms. I do not say that Confederation would be entirely

               <br />
               from himself, looking at the question dispassionately, that the construction of the Railway

               <br />
               be ill-adapted to some of our local interests which we desire to protect, it should be remembered 
               <br />
               that the Canadian tari is now under revision, as regards the free admission of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">American</span>

               Then, Sir, where would be the advantage of union in that other direction that has been

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Exception</span> has been taken by the Honourable gentleman to the ﬁsherv laws of the Dominion; 
               <br />
               and it is said that the whales and salmon will cry out for Confederation to protect them. if 
               <br />
               the Canadian fishery laws were enforced in their present form, it is possible that the salmon 
               <br />
               might escape, and the whales might spout with impunity; but we have a right to expect that 
               <br />
               the Dominion Parliament will adapt these laws to this Colony, on the representations of the 
               <br />
               Members from this Province. It would be absurd to suppose that, if the ﬁshery laws of the 
               <br />
               Dominion were inimical to British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Columbia.</span> they would be enforced; the nature of the union 
               <br />
               will be such as to make the interests of this part of the Dominion identical with other parts. 
               <br />
               We cannot suppose that the Dominion Parliament would seek to injure this Province. A man 
               <br />
               would not wantonly injure the smallest member of his body. He could not do so without 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feeling</span> it. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">No</span> man can neglect or injure any member of his own body with impunity. If one 
               <br />
               member, however humble, suffers, all the members will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suffer</span> with it. Community of interest 
               <br />
               is the best guarantee for fair play to every section. The Dominion is made up of Provinces, 
               <br />
               and the prosperity of the Dominion means the prosperity of the Provinces of which it is 
               <br />
               Composed.
