               River mines, so much, that they would almost lead us to suppose that if Peace River was to

               with ﬁnance. It is a subject which I have not made my particular study. The class of observa- 
               <br />
               tions which I shall feel it my duty to make upon these clauses, will be more for the purpose of 
               <br />
               enquiring whether this Council has taken properly inlo consideration the possibility of the 
               <br />
               population of this Colony <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">increasing</span> within ten or ﬁfteen years to 100,000, or about that number, 
               <br />
               if such an increase should take place, with the debt of British Columbia paid off, as it will be. 
               <br />
               by that time, Canada <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Will</span> gain enormously under those terms. Ol" the prospect of there being 
               <br />
               a large consumption of Canadian goods here, I can say nothing. I do not think it likely that 
               <br />
               the Railway will supersede sea carriage in bulky staples. There are great diﬂiculties connected 
               <br />
               with the transport of any goods, and until the Railway is in operation, I apprehend that the 
               <br />
               bulk of our dry goods will come as heretofore, from Englnnd, whilst that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">claim</span> of unlnanufac- 
               <br />
               tured articles, which we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> now importing from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">America,</span> will still be likely to come into the 
               <br />
               market cheaper than Canadian goods, even though they are subject to a tariff. It is the 
               <br />
               diﬂiculty of transport, our isolation in fact, as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Attorney-General has stated, and not 
               <br />
               the tariff, which is the real and substantial impediment to trade. I cannot help thinking that 
               <br />
               it is the probable destiny of this Colony to be numbered by hundreds of thousands, rather than 
               <br />
               by millions. This is the ultimate part of the world. We are in this Colony further removed 
               <br />
               from the great centres of civ ization than probably any other known portions of the globe; we 
               <br />
               may almost be called the last country in the world; and it is probable that only exceptional 
               <br />
               articles of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">manufacture</span> will come to us from Canada. The consumption of manufactured articles 
               <br />
               imported from England, which can produce every kind of manufactured article cheaper and 
               <br />
               better than Canada, is not likely to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">decrease.</span> Canada cannot compete with the facilities afforded 
               <br />
               by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England</span> and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l‘nited</span> States in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'niainlfacl'uresi</span> With regard to the advantages to be 
               <br />
               derived by Canada <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> the terms. I take it that the present population of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consumers</span> in British 
               <br />
               Columbia is in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">realil‘;</span> about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">25.000,</span> instead of 40,000. As the population increases the Customs 
               <br />
               Revenue, which will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">always</span> be the main source of income, will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">increase;</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advantage,</span> cou- 
               <br />
               sequently, will be entirely on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> side of the Dominion; their proﬁts grow in proportion as our 
               <br />
               population increa whilst their burdens are becoming less. Customs would increase and 
               <br />
               judicial fees would increase; in fact. with a population of 100,000, I think I am not far wrong 
               <br />
               in stating, that Canada would take from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$800,000</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">151000.000</span> from this Colony in the shape 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Revenue</span> every year, and would leave Bri l Columbia with an increased expenditure neces- 
               <br />
               sary for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">carry</span> ng on the Local Government. without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> Corr sponding increase of income. The 
               <br />
               clauses proposed show, in my humble opinion, a present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">temporary</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">uncertain</span> advantage, 
               <br />
               against a certain and prolonged future loss.
