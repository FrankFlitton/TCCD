               a special <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clay,</span> irrespective of these Resolutions. should be set apart for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discussion.</span> There is 
               <br />
               no desire whatever on the part of the Government to shirk the question. The matter of

               First. Canada has to accept them; then there is r . 'ence back to British Columbia to submit

               <br />
               with a Crown Council; we must expect to go in with fuller Representative Institutions. If 
               <br />
               we do not have Confederation under these terms, we shall. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nevertheless,</span> have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Representative</span>

               Institutions; and a majority, under the Imperial Act, will have the power to change and get 
               <br />
               ‘Responsible Government, that is, party government. My point is, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[that</span> it is unnecessary to

               drag in Responsible Government now; it is not necessary to mix it up with these Resolutions. 
               <br />
               Our vote on this Resolution need not be decided on Responsible Government, or party govern- 
               <br />
               ment. We shall still be open to send any other Resolution on the subject of party government 
               <br />
               to the Governor. I, therefore, throw out the invitation to discuss it more fully on a future 
               <br />
               day. I feel sure that it this course is adopted the discussion will be more free.

               Hon. Mn. RI <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">G~I</span> think, Sir, that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">His</span> Excellency’s message, it I may so call these 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Resolutions,</span> invites us to discuss Responsible Government. Sir, we have been in former days 
               <br />
               favoured with Representative Institutions, and have been defrauded by them. I desire to 
               <br />
               know what we have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gained</span> by the Irresponsible Government that has for some years past 
               <br />
               oppressed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us.</span> What, I ask, has been done about the various questions that have come up— 
               <br />
               the Sisters‘ Rocks, the Court of Appeal? The answer has been no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">funds.</span> Where do the funds 
               <br />
               come from? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">From</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people.</span> If the Governor heard the views of the people, he might, 
               <br />
               perhaps, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">change</span> his views. I ask Hon. Members here, who have lived under Responsible 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iovernment</span> in Great Britain, [Hear, hear, from Mr. DeCosmos] not to be recreant to their 
               <br />
               country. Hon. Members on the other side may say they are against Responsible Government 
               <br />
               and refer to a former House of Assembly of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Vancouver</span> Island. This is no argument. I trust 
               <br />
               that Hon. Members loving British institutions will be true to their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> Because there are 
               <br />
               defects in some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Assemblies,</span> do not let us run into the abject error of saying we are not ﬁt for 
               <br />
               self-government. We have borne this too long. Do not let us hand over to Canada our consent 
               <br />
               to submit to this degradation. Let us not say that we are not lit; that we surrender the 
               <br />
               question of self—government. Who, I ask, has examined the people? Who has tried them and 
               <br />
               discovered whether or not they are-competent to exercise the privileges of Responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern</span> 
               <br />
               ment? There are many points in this clause which demand discussion, but I am not going to 
               <br />
               exhaust myself. I say, however, that the question of Responsible Government must be con- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sidered.</span> I throw the gauntlet down,

               Hon. Mn. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I-IUMI’HRISYS—Mr.</span> Chairman, as mover of the Resolution on Responsible

               Government, I do not think it necessary to take up the time of the House. I am perfectly 
               <br />
               satisﬁed in my own mind that the ofﬁcial members are convinced that the people are in favour 
               <br />
               of Responsible Government. As a student <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> history, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">young</span> as I am, I begin to realize this 
               <br />
               truth: that all liberty and improvement has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> infused into communities by the shock of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revolution.</span> or violent agitation. There is no hope <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of:</span> political improvement in time of tran-

               quillity-and \vithout agitation. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> ofﬁcial members of this Council are remarkable for their 
               <br />
               profound indifference to right and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wrong.</span> It is in their interest to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">postpone</span> the settlement 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> this question of Responsible Government. I hold that there is a great necessity for this

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Resolution.</span> The ques ion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ought</span> to be settled now and for or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> Why should we be com-

               pelled, year <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">after</span> year, iolight those battles for reform over and over again? Let this question 
               <br />
               he settled so that we may have leisure for other things. Hon. gentlemen say the people are not 
               <br />
               in favour of Responsible Government. ’l‘ime will show. I say that they will almost as a unit 
               <br />
               insist upon it, and I lay down this proposition—no Responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government,</span> no Confederation; 
               <br />
               no Confederation, no pensions. Instead of t liteniug the Governmental reins they should be

               for then, in all probability, a mightier nation than Canada will take charge of us. I am in

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">favour</span> of Confederation if it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gives</span> us permanent advantages, not otherwiso. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">We</span> must have a
