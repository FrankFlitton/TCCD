               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government.</span> Do they want it? Doubtless there are those in this House, possibly even in 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unofficial</span> ranks, who will deny that the people of British Columbia really desire to have 
               <br />
               Responsible Government under Confederation. It is sometimes difﬁcult to account for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diver.</span> 
               <br />
               gence of opinion; but I venture to think that I have the weight of both argument and evidence 
               <br />
               on my side when I assert, as I do, that the great body of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people—ecertainly</span> an overwhelming 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inajoritywdo</span> earnestly and intelligently desire that form of government. It is difﬁcult to believe 
               <br />
               that any man who has given due thought to the subject can possibly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hesitate.</span> Look at the 
               <br />
               position this Colony would occupy under Confederation. without the full control of its own 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs-a</span> condition alone attainable by means of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Responsible</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> While the other 
               <br />
               Provinces only surrender Federal questions to the Central Government, we would surrender all. 
               <br />
               While the other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces</span> with which it is proposed to confederate upon equal and equitable 
               <br />
               terms retain the fullest power to manage all Provincial matters, British Columbia would 
               <br />
               surrender that power. Her local as well as her national affairs would virtually be managed 
               <br />
               at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ottawa.</span> Could a union so unequal be a happy and enduring one? The compact we are 
               <br />
               about to form is for life. Shall we take into it the germ of discord and disruption? The 
               <br />
               people desire change; but they have no desire to exchange the Imperial heel for the Canadian 
               <br />
               heel. They desire political <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">manumission.</span> I stand here, and, in the name of my ancestors, 
               <br />
               protest before Heaven <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> the surrender of constitutional <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rights</span> purchased by the best 
               <br />
               blood of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">racema</span> priceless legacy we have no right to barter away, even if we would. We 
               <br />
               owe it to our ancestors to preserve entire those rights which they have delivered to our care. 
               <br />
               We owe it to posterity not to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sulfer</span> their dearest inheritance to be destroyed But, if it were 
               <br />
               possible for us to be insensible of these sacred claims, there is yet an obligation binding upon 
               <br />
               ourselves, from which nothing can acquit us; a personal interest which we cannot surrender. 
               <br />
               To alienate even our own rights would he a crime as much more enormous than suicide, as a 
               <br />
               life of civil security and political freedom is superior to a condition of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘serfdom;</span> and if life be 
               <br />
               the bounty of Heaven, we scornfully reject the noblest part of the gift if we consent to surrender 
               <br />
               that certain rule of living, and those constitutional rights, without which the condition of human 
               <br />
               nature is not only miserable but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contemptible.</span> I know but too well that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> people of this 
               <br />
               Colony have, during these years past, been unjustly and imconstitutionally deprived of their 
               <br />
               rights; but the perpetration of a wrong in the past can constitute no argument for perpetrating 
               <br />
               that wrong in the future; and it would appear a most ﬁtting moment, when a new constitution 
               <br />
               is about to be offered, to demand the full restoration of political rights of which we have been 
               <br />
               for some time so unjustly deprived. A word about the constitution which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Governor proposes 
               <br />
               to confer upon this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colony.</span> Regarding it in the dim light shed upon it by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Executive,</span> it 
               <br />
               is not unfair to assume that there will be one more popular Member taken into the Executive, 
               <br />
               and that the people will have a majority of two in the Legislature. Let us suppose that the 
               <br />
               Legislative Council has 20 Members, 11 elected by the people and 9 appointed by the Governor. 
               <br />
               Three are taken from the 11 into the mysterious chamber of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Executive,</span> where they become 
               <br />
               —I will not say <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">corrnpted~manipulated;</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">educated</span> to see things somewhat differently from what 
               <br />
               they saw them before. In a House so constituted, is it unfair, is it uncharitable to conclude 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">r</span> that, on all Government measures at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">least,</span> the Government would command a majority? Take 
               <br />
               3 from 11, and 8 remain. Take 8 from 20, and how many remain to the Government? Is 
               <br />
               it not 12? Where, then, is the people’s majority under the proposed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constitution?</span> And yet I 
               <br />
               am <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constantly</span> told that this is not the proper time <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> ask for Responsible Govermnent—that 
               <br />
               il’ the people want it they will possess. under the new constitution, the ready means <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> obtaining 
               <br />
               it. Sir. I do not see the matter in that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">light,</span> I see in the proposed constitution a condition of 
               <br />
               things which promises a ﬁve years', possibly a ten years‘, agitation for what the people are 
               <br />
               prepared for now, desire now, are entitled to now. All Governments are naturally conservative. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">All</span> persons holding positions of honour, power. or emolument, are conservative. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rL‘hlnk</span> you 
               <br />
               those holding <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">office</span> by appointment will favour or promote a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">change</span> which would make them 
               <br />
               responsible to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people—exchange</span> their commission from the Crown for the more brittle

               <br />
               people in their struggle for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Responsible</span> Government; and how long the struggle might last, it 
               <br />
               would be idle to predict. Besides, the people of Canada do not desire to see British Columbia 
               <br />
               occupying any such false position. They know too well the value 01‘ l'ree institutions, and their
