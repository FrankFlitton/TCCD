               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> debate was resumed by the Hon. Mu. TRUTCII, Chief Commissioner of Lands and 
               <br />
               Works, who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">saith—Mr.</span> President, in rising to renew the debate on the question which has 
               <br />
               been brought before the House by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Honourable</span> the Attorliey~General. I desu‘e to express 
               <br />
               my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regret</span> that I was prevented yesterday, by indisposition, from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speaking</span> in support of the 
               <br />
               motion which I had the honour to second, because I fear that by the delay I may have laid 
               <br />
               myself. open to the charge of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">waiting</span> to reply to objections that might be urged against this 
               <br />
               motion, instead of at once supporting it upon positive and substantial grounds, as I hold it to 
               <br />
               be incumbent on those to do who advocate so important a measure. I must also ask the 
               <br />
               indulgence of the House if I ﬁnd it necessary to follow the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Honourable</span> the Attorney-General over 
               <br />
               ground already so fully and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ably</span> occupied by him, as, rather than leave out anything in the 
               <br />
               history of this question which is pertinent to my argument, I will run the risk of laying myself 
               <br />
               open to the charge of plagiarism. In the ﬁrst place, then, I must <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ask</span> you, Sir, to allow me 
               <br />
               to trace the history of Confederation in this Council, as shown in the debates which have taken 
               <br />
               place on the Slibject. You will ﬁnd, Sir, that this subject was ﬁrst introduced into this‘Council 
               <br />
               on the 29th of March, 1867, when a Resolution in favour of the abstract principle of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Con“</span> 
               <br />
               federation of the British Provinces in North America, and expressing the desire that this Colony 
               <br />
               should be allowed the opportunity of entering the Dominion upon fair and equitable terms, 
               <br />
               at some future time, was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unanimously</span> agreed to. 1 do not quite take the View of the Honourable 
               <br />
               the Attorney-General with respect to the discussions that have taken place on this question; 
               <br />
               for, Sir, I think that the question is now for the first time brought before this House and the 
               <br />
               country in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> practical shape, for a full and deliberate expression of opinion. The vote which 
               <br />
               was taken in 1867, according to my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">understanding</span> of it at that time, went no further <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">than</span> 
               <br />
               to express a desire on the part of the Colony to be confederated with Canada, when a favourable 
               <br />
               occasion should arrive, and the result of that vote was, I believe, the insertion of the clause in 
               <br />
               the “British North America Act,” on which the measure we are now discussing is based. Again, 
               <br />
               in 1868, when the Honourable Member for District <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">No.</span> 2 introduced a series of Resolutions 
               <br />
               setting forth terms on which this Colony should be united with Canada, the sense of the House, 
               <br />
               as then expressed, was that we were not possessed of sufﬁcient information to enable us to 
               <br />
               come to any practical resolution on the subject; and, Sir, when the terms and conditions then 
               <br />
               proposed for the consideration of the House are compared with those now submitted for your 
               <br />
               adoption, no words are needed to show that the conclusion then arrived at was judicious. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Last:</span> year. again, the subject was introduced by the Hon. Dr. Davie, to a reluctant House. 
               <br />
               We all felt that there were circumstances which rendered its discussion then in this Council 
               <br />
               inexpedient, although the question of Confederation was even then occupying public attention 
               <br />
               to an absorbing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extent,</span> and had in fact been the test question at the elections a short time 
               <br />
               previously in the Districts in this part of the Colony. But certain remarks of the Honourable 
               <br />
               Member for Cariboo, in reference to the position of Government Members on this question, 
               <br />
               compelled the expression of the views of the Council on the subject at that time, in a Resolution 
               <br />
               pointing out the practical impossibil‘ of the union of this Colony with Canada, until the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-</span> 
               <br />
               West Territory was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amalgamated</span> with the Dominion. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               But now circumstances are entirely changed. The Hudson <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Bay</span> Company’s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rights</span> in that 
               <br />
               region, known as the North-West Territory, are determined by purchase, and that country is 
               <br />
               practically part of the Dominion of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada;</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> the temporary opposition from a certain class 
               <br />
               of the population of the Red River Settlement, to the assumption of the Government by the 
               <br />
               Canadian authorities, is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">passing</span> away, if not by the present moment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">virtually</span> at an end. And 
               <br />
               treating that ebullition of feeling resulting from misapprehension of the real intention of the 
               <br />
               Dominion Government as passed away, I regard it as an established fact that, as stated in Lord 
               <br />
               Granville’s despatch, our boundaries are now conterminous with those of Canada. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               But not only is Union with Canada now practicable, but, Sir, I regard the present as a most 
               <br />
               opportune moment for its consummation. I entirely agree with Honourable Members who say 
               <br />
               that this Colony requires a change. In its present depressed state, the Colony needs assistance 
               <br />
               and fresh <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">impetus,</span> There are many causes which combine to contribute to the depression now 
               <br />
               observable in the country. It has been attributed to the present form of Government. Take 
               <br />
               that as one cause, if you please; but, Sir, I believe it has had very little effect, if any, in pro-
