               If we could believe that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> of the Dominion were composed of men of so 
               <br />
               little wisdom as the opponents of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> seem to think, I would say, do not let us join 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them.</span> But I believe, Sir, and the Imperial Government believes, and British Columbia believes, 
               <br />
               that the Government of the Dominion is composed of statesmen. And I say, Sir, that since 
               <br />
               these statesmen have grasped the great idea of Confederation, they have proved themselves 
               <br />
               ﬁt to govern an empire. I am surprised to ﬁnd any Honourable Member venturing to suggest 
               <br />
               that Canada either could not, or would not, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fulﬁl</span> her pledges. The Dominion Government is 
               <br />
               one and the same in this matter with the Imperial Government. The Imperial Government 
               <br />
               stands at the hack of the Dominion Government, and will be equally concerned in the fulﬁlment 
               <br />
               of the stipulations in their integrity. It will be time to impugn the honour of Canada when she 
               <br />
               refuses to keep the terms. With regard to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nova</span> Scotia, a departure was made from the terms 
               <br />
               of union. The Imperial Government, and the Canadian Government, considered that certain 
               <br />
               concessions ought to be made, and they were made, but only to add to the terms in favour of 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia. British Columbia places herself in a false position before Canada, and before 
               <br />
               the world, in saying that there is any doubt as to whether the Dominion would fulﬁl the 
               <br />
               terms 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               With regard, again, to the tariff. I think that the only arguments against Confederation 
               <br />
               worthy of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consideration,</span> are against the present Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Tariff.</span> The Customs Tariff is a 
               <br />
               federal matter, and I confess that the arguments against the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">applicability</span> of the present scale <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> 
               <br />
               to British Columbia are entitled to notice; but, Sir, as I said before, I think these arguments <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">',</span> 
               <br />
               are to a great extent met by the fact that we shall have an amended <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariff,</span> or a reciprocity <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"</span> 
               <br />
               treaty. But if we could hit upon some scheme that, Without infringing the Dominion preroga- _ 
               <br />
               tives, would meet our requirements, it would be most desirable, and shall have my hearty <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">L</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               In conclusion, Sir, the Government measure shall meet with my hearty support, so far as - 
               <br />
               it goes. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               It affords me unpseakahle gratiﬁcation to find that Government has sent down a measure <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span> 
               <br />
               for Confederation which can hardly be cavllled at. '

               While feeling pleasure in giving a hearty general support to this measure, I shall reserve

               I believe there are terms of the greatest importance <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Which</span> ought to be added. But anything 
               <br />
               that can be added will not meet the wishes of the people of this Colony, unless the fundamental 
               <br />
               principle of self—government accompanies them. I believe that the Canadians are a great, a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wise,</span> and a conservative people; but I conceive we should be doing a great wrong to ourselves, _ 
               <br />
               to our children, and to those who are to come after <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us,</span> if we left out Responsible Government.

               Suppose, Sir, the case of three persons forming a partnership; lf the third partner, coming

               <br />
               he would not only be giving up his own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rights,</span> but he would be throwing into the partnership 
               <br />
               a great element of discord. I say, then, that while <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(‘Ianada</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessarily</span> and properly asks us
