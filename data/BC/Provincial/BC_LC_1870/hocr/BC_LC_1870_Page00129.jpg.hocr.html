               <br />
               with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span> to provision being made to protect the agricultural produce of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colony.</span> It has 
               <br />
               been said by the honourable Executive Member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> Victoria City that this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differential</span> tariff is 
               <br />
               quite a new thing to me. If he will take the trouble to refer to the Colonist of the 15th May, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1868,</span> he will ﬁnd <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> in an article written by in clf I touched on this matter; it is not new to 
               <br />
               me. I am thoroughly persuaded that the disti ct which I represent will he a unit against Con- 
               <br />
               federation without a provision to keep up <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">protection,</span> From Comox to Soohe the opinion on this 
               <br />
               point is as that of one man, and I believe I inaysay that it is the same thing as regards the whole 
               <br />
               of the agricultural districts on the Mainland, from Soda Creek to Kamloops. I hold, with respect 
               <br />
               to protection, that when farmers shall be able to produce farm produce in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sufficient</span> quantity to 
               <br />
               enable them to reduce their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prices</span> as low as the prices obtained by the f- 'niers of Oregon and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Washington</span> Territory; then protection is not essential, for this great and sufﬁcient reason that if 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">produce</span> as good an article at home as we can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">get</span> abroad, which we can put down at the 
               <br />
               same price, the cost <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> transport will be a sullicient protection. Our farmers will have a natural 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">protection.</span> With regard to manufactures, I am one of those who believe that our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">manufactures</span> 
               <br />
               ought to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">protected.</span> If we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">go</span> iulo public works we must have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">waggons</span> and machinery. and the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">waggon-buildcrs</span> should have protection; then, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">again,</span> t’ rming implements should be made in the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colony,</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">encouragement</span> should be given to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">manufacturer</span> of these things Again, there are 
               <br />
               the bootmakcr and tailor, and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">soapinalicr</span> and others, even the brewer, for whom we require
