               means <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pickings,</span> ofﬁce. place, and power. This will be represented, I am well aware, as being 
               <br />
               the result of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">being</span> in the Executive Council. It is said that there is a great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> between

               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">atmosphere</span> of the two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Councils,</span> I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">acknowledge</span> it. There. with closed doors, people speak 
               <br />
               the truth, without any ad <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">caplmldmu</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arguments</span> addressed to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">galleries,</span> There people can

               Member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\‘ew</span> Westminster in his able speech erected a very handsome structure, but, like

               most fancy structures, it will be a very expensive <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one,</span> He <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wants</span> a Government like Ontario; 
               <br />
               that is a Government of one House, with eighty members. For a Government of that kind not 
               <br />
               less than forty or ﬁfty would be absolutely necessary.

               lion. Mu. ROBSON—I never said like that of Ontario. but that we wanted the principle

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon,</span> Mn. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l’lELMCKI‘lN—Then</span> why not bring in a scheme embodying it? The true <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prin‘</span> 
               <br />
               ciples of Responsible Government can only exist satisfactorily with forty or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">liﬁty</span> members in 
               <br />
               the House. It would cost very little short of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$20000</span> per annum. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">That,</span> out <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oi?</span> the very small 
               <br />
               amount we are to get from Canada, would reduce the amount likely to be available for public 
               <br />
               works to a fraction. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">You</span> must have a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">large</span> number to work Responsible Government, or, 
               <br />
               more properly speaking. party government. If ve are to have it. I would not have the heads 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">departments</span> responsible to the people; at least not the working heads. If any head of a 
               <br />
               department is to be responsible to the people, let it be the political head; but I would make 
               <br />
               the working heads permanent. I have found, from my experience of the old Vancouver House 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Assembly,</span> that policy frequently changes and turns <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">round,</span> The same thing would happen 
               <br />
               under Responsible Government. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">11?</span> I wished to oppose Confederation, I believe that I could 
               <br />
               not do a better thing towards effecting my object than to vote for Responsible Government; 
               <br />
               but I want to see the more material wants advanced by Confederation. I know that material 
               <br />
               interests were not the pivot, but that is was place, patronage, and oiﬁce that .was wanted. 
               <br />
               With <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span> to the present system of Government, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it'is</span> very easy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'to</span> say that it is bad, but 
               <br />
               I have listened to all the speeches and have not heard one word of practical fault-finding with 
               <br />
               the present Goverinnent—merely the assumption that the people desire change. This desire 
               <br />
               for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">change</span> they have been educated to. I acknowledge many faults in the past, but we have 
               <br />
               now a new Executive, and we are promised a change in the form of Government; but this is 
               <br />
               apart from Confederation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">altogether,</span> lt appear to me that the ﬁrst thing we have to arrange 
               <br />
               is the money question; to get our material inter ,ts first settled; to make sure that this Colony 
               <br />
               should be pecuniarlly better off; to make the question of Confederation now turn upon 
               <br />
               material interest. and not allow our material interests to be jeopardized by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«a</span> cry for Respon- 
               <br />
               sible Government; not to allow <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Responsible</span> Government to be the sauce to make the public 
               <br />
               swallow bad and unproﬁtable terms. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">All</span> Members have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">acknowledged</span> that “money” is the 
               <br />
               ba s or all Govermnents; let us get that money. I would not have the public vote for 
               <br />
               Responsible Government and forget or put in the background the money. Place the question 
               <br />
               upon material terms and the Colony will demand profitable terms; but mix it up with Respon- 
               <br />
               sible Government and you got a divided opinion upon it. and those who think Responsible 
               <br />
               Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">everythiiw</span> will vote for that to the exclusion of any terms. or, at all events, 
               <br />
               with unproﬁtable terms. There <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are.</span> doubtless. many who hope to live upon Responsible Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment; but, Sir, Responsible Government is not food and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">roiment,</span> The people can live 
               <br />
               without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Responsible</span> Government. but they cannot live upon it. Give them food and raiment 
               <br />
               ﬁrst; the rest will follow in natural succession. These few words will give you my reasons for 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consenting</span> to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arrangement</span> proposed in the conditions. More than this, I am not pledged to 
               <br />
               It ponsible Government, but I am pledged to representative institutions. The latter have been 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">granted;</span> my mission thus <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> is fulﬁlled. l have always asserted that we must take our steps 
               <br />
               to Responsible Government gradually. Having representative institutions, we can go on to the 
               <br />
               other. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">No</span> one ever stated that the people were unﬁt to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern</span> themselves; all acknowledge 
               <br />
               that they have talent enough. But this I do assert, that thus far the people have shown an 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unwillingness</span> to govern <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">themselves—"have'taken</span> but little interest in the matter. It is not 
               <br />
               that they are unfit, but unwilling. They prefer looking <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">after</span> their own business; it pays them
