               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">charisma</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sentiments</span> of the heart, and I regard loyalty as one of the most deep-rooted and_ 
               <br />
               highly prized treasures of the human <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">breast.</span> [“ Hear, hear,” from all sides]

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Bear with me, Sir, while I tell you now what I think <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not.</span> I don’t think 
               <br />
               it necessarily means Responsible Government, or, as an Honourable Member at the other end 
               <br />
               of the House has put it, that it means getting rid of Government Oﬂ'lcials. If that Honourable 
               <br />
               Member’s desire is to be rid of the present incumbents of ofﬁce so that others may take their 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">place,</span> I think it probable that his wishes in this respect may be gratiﬁed through Confederation; 
               <br />
               and in that case I could only hope <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the change would be beneficial to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colony,</span> But I 
               <br />
               doubt much if this measure would receive support from this Council on these grounds; and at 
               <br />
               all events the Honourable Gentleman cannot expect much sympathy on that score from this side 
               <br />
               of the House. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Again, Confederation does not, to my mind, mean Responsible Government, as some Honour- 
               <br />
               able Members hold. British Columbia will assuredly get Responsible Government as soon as 
               <br />
               the proper time arrives, as soon, that is to say, as the community is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sufﬁciently</span> advanced in 
               <br />
               population, and in other respects, to render such a form of Government practically workable; 
               <br />
               sooner, probably, through Confederation than by any other means, and the sooner the better, I 
               <br />
               say. But I do not think it desirable to fetter or cumber the proposed terms of union with 
               <br />
               anything about Responsible Gavernment, and specially for the reason that we should ﬁnd it 
               <br />
               very difﬁcult to arrive at any conclusion in favour of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> Great ditference of opinion exists 
               <br />
               upon' the subject even around this Council Board, and I am by no means sure that the strongest 
               <br />
               opposition to Responsible Government would come from the Government side of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House.</span> It 
               <br />
               is easier to change the constitution after Confederation than before. [“No, no."] Under the 
               <br />
               Organic Act, this Colony could get Responsible Government. In fact, it is the special prerogative 
               <br />
               under this Act of each Province to regulate the constitution of its own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Executive</span> Government 
               <br />
               and Legislature; and whence this desire <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> act so prematurely now in this respect? 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Another Honourable Member has told you that in his opinion Confederation means the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terms~means</span> a Railway; but I take it, Sir, that the terms proposed result from Confederation, 
               <br />
               and that the Railway is a means to the end, for we cannot have real Confederation without 21 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway,</span> But, Sir, I advocate Confederation on principle; and I belleve the terms to be the 
               <br />
               natural result of Confederation. They ﬂow from it as a natural consequence, as the effect 
               <br />
               proceeds from the cause. I believe that by Confederation we are to gain those advantages 
               <br />
               which are set forth in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terms,</span> 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               If it could be shown that by acceptance of these terms we should in any way sacriﬁce our

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">brought</span> a dozen railroads. But I believe that each member of this community will be raised 
               <br />
               by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">change,</span> We shall have a distinct and very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respectable</span> representation in the House of 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               be a favoured portion of the Confederation, when <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">admitted.</span> on account of its position as the
