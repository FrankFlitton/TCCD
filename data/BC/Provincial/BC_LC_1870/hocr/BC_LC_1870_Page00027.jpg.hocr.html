               The question has always appeared to me to be this :—Cont‘ederaiion with England, which 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> have; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> in its truest sense; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> with all the security of protection,

               and all the pride of self-government, now or hereafter to be, when the Colony shall have

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population</span> and wealth sufﬁcient: or Confederation—or, as it should be termed, “ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Incorporation</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">”-—~</span> 
               <br />
               with Canada. Incorporation with a country to which we are bound by no natural tie of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affection</span> 
               <br />
               or duty, and remote in geographical position, and opposed to us in material interests Incor-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">poration</span> with all the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">humiliation</span> of dependence, and to my mind the certainty of reaction, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agitation,</span> and discontent. Canada can never become the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tossiyucc,</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nﬁi’ciul</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assigned,</span> the 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ency</span> and the Mother Country. I am opposed to the political extinction of this Colony, and 
               <br />
               its subservience to the will of a majority of the House of Commons at Ottawa, and the admin- 
               <br />
               istration of its affairs by the political adherents of Canadian statesmen. And all this for 
               <br />
               what? For “material beneﬁts,” for a money consideration, in which the ring of the dollar 
               <br />
               only faintly conceals the clink of the fetter. I am grieved at the mode in which the change 
               <br />
               is sought to be effected, and View the bargain and sale of political independence for ourselves 
               <br />
               and our descendants for a few dollars in hand, and a few dollars in the future, as equally 
               <br />
               shameful and void. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span>

               <br />
               the last twelve years—ever since I have been engaged in politics in the Colony. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[Hon</span> Registrar'-

               <br />
               not made a Nation yet. I need only, in reply, quote for his enlightenment the old adage “ Rome

               ever had one end in view. I have seen three Colonies united on the Pacific Coast. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hon.</span> Mr.

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I'Ie'lmchenu“Three?”]</span> Yes, three: Stehin, British Columbia, and Vancouver Island; and if

               I had had my way, instead of the United States owning Alaska, it would have been British 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today.</span> I have advocated the union of those three Colonies, and in the union of two of them 
               <br />
               particularly I have taken a prominent part. For many years I have regarded the union of 
               <br />
               the British Paciﬁc Territories, and of their consolidation under one Government, as one of the 
               <br />
               steps preliminary to the grand consolidation of the Britile Empire in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North</span> America. I still 
               <br />
               look upon it in this light with the pride and feeling of a native~horn British American. From 
               <br />
               the time when I ﬁrst mastered the institutes of physical and political geography I could see 
               <br />
               Vancouver Island on the Paciﬁc. from my home on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Atlantic;</span> and I could see a time when 
               <br />
               the British Possessions, from the United States boundary to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:</span> tic Ocean, and extending 
               <br />
               from the Atlantic to the Pacific, would be consolidated into one great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">i</span> ation.

               Sir, my political course has been unlike that of most others in this Colony. Allow me to 
               <br />
               illustrate my meaning by the use of another old <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">adage.</span> My course has been that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> “ heating

               We are here, Sir, laying the corner stone of a great Nation on the Paciﬁc Coast. When

               have been produced by violenco, and extended their empire by conquest. But we are engaged 
               <br />
               in building up a great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sation</span> in the noon-day light of the nineteenth century, not by violence, 
               <br />
               not by wrong, but I hope, Sir, by the exercise of that common sense which the Honourable 
               <br />
               gentleman who preceded me called statesmanship.
