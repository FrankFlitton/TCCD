               impossible to approach the subject without feeling <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">its</span> vital importance; and I think it would 
               <br />
               tax our united will and energy to their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">utmost</span> limits, if we had the power to frame a tariff 
               <br />
               which would be suitable; therefore, I see, wisely, in all the Resolutions a wide <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">generality.</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Upon</span> this question of tariff we must especially avoid attempting to commit the Dominion 
               <br />
               Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fixed</span> principle. The tariff cannot be part of the terms, but it is. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">undoubt»</span> 
               <br />
               edly. a matter of consideration to be urged on the Canadian Government. Though we have 
               <br />
               assented to the Organic Act. we have not shut ourselves out from going to the Dominion 
               <br />
               Parliament to ask for remedies which they can give to us, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:to</span> as]; them to find a remedy 
               <br />
               which will make <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> acceptable ‘to this Colony. Therefore. I think, with the Honour- 
               <br />
               able Chief Commissioner, that one general Resolution upon this subject, after dealing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with.</span> 
               <br />
               the three <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">separate</span> Resolutions or abstract principles, may, with advantage, be passed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«by</span> this 
               <br />
               House. I think also, with that honourable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Chairman, that Canadian statesmen 
               <br />
               who will have to deal with this matter. will do so with wisdom. They, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">considering</span> the 
               <br />
               terms when other Provinces have entered the Confederation, must have experienced some of 
               <br />
               these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculties</span> which now come to us for the first time. No doubt many <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">honourable</span> members 
               <br />
               of this House have given great consideration to this question. yet I think that Canadian 
               <br />
               experience will help us. Much has been said on free port—much for and against. My own 
               <br />
               tendencies, since first I had a seat on this floor, in another <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Assembly,</span> have been in favour of 
               <br />
               free port. I voted for it then, but I feel that I am obliged to vote against it now. The 
               <br />
               Imperial Government will not sanction anything which is in effect <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">avdiiferential</span> duty in the 
               <br />
               same tariff; but this is distinct from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span> of a separate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariff</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> British Columbia. 
               <br />
               Other considerations will naturally strike Canada, and I think if free port was made a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sine</span> qua 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">non</span> she would refuse Confederation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">altogether.</span> as she would not like to run the risk of entering 
               <br />
               into difﬁculties and disputes of a ﬁscal character with her great and powerful neighbour. which 
               <br />
               might possibly arise out of smuggling. Another <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂ’iculty</span> in dealing with this matter that we 
               <br />
               have to encounter is, that we have intorniation that a reconstruction of the Canadian tariff is 
               <br />
               at present going on, and there is some chance of a reciprocity treaty being arranged, therefore 
               <br />
               we cannot put forward any ﬁxed principles. The main objections of the Dominion to a separate 
               <br />
               tariff, it strikes me, will be found to be: ﬁrst, that they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> afraid of infringing principle: and, 
               <br />
               second, the formation of a precedent for a special <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tarili",</span> which might cause <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland,</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> Brunswick, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Xova</span> Scotia, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">other</span> Provinces to ask for special tariffs to suit their par~ 
               <br />
               ticular <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">circumstances,</span> and to avoid the inconvenience of possible hostile tariffs. There are 
               <br />
               certainly many plausible reasons to be found in favour of a special tariff for British Columbia. 
               <br />
               Such as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difficulty</span> of communication. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(the</span> want of either road or railway, and the security 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> smuggling into Canada. But the probability is, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> protection to commerce would be 
               <br />
               secured by the reconstruction of the Canadian tariff, and I regard the framing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> a tariff now 
               <br />
               which would apply satisfactor‘ ' to our altered circumstances, under such a thorough change as 
               <br />
               Confederation would bring, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span> a matter of impossibility. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Formerly,</span> when there was a free 
               <br />
               port at Victoria. it was always in danger, and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Senior Member for Victoria City, 
               <br />
               then the Speaker of the Vancouver Island House of Assembly, was always afraid of. every 
               <br />
               little impost on stock or produce lest it should infringe upon the principle of free trade. and at 
               <br />
               last it w so loaded with dues and charges that before the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Union</span> the principle of free port 
               <br />
               was destroyed. But I see no reason <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">why,</span> when we are going into a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">partnership,</span> we should 
               <br />
               not arrange the best terms we can; and I think that the differences could be altered in 
               <br />
               favour of this Colony. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">favour</span> of Confederation generally. We have no power <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ourselves;</span> 
               <br />
               that is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reason</span> this question is not brought up in the terms. We must see what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eltect</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Union</span> will have on this Colony <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">first;</span> we must see how the thing works before we decide 
               <br />
               finally. At the same time. we must take care that we protect such important interests as 
               <br />
               agriculture and commerce from haste or injurious delay. I will, therefore, as soon as the 
               <br />
               terms are settled. propose a resolution which will meet this difﬁculty and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,,</span> c time to see 
               <br />
               what change. if any, the country <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may</span> require. In sending our resolutions to the Canadian 
               <br />
               Government, we must not suppose that we have exhausted the subject. Many points must 
               <br />
               arise when the Canadian Commissioners come here, or ours go there—if the matter take that 
               <br />
               turn; but we should be careful not to overload the terms, lest we should endanger the cause 
               <br />
               of Confederation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">altogether.</span> We must have some faith in the Dominion Government—in 
               <br />
               Canada and Canadian stalteslnen. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">We</span> must not forget that their own interests would be ours. 
               <br />
               I say nothing with regard to the latter part of the resolution of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Member for Victoria
