               Hon. MR, DECOSMOS—I have said indeﬁnitely—possibly for ten or twelve <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years.</span> We may 
               <br />
               have the Railway completed by that time. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Mr. Wood put the question properly. 
               <br />
               The tariif is a thing that is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">changeable—it</span> rises and falls. Suppose that Canada has to raise six 
               <br />
               millions for a guarantee for the Railway, they might have to raise the tariff. I think the tariff 
               <br />
               will probably rise for a long time. But this is aside the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">issue.</span> My object in making this propo- 
               <br />
               sition is to prevent clashing between our Local Government and the Dominion. I include produce 
               <br />
               in my rccommendation,—which means stock, cereals, and vegetables. If a provision of that sort 
               <br />
               were added we would be in a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">position</span> to get 11 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">certain</span> degree of protection, and the largest 
               <br />
               interest, that is the agricultural interest, would be satisﬁed. But I maintain that beyond this we 
               <br />
               ought to protect certain rude manufactures; and in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">goingr</span> into the Dominion we should go with 
               <br />
               as little friction as possible; there must be some friction, but we must keep things as smooth as 
               <br />
               possible. There will he, as I have said before, a revolution in labour and value. Now, we do 
               <br />
               not want too much protection. Let our agricultural interests be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisﬁed,</span> and if those engaged 
               <br />
               in rude manufactures are protected the people will ‘be satisﬁed. There are also a class engaged 
               <br />
               in trade who believe in protection; you will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">find</span> them the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agricultural</span> interest, the manufacturing 
               <br />
               interest, and believers in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">protection.</span> who will form a strong band of opponents to Confederation. 
               <br />
               Take away this subject of friction and you have the whole thing easier. If they are not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con-</span> 
               <br />
               sidered there will be opposition before <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation,</span> and more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">other.</span> If Hon. Members desire 
               <br />
               to keep up a feeling of loyalty towards Canada after Confederation, they will protect these 
               <br />
               interests. With respect to the Hon. Member for New Westminster, his argument is no stronger 
               <br />
               than his weakest point, which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is—[I—Ion,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Dr.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Helmckenwl-Iis</span> resolution]. Well. perhaps this is 
               <br />
               the weak point. He admits the whole point. 1 do not intend to follow the Hon. Member. I 
               <br />
               ask the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon,</span> Members to consider this question so as to consider industries and manufactures, 
               <br />
               so that the union may he lasting. 1 hope <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">both</span> sides will unite heartily in shaping our institutions 
               <br />
               with this end in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">View.</span> 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Hon. MR. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">RINGwlir.</span> Chairman, I only desire to drop a few hints. I say that the Organic 
               <br />
               Act is wholly inapplicable to this Colony. Does the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Member for New Westminster mean 
               <br />
               to hand us over under this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Organic</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> to swell the coffers of the Dominion? I hail any 
               <br />
               approach to free trade; I believe in it; free trade should have as free a course as the wind. 
               <br />
               Now, Sir, with regard to what has been said about protection to commerce; there are natural 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">artificial</span> protections. I am for protecting the farmer by natural protections. Any attempt 
               <br />
               to shut out the surplus produce of another country must fail. The attempt to protect: farmers 
               <br />
               by imposing a tax on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">flour</span> and such articles, is a mistake. Any protection beyond harbour and 
               <br />
               pilot dues is a vicious system. Then, say others: free port is abolished, would you go back to 
               <br />
               direct taxation? I say, how can we ascertain what the people can pay by taxing income and 
               <br />
               property. The revenue would be smaller, but it is not ﬁctitious. We must curtail expenditure, 
               <br />
               and having done so, I would abolish customs altogether as a source of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revenue,</span> 1 agree entirely 
               <br />
               with the proposition of the Hon. Member for New Westminster, that the tariff of the Dominion 
               <br />
               is a Federal matter. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Hon. MR. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">IIIIMI’Hl’tEYSer.</span> Chairman. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1</span> rise to support the recommendation of the 
               <br />
               Hon. Member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Victoria</span> District. I have, listened carefully to the lofty arguments of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> appointees on this question, It appears to me that the mistakes which the English 
               <br />
               generally make are attributable to their reading and studying great English writers too much, 
               <br />
               instead of considering what is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">practically</span> applicable to a new country. Old countries are, in 
               <br />
               this respect, very differeth to new. Free trade may suit England and other old countries, whilst 
               <br />
               it may act very perniciously in a new one. Even in old countries a large proportion of the 
               <br />
               people whom free trade is calculated to beneﬁt are against it. But in new countries protection 
               <br />
               is absolutely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessary.</span> It is said by some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> gentlemen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the farming interests in the 
               <br />
               upper country needed no greater protection than nature <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hall</span> given them. I can mention an 
               <br />
               instance to the contrary. Flour was imported last year from California and sold in Cariboo 
               <br />
               at prices with which the upper country farmers could not compete, There ought to be some 
               <br />
               way of protecting the upper country farmers without clashing with the interests of the 
               <br />
               Dominion. I think it but just and right to protect the farmers above all other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interests.</span> I 
               <br />
               look upon this question as next to Responsible Government, and that I regard as the most 
               <br />
               important question in the Resolutions which are before the Council; all others sink into 
               <br />
               insignificance besides <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> two conditions.
