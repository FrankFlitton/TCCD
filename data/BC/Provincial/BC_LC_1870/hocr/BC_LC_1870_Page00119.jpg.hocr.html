               <br />
               hardly exists. it is true. It is an injustice to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">presume</span> for a moment that the Colonist in this, 
               <br />
               or any other Colony of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Anglos</span> xon origin. is in any way unﬁt for the enjoyment of the freest

               <br />
               enterprising and more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pushing</span> than the stay-at-home Englishman. He has better knowledge 
               <br />
               of the world and of human nature; he graduates in a school in which politics are prominent, 
               <br />
               and he is free from an immense amount of ignorance and prejudice which is thought and 
               <br />
               written and acted in the Old World. But then comes the consideration, what elements are 
               <br />
               indispensable in the community to form the representative body, if, as is contended, that 
               <br />
               element is to be supreme; or, what is the same thing in point of actual power, when that 
               <br />
               element constitutes the working majority? I will answer: (1) Localized and permanent 
               <br />
               population. {2) Established diversified interests; wealth, whether capital or regular income, 
               <br />
               the well—doing of professions, busine es and industries, agriculture, substantial industries, 
               <br />
               staples. Population herein we are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deﬁcient—6.500</span> adult white <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">menmsporadic,</span> scattered, and 
               <br />
               temporary. How many care to vote? How many are aliens? Established interests here also 
               <br />
               are deficient; isolation our drawback; staples we have, but they are undeveloped or unlucky; 
               <br />
               gold <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mining:</span> depressed; agriculture under a disadvantage, and no good market; coal not much 
               <br />
               sought after, and minerals a speculation; lumber unfortunate; ﬁsheries unestablished, and 
               <br />
               commerce in the way of export killed by the abolition of the free port, or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interior</span> from the 
               <br />
               absence of a large home <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">demand.</span> These are all our material elements of wealth, and we have 
               <br />
               them in no great abundance. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> without them, what have we? A sparse community, in 
               <br />
               which the only thriving interest is agriculture, and that only because supply is not equal to 
               <br />
               demand; or, in other words. small in numbers and importance, and no wealthy class at all. 
               <br />
               Can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self-government</span> be trusted to such a population? I say emphatically no! Now, I am 
               <br />
               not greatly in favour of a high qualiﬁcation for representatives—fm' Members of the Council. 
               <br />
               It is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sufﬁcient</span> for me that they represent substantial interests; but when we have unsubstan- 
               <br />
               tial representatives representing unsubstantial and small constituencies, I can hardly under- 
               <br />
               stand anything more dangerous, and, I might add, more ridiculous or more extravagant. That 
               <br />
               representatives should be substantial people is desirable, but that they should represent sub- 
               <br />
               stantial interests is indispensable. if representatives are unfaithful to their trust the remedy 
               <br />
               is possible; but where the class of electors is needy and unsubstantial, it seems impossible to 
               <br />
               conceive anything more disastrous. Taxation, as before has been observed, is the cream of 
               <br />
               legislation; and taxation at the hands of unsubstantial men, or men forced to advocate the 
               <br />
               interests of unsubstantial constituencies, will be nothing but tyranny. Opinions may be divided 
               <br />
               in many other matters; the votes of a party may be split on many points; but in the hands 
               <br />
               of the masses the substantial class will be heavily and unmeasurably taxed to suit the views 
               <br />
               of those who have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nothing</span> to lose and all to gain by any contemplated movement. Take the 
               <br />
               example of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Vancouver</span> Island in old days as an example of a small and a narrow community; 
               <br />
               again, the example of Victoria, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Australia,</span> where legislation is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">elfected</span> by the enormous 
               <br />
               majority of the advocates of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inter-e</span> ts of constituents elected on a low qualiﬁcation,— 
               <br />
               manhood suffrage. 1 cannot but understand that if the Government is in the hands of the 
               <br />
               representatives of the people. and a working majority of them. supreme representative Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, if not equivalent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«to,</span> is, in el’l’cct, equal to Responsible Government. In the hands of 
               <br />
               the representatives of the people, supplies would all be voted. except condi ons were exacted, 
               <br />
               favourable to the popular will. And, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sir,</span> having treated on representative and Responsible 
               <br />
               Governments as applied to this Colony, let us see its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bearing</span> on the subject of Confede 'ation; 
               <br />
               and here I follow in the footsteps of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> Westminster; his reasoning 
               <br />
               is mine. but not his conclusions. Without Responsible Government, or its equivalent, or its 
               <br />
               approximate Government by a representative majority, we have no safeguard against a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern»</span>

               <br />
               a dependency. and Canadian interests will prevail. Dependence on England is bearable; they 
               <br />
               have no interests apart from ours; but dependence on Canada would be unbearable; their 
               <br />
               interests are different from ours, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">That</span> is the conclusion that is inevitable; it is but a logical
