               great importance, it does not appear to me that it necessarily forms any part of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terms.</span> It 
               <br />
               is, in my opinion, futile to imagine that we shall obtain power, under Confederation, to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">frame‘</span> 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regulate</span> our own tariff. 'l‘he Customs tariff is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">essentially</span> a Federal measure, and the 
               <br />
               Dominion Government cannot <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\r‘el</span> well permit a Province to make its own tariff. To do so 
               <br />
               would, in my opinion, he to admit a principle which would ultimately break up the whole (lon— 
               <br />
               Iederation. If such a concession were made to British Columbia every other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I’rovince</span> in the 
               <br />
               Dominion would forthwith clamour for it. The Dominion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tarilf</span> is of necessity a Federal matter, 
               <br />
               to be dealt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> by the Federal Parliament, and it is unreasonable to expect that such an 
               <br />
               exception will he made in our favour. The Customs <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariﬂ’?</span> is the main source <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Federal 
               <br />
               revenue; and if any Province were permitted to tinker with it, the Federal revenue would, 
               <br />
               indeed, be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">precarious.</span> History does not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">encourage</span> us to hope for such a power. Taking the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">United</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States</span> which, in thi. reSpect. presents conditions not dissimilar to those of the Dominion, 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd that the Customs tariff has ever been a Federal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question,</span> To no State or Territory 
               <br />
               has it been conceded to deal with its own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariff.</span> If the strongest reasons had not existed for 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bills.</span> we should certainly have found exceptions made in favour of Paciﬁc States and Territories. 
               <br />
               Hon. Members will recollect the bitter complaints made in earlier times on this Coast against 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Federal</span> tariffs; yet the people, while <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">complaining,</span> were never foolish enough to claim or expect 
               <br />
               the right to regulate their own tariit’. They knew perfectly well that such a power was Wholly 
               <br />
               incompatible with Union. It is as well that we should not cling to any such hope as that of 
               <br />
               being permitted to make and regulate our own tariff under Confederation. I quite concur with 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the'Hon.</span> the Chief Commissioner in the view that. notwithstanding the difference in existing 
               <br />
               conditions on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"this</span> side of the continent, and on the Atlantic side of it. there are many questions, 
               <br />
               even of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariff,</span> which would be more successfully dealt with at Ottawa, and that our repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives would be listened <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to.</span> and would have their due <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">weight</span> upon such questions. Probably 
               <br />
               through their inﬂuence the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariff</span> would, in some respects, be made more conformable to our 
               <br />
               circumstances and interests: but the Dominion tariff must be altered and maintained by the 
               <br />
               Federal Parliament, and not by any Provincial authority. We occupy a very exceptional 
               <br />
               position, and shall do so for years, in regard to such questions, and this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">justify</span> us in 
               <br />
               asserting that the tariff of Canada, as a whole, is not applicable to British Columbia at present. 
               <br />
               But, Sir, permit me to say that this question, like most others, has two sides to it, and has not 
               <br />
               been approached with that fairness and candour which its great importance demands. We are 
               <br />
               very apt to estimate protection above its real value—to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forget</span> the price we pay for it. Even 
               <br />
               our farmers sometimes pay more for protection than it is in reality worth to them. Under 
               <br />
               free trade the products of this part of the Colony conunnnded a much more ready market, and 
               <br />
               higher prices, than they do now after three years of protection. I am <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">willing</span> to admit that a 
               <br />
               few l'z <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">more</span> have thriven, partly. perhaps, on protection. but partly. too, I am <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">apt</span> to think, at 
               <br />
               the expense of other classes and other interests in the Colony. Let us <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">remember</span> that protec- 
               <br />
               tion is not an unmixed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">good.</span> and that it sometimes costs more than it is really <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">worth.</span> It should 
               <br />
               also be remembered that the importance <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> protection is somewhat localized in its application. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nature</span> has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">given</span> ample protection to the interior of the Colony; and it is, in reality, only 
               <br />
               on this Island and the Lower Fraser that artiﬁcial protection can be desirable. I venture to 
               <br />
               think that there is a great future <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ibefore</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Vancouver</span> island. but I do not believe that it will 
               <br />
               ever owe its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">greatness</span> to agricultural (levelopmeut._ l believe that its commercial, maritime, 
               <br />
               mineral, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">manufacturing</span> industr will far <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">outweigh</span> its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">farming</span> interests, and i do not 
               <br />
               think, therefore, that we would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">jus</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wed</span> in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">refusing</span> Confederation upon fair and equitable 
               <br />
               terms. simply because we could not have power to regulate the Customs tariff. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regret</span> that I 
               <br />
               am unable to agree with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> one of the recommendations now before the Committee. The 
               <br />
               wisest: course, in my opinion, will be to ask the Dominion Govermnent to withhold the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">applica~</span>
