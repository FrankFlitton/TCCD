               debt of Canada for 120,000 of the population <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Canada at the time of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">linion,</span> which is esti-' 
               <br />
               mated at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$39,000</span> per annum; and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(-1)</span> the balance of our presont revenue (not including the 
               <br />
               Customs, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">E.</span> ise, Postage, &amp;c., that go to the Dominion), estimated at $151,050 per annum. 
               <br />
               Now, Sir, i have already shown that our maximum population does not exceed 40,000. If 
               <br />
               we estimate the population of the Dominion on our admission in 1871 at 4,300,000, and the 
               <br />
               public debt at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3580000000,</span> the rate per head would be 0. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> $20 per head for our 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">40.000</span> people would entitle us to a public debt of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"800,000;</span> and as our public debt, after 
               <br />
               deducting Sinking <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Fund,</span> would be in 1871 about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I,</span> , .000, the Colony would enter the 
               <br />
               Dominion with a debt of about $250,000. So no re nne can be acquired from the third 
               <br />
               source of revenue on the basis of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">40,000</span> population. Again, it‘ the proposed terms allowed us 
               <br />
               to enter with the same debt per head as old Canada entered the Dominion, that is $25 per 
               <br />
               head, our population of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">40,000</span> would only entitle us to a debt of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,000,000,</span> leaving us still 
               <br />
               in debt $50,000 on our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">admission.</span> No revenue <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">still,</span> Let us now take a passing glance at 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland</span> terms of Union. The debt per head allowed to New Brunswick on her 
               <br />
               admission was, we are told, accepted on behalf of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland</span> by those who negotiated the 
               <br />
               terms, and that was .77 per head. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">40,000</span> people at $27.77 per head would entitle 
               <br />
               the Colony, on admission in 1871, to a public debt of $1.110,800, instead of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,048,644,</span> our 
               <br />
               public debt then leaving a difference of $02,150. on which. on the basis of the third source <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 
               <br />
               revenue, we would be entitled to draw interest at 5 per cent. "hat <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference,</span> $02,150 at 5 
               <br />
               per cent, would yield only $3,107,-—a sum very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[or</span> below $82,000 per annum, the estimate in 
               <br />
               the terms proposed. So it is neither on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland</span> basis, nor on a basis of fact, that 
               <br />
               the Hon. Member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> Victoria City has framed the Government scheme of Union. I will 
               <br />
               now come, Sir, to the real point of ‘ssue. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will‘</span> try. with all fairness, to discover whether 
               <br />
               there is or is not any ground on which to base the assumption of a population <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 120,000. 
               <br />
               We have been told by the Hon. the Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works, and by the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lion.</span> and learned Attorney-General, that the financial calculations are based on the proportion 
               <br />
               between the receipts of Customs and Excise in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colon}</span> and the receipts from Customs and 
               <br />
               Excise in the Dominion of Canada. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> Sir, from statistics in my possession, Lﬁnd that 
               <br />
               the Customs <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of.</span> Canada yield <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$8,040,000.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Thatamount,</span> with a population of 4,300,000, would 
               <br />
               be equal to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span> per head per annuni. Let us now see what the Customs Revenue yields per 
               <br />
               head in British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Columbia,</span> In 1869, the Customs were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$342,120.</span> The difference between the 
               <br />
               average percentage of Customs duty imposed in British Columbia and in Canada is 7 per cent. 
               <br />
               less under the Canadian than under our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tarilf,</span> Now. as we imported in 1860 $1,775,000, 7 
               <br />
               per cent. on that amount would be equal to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,2é.250.</span> If we deduct <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">31%,250</span> from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$342,120,</span> 
               <br />
               our Customs receipts in 1869, we shall have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$217370,</span> the total revenue Canada would have 
               <br />
               received from British Columbia in case we had been in the Dominion. If we divide this 
               <br />
               $217,870 by our population, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">40.000,</span> we shall have per head; in round numbers, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span> 
               <br />
               We can now easily discern the reason why the basis of population has been fixed at 120,000 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[or</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">financial</span> purposes in the Government scheme <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Union.</span> It is apparent that the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment estimate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> population has been founded on the conclusion that in British Columbia the 
               <br />
               Customs would be about $0 per head. and in Canada <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span> per head, or three times higher here 
               <br />
               than there: and. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">therefore,</span> our population <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">40,000</span> ought for ﬁnancial purposes to be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">120,000,</span> or three times greater than it really is. If there were not reasons for the opinion 
               <br />
               that under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> the Customs and EXCise of the Dominion, as applied to this Colony, 
               <br />
               would not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perceptibly</span> exceed the. rate per head in the Dominion East, I would cheerfully 
               <br />
               assent. for ﬁnancial purposes, to the assumption of 120.000 as our basis of population. I 
               <br />
               cannot. however, conscientiously do so, for with the extension of the Dominion to the Paciﬁc, 
               <br />
               1 hold, will come the' equalization of political <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rights,</span> and the equalization of taxation. The 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ecpialization</span> of political rights will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">established</span> with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ext&lt;</span> sion of the Dominion; but 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">equalization</span> of taxation, though it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may</span> not come in the ﬁrst year <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> ler Union, yet it is bound 
               <br />
               to come within two or three years after <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Union</span> shall have been proclaimed. In proof <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">otthis</span> 
               <br />
               assertion, I could direct the attention of the Council to what I deem facts: (1) That as soon 
               <br />
               as ITnion shall have been proclaimed, Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">maimt'acl'urers</span> will enter our ports duty free, 
               <br />
               and that the reduction of Customs receipts from this source will, on the basis of our imports 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> 1800. be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘AOO</span> per annum; (2) The reduction of C‘ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"toms</span> receipts after Union, for 
               <br />
               Canadian produce entered duty free, and by theincroasc oi’ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gricnltnral</span> produce in the Colony, 
               <br />
               will be, on the imports of 1860. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$00,100.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now</span> these two reductions are equal to $124,500,
