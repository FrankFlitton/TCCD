               It is unnecessary for me to say anything in favour of the principle of Confederation. It is 
               <br />
               admitted in the Resolution which I have just read. I take it, Sir, that the obstacle there referred 
               <br />
               to will be speedily removed; that the small band 01‘ disaffected spirits will soon disperse, and 
               <br />
               that the machinery of Government will shortly be put in motion; and though I do not take 
               <br />
               pleasure, like the Hon, Member on my left, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revolution,</span> political hatred, agitation, and blood 
               <br />
               and thunder generally, I am not disposed to regret the occurrence of the difﬁculty in the Red 
               <br />
               River, for it will teach the Canadian Government, and the Imperial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govea'ument,</span> and all Govern- 
               <br />
               ments, that though you may buy and sell territories, you cannot transfer the human beings 
               <br />
               therein, like so many serfs and chattels, to a fresh allegiance with impunity; that the consent 
               <br />
               of the people must be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">first</span> obtained; and that though the soil may be sold, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">soul</span> is free. 
               <br />
               This measure was, to a certain extent, forced upon the Government by the people of this Colony. 
               <br />
               It is said that the people clamour for a change in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government.</span> Why, Sir, we have had 
               <br />
               changes enough during that time I have been in the Colony, to ruin any country; changes 
               <br />
               generally for the worse. [“ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">No,</span> no,” from Mr. DeCosmosJ But whether Confederation comes 
               <br />
               or not, there is one change more which I hope to see before this year expires, and that is a 
               <br />
               change in the Constitution of this Council. I desire to see all the Members, save the Executive 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ofﬁcers,</span> elected by the people; and this change is promised by the Governor. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I hope, also, that the Colony will so prosper, and the population so increase, that before 
               <br />
               many years another change will come, that is to say Responsible Government. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">At</span> present, 
               <br />
               I believe we are not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fitted</span> for it; it is practically impossible, and the Governor has had the 
               <br />
               courage to declare it. I would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gladly</span> believe that the cry for this panacea for all evil does 
               <br />
               not come from those who would fain jump into vacant places, and enjoy what they are pleased 
               <br />
               to term bloated idleness. Such pharisaic p otisni was so well exposed by my much-abused 
               <br />
               friend at the bottom of the table (Dr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Helmckenl,</span> that I will not further allude to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> But 
               <br />
               I say, Sir, that if they can find public servants who will perform their duties better and more 
               <br />
               perfectly, let them in God’s name come <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on.</span> I am content, for one, to give place to better men. 
               <br />
               Now is the opportunity offered. But, Sir, I am rejoiced that this measure has come down 
               <br />
               from the Executive; it will, when accomplished, give us rest I hope from this everlasting change. 
               <br />
               The farmer, the artizan, the capitalist, and the merchant will know what to expect, and will 
               <br />
               make their plans accordingly. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Years</span> ago, the farmer naturally expected that the Free Port 
               <br />
               system was settled and approved <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of.</span> Agitation commenced, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">farmer</span> and the merchant could 
               <br />
               not carry on their pursuits without an iety, and the Colony <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sulifered.</span> The Free Port was 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">abolished—that</span> grand political <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mistake—I</span> iiou with British Columbia was effected, and a heavy 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariff</span> imposed, and business calculations were confounded again. But this Colony and the 
               <br />
               people have such elastic force. that they are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">again</span> beginning to settle themselves down to the 
               <br />
               new order of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thing“</span> Busine went on, it is true, but, nevertheless, it suffered; and for the last 
               <br />
               two years <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agitatioi</span> has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">again</span> been at work. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">farmer</span> is alarmed; he is prosperous at 
               <br />
               present, but he dreads (unnecessarily I think) what will be virtually to him the Free Port 
               <br />
               system again; and so alarm, and change, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unquigtness</span> are for ever distracting this small 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">struggling</span> Colony, which. unless it had immense vital energy, and enormous latent strength, 
               <br />
               would long <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ago</span> have succumbed. I see. however, in the prospect before us, a sign of better 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">things-a</span> more hopeful future—a state which when consummated will, I believe, secure a more 
               <br />
               settled life to the Colony.
