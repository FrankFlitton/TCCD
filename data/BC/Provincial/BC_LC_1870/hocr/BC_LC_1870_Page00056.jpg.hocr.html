               from Canada, that her Customs and Excise produced $2.75 per head of her <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population;</span> at the 
               <br />
               same rate, $2.75 per head, our Customs represent the same present revenue as a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population</span> of 
               <br />
               120,000 Canadians produce. This estimate of 120,000, therefore, though nominal, is really 
               <br />
               just and fair; hence 120,000 population has been adopted as the basis of our ﬁnancial calcula- 
               <br />
               tions. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$35,000</span> in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">paragraph</span> 3. allowance for the general support of the Government, is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">an</span> arbitrary sum adopted by Canada in negotiating with Newfoundland and New Brunswick. 
               <br />
               The allowance of 5 per cent. interest on the difference between our public debt and that of 
               <br />
               Canada is arrived at in this way: We have it ofﬁcially from Canada that her debt on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">February</span> 
               <br />
               9th—say 1st March if you <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">like—amounted</span> to $22 per head of her population. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">This</span> would entitle 
               <br />
               us, with 120,000 people, to come in with a much larger debt than our own, vh'ch at the time 
               <br />
               of Union would he, say, $1,000,000. The interest at ﬁve per cent. on the difference of these 
               <br />
               amounts would give us the annual allowance of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$82,000</span> named in the papers before the House. 
               <br />
               The 80 cents a head on our population of 120,000 is the usual allowance prescribed by the Organic 
               <br />
               Act of Confederation.

               Hon. CHIEF <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">COhIMISSth‘ER—Mr.</span> Chairman, I think that on these two clauses depends 
               <br />
               the whole stability of our scheme; and as I believe <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them</span> to be of very vital importance 
               <br />
               [“Hear,'hear,” from Mr. DeCosmos], I trust I shall be excused if I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offer</span> a few remarks 
               <br />
               upon them, although it is possible I may travel over the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some</span> ground as the Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Attorneh</span> 
               <br />
               General has taken up in introducing these clauses. I say. Sir, that 120,000 may appear 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on</span> avagant at ﬁrst sight. The basis of the population of 1861 is taken as the basis on which 
               <br />
               other schemes rest; but that would not do for this Colony. It would not give us an equal 
               <br />
               advantage with other Provinces. It has, therefore, been found necessary to take some other 
               <br />
               basis. And here, Sir, I desire to say that I am permitted to inform this House that the 
               <br />
               Executive are very much indebted to the Hon. Member for Victoria City, who is also a 
               <br />
               Member of the Executive Council (Dr. Helmcken), for his able <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assistance</span> and suggestions 
               <br />
               in preparing this scheme. I trust that this Council will. ﬁnd that the Hon. Member has been 
               <br />
               most practical <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> ardent in his endeavours to obtain good terms, if he has not been an 
               <br />
               enthusiastic advocate of Confederation. With regard to the reasons for adopting the number 
               <br />
               of 120.000 as the basis of population, we ask something for undeveloped resources. The 
               <br />
               expenses of living in this Colony are much higher than on the Atlantic Coast; there is more 
               <br />
               per head paid <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> taxes here than in any other part of the Dominion. One <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dollar</span> here is in 
               <br />
               reality wort-h no more, that is to say it goes no further, than one shilling in the Eastern 
               <br />
               Provinces; and one man here pays as much to the Revenue as four on the other side. The 
               <br />
               basis is in fact the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">basis</span> of Customs paid by each individual in this Colony, compared with 
               <br />
               the Customs Revenue paid per <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">individual</span> in Canada. Taking the estimate of the present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">your,</span> 
               <br />
               the Canadian Customs and Excise old <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$2.75</span> per head on the present population; and our 
               <br />
               Customs being <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$330,000,</span> is equal to $ ' per head on a population of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">120,000,</span> upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">comparison</span> 
               <br />
               with Canada. Practically and equitably, I believe this to be a fair <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">basis.</span> It may be open 
               <br />
               to some logical objection, but I believe it is equitable. The estimate which we propose to hand 
               <br />
               over yields at that rate, as we now farm it. We turn it over into the hands of those who are 
               <br />
               to manage it. it is not for us to consider how. If they reduce the Customs, it is nothing to 
               <br />
               us; we must have a basis as favourable as this. [“ Perhaps more so "—Hon. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l-Ielnicken.)</span> 
               <br />
               Perhaps more so, as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Hon. Member says. The debt of Canada amounts to $22 per head 
               <br />
               on the population, and this on a population of 120,000 gives a debt of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$2,640,000.</span> We may 
               <br />
               claim to have our debt taken over on the same basis as other Colonies, as before Union can 
               <br />
               be consummated we may expect our debt to be reduced to $1.000,000, leaving a balance of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,640.000,</span> on which we will have a right to claim interest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> 5 per <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cent,</span> that is to say; 
               <br />
               $82,000, as stated in the printed particulars now before the Committee. The subsidy of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$35,000</span> 
               <br />
               is equal to that given to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland.</span> Referring <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">again</span> to the printed ﬁgures, you will ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amount</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Revenue retained by British Columbia is $3 51 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">50.</span> Add this to the subsidies. 
               <br />
               including the interest on the difference of the debt, amounting to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$213,000,</span> and we have a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">total</span> 
               <br />
               Revenue of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$364050.</span> As we shall be relieved of all expenses but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$212,000.75,</span> we shall <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1mm</span> 
               <br />
               left a clear balance of $ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">040.25</span> to be spent in local “'01 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\s.</span> This constitutes the Financial 
               <br />
               Scheme, and although it is open to argument, it is about what we are entitled to receive, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> 
               <br />
               what we must receive to place us in a fair position under Union.
