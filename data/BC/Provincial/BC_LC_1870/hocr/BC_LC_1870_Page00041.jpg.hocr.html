               It seems to me, Sir, that the people and their interests have been entirely ignored through-

               out the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discussion</span> of this question. and perhaps <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intentionally.</span> I refer to the subject of

               I remember that in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opening;</span> this debate, the Hon. Attorney-General invoked the Divine 
               <br />
               blessing upon the work upon which we were then entering. This was high-sounding, and a 
               <br />
               very nice picture to look at, but it does not wear well without that strict attention to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>

               divine rights of the people, which is inalienable from true political economy.

               I have a distinct recollection of most Hon. Members now occupying an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁcial</span> position at 
               <br />
               this Council Board, and of the positions which they occupied when ﬁrst they came to this 
               <br />
               Colony. I have often asked myself what entitles these Hon. Members to govern this Colony; 
               <br />
               but I have never been able to answer myself <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfactorily,</span> I am perfectly ready to admit the 
               <br />
               ability of Executive Members as individuals. The learned eloquence of the Hon. Attorney- 
               <br />
               General has always, since 1 have had the honour to sit at this Council Board. impressed me 
               <br />
               with a deep sense of the advantage of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thorough</span> forensic training; and the power and force of 
               <br />
               the reply of the lion. the Chief Commissioner has ever and again made me feel with especial 
               <br />
               force the utter hopelessness of combating stern ofﬁcial reticence with even the most brilliant

               <br />
               our estimation of personal worth, the question has still remained unanswered, and, in my 
               <br />
               opinion, unanswera Is. What is there in the collective wisdom of these Honourable Ofﬁcial 
               <br />
               Members that entitl 5 them to arrogate to themselves the right to rule? Are they, I ask, the 
               <br />
               dominant race, and are the people serfs?

               We have heard a great deal about absorption, and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">danger</span> of the larger body swallow-

               ing up the smaller. I think about as inuch of that danger as i do of the other evil threatened 
               <br />
               in such earnest and thrilling language by the Hon. Member for Victoria, namely, that our 
               <br />
               salmon would be under Confederation, and the protection from salmon nets that would be 
               <br />
               extended to them, increase and multiply to such an extent that they would absorb all the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">smaller</span> ﬁsh. I, however, to speak seriously, loubt very much if the Hon. Member can cite 
               <br />
               a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">single</span> example in history of the larger absorbing the lesser. unless the larger possessed

               better qualiﬁcations, as in the case of the absorption by British Columbia of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Vancouver</span> Island.

               Sir, we must give up all personal prejudices, and we must bend our minds to the establishment
