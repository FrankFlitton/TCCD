               I do not see why the Colony should be put to the expense of conveying the message; there is

               The fact of our doing so would lead to the presumption that Confederation is agreed upon. I

               the Colony assents to Confederation in the abstract. Why should we send three or four Hon.

               I cannot <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agree</span> with the Hon. Member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nunaimo</span> that it would be cheaper to send them by
