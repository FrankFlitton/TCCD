               Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mn.</span> ROBSON—I must oppose the amendment of the lion. and learned member; 
               <br />
               ﬁrst, because it raises invidious distinctions, and might lead to the inference that we were 
               <br />
               indiiferent to the other portion of the terms; secondly. because it asks this House to do what 
               <br />
               it cannot, and, even if it had the power. ought not to do. This Council is not the proper body 
               <br />
               to dictate final terms. This Council is only a quasi-representative body, and does not fairly 
               <br />
               represent the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people.</span> With a House constituted as this is. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">containing</span> some Members who 
               <br />
               professedly only represent their own individual opinions, it would, in my opinion, be an insult 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> people to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">make</span> any condition a test of union, in the sense proposed, Suppose Canada 
               <br />
               sends back the terms without the Railway, it is for the people to accept or reject them; that 
               <br />
               is a right <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">belonging</span> to the people, who have not yet been consulted. The Hon. Mr. Wood has 
               <br />
               said <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(that</span> there are Hon. Members in this House who would go in for Confederation on any terms. 
               <br />
               I, for one, have never done so; nothing is more foreign to my desires. [“ Hear, hear,” from 
               <br />
               the Attorney-General.] Though I am a Canadian, and am proud of my country, I am also a 
               <br />
               British Colombian; and upon this question my first and last thought <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span> been, is, and will be, for 
               <br />
               British Columbia. [“ Hear, hear," from the Attorney-General.] 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Hon. MR. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ALSTONWAS</span> a test question, I must say I cannot vote for this amendment 
               <br />
               If I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">am</span> in this Council when the ﬁnal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">votes</span> upon Confederation are to be taken, I shall be 
               <br />
               prepared to vote <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> Confederation, unless a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway</span> is included in the terms—unless, 
               <br />
               that is to say, my sentiments undergo some change which I do not foresee. I do not see how, 
               <br />
               if this were made a test question, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Goveriuneirtcould</span> carry out their instructions, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁrst/to</span> 
               <br />
               submit the Resolutions to Canada. and then to submit the Canadian terms to the people. 
               <br />
               This is not the time to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">submit</span> a test question, neither can we arrogate to ourselves the power 
               <br />
               to do so; it must be left to the popular vote. Therefore, although I fully concur in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">senti~</span> 
               <br />
               ment that we must have a Railway some time or other, I must vote <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> this amendment.

               Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mn,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HELMGKlslﬂ—Mr.</span> Chairman, the sooner we get back to business the better. The 
               <br />
               discussion has become <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">too</span> wide. Some IIon. Members seem to think that Canada can’t do it, 
               <br />
               that too much money is required. What is the fact? We merely ask the Canadian Government 
               <br />
               to spend one million a year. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">What</span> is the interest on that sum, at 4 per <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cent?</span> $40,000. and the 
               <br />
               next year $80,000. I don’t know how long it will take to get to the Rocky Mountains We want 
               <br />
               the Railway for our own purposes. [“ Hear, hear, hear,” from Hons. DeCoanos, Holbrook, and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">others]</span> We shall derive <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">benefit</span> from the expenditure of a million dollars a year in the Colony, 
               <br />
               and be getting a Railway at the same time. Every one seems to think that the Railway will 
               <br />
               unite the country; so it will; but it is not simply a Railway or a Telegraph that will unite 
               <br />
               Canada and British Columbia. The only true basis of Union is that people should have the 
               <br />
               same interests, the same feelings, and the same desire to make this a prosperous country. 
               <br />
               If Canada gives us terms sufficiently good to show <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> it is her intention to do all she can 
               <br />
               to develop our resources and advance our interests. then she will gain the affections of the 
               <br />
               people of this Colony, and then there will he an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lfnion</span> which no Railway can give, a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">material</span> 
               <br />
               Union which nothing can disturb, and we shall ﬁnd hereafter that Kingdoms and Nations will 
               <br />
               spring out of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> Union. We are told by the lion. Mr. Wood that the Ollicials must vote for 
               <br />
               these terms, as they have been settled by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Governor. This is not so, for before any terms 
               <br />
               can be concluded some one must go to Canada from here, or come from Canada to this place, 
               <br />
               to arrange conditions. I believe in what His <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Excellency</span> has said. I place more reliance on him 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">than</span> on any one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">else.</span> I believe he will act <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fairly</span> and justly in this matter. nor do I think 
               <br />
               there is so much to fear from Canada as there is from the danger of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> people of this Colony 
               <br />
               cheating themselves; you can make the people believe- anything. I do not agree that the 
               <br />
               country is in 'such a depressed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">condition.</span> I know that Victoria, the chief city, is in rather 
               <br />
               a depressed condition, and perhaps <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> Westminster also, but outside it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">otherwise</span>
