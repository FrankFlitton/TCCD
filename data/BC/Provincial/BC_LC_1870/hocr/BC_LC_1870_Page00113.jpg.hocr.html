               Stuart Mill on Responsible Government: First, “Do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> people require it; or are they unwilling 
               <br />
               to accept it?” We are told that this has not been made a question; I deny this statement. 
               <br />
               It has been made a question, more or less, in Victoria at every election. Every election 
               <br />
               depends more or less on this point. Second, “Are the people willing.to take the burdens which 
               <br />
               are imposed on them by such a form? ” I say that we have the answer to this proposition in 
               <br />
               the fact of there being people willing to come here where they are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">practically</span> useless, Do not 
               <br />
               persons come forward to represent the people? A very large majority of the people take part 
               <br />
               in every election. Third, “Are the people willing and able to do that which will enable the 
               <br />
               Government to perform its functions properly?” This, I contend, is the condition of the 
               <br />
               Colony. The main <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">argument</span> of the Chief Commissioner in his very able speech, a broad argu- 
               <br />
               ment and very well put, is that the population is scattered. I say this argument cannot be 
               <br />
               used with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect.</span> We are told that the Government would fall into the hands of Victoria as 
               <br />
               the centre of population and wealth; no great harm it it did. Victoria is dependent upon all 
               <br />
               parts of the Colony, and they on her; their interests are identical, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Another</span> objection that has 
               <br />
               been raised is, that we cannot <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">get</span> men of proper intelligence and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">qualifications</span> for positions of 
               <br />
               honour and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trust.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lookingr</span> round this Council Board we see men who have come out to this 
               <br />
               Colony to make their own fortunes and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">homes.</span> Out of them the present members of the 
               <br />
               Government have been chosen, and out of our present population there can he found an equal 
               <br />
               number of men who can properly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fulfil</span> the duties of the Government. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">7</span> cannot see that it is 
               <br />
               impossible to find proper men. If we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">find</span> men willing to sit in this Council now, we shall 
               <br />
               ﬁnd plenty ready and anxious to share in the burdens of Responsible Government. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suﬂ‘i»</span> 
               <br />
               ciency or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">insufficiency</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> population is not an element in this question. The United States 
               <br />
               has been pointed out to us as an example. I say there is no Responsible Government in the 
               <br />
               United States; it is an absolute despotic democracy, absolutely irresponsible to the people, 
               <br />
               except once in four years. There is no such thing as responsibi ty in the form of government 
               <br />
               of the United States, The only means of‘ getting rid of a minister is by impeachment. The 
               <br />
               Hon, Member for Carihoo, in his rambling speech, gives us no new argument against Responsible 
               <br />
               Government. He certainly reiterated much that was forcibly put forward by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Chief 
               <br />
               Commissioner. I can well believe that the wheat was left at Carihoo, and the chaff came here.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Hon. Mk, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HUMPHREYS—Sir,</span> l have ]istened to the speeches of the Hon. Chief Commis- 
               <br />
               sioner of Lands and Works and to the Hon. Government nominee, and I ﬁnd them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difficult</span> 
               <br />
               to answer, because there is so little in them, The only way would be to have them printed 
               <br />
               and read then). They carry their answers with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them,</span> One Hon. Member says that it rests 
               <br />
               on numbers. I say that intelligence is the only qualiﬁcation for Responsible Government; 
               <br />
               numbers have nothing to do with it. If I err I am proud of erring with some of the greatest 
               <br />
               men that England ever produced. The Hon. Chief Commissioner has admitted that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">popu'</span> 
               <br />
               lation, taken man for man. is equal to that of any country. Then, I say, we have the proper 
               <br />
               qualiﬁcation. Let us have practical, and not theoretical, means of governing. What is really 
               <br />
               the case? Under the present term <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Government the people have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> pay for the privilege and 
               <br />
               beneﬁt of a few gentlemen sitting round this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">board.</span> Take away this form of government and 
               <br />
               make it more liberal, and what is the danger? All the civil wars and troubles have not arisen 
               <br />
               from the uneducated. but from the ambition of the so—called educated classes. The people have 
               <br />
               been the conservatives who came forward to keep the country <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">going.</span> Take away the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">so«called</span> 
               <br />
               intelligent and educated classes and it will be no great loss; the labouring classes can always 
               <br />
               supply men to fill their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">places.</span> But take away the working classes and you kill the world; the 
               <br />
               educated classes cannot fill their places. In my opinion, Sir, the people want practical reality. 
               <br />
               They have endured too <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">long</span> the law’s delay and the insolencc of those in oilice. Why should 
               <br />
               we come here, year after <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">year.</span> to ask for a change in the form of government? I think that 
               <br />
               Responsible Government should be a sine qua non of Confederation. I shall <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">more</span> an amend— 
               <br />
               ment to that effect. 
               <br />

               Hon. Du, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I‘lI‘lLMCKENwGrent</span> heavens! what terrible things are said and done in the 
               <br />
               name of the people To hear Ilon. Members tall: one would think that they were the people. 
               <br />
               But the people are quiet while Hon. Members are very loud. I intend to support the Govern— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ment.</span> I do not mean to say much for or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against.</span> I take the position that the people can 
               <br />
               have Responsible Government when they want it; and their representatives ought to be satisﬁed 
               <br />
               to take it when the people really and seriously ask for it. Responsible Government has been 
               <br />
               one of the watcbwords of a certain set of politicians who wanted to bring on Confederation.
