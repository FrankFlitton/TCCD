               and if we deduct <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$124,500</span> from $217,876, the amount that has been assumed by Government 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> Canada would draw from this Colony in Customs receipts, we shall have only $93,370; 
               <br />
               and thus $03,376 will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">only</span> a fraction more than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$2</span> per head for our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">40,000</span> population—— 
               <br />
               very nearly the same rate per head of Customs taxation on the Paciﬁc as on the Atlantic. I 
               <br />
               might enter into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">explanations</span> at greater length to show the correctness of this conclusion, but 
               <br />
               I deem it undesirable. The certainty of the equalization of taxation all over the Dominion 
               <br />
               renders the assumption of a population of 120,000 for ﬁnancial purposes a pure fallacy. and 
               <br />
               nothing more nor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nothing</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">less,</span> It is simply taking a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tempera",</span> a transitory state of 
               <br />
               things, a state of things that will pass away in a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">year</span> or two, as the basis for permanent condi- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tions,</span> Besides, there is a serious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disadvantage</span> in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ssuniing</span> that we will pay 
               <br />
               unnum in Customs duty to the Dominion after <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Union,</span> and it is this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:——i</span> arly every one 
               <br />
               would like to see all kinds of foreign <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">merchandize,</span> except such as would enter into competition 
               <br />
               with home-grown produce and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">homemade</span> manufactures, entered duty <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">free</span> in Victoria, in 
               <br />
               order to foster and extend ‘comnierce. Now, it the Dominion Government made such an 
               <br />
               exemption from Customs for our beneﬁt, it is but natural that we should make good to Canada 
               <br />
               in some other way what her revenue would lose by such an exemption. If Vancouver <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stillld</span> 
               <br />
               were exempted from Customs, and its population were taken to be 20,000, the Local Govern- 
               <br />
               ment would he expected to pay to the Dominion $0 per head, or $120,000 per annum, for the 
               <br />
               exemption. But if instead of the temporary rate of $0 per head, the permanent rate of $2 
               <br />
               per head were taken, the 20,000 people of Vancouver Island would only have to provide 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$40000</span> per annum in lieu of $120,000, a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">saving</span> of $80,000. The advantage of adhering 
               <br />
               strictly to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">facts,</span> instead of fallacious assumptions, is consequently perceptible to every one. 
               <br />
               By following facts we can have a scheme of union with a true correlation of parts, a thing 
               <br />
               impossible if we follow the proposed assumptions. 1 have stated that $93,370 is all the 
               <br />
               Revenue that Canada is likely to receive in Customs from British Columbia, on the basis of 
               <br />
               Population and imports of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1860,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> it a wide <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">margin</span> he allowed, and these ﬁgures be 
               <br />
               raised to $120,000 per annum, it would only, at $2 per head, entitle us to a population of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(30,000,</span> That population would entitle the Colony to a debt of $1,200,000, or only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$150,000</span> 
               <br />
               in 1871 over our present debt, and on which the interest would be but $7,500 per annum, 
               <br />
               lt is useless for me to follow the matter further to Show that the ﬁnancial terms are not based 
               <br />
               on correct premises. But before I conclude this section of the subject I would remark that 
               <br />
               I have not taken into account the amount of Internal Revenue, such as Excise, Postage, 
               <br />
               Stamps, Malt Tax, &amp;c., that the Colony is likely to contribute to the Dominion Treasury; for, 
               <br />
               so tar as I can estimate the rate, it will not excoch $1, or $1.25 per head, and offers little or 
               <br />
               no grounds on which to base ﬁnancial terms. The only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference,</span> it appears to me, between 
               <br />
               the Customs and Internal Revenue laws of Canada, as applied for Revenue purposes to this 
               <br />
               Colony, is: that the Internal Revenue‘Taxes are likely to be, from the date of our admission, 
               <br />
               at the same rate per head here as in other parts of the Dominion; whereas the Customs will 
               <br />
               be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">higher</span> here per head for a few years than there. Turning <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now,</span> Sir, to that portion of the 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial terms that proposes to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">get</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$.11.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">30</span> from sources of revenue to be reserved after 
               <br />
               ["nion to the Colony, 1 cannot help thinking that: there has been a mistake all through the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Governmental</span> scheme, and that the amount of revenue proposed to be obtained from those 
               <br />
               sources is another instance of Governmental <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hlundering.</span> As 1 sum up these sources of 
               <br />
               revenue from the Estimates of 1870, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the“</span> areas follow. —Iload ’l‘olls, $50,000; Land Sales,

               <br />
               be no grounds for including such accidental sources of revenue under the head of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">permanent</span> 
               <br />
               sources of revenue. Hence we must reduce the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$151000</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> local revenue to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$141,000.</span> But 
               <br />
               the latter amount must also be reduced by deducting the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Vancouver</span> Island Road <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Tar</span> $6,000, 
               <br />
               therefrom, thus <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">leaving</span> only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.1000</span> as permanent sources of revenue; for if the Vancouver 
               <br />
               Island Road Tax be included in our estimate of permanent revenue, we ought also <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> include

               the annual revenue <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cities</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Victoria</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> Westminster, which is simply absurd.
