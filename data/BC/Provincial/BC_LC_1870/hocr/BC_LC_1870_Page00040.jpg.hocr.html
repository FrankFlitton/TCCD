               I recently read, Sir. an account of a meeting held in one of our principal Canadian cities,

               occasion to refer to Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, he added:—“Amer <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">van</span> though I

               concerted action, the. entire audience of men, women. and children rose to their feet and sung

               <br />
               simply desn-e to relate this fact. I had occasion to go into the Hon. Attorney-Gelicl‘nl’s otﬁce 
               <br />
               in 18 ". and he then showed me a letter, written by himself. in favour <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oi“</span> Confederation; and 
               <br />
               after <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perusing</span> that letter I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">felt</span> convinced that when, in his estimation. the proper time arrived,

               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cause,</span> would have a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">v\</span> and sincere advocate in the Attorney—General. I mention this

               in order to show that the lion. Member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l"</span> toria District has no right to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arrogate</span> to
