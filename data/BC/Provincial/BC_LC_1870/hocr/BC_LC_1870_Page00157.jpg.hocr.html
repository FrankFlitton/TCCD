               IIon. MR. WALKEM—Sir, I have made i'ew speeches during this debate, but this is a 
               <br />
               question on which I must ask leave to say a few words. Session after Session the question has 
               <br />
               been brought <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">down</span> We have had always a large Victoria element, and this question has. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unfortunately,</span> always taken a Victoria and Mainland <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">issue.</span> I have studied this matter care- 
               <br />
               fully. With <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span> to the Acts themselves they are very strong; they commence with preambles 
               <br />
               as to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">construction,</span> maintenance, and repair. The toll was not mentioned as to continue merely 
               <br />
               until the debt was extinguished, therefore I think the vote should be taken on another view. 
               <br />
               The beneﬁts accrue equally to Victoria and the Upper Country; probably the farmer gets the 
               <br />
               lion‘s share; I know the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Upper</span> Country pretty well: formerly the miner used nothing outside 
               <br />
               of bacon and ﬂour. This should not he made an Island and Mainland question. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I—lon.</span> Dr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HELMCKIU</span> —I do not regard the subject as a joke. We have paid <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$60,000</span> for 
               <br />
               roads on Vancouver Island—roads not one-twentieth the length of those on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mainland.</span> 
               <br />
               Victoria gets more kicks than haltpence. Victoria <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pays</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">greater</span> part of the tolls. I belong 
               <br />
               to a company who pay a large proportion. What do they propose in place of a road toll? 
               <br />
               Some one must pay it. Thirty <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thousand</span> dollars per annum is required to keep roads in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">repair.</span> 
               <br />
               I say Victoria and Vancouver Island are more concerned with What is for the good of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colony,</span> generally, than any part of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mainland.</span>
