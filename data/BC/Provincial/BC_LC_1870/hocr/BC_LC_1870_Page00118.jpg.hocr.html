               is the fashion for Honourable Members to say that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> of this or any other com- 
               <br />
               munity are bound to govern according to the well understood wishes of the people; that the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">110.1:</span> populi is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">row</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(let;</span> that Ministries and Governments are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responsible</span> to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people.</span> But: 
               <br />
               the true principle, as we all very well know, is that Governments and Ministries are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responsible,</span> 
               <br />
               not to the people as a populace, but to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representatives</span> of the people, properly and reasonably 
               <br />
               chosen. Governments and Ministries are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responsible</span> not to numerical majorities, but to the 
               <br />
               country. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> Sir, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representative</span> institutions are liable to this obvious and well~known 
               <br />
               danger. I will quote the words of a well-known political writer, Herbert Spencer: “When- 
               <br />
               ever the proﬁt accruing to the representative individually, from the passage of a mischievous 
               <br />
               measure, largely exceeds his loss as a unit in the community from the operation of the injurious 
               <br />
               law, his interest becomes antagonistic to that of his constituents, and sooner or later will sway 
               <br />
               his vote.” How true and bow obvious this is. I might go further, when the private and 
               <br />
               personal, the direct and immediate, interest of the representative or of the constituents, whose 
               <br />
               advocates and delegates they are. is opposed to any matter of legislative action, the direct 
               <br />
               and material interest will, of a certainty, prevail over the distant and more remote welfare 
               <br />
               of the, connnunity, in all but very rare instances. This is the danger that threatens all 
               <br />
               representative institutions, and the only safeguard against i is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">qualiﬁcatieuwthe</span> pecuniary 
               <br />
               and material qualification of the representative, the pecuniary and material qualiﬁcation of 
               <br />
               the elector; and, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accordingly,</span> we see representative institutions ﬂourishing and successful 
               <br />
               only when this safeguard practically exists. Let us turn to the example of England. In 
               <br />
               England representative institutions and Responsible Government work <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">smoothly—wand</span> why? 
               <br />
               Because of the notoriously aristocratic and plutocratic character of the Legislature of Great 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Britain</span> Political life is a sealed book to any but the wealthy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">classes.</span> Every member of 
               <br />
               Parliament is a man of property; no other can afford the luxury <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> legislative life; and 
               <br />
               society is secure in the hands of representatives whose property would suffer from the results 
               <br />
               of vicious or reckless legislation. I say nothing of the question of! peace and war, probably 
               <br />
               the most momentous and disastrous subject of vicious and reckless legislation, a question 
               <br />
               which will not arise in the Colony. The cream of all legislation is taxation, and my solid 
               <br />
               conviction is that representative institutions and Responsible Government will fail whenever 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">working</span> majority is in the hands of an unsubstantial class of representatives or of electors. 
               <br />
               I have thus, Sir, treated <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or</span> representative institutions and Responsible Government somewhat 
               <br />
               in the abstract. 1 will now refer more particularly to its application to this Colony, and this 
               <br />
               apart from any question of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation;,a1nl</span> I will repeat that I am in favour of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exten.</span> 
               <br />
               sion to‘the utmost possible limits of the representative elements of this Council, but adverse 
               <br />
               to Responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government;</span> With respect to the constitution of the Legislative Council of 
               <br />
               British Columbia, it might, I think, hardly be necessary. in the present condition of the 
               <br />
               Colony, to advocate a second <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Chllllll)€l“-il</span> Council as distinct from an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Assembly.</span> However 
               <br />
               advisable this may be in an advanced condition of the Colony, advanced in numbers and 
               <br />
               wealth, few, if any, would advocate such an institution as a second chamber. The elements 
               <br />
               for forming such a chamber are sadly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wanting,r</span> in the present state of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs,</span> and the matter 
               <br />
               may be dismissed without further <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">connnentmwithout</span> discussing the advisability in a general 
               <br />
               way of such an institution at all, or the, constitutional elements of such a body. But <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'ith</span> 
               <br />
               regard to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature</span> on the supposition of its consisting of one single <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House.</span> it will be 
               <br />
               necessary to speak at somewhat greater length. or what elements ought such a legislative 
               <br />
               body to consist? At present it consists of ofﬁcial members, heads of departments; official 
               <br />
               members not heads of departments, but representing. for the most part, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> magisterial 
               <br />
               districts; a few nominated <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nlenllvOi's~Xioliiiilzlt0(l.</span> I think it is reasonable to presume, from an 
               <br />
               impression of their being tolerany intelligent and moderate; and a few representative <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mem»</span>

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bers.</span> it is asked whether the constitution of this Council should be altered so as to establish 
               <br />
               direct Responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government.</span> or what may be looked upon almost as its equivalent, a large 
               <br />
               working majority of responsible members. I leave out of the question at present all reference 
               <br />
               to any modiﬁcation of the constitution of the Council in the event of Confederation, and I 
               <br />
               consider the matter at present only in reference to the Council and the Colony in their actual 
               <br />
               condition. At present it is obvious. and must be felt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> all or" us, by ofﬁcial members no less 
               <br />
               than by independent members, that our po on as a Crown Colony is what is commonly
