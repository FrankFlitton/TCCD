               but I believe the Canadian statesmen are sufﬁciently <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">farseeing</span> to take care that not an interest 
               <br />
               in this Colony shall suffer by the Resolutions which we are about passing. With regard to the 
               <br />
               Dominion Tariff, people thought <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the abrogation of the Reciprocity Treaty was the death- 
               <br />
               hnell of the independence of Canada. I have lived, however, to see her more prosperous by that 
               <br />
               abrogation. It has taught her to develop her own resources, and to become self~reliant. After 
               <br />
               she was prevented from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">going</span> to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">United</span> States, by that abrogation, she turned her attention 
               <br />
               to her own resources, and I believe she is now going to be one of the most progressive nations 
               <br />
               upon the earth. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Undoubtedly,</span> she is determined to progress westward. until she reaches British 
               <br />
               Columbia and the Paciﬁc; and with all her progressive tendency she will not abate one jet of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rilty</span> for which, now as ever, she is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">distinguished,</span>

               Now, with regard to Responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government.</span> {“Ilear, hear,” from Mr. DeCosmos.] I 
               <br />
               desire to touch lightly upon this subject in passing, because I have been told that my popularity 
               <br />
               has suffered by some remarks to which I gave utterance in this House upon a previous occasion. 
               <br />
               Much as I value populari , I must on this question express my honest and conscientious opinion 
               <br />
               as an individual. I believe that I was the ﬁrst to break ground on the question of Responsible 
               <br />
               Government, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">connection</span> with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation.</span> I did it, not hastily or thoughtlessly, but on 
               <br />
               conviction; and I maintain that so long as I do it honestly, I am free to say what I please, as 
               <br />
               an individual, upon this matter. I do not believe, Sir, that, with our present population, with our 
               <br />
               people scattered over a vast extent of thinly populated country, and having regard to the various 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conflicting</span> interests consequent on remoteness from the centre, the principle of Responsible 
               <br />
               Government cannot be satisfactorily applied to this community at present. I believe entirely 
               <br />
               in the ability and ﬁtness of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">AngloSaxon</span> race to govern themselves; but I say that the time 
               <br />
               has not: yet arrived under which that particular form of government, generally known as Respon— 
               <br />
               sihle, can be satisfactorily worked in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colony.</span> I believe that the scheme foreshadowed by 
               <br />
               the Governor for Representative Govermnent will be the best that, under present circumstances, 
               <br />
               the Colony can have. The popular members under that system will have a clear majority, and, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consequently,</span> the people will have the control of the pu e-strings. I do not speak these words 
               <br />
               as a member of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Executive</span> Council, but as the expression of my own deliberate opinion. Sir, 
               <br />
               I was not sent here pledged to any particular platform. My constituents had confidence in me, 
               <br />
               and were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">content.</span> that I should act on my own judgment. Speaking <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">officially,</span> I say that Respon- 
               <br />
               sible Government is not a question of 'nion. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ifnion</span> gives us the exclusive right to 
               <br />
               alter our own laws with respect to everything connected with the internal and local Government 
               <br />
               of the Province, so long as the Federal prerogative, it I may so call it, is not infringed. If the 
               <br />
               majority of the people want Responsible Government after <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation,</span> neither Governor 
               <br />
               Musgrave nor any other power on earth can prevent their having <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> It is unfounded, unfair, 
               <br />
               and unjust, on the part of those who are opposed to the Government on the question of Con- 
               <br />
               federation, to endeavour. to put any other complexion upon the matter.
