               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">saic</span> “No, no,” one thing is certain, it afﬁrmed, in the most distinct manner, by this Council,

               the principle of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">C(mfedcroiion,</span> the advisability of our joining at some time or other the Dominion 
               <br />
               of Canada. That principle has during every subsequent session, down to the present day, been 
               <br />
               conﬁrmed, either directly or indirectly, by a speciﬁc Resolution of this House [“No, no,” from 
               <br />
               Dr. Helmchen and Mr. Wood]. Thus, on the 28th April, 1868, a Resolution was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">passed</span> by this

               Council conﬁrming the previous Resolution, in the following terms :—

               What is that but a confirmation of the principle? Now let us look to the Journals of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1809,</span> 
               <br />
               There I see that, on the 17th February, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1885),</span> when, owing to the position of other political 
               <br />
               issues then current in the Colony, it would have been easy, had it been so desired, to procure 
               <br />
               an adverse verdict on the principle of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation,</span> the House, though invited to do so, refused 
               <br />
               to go any further than to request Her Majesty’s Government (while the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-West</span> Territory 
               <br />
               was still out of the Dominion) not to press the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">present</span> consummation of Union. The word 
               <br />
               “present” <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> an express amendment of my Honourable colleague opposite (Mr. Trutch) and 
               <br />
               myself, so as to .preserve the principle, and hide our time. The House, therefore, I take it, 
               <br />
               has thoroughly and uniformly committed itself to the principle of Confederation, and may 
               <br />
               very properly be invited now, setting aside all causes of difference. for the common good, 
               <br />
               calmly, frankly, and cordially to enter upon a discussion of the terms. But if any Honourable 
               <br />
               Members think the principle has not been decided. now is the time and now the hour to settle 
               <br />
               that point (as far as this Session and this present Council is concerned) once and forever. 
               <br />
               They are bound, in support of their views, to lay before the Council the reasons for the faith 
               <br />
               that is in them, and to explain why we should not consolidate counsels with the Dominion.
