               terms of: union, I will conclude this part of the subject by stating that the terms submitted in 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Resolutions,</span> and illustrated by the printed Estimate. instead of giving the Colony a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pen</span> 
               <br />
               manent total revenue of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$304,050</span> per annum, will only produce <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$248</span> 7, unless higher Provincial 
               <br />
               taxation be levied here than in other parts of the Dominion. The w ay in which i make up these 
               <br />
               results is as follows <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:~By</span> the terms submitted by the Government, there is (lst) Fixed subsidy, 
               <br />
               $35,000; (2nd) Interest on difference of Public Debt, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$82,000;</span> (3rd) 30 cents per head on 120,000

               <br />
               the proposed terms, there is: (1) <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Fixed</span> subsidy 35,000; (2) 80 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cents</span> per head on 120,000 people, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$06,000;</span> (3) Interest on difference of debt, taking $20 per head as the debt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Canada, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$67,567;</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(4)</span> Reserved revenue, $50,000: Total, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$38,567.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> if we deduct from the latter amount the 
               <br />
               Government estimate of current: evpenditure, viz.: <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$211,000,</span> there would only remain a surplus 
               <br />
               revenue of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$36,558,</span> instead of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$101,050,</span> as anticipated. 1, therefore, sincerely think that the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> scheme is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wrong,</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ought</span> to he revised. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr,</span> Chairman, I therefore propose to 
               <br />
               bring under the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">notice</span> of the Council what I consider ought to he the ﬁnancial terms, taking for 
               <br />
               granted always that Canada will become liable for our public debt at the time <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofadniission.</span> 
               <br />
               When the Provincial Delegates met in Quebec and London, to decide on the terms of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederar</span> 
               <br />
               tion, they divided the Provinces into three groups, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">via:</span> Upper Canada, Lower Canada, and the 
               <br />
               Maritime Provinces. Lower Canada was taken as the initial point. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Kow,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sir,</span> in deciding 
               <br />
               ﬁnally as to the terms, I consider that British Columbia ought to be treated as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> fourth 
               <br />
               group, whilst: <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nortanest</span> Territory may be r <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lrded</span> as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁfth,</span> The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁrst.</span> thing that 
               <br />
               strikes me, on looking at the Eastern Provinces, is their territory. Ontario has 121,200 square 
               <br />
               miles; Quebec, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">210.000;</span> and all the Maritime Provinces, 88,00 Territorially, then, we are 
               <br />
               their equal, and greater than either of them. The natural capa ty of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">territory</span> to support 
               <br />
               population is as great as Lower Canada. We have a ﬁner climate, and more varied natural 
               <br />
               resources. Quebec sustains a population of about 1, .000. or more. Ontario has 2.000.000. 
               <br />
               It is true that they are two centuries ahead of us, and we are in our infancy, with a handful 
               <br />
               of people. But that is no reason why, in framing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terms,</span> that we should not look ‘forward to 
               <br />
               the rapid development of the Colony, and to the possession of a large settled population. Con- 
               <br />
               sideriug our geographical position, our natural resources, our wide-spread population, and our 
               <br />
               future, I think that we are entitled to as large a ﬁxed subsidy as Ontario, that is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$80,000,</span> 
               <br />
               The proposed terms, submitted by the Government, ale only $35,000 per annum. Now, this 
               <br />
               is placing British Columbia, with its 220.000 square miles. its great natural resources, and 
               <br />
               the best climate in the world, on a par with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland,</span> with its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">40,000</span> square miles, its 
               <br />
               sterile soil and inhospitable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">climate—21</span> country that has never yet developed any capacity 
               <br />
               for anything but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">catching</span> and selling codﬁsh. Prince Edward’s Island is also offered a ﬁxed 
               <br />
               subsidy of $35,000 per <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">annum,~a</span> little insular community with a territory <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 2,100 square 
               <br />
               miles, a hundred times less in area than our own country, and with a climate far inferior to 
               <br />
               ours. It is simply absurd to propose such a thing as ranking this Colony in subsidies with 
               <br />
               either of the Provinces except <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ontario.</span> I want neither more nor less than what the latter 
               <br />
               Province gets as a ﬁxed annual subsidy, Every <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ilon,</span> gentleman present who gives the matter 
               <br />
               a moment’s consideration must agree with me that $85,000 is entirely out of the question, and 
               <br />
               that the least we can accept is a ﬁxed subsidy of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$80,000</span> per <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lllllllllll.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lelear.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hearil</span> In the 
               <br />
               next place, I propose that our population be taken at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">40,000,</span> and at no time shall it be con— 
               <br />
               siderod less; and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> we shall be entitled to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">receive</span> 80 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cents</span> per head annually until our 
               <br />
               population shall have reached <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1,000,000.</span> By this proportion we have truth and fact on our

               <br />
               propose that we shall <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">receive</span> 80 cents on lhut <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">number</span> at oncc. and that we shall <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">receive</span> no
