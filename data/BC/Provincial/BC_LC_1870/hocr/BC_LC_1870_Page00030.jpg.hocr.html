               Sir, where else except to Canada could we go? The Honourable Member talks of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> i 
               <br />
               cultural interests. Why, Sir, by going somewhere else, these interests from Comox to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Soolxe,</span> 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> Soda Creek and Kamloops to the Lower Fraser would be destroy l. "he country <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span>

               <br />
               that one. ion came up, Sir, the farmers would quickly put it down. The Honourable Member 
               <br />
               for Victoria City sa s that the question comes here by desire of Her Majesty‘s Government. 
               <br />
               Sir, I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span> again, that it comes here by desire of the people, a large proportion of whom have 
               <br />
               asked Her Majesty’s Government and the Government at Ottawa to bring it here. I am thank- 
               <br />
               t’ul that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span> of Confederation is here. The Honourable gentleman says it is a 
               <br />
               Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measure,</span> and that the terms must he passed. I say, again, that I hope terms will 
               <br />
               be passed of such a character as will contribute to the prosperity and happiness of this Colony. 
               <br />
               The Honourable Executive Councillor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span> that this is a Government measure, and that 1t 
               <br />
               ought to be an open question. Why does he not retire from his seat then? i would not be

               Then I am sorry for the choice that has been made. Whv, Sir, the programme settled by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span> 
               <br />
               Government would leave it virtually an open question by referring the terms to a popular vote. _

               1 may have something to say upon that hereafter. I-low patriotic will the Honourable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> -

               the Honourable Member has my full per-mi 'ion to withdraw. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[Laughton]</span> I have alwavs been

               <br />
               getting the terms proposed, all will be right. I quote from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colonist</span> newspaper of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">20111</span> 
               <br />
               February, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1870,</span> in which the Honourable gentleman is made to say, “I hope the people will

               <br />
               have helped to build up town after town; but how are they now? Many of these towns which 
               <br />
               had the 000 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inhabitants</span> have almost none now. it will be the same with our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gold-mining</span>

               <br />
               bargain with Canada, by all means let us make it, and make it now. I like the word bargain, 
               <br />
               it sounds like business. What did the Honourable Member for Victoria <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span> at the last election?— 
               <br />
               “ Don‘t let us have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation.</span> for we shall have a surplus revenue of $100,000 in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1869,</span> and 
               <br />
               we will do better without Confederation.” Confederation was inopportune then. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">There</span> was a
