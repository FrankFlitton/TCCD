               <br />

               <br />
               under a despotism, or what is equivalent to it. I have been in this Colony nearly eleven years; 
               <br />
               I am satisfied that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">want</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Responsible</span> Government. Hon. Members say there are 
               <br />
               different forms of Responsible Government; admitted. I am not sure that it would be advisable 
               <br />
               to introduce any one system in its entirety here. Hon. Members have been quoting <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">writers</span> 
               <br />
               upon this subject; I will quote Lord <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Macaulay,</span> he says: <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“Government,</span> like a good coat, is fit 
               <br />
               for the body for which it is made.” I say if we cannot live on Responsible Goverinnont, we 
               <br />
               cannot live on irresponsible Government. I do not know what is shadowed forth in His 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">chellency‘s</span> speech; I confess I cannot understand it. If the Governor had promised a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">two«</span> 
               <br />
               thirds elective House, with heads of department sitting to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> information without voting, 
               <br />
               then I think the question of Responsible Government would never have been considered. I 
               <br />
               ask I-lon. Members to endeavour to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">approximate,</span> and if they cannot agree to full Responsible 
               <br />
               Government, then to give us as liberal a form as they can. If you withhold Responsible

               Government you lose Confederation.

               Hon. MR. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ROBSON—Mr.</span> Chairman, in rising to reply to what has fallen from Hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen in opposition to Responsible Government, I crave the kind indulgence of this House; 
               <br />
               and should I. in the course of my remarks, appear unduly harsh or unkind, I beg <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon!</span> gentle- 
               <br />
               men to attribute it to earnestness in advocating a great cause, 'ather than to a desire to wound 
               <br />
               the feelings of any. The Hon. Member for Cariboo, who is also a Member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the Executive, 
               <br />
               made a very convenient, yet, to my mind, snigularly incﬂ'ective, reply to one point in my 
               <br />
               speech of Friday. I had, or fancied I had, with considerable force and elabo <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘oteness,</span> pointed 
               <br />
               out the difﬁculties that might naturally be presumed to lie in the way of obtaining Responsible 
               <br />
               Government under the new constitution proposed to be conferred upon this Colony; and the 
               <br />
               only answer is that the Organic Act makes the necessary provision. 1 was as well aware of 
               <br />
               the provision made in that Act before the Hon gentleman spoke as after; but no attempt has 
               <br />
               been made to meet the difﬁculties I suggested. The Hon. gentleman, with that facetiousness, 
               <br />
               poetry and ready wit for which he is so justly celebrated, proceeded to point out the undesir- 
               <br />
               ablencss of Responsible Government in this Colony. Under it, he told us, Cabinets would be 
               <br />
               too versatile. In fact, he described the working of such institutions as a sort of dissolving 
               <br />
               views, a thimble-rigging operation, “now you see it, now you don’t,” in such quick succession 
               <br />
               would the changes be rung. The Chief Commissioner would, it appeared from his description, 
               <br />
               be much like Lincoln’s cclcb'ated ﬂea. Now, Sir, where did the Hon. gentleman acquire his 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">experience</span> of the working of Responsible Government? Was it not in Canada? What do 
               <br />
               we find to be the experience of that country? ('fcrtainly it does not in any way warrant the 
               <br />
               conclusions arrived at by my Hon. friend. On the contrary, we ﬁnd a change of Ministry <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> 
               <br />
               be of very rare occurrence. The present Premier of Canada has, with one. unimportant inter— 
               <br />
               mission, been at the head of the Government for some twelve or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fourteen</span> years! <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">As</span> I stated 
               <br />
               on a former occasion, the people of British Columbia <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> not politicians, nor are they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fond</span> of 
               <br />
               change. They are naturally conservative. Give them a people’s Government. and in no part 
               <br />
               of ller Majesty‘s Colonial Empire will a less versatile. a more conservative and loyal people be 
               <br />
               found. The Honourable gentleman said Responsible Government would blow the chaff into this 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> although I listened with pleasure,as I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">always</span> do. to that gentleman‘s oratory and 
               <br />
               humour. I could not but e. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">)erience</span> a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feeling</span> of regret to ﬁnd him on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wrong</span> side of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> 
               <br />
               question. taking a false <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stop.</span> It is sad to witness the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">early</span> mistakes of a young man of such 
               <br />
               talents. ambition. and promise; and when I hear such words <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">coming</span> from my I-Ion. friend, I begin 
               <br />
               to fear that the bright future. the brilliant political career I had marked out for him <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may</span> never 
               <br />
               be realized. Sir. a certain proportion of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">chaff</span> may be blown into this House. under Respon- 
               <br />
               sible Government, as is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ease</span> now; but, depend upon it, under the form of government we 
               <br />
               seek, the chaff would quickly be blown out at the back door, before the breath of public opinion. 
               <br />
               The people can always discriminate between wheat and chaff. and Responsible Government 
               <br />
               supplies the most ctch ive winnowing-fzui with which to separate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> two. We were reminded 
               <br />
               by that Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> that Responsible Govarmncnt had its failures as well as its successes; 
               <br />
               and he referred to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Victoria,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Australia,</span> and to Jamaica, as instances of failure. Now. I cannot 
               <br />
               but think the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lion.</span> gentleman has been singularly unfortunate in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">going</span> to these Colonies to 
               <br />
               prove his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">i'iroposition.</span> The former ranks amongst the most ﬂourishing. progressive, and 
               <br />
               wealthy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of.</span> all Her Majesty‘s Colonial possessions. Doubtless very grave political diiiiculties
