               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Member for Victoria District (Mr. leCosmos) says that equalization of labour, and of

               value of property and productions. will come about. I admit t it it may be so, but in my 
               <br />
               opinion it will not be for some years to come. If there is equalization of labour, there. will 
               <br />
               also be equalization of taxation and ofﬁces. The Local Government can lool: after this when 
               <br />
               it happens. I do not suppose that Canada will he disposed to look at our terms critically; 
               <br />
               they are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">getting</span> this Colony far too cheap; I think , <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">0,000</span> is too cheap. The Hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> DeCosmos) says that we should go to Canada and ask $80,000 per annum, because another 
               <br />
               Province has the same, and that this Colony, which is larger in extent of territory than the 
               <br />
               largest of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces,</span> should have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$80,000.</span> But the Hon. gentleman must recollect that we 
               <br />
               do not produce revenue equal to what the other Provinces produce. With regard to the limit 
               <br />
               of population for the. purposes of representation, 1 thinl: 400,000 is too small; it ought to have 
               <br />
               been 1.000.000. not indeﬁnite. 120.000 gives us the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">right</span> to have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eight</span> members to represent 
               <br />
               us; th is a matter of expediency. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">There</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> a fault in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Resolution</span> to which I will draw 
               <br />
               attention, it is this, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> we do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">got</span> any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">him</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Revenue</span> to the Colony until we get 
               <br />
               a population of over 120,000 persons. We have to calculate what our Revenue will he now 
               <br />
               under Confederation. and we cannot look for any increase for years to come. Whichever way 
               <br />
               we look at it. the figures <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">come</span> back to the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thing.</span> we want <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$230,000,</span> and there are several
