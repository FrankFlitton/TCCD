               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">)ongress,</span> who has no vote. Dakota, another Territory, has been refused admission as a State 
               <br />
               until it has a population larger than it now possesses. I am just reminded about Alaska, 
               <br />
               which is not even a Territory <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">yet.</span> General Thomas reported <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> giving it any other than 
               <br />
               a military form of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> How can we. then, expect Responsible Government with our 
               <br />
               population? I know that there are Honourable Members wavering; their interests tell them 
               <br />
               to vote one way, their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conscience</span> points to another. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say.</span> vote according to your conscience. 
               <br />
               I say that a village can never have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Responsible</span> Government. I maintain that it would prove 
               <br />
               a curse, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">through</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agitation</span> that would follow, instead of a blessing. I coincide with the 
               <br />
               Honourable Member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> Westminster as to what he says as to callous hands. I believe 
               <br />
               there are men with tattered garments in the upper country quite capable of giving a sensible 
               <br />
               vote upon all questions likely to come before a Council in this Colony; but we ﬁnd that they 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*too</span> much to do; they have no time for politics; they have to earn <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> own bread. I 
               <br />
               believe that the Honourable Member for Caribou has uttered the true sentiments of the great 
               <br />
               majority of the district. I do not believe that Cariboo is favourable to Responsible Govern- 
               <br />
               ment. Those gentlemen with the patched garments and callous hands have the same oppor- 
               <br />
               tunitythat the Member for New Westminster has had of coming into the House. He has 
               <br />
               told us with pride of his hard work as a pioneer on the Fraser River; and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> we hear him 
               <br />
               advocating, with most eloquent language, his views upon this great question. His voice has 
               <br />
               had much to do with shaping the councils of this House. and, I ask. are these doors shut to 
               <br />
               any man in the Colony of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">equal</span> talent with the Honourable gentleman, who can be found 
               <br />
               willing to devote their time to the service of their country? I do not feel in the servile 
               <br />
               position or being obliged to vote one way or the other. i am as free to vote as the Honourable 
               <br />
               Member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">himself.</span> I shall give my vote to the best of my ability. I believe that no compul- 
               <br />
               sion has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">brought</span> to bear upon any Member of this House, ofﬁcial or otherwise. The 
               <br />
               hr or part of the speech of the Honourable gentleman <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Robson) is hardly worthy of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">former.</span> It contains language which I am very sorry he has used; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">language</span> which makes me 
               <br />
               believe that it is not from conviction, but that it is intended to go forth to the world to stir 
               <br />
               up the people; excellent stump oratory, if. without intending the slightest disrespect. I may 
               <br />
               use the term. I believe it is not the wish of the property owners of Victoria to' have Respon- 
               <br />
               sible Government. Do you <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suppose,</span> Sir, that property owners are going, willingly, to entrust 
               <br />
               their interests to persons of whom they know <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nothing?</span> I do not dread professional politicians; 
               <br />
               I believe they are as useful as any other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prof</span> ional men in their way; but I sa as a 
               <br />
               fact, there are no politicians here with the exception of those who have devoted their time to 
               <br />
               politics Why, I ask, is there so great an antipathy to leaving this question for the people to 
               <br />
               decide at the polls? "' Give us,” says the other side, “ an opportunity of educating ourselves, 
               <br />
               so that our mistakes, when made, may be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">remediec</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">9'</span> I say that there is no better education 
               <br />
               than this Council, in which Hon. Members have education before they Come to Responsible 
               <br />
               Government; for under the scheme foreshadowed by the Governor. the position will be very 
               <br />
               little inferior to Responsible Government. Depend upon it, if the Canadian Government think 
               <br />
               we can manage Responsible Govermnent they will give it to us—thcy will be glad to get rid 
               <br />
               of the question. I say, however, this question is being <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agitated</span> at an inopportune time. i, 
               <br />
               for one, would not consent to trust my interests to any such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">change.</span> I do not believe in the 
               <br />
               present form of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> but if the form foreshadowed by the Governor be carried out, it 
               <br />
               will give the people a ‘lll very little interior. as l have said, to Responsible Government, 
               <br />
               and inﬁnitely more we ble. I trust that, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">llon.</span> Members will give <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clue</span> weight to the remarks 
               <br />
               of other speakers who have preceded me upon the question. and will well consider their votes.

               <br />
               it never ought to have been in the terms. it presumes that this Colony is willing to go into

               or what: advantage it can possibly be to us. if we go into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> bound hand and foot
