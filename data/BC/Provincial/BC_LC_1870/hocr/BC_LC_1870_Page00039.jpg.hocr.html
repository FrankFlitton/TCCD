               Mr. Wood, in his usual gentlemanly way. It is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> of “Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proclivity"</span> As a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">native:</span> 
               <br />
               born Canadian, in common with others, I love the land of my birth We <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">admire</span> her institutions 
               <br />
               and revere her laws; but we never forget the land of our adoption, and we would no more 
               <br />
               consent to see her wronged by Canada than would the tens of thousands of Englishmen who 
               <br />
               have made Canada their home, permit a wrong to he done her by England.

               It is also wrong and contrary to fact that, “so anxious are we for Confederation that we 
               <br />
               would accede to any terms proposed.” During <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> past three years, I have been one of the 
               <br />
               foremost in advocating the cause of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation;</span> and, in so doing, throughout <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> interior 
               <br />
               of the Colony, I am free to confess I never uttered such a sentiment; and, in justice to my 
               <br />
               fellow-countrymen in particular, and the advocates of this cause in general, I will say that 
               <br />
               I never heard any one express a desire that this Colony should be confederated, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">except</span> on 
               <br />
               such terms as might, on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">investigation,</span> be found to be just and beneﬁcial.

               We desire <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> with Canada, because we believe that it will be to the interest 
               <br />
               of this Colony to unite with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">progressive</span> Colonies to the east. That they are progressive 
               <br />
               I assert, and as proof I point to the fact that, previous to Confederation, Canada proper had 
               <br />
               expended $184,000,000 on public works, principally in building canals. Up to 1869, $170,000,000 
               <br />
               had been expended in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">railways.</span> She pays to-day $300,000 yearly for her ocean steam mail 
               <br />
               service alone, and her <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enterprise</span> is followed by her people. Her manufactures are increasing 
               <br />
               yearly, and even now she is exporting cloths to England, and competing there with cheap 
               <br />
               labour. One firm alone, composed of men who landed in Canada penniloss, now has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$0,000,000</span> 
               <br />
               invested in ocean steamers, employing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">4500</span> men, and thus sustaining 22,000 persons. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Among</span> 
               <br />
               the objections <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">urged</span> by Hon. Members against Confederation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is.</span> our proximity to the United 
               <br />
               States. This, I hold, is no objection. Canadians are not taught to fear competition with the 
               <br />
               United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States.</span> The general feeling there is that we can hold our own (except in point of 
               <br />
               numbers) with her in any direction whatever. It is to her we look for a great portion of our 
               <br />
               trade, and the advantages of such trade are mutual. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">u</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The question is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">often</span> asked: “What are the immediate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advantages</span> to be derived by us 
               <br />
               from Confederation? " My reply is that, in addition to the amount paid us by way of subsidies, 
               <br />
               we will save by a reduction in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariff?</span> and by importing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canadian</span> manufactures, a very 
               <br />
               considerable sum, thus reducing our taxation. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Next,</span> the terms propose that $1,000,000 be spent 
               <br />
               on a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">waggon-road</span> to be commenced immediately and completed in three years, thus causing 
               <br />
               over $300,000 a year to be spent.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Hon. gentlemen will recollect that in 1801. 1862, and 1863, immigration poured in on us, 
               <br />
               caused by the report of rich discoveries in Cariboo, and by a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">knou‘Iledge</span> on the part of those 
               <br />
               coming that the Gove~nment was spending large sums on public works, and that those who 
               <br />
               failed in the mines n <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">0</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> fall back on the roads to replenish their purses; and many who are 
               <br />
               now permanent settlers in the interior acknowledge <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> they made their ” farm stake ” there. 
               <br />
               How much more is this likely to be the case if the larger works contemplated in the terms are 
               <br />
               carried out. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Then, Sir, look <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> the construction of a Railway. You may judge of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">magnitude</span> of the 
               <br />
               work <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">following</span> ﬁgures. There were employed on the Central Paciﬁc at one time 25,000 
               <br />
               men and 6,000 teams; 000 tons of material were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forwarded</span> daily to the point of construction; 
               <br />
               30 vessels in harbour at one time, loaded with material; the \vharves at San Francisco and 
               <br />
               Sacramento <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">loaded</span> with railway iron; 70 locomoti landed, and 700 cars built to carry on 
               <br />
               the work on construction account; no less than 30 sawmills in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">operation</span> at one point at one 
               <br />
               time. The enterprise that set this enormous trade in motion is not one of greater magnitude 
               <br />
               than will be the work undertaken on this side, and if our farmers and population generally do 
               <br />
               not profit, and that immediately, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">carrying</span> on of such enterprises as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> let them 
               <br />
               succumb, for I know of no state of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prosperity</span> that can help them. I contend the beneﬁts 
               <br />
               of Confederation, in these respects at least, will be immediate. But <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I'lon.</span> Members have said 
               <br />
               “the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States</span> will derive the benefit.” If that argument holds good, why not tell the 
               <br />
               merchants of Wharf Street to close their doors because foreign nuinufacturcrs reap a part of 
               <br />
               the beneﬁt of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> trade. Better, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">21</span> great deal, for the opponents of this cause to advise the 
               <br />
               farmers to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cultivate</span> every inch <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">farms</span> and garner up their crops, for the day <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assuredly</span> 
               <br />
               will come when they will have ample market for all they can raise. 
               <br />

               It has been urged here <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> Canada cannot retain her population, much less the immigra-
