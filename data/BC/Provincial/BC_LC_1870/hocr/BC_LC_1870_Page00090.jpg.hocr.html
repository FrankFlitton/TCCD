               Hon. MR. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">DECOSMOS-d</span> remark. Mr. Chairman, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> there is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">considerable</span> contrast 
               <br />
               between the views of two Hon. Members of the Executive Council. I mean the Hon. Chief 
               <br />
               Commissioner (Mr. Trutch) and the Hon. Member for Victoria City (Dr. Helmeken). The 
               <br />
               former says that it is not proposed to construct <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a‘Ilailway</span> with reference to local interests. 
               <br />
               He says to advocate our own local interests i.. simply inapposite. I think differently. I think 
               <br />
               that we should deal with it locally as well as nationally. I presume it is put in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terms»</span> 
               <br />
               because it is expected that it will beneﬁt the Colony. We don’t care so much for its beneﬁting 
               <br />
               the people of Montreal as for beneﬁting ourselves; we look at it from a British Columbian 
               <br />
               point of view. I say with the Hon. Member for Victoria City (Dr. Iielmcken), that we should 
               <br />
               deal with it with reference to British Columbion interests. After the discussion of yesterday, 
               <br />
               I confess my surprise. I thought from the tenor of the Resolutions that the Canadian Govern- 
               <br />
               ment would construct the line. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> we are informed by the Hon. Chief Commissioner that 
               <br />
               it will be undertaken by a private company. Then, he says if we cannot get a Railway we 
               <br />
               must have an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">equivalent.</span> If this clause is not a ﬁxed principle in the terms, then, I ask, 
               <br />
               what do the Government propose as an equivalent? With regard to Railway communication 
               <br />
               through British Columbia, we ought, in my opinion, to connect Kamloops and the adjacent 
               <br />
               country with the seaboard. That is, commencing at navigable water on Fraser River and ending 
               <br />
               at Savona’s Ferry, Kamloops Lake. This line, at the utmost, is only 11-50 miles long. The 
               <br />
               expense of its construction, at $50.000 per mile, would be $7.500,000. We might safely approach 
               <br />
               the Canadian Government upon this, irrespective of the terms of Union, under the constitutional 
               <br />
               provision authorizing the Dominion Government to construct public works of this character. 
               <br />

               Hon. CHIEF <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">COMMISSIONER—l</span> say again that the scheme of this Railway, on which 
               <br />
               this clause is based, hangs on the construction of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">line</span> from the seaboard. I never said. and 
               <br />
               never intended to say, that we had no right to take into consideration whether or not local 
               <br />
               interests would be beneﬁted. I say that I would not dare to stand up here and advocate a 
               <br />
               special link of a special line. I should think if I did so that I was doing what the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canadian'</span> 
               <br />
               Government could not listen to. But in a great scheme which contemplates a line of Railway 
               <br />
               from the seaboard of British Columbia to Canada, 1 consider that the Dominion Government 
               <br />
               may take a broad View and strain a point to get it. This clause has been drawn without pre- 
               <br />
               tending to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">define</span> the route. I did not say that it was proposed that the line should be built 
               <br />
               by a private company. I said that it suggested itself to my mind that the line would be built 
               <br />
               by a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">private</span> company. not that it was so proposed. I do not disregard local interests I look 
               <br />
               upon this Railway as a necessity of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">positionw—n</span> means to the end. I do not advocate it on 
               <br />
               its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">merits</span> as to local interest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> but as a grand scheme of Transcontinental ltailwz <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'.</span> Why, Sir, 
               <br />
               some say that the terminus should be brought to Esquimalt or Xanaimo. A Railway is wanted 
               <br />
               in the interests of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederacy.</span> but the locality has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">generalized</span> as much as possible 
               <br />
               by the Government. This brings me to anolher point: <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">though</span> I look upon the Railway as a 
               <br />
               necessity of the position, in view of the approach of Confederation, 1 would not pledge myself 
               <br />
               to bind the Dominion Government to the special terms of this clause. I think it possible that 
               <br />
               terms may be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suggested;</span> instead of this condition, which may be found to be acceptable to the 
               <br />
               people of this Colony, to whom, as you know. His Excellen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’s</span> the matter must he referred. 
               <br />
               I do not look upon the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway</span> as uuessential. I say it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> essential; for without unity of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interests.Confederation</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cannot</span> endure. Ii' I did not think that under Confederation we should 
               <br />
               be governed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sal‘isfaclorily</span> and to our advantage, I would oppose C.‘&lt;mtederntion, and would 
               <br />
               advise its abandonment. I do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span> and I am not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">going</span> to bind myself, that unless that 
               <br />
               clause is granted by Canada I shall not vote for Confederation, although I think it essential
