               with population like England, where people cannot <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">find</span> work for their hands to do, I could 
               <br />
               conceive it likely that we might acquire population through Canada, but I cannot see how we 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can</span> gain population unless a Railway were not only commenced, but in such a state of progress 
               <br />
               as to be a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">means</span> and inducement for population to come into the country, and this is not likely, 
               <br />
               in my opinion, to be the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">case,</span> I have listened to what my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Honourable</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">colleague</span> has said about 
               <br />
               the agricultural interests, and I entirely coincide with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">him,</span> Our farmers cannot compete with&lt; 
               <br />
               the farmers of the United States under the Canadian Tariff. In the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">United</span> States, farmers <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">V</span> 
               <br />
               are able to get everything that they want within their own country, whilst here everything <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">V</span> 
               <br />
               comes from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">abroad.</span> Until the farmers of this Colony can make everything that they require 
               <br />
               for their own use, they cannot compete with those of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">United</span> States. We can always import <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&lt;</span> " 
               <br />
               American goods, even under a heavy duty, cheaper than Canadian goods, and this, Sir, will put 
               <br />
               this Province under a different condition as compared with other Provinces. 
               <br />

               Let us then suppose this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> scheme carried out; we will consider the sacriﬁce 
               <br />
               completed, the victim decorated with the conditions which have been graciously accorded by 
               <br />
               the more powerful contracting party. What will become of our farmers? I refer more 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">particularly</span> to the farmers of the Island and of the Lower Fraser. This class I look upon 
               <br />
               as the bone and sinew of the country. They, Sir, I say, will be driven out of their own market 
               <br />
               by the cheaper productions of the States. And, I would ask, what industry it is supposed will 
               <br />
               take the place of agriculture? Moreover, Sir, I would ask it we be confoderated upon these 
               <br />
               terms, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">what:</span> guarantee has the Colony that the terms will be carried out? We all know that 
               <br />
               when compacts are made between a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">large</span> and a small power, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">larger</span> can break the treaty 
               <br />
               with impunity when an emergency arises. Would Canada hesitate, in the event of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">havingr</span> to 
               <br />
               repel a Fenian invasion, to abandon the Railway? We have no guarantee that the Dominion 
               <br />
               will carry out: the terms to which her statesmen may agree. We may be abandoned at any 
               <br />
               time. The beneﬁts of the larger Provinces of Canada will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">always</span> take precedence of those 
               <br />
               of British Columbia, whose representatives will he in a small minority. And I would never 
               <br />
               consent to Confederation on any terms without an Imperial guarantee that the terms would 
               <br />
               he observed and kept. History tells us that in a compact between a larger and smaller country, 
               <br />
               the smaller must go to the wall.

               At the present time, I think that any terms will be inimical to this Colony, on account <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Of!-</span>

               an equal vote in the Dominion Parliament with other Provinces; on account of the danger of

               our farming interests being killed and crushed; and on account of the unsettled state of the 
               <br />

               Imperial policy, but what of that? We are told that Great Britain desires to get rid of all
