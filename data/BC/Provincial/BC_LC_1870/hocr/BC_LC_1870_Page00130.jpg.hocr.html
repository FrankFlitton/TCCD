               Sir, that we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> come to a most important question, one that concerns our own country. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Coir</span> 
               <br />

               <br />
               passed by the people, they will produce great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ills.</span> I say that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agricultural</span> interests are most

               important; when we come to manufacturing interests it is different, they have made but little

               <br />
               different, I say that the farmers could not exist without protection; you will depopulate the

               country by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bringing</span> Confederation without protection. I have stated that this Colony <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affords</span>
