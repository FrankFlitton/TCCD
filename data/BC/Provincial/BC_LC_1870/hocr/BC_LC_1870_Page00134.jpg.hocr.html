               <br />
               with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation.</span> Then why, it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might’be</span> asked, was it not touched upon in the terms? 
               <br />
               Not because it has not been fully considered, but because the Organic Act puts it virtually 
               <br />
               out of the power of the Colony to prescribe what form of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariif</span> we should have under Confed- 
               <br />
               eration. The scheme, as has been already pointed out by the Hon. Commissioner of: Customs, 
               <br />
               is based on the transfer of the control of our Customs <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> Canada; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">therefore,</span> it is not within

               <br />
               special tariff for this Colony; but this is a matter which is left open for the consideration of

               this Colony on its merits, and is left open, as the Hon. Member for Victoria has told you, for

               inserting any condition as to make it in fact a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sine</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mm</span> mm; but it is left open for this Council 
               <br />
               to suggest what tariff would be suitable for this Colony. The Hon. Mr. Wood has discussed this

               matter on its abstract merits, as if it was in our power to dictate to Canada what tariff we

               <br />
               It is for 1 '0 consider what tariff would best suit us in or out of Confederation; but it is not 
               <br />
               allowed to us to prescribe to the Dominion what form of Customs duties they shall adopt in 
               <br />
               this Colony, or in this Province, as it will be. We have placed the control of the matter out

               <br />
               this reason: We. as being acquainted with the wants of the place, are best able to point out

               <br />
               of tariff and free port in the abstract. and the Government invite the freest discussion on 
               <br />
               the point, both as regards protection to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agriculture</span> and manufactures, and free port. But I 
               <br />
               believe it will be better for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colony</span> to leave the decision and the remedy for the evils to 
               <br />
               those who will have the care of this Province, as well as the Eastern <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces.</span> I think it 
               <br />
               will be to the interest of statesmen in the Dominion to treat this Colony well. Instead of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feeling</span> any want of conﬁdence in those statesmen. I feel sure that every possible measure to 
               <br />

               <br />
               decide what will be most beneﬁcial to this Colony, even in regard to tariff. I would rather hear
