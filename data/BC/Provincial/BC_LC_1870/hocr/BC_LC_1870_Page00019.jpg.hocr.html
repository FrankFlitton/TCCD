               Council, if I did not believe that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> would prove advantageous to this Colony, and 
               <br />
               redound to the benefit of our local interests, I should not support it by my voice. I might as

               <br />
               to speak for it and to advocate it as heartin as I do. It is hardly possible to show where the 
               <br />
               colony will be beneﬁted by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation,</span> without discussing the terms, which is not my present 
               <br />
               intention to do; but I promise Honourable Members that if these Resolutions get into Committee, 
               <br />
               I will fully <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfy</span> them of the local advantages that must accrue to the Colony from union with 
               <br />
               Canada, on the terms proposed in these Resolutions.

               I believe, Sir, that many of the objections which have been raised to Confederation have 
               <br />
               arisen from prejudiced feelings. I have no reason to be prejudiced against or partial to Canada. 
               <br />
               I believe that Canadians as a people are no better than others, and no worse. I have no ties 
               <br />
               in Canada, no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">particular</span> reason for entertaining any feeling of aftcction for Canada; and if 
               <br />
               1 did not believe that the advance which we make will be met in a becoming spirit, [“Hear, 
               <br />
               hear,”] then I should be of opinion that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> would be nothing more than on union 
               <br />
               on paper, one not beneficial to this Colony or to Canada. There are statesmen there, Sir, 
               <br />
               who know that it would be useless to try to beat us down on terms; for what would be the 
               <br />
               use of Confederation if it afterwards turned out that this Colony was injured, rather than 
               <br />
               beneﬁted, by it. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span>

               The Honourable Junior Member for Victoria asks what guarantee have we that the terms 
               <br />
               will be carried out. I say at once, Sir, that if the terms are not carried out, if the Canadian 
               <br />
               Government repudiate their part of the agreement, we shall be equally at liberty to repudiate 
               <br />
               ours. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[D12</span> Helmchcn—“How?”] We should, I maintain, be at liberty to change; but I, for 
               <br />
               one, do not approach this subject with any such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feeling.</span> [“ Hear, hear,” from Mr. DeCosmos.] 
               <br />
               There are always two sides to a bargain, and it the. terms which are frankly and honestly 
               <br />
               proposed are not fairly and honourably dealt with, we should, in my opinion, he at perfect liberty 
               <br />
               to draw <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">back,</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               There is, however, one real and practical objection which has always suggested itself to 
               <br />
               my mind from the first, and that is, that the same measures that apply to the circumstances 
               <br />
               of Canada, such as tariff, will not apply equally in all respects to this Colony. It will be asked, 
               <br />
               then, why is there no suggestion as to some alteration or modiﬁcation of the tariff in the terms. 
               <br />
               The reason is somewhat similar to the reason for the omission of all mention of Responsible 
               <br />
               Government. You would find it very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂicult</span> to come to any conclusions on this subject in 
               <br />
               this Council. It is impracticable to deﬁne now positively what precise <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariff</span> would best suit 
               <br />
               this country. Some favour a free port. I should be inclined to favour <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> myself if I believed 
               <br />
               it, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">practicable.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Some,</span> on the other hand, say that we must have protection to agriculture, and 
               <br />
               that without it we cannot compete with the farmers of Oregon. This point was fully discussed 
               <br />
               in the Executive Council, but it was decided to omit any conditions for the regulation of Customs 
               <br />
               dues from these terms; and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lao</span> not think that this measure ought to be complicated with the 
               <br />
               tariff question. I believe that we may safely trust this people with whom we are. about to 
               <br />
               negotiate, to do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> much for us in this direction as we could do for ourselves; it will be to 
               <br />
               their interest to do so. It requires no argument to show that it will be to the interest of 
               <br />
               Canada, after <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation,</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advance</span> the prosperity of this country. If it be possible to 
               <br />
               adopt a special tariff to this part of the Colony, and I see no reason why it should not be 
               <br />
               adopted, I conﬁdently hope to see. such a special tariff arranged under Confederation. [“ Hear,

               hear," from Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">DeCosmosJ</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Rely</span> upon it, Sir. that there are statesmen in Canada who have 
               <br />
               a far wider and longer political experience than Members of this House, and who would be 
               <br />
               able to point out many means of prosperity, for which we are looking with so much <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anxiety,—</span>

               <br />
               fail to see as plainly as we do that Confederation would be of no beneﬁt to Canada unless it 
               <br />
               redound to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advantage</span> of British Columbia. This requires no argument; it is perfectly 
               <br />
               plain common sense. 
               <br />

               <br />
               is clearly expressed in Earl Granville’s despatch. He does not say you must confederate, 
               <br />
               whether you will or not; it is left to the people to decide this question for themselves; but he
