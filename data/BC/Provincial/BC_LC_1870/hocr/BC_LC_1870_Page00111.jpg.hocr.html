               other matters, if they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exercise</span> influence at all. it will be for the good of the country. A

               proper and reasonable matters. Responsible Government ought not to be a condition of Con-

               Imperial sanction to establish. But if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> is to depend on this question of Responsible

               Government, then I say let it be the test also of the reality of the supporters of Confederation.

               Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MK</span> ROBSON—I expect the privilege of a general reply, but I desire to explain, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now,</span> that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Chief Connnissioner has made an unfair use of what I said about “horny 
               <br />
               hands and patched garments.” I disclaim having used it in that connection attributed to me;

               his remarks are unfair.

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">WALKEM—J</span> think on an important question of this kind every member should 
               <br />
               give a reason for his vote. I have given the matter great consideration, and had intended 
               <br />
               entering somewhat fully into the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discussion,</span> but the Hon. Chief Commissioner has anticipated 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">me.</span> I have been utterly astonished as I listened to what fell from him. I entirely coincide 
               <br />
               with him in his argument and in his views. Indeed. I can hardly help thinking that either 
               <br />
               he has copied my notes or I his. I must congratulate myself on coming to this conclusion. 
               <br />
               On the same ground I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">congratulate</span> the House on the good temper, good taste, intelligence, 
               <br />
               and ability with which this question has been launched for discussion. The main speech 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“for</span> the Hon. Member for Victoria District did not dcign to express his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">viewsv—has</span> been 
               <br />
               that of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Member for New <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Westminster.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">As</span> I listened to that speech, Sir, one of 
               <br />
               the best ever uttered in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House.</span> I almost <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">felt</span> that for live long years I had been wrong,— 
               <br />
               he almost made a convert of me; but; upon looking a little more closely into it I ﬁnd <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> 
               <br />
               it is based upon false premises; his arguments are fallacious, and his conclusions wrong. The 
               <br />
               Hon. Member says that Responsible Government is a principle which may be applied either to 
               <br />
               the Great Eastern, or to a dairy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">churn.</span> or to a lady’s watch; that it is a principle capable of 
               <br />
               being carried out by three or three hundred. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">This</span> is utterly incorrect; it is not a principle, but 
               <br />
               a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">form,</span> one element of which is responsibility to the people. It is a form adopted by the people, 
               <br />
               but it does not follow, as a matter of induction, that it can be used or carried out in every 
               <br />
               place or by every community. In 1837 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> rebellion in Canada, for the purpose of acquiring 
               <br />
               Responsible Government, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tool;</span> place. The rebellion was raised and the question agitated 
               <br />
               simply for changing the form of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government,</span> What w <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> the population? It was in the 
               <br />
               neighbourhood of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2.000.000</span> in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">183’",</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2.500000</span> in 1861. Look at the difference of the 
               <br />
               population of this Colony; after deducting the aliens and females, there is scarcely a voting 
               <br />
               population through the whole Colony of 3.000. Have the whole country mapped out and show 
               <br />
               me how much further the Governor can go in usefully <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extending</span> the representation. We 
               <br />
               have nine members, and out of these nine, under Responsible Government, we should have to 
               <br />
               elect a Colonial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Secretar,</span> ll] Attorney-General, a Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works, 
               <br />
               and probably two other Cabinet Ministers; altogether ﬁve in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁce,</span> and four <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">struggling</span> for 
               <br />
               power. Make the whole number eighteen and you then have a constant struggle for power; a 
               <br />
               struggle such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as.</span> we have not had in this Colony before. and such as I hope we shall not see. 
               <br />
               There are virtually two ends of the Colony which represent all the wealth and property of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">community—Yictoria</span> and Cariboo. Cariboo would be contending for the repeal of road tolls, 
               <br />
               and \‘ictoiia would be contending that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> ought to be paid. it may be said that these 
               <br />
               general <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">questions</span> of taxation will be left to the Dominion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> but there are many 
               <br />
               other subjects which will create <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differences</span> between the two ends of the Colony. The Hon. 
               <br />
               Member for New Westminster says if we go in without Responsible Government we shall go 
               <br />
               in with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agitation,</span> Does any one believe that if we had Responsible Government to-niorrow. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">politicians</span> will have no subject on which to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agitate.</span> Political agitation will never <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cease.</span> Let 
               <br />
               us go further. As the Honourable Chief Commissioner s ys, we have the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States</span> advo— 
               <br />
               cating Responsible Government, and that form of it which is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aid</span> to be the best in theory, 
               <br />
               a form in reality democratic; but the people are not educated to the extent of the principle 
               <br />
               1' 11?. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Americans</span> are averse not only to granting small but large territories the freedom 
               <br />
               which we now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ask,</span> They say: “You shall be a Territory until you are properly educated.“
