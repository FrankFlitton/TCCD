               any remarks I may be enabled to offer will proceed rather from a sense of duty to my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con»</span> 
               <br />
               stituents and to my country than from any hope of changing the views or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inﬂuencing</span> the vote of 
               <br />
               any Honourable Member. What is Responsible Government? I have been led to believe that 
               <br />
               considerable confusion of ideas exists upon this point; and I was the more impressed with this 
               <br />
               upon listening to the remarks ot the Honourable Member for Cariboo, a few days ago. That 
               <br />
               Honourable gentleman compared. the introduction of Responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> into this Colony 
               <br />
               to applying the machinery of the Great Eastern to a dairy churn. Now, Sir, Responsible 
               <br />
               Government is not a quantity; it is a principle; and as such it is applicable to the Great Eastern <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> 
               <br />
               or to a dairy churn,-—capable of being applied to a tiny lady‘s watch. It is a principle 
               <br />
               admirably adapted to the largest communities in the Old <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">World.</span> It. is a principle admirably 
               <br />
               adapted to the smallest communities in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> World. it is a principle that may be worked 
               <br />
               out in a cabinet of a hundred. It is a principle which may be successfully worked out in 
               <br />
               a cabinet of three. Without it no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> can. in the true sense, be called a people‘s 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government.</span> All true Governments derive their power from the people. All true Govern- 
               <br />
               ments must be responsible to the people. Responsible Government is, then, a principle which 
               <br />
               may be adapted to, and successfully worked out <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in,</span> this community. If this proposition is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">incontrovertible,</span> which i maintain it: is. who can say that British Columbia is not large 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enough</span> for Responsible Government? There are men here of ability to form a Cabinet. The 
               <br />
               Cabinet of the clay is, under the responsible system, the Government, just so long as it has the 
               <br />
               confidence of a majority of the representatives of the people in the House. In the event of 
               <br />
               that: conﬁdence <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">being</span> lost. one of two courses is open: The Ministers place their resignation 
               <br />
               in the hands of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Governorx</span> who commonly calls upon a prominent member of the opposition 
               <br />
               to i'orm a Ministry; or, it they believe that the House does not truly represent the people 
               <br />
               upon the question at issue, they advise a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dissolution</span> and an appeal to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country</span> What 
               <br />
               would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Responsible</span> Government have to do here? In dealing with this question <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3:,</span> of course, 
               <br />
               assume British Columbia to be a Province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the Dominion; and, I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confess,</span> that were it 
               <br />
               otherwise, were it proposed to remain a sopa-ate Colony, the case would be different. I do 
               <br />
               not say that even then I would not advocate the introduction of Responsible Government, 
               <br />
               but that advocacy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might</span> be less hearty and less ﬁrm. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Regarding</span> British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Columbia</span> as a 
               <br />
               Province of the Dominion, the chief objections are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">memoved</span> by the removal to Ottawa of all 
               <br />
               those larger and more complex <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">questions</span> of legislation which might threaten to crack the brain 
               <br />
               of our embryo statesmen. The Local Government would alone have to deal with local questions, 
               <br />
               and thus it would have very simple duties to discharge—scarccly more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁcult,</span> in fact, than 
               <br />
               those falling wi Iin the functions of a large municipality in Canada. Are the people in British 
               <br />
               Columbia ﬁt [or it? And here I would express my sincere regret that the representative of 
               <br />
               Her Majes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">_'</span> in this Colony has felt it to be his duty to pronounce an adverse opinion. I will 
               <br />
               yield to no one, either in this House or out of it, in entertaining a high respect for His Excellency, 
               <br />
               i'or his talent, experience. antl honesty of purpose; but I do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say—and</span> I say it with respect, 
               <br />
               more in sorrow than in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oxygen—«that:</span> I cannot think his knowledge of the people of this Colony 
               <br />
               was such as to justify him in so early <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pronouncing</span> upon their fitness for self-government.
