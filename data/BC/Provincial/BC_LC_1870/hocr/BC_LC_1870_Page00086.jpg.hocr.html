               <br />
               entertain such a supposition is, if I may be allowed the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expression,</span> an outrage on common 
               <br />
               sense too absurd to be for a moment seriously entertained. Would the Imperial Government 
               <br />

               the Imperial Government never broke faith yet, and both are pledged to the fulﬁlment of this 
               <br />
               condition. Canada has hitherto gone in advance of her word. The disl‘rustt‘ul views of the 
               <br />
               Hon. junior Member for Victoria (Mr. Drake) are so manifestly unjust that, as it is impossible 
               <br />
               that they can arise from ignorance, I may be pardoned for attributing them to wilfulness, to 
               <br />
               a rabid sense of opposilion, and a chronic feeling of distrust. To ask the President of the 
               <br />
               United States to endorse a scheme which emanates from the Imperial Government. I look 
               <br />
               upon as a monstrous <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ill~tinied</span> joke, against which reason and argument are powerless. I 
               <br />
               cannot—we cannot discuss it, Now, to go to the ways and means. Why, Sir, it is well 
               <br />
               known that Canada is rich. Does the Hon. Member know that Ontario and Quebec have 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$4,000,000</span> lying idle at this moment, carrying low interest. There is plenty of capital in 
               <br />
               Canada at this moment to build the Paciﬁc Railway, The reason why Canada uses the 
               <br />
               Imperial guarantee for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">£300.000</span> is this: She can borrow cheaper through the Imperial 
               <br />

               <br />
               public works. It pays her to do so. It is simply a beneﬁcial ﬁnancial operation,

               Canadian statesmen are very like all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">others,</span> Canada acts <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">through</span> her Ministers. Those now

               in power are, so far as we know, favourable to this scheme. But, without imputing motives, it
