               It is astonishing to find what a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">change</span> has come over the Hon. Mr. DeCosmos since he 
               <br />
               changed his city seat for a rural seat. He is becoming less capable of takiJg a statesmanliko

               <br />
               is, after all, the proper way. I cannot think that this House, with the small representative 
               <br />
               element that it has, should be asked to decide this point. I say that the tendency of the

               <br />
               the tendency of Canadian policy is towards free trade. Now, I believe, that a great British 
               <br />
               Empire is to be established on this Continent,—the Greater Britain; and I believe that all

               believe it to he of the fist importance that there should be a free port <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">here.</span> By a free port

               <br />
               sition. If it should be decided that a free port would conduce to the interest of the Province

               and, consequently, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">torthe</span> interest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the Dominion, why should not we have it? Why should

               not venture to say how far; with one foot planted on the Atlantic and the other on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Pacific,</span>
