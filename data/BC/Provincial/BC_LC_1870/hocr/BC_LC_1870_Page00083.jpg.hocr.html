               in the year. It must go to Montreal, on the north side of Lakes Superior and Huron. It will 
               <br />
               cost $100,000,000 to construct it to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lillie</span> Superior from Victoria. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now</span> a four per cent. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gum»</span>

               autee on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$100,000,000</span> will require Canada to impose additional taxation of $4,000,000 a year. 
               <br />
               Then you must remember that the wear and tear of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway</span> would not be met by the 
               <br />
               returns. Besides that, there are running expenses to he provided for. The United States 
               <br />
               Trans-continental Railway pays from the way stations in the populous districts through which 
               <br />
               it passes; we should have none, except a few people at the Red River and in British Columbia. 
               <br />
               A four per cent. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lguarantee</span> would be adding <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oneAthird</span> to the annual taxation of the Dominion. 
               <br />
               Then for the portion of Railway they will have to make from the west end of Lake Superior 
               <br />
               to Montreal, there would be required $50,000,000 more at four per cent. To meet these sums, 
               <br />
               therefore, there would have to be raised an annual sum of $6,000,000 by Canada; in other 
               <br />
               words they would have to add nearly ﬁfty per cent. to the present taxation of Canada. Do you 
               <br />
               think, Sir, they will ever do this, or that any Finance Minister would dare attempt it in the 
               <br />
               present state of Canadian ﬁnances? I call attention to this view of the subject in order to 
               <br />
               prevent false impressions getting abroad, and the creation of false hopes, which will only lead 
               <br />
               to disappointment. With all due deference to his professional knowledge, I deny the correctness 
               <br />
               of the estimate of the Chief Commissioner that this Railway will cost only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">two'thirds</span> of the 
               <br />
               United States <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Transcontinental</span> line. This is a more difficult line in my opinion, not an easier 
               <br />
               one, than the line over the Sierra Nevada. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Perhaps</span> part of the year we might get communi- 
               <br />
               cation, partly by steamboat and partly by railway, but for several months in the winter the 
               <br />
               water portion of the route would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">beyelosed</span> up. In the temper of this House and the temper 
               <br />
               of the Government, I do not expect "this Resolution of mine to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">go</span> up to the Government. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">how,</span> 
               <br />
               I want to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">utilize</span> our money, and to utilize our time. I estimate that a Railway from Fraser 
               <br />
               River to Kamloops would cost <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$50,000</span> a mile. According to the plan of the Chief Commissioner, 
               <br />
               with the expenditure of only $1,000,000 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:1</span> year, at the end of five years, it we started at Bur “1rd 
               <br />
               Inlet, we should get to Yan only, for which the water communication at present existing would 
               <br />
               sufﬁce, and consequently that time would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lost</span> Possibly it might be opened to the Rocky 
               <br />
               Mountains in ten years, if begun at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> Westminster as this scheme proposes It is our duty 
               <br />
               to open the interior country—Osoyoos, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Oltanagau,</span> Kanlloops, Similkameen, and other districts. 
               <br />
               Bring <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">theinterior</span> into communication with the seaboard, that would settle up the best portion 
               <br />
               of the interior, provide an outlet for produce, and keep the money that is new sent abroad 
               <br />
               within our own borders. The Government plan will injure, it not delay, the development of the 
               <br />
               country. I have no hope that my recommendation will pass, but still I have the satisfaction

               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feeling</span> that I have done my duty, '

               Hon. Mn. HOLBROOK—Sir, I rise to support the recommendation of the Hon. Member for 
               <br />
               Victoria District (Mr. DeCosmos). I quite agree with that Hon. gentleman that a Railway 
               <br />
               starting from the head of steamboat navigation, would he more useful than any other, If we 
               <br />
               have a Company spending $1,000,000 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">21</span> your in building a Railway which will open up the 
               <br />

               <br />
               and by commencing at the head of navigation we shall'reap the advantage in our lifetime. It 
               <br />
               will develope the Mainland. Agricultural land would be turned into proﬁtable use, and the
