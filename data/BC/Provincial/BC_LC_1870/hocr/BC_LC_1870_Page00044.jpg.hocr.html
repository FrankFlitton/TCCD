               <br />
               reason, hope to get the fruit. I say, Sir, that it is a gross libel upon the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intelligence</span> of the 
               <br />
               people of this Colony, to say that we are not ﬁtted for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Self»g0VGI“llllcllt,</span> In no country can

               <br />
               in this Colony. I hold, Sir, that the greatest enemies of the people are those who always 
               <br />
               endeavour to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hilazon</span> forth their learning. I am proud to say that I am of the people. My 
               <br />
               education, if not of so high a culture as that of some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon</span> Members of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House,</span> has at 
               <br />
               least enabled me, up to this time, to make my own way in the world, unaided by ofﬁcial pay 
               <br />
               and without the assistance of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">official</span> favour or inﬂuence. And when I hear Hon. Members 
               <br />
               speaking of the people as a class-unfit for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sell-governinent.</span> I ﬁnd it difﬁcult to believe that 
               <br />
               such a set of men are the same as have been speaking before, in this House and outside, on 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation.</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               In conclusion, Sir, I say fearlessly that Responsible Government is a sine qua non in the 
               <br />
               terms of Confederation. Place what conditions you will before the people, without the condition 
               <br />
               of Responsible Government, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> .is killed. '

               Confederation means to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ofﬁcial</span> Members a pension; to the people it means self-government; 
               <br />
               and I say, Sir, that above all things, we must keep in view the absolute necessity of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">keeping</span> 
               <br />
               control of our own local affairs. otherwise Confederation would be useless to the country;

               adduced; especially have I listened to every argument of those who are in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opposition,</span> and I 
               <br />
               believe that nothing remains unanswered—in fact, but a few crumbs are left for me. Another 
               <br />
               reason why I did not desire to make a speech is that my principles are pretty thoroughly 
               <br />
               known, and I deem it almost a work of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">supereroezltion</span> to reiterate my sentiments.

               serious turn. I think it right and proper to say a few words. Whoever knows me through this

               <br />
               to me to be replete with the greatest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interest,</span> and I trust that I may be spared to see this
