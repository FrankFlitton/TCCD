               number of passengers going from Canada to the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States,</span> he ‘has omitted to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> you the 
               <br />
               number of those passing from the States into Canada. One reason why Canada has not retained 
               <br />
               the whole number of emigrants landed on her shores, is that they ﬁnd greater <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attractions</span> in 
               <br />
               the treeless prairies of the Western States than in the heavily <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tinlbered</span> lands of Canada. 
               <br />
               This, Sir, has ever been a serious drawback to her. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2But</span> now the case is ditferent. Having 
               <br />
               acquired the vast territories of the great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">NortlrWest.</span> she will open them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to‘settlement,</span> and 
               <br />
               then she will have inducements to offer such as cannot be boasted of by any other country in 
               <br />
               the world. Open those millions of acres to the settler, and you will see such a rush of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">immi«</span> 
               <br />
               gration—uot only from the older countries of Europe. but from the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States—ms</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will.</span> 
               <br />
               astonish the world, and stand <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unparalleled</span> in the history of immigration. Canada’s hardy sons

               The diflicultiesoi‘ defence <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> been spoken of as a formidable obstacle. Sir, she never 
               <br />
               regarded them in any such light. Canada has no tears in that direction. She relies on the 
               <br />
               thorough good <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">understandingr</span> that has existed between herself and the United States for so 
               <br />
               long a period, as a guarantee for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">future.</span> Their interests are so identical that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they’</span> cannot 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attord</span> to quarrel. The troubles between them heretofore <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> been on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England’s</span> account, and 
               <br />
               not Canada’s, as witness the Trent affair, and the more recent Fenian invasion, which was 
               <br />
               rather a stab at England than an attack on Canada. During the recent fratrlcidal war in 
               <br />
               the United States, Canada had a diliicult part to play in maintaining strict neutrality, yet she 
               <br />
               came out unscathed. It must be remembered, also, that Canada possesses in her canal system 
               <br />
               a powerful <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lever~a</span> guarantee for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">peace~vastly</span> more potent than fortifications. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l’i‘he</span> great

               As to that “other issue ” (I will not use the word that has been so freely used outside), I

               have no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tears</span> for Canada or this Colony either. It used to be fashionable here, in early days, 
               <br />
               to associate the name of Canada with rebellion. It was the result of prejudice and ignorance,

               I recently read, Sir, an account of a meeting held in one of our principal Canadian cities, 
               <br />
               on the occasion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> a Sabbath school convention. An American gentleman was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">engaged</span> in 
               <br />
               addressing the house, ﬁlled to its utmost C ity. In the course of his remarks, having 
               <br />
               occasion to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">refer</span> to Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, he added :—~“Amorioan <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">though</span> I 
               <br />
               am, I can with all my heart say, ‘God bless the Queen.’ ” Inunediatoly, Sir, without any pre~ 
               <br />
               concerted action, the entire audience of men, women, and children rose to their feet and sung 
               <br />
               the National Anthem. That gentleman said, that such a spontaneous, hearty, and unanimous 
               <br />
               outburst of loyalty was probably never heard before.

               Such, Sir, is the kind of loyalty we were taught in Canada; such is the kind that is 
               <br />
               being taught to the rising generation of the new Dominion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to-day;</span> and I leave it to you as to 
               <br />
               whether there is room for that “other issue ” or not.

               Hon. Member for Victoria <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">District</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> the Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Attorncyﬂenoral.</span> that his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">center</span> 'on to 
               <br />
               Confederation was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">late.</span> I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">know</span> that it is impossile to make some Honourable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Members</span>

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">believe</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anythingy</span> good of Ofﬁcials, whether in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respect</span> of Confederation or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anything</span> else. But I 
               <br />
               simply desire to relate this fact. I had occasion to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">go</span> into the Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">A“(alley-Generals</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁce</span> 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1867',</span> and he then showed me a letter, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">written</span> by himself. in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">favour</span> of Confederation; and 
               <br />
               after <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perusingr</span> that letter I felt convinced that when, in his estimation, the proper time arrived, 
               <br />
               the cause would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> a warm and sincol'e <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advocate</span> in tho <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">AttorncyGene</span> ll. I mention this 
               <br />
               in order to show that the Hon. Member for Victoria District has no r ht to arrogate to 
               <br />
               himself that he was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> only man who was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">far-seeing</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enough</span> to recognize the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advantages</span> of 
               <br />
               Confederation three <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years</span> ago. and as a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">roprool’</span> to him for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">finding</span> fault with the position taken 
               <br />
               by Hon. Oliicial Members on this question now.

               To sum up. Sir, I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span> that amongst the statesmen of Canada we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may</span> safely look for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">men</span>
