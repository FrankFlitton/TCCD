               Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mn.</span> DnCOSMOS—I ask for a temporary subsidy of 000 per annum, to be 
               <br />
               diminished annually in amount, in proportion as our population shall exceed 40,000. New 
               <br />
               Brunswick has a temporary subsidy of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$03,000</span> for ten years. Nova Scotia <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> temporary subsidy 
               <br />
               of $82,000 for ten years. The grounds on which I ask a temporary subsidy for British 
               <br />
               Columbia are: firstly, that the cost: of living here is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">greater</span> than in the Eastern Provinces, 
               <br />
               and, consequently, public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oll‘icers</span> must be paid higher laries, and necessary s 'vices cost more 
               <br />
               in this country than there; secondly, our country ' <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">y</span> .ry large, and our population is small 
               <br />
               and widely scattered. and, consequently. requiring a larger staff <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oliit‘</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">11s</span> than a more compact 
               <br />
               and more populous community might require elsewhere; lastly, we require the additional 
               <br />
               temporary subsidy on the highest of all gromids—expediency, that has governed polit in all 
               <br />
               times and countries. Without a surplus of at least ., 0,000 per annum, the Local Government 
               <br />
               will be ahle to do nothing to advance the interests and settlement of the country. Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion would soon prove i ‘elf a source of disappointment, if there were no money spent annually 
               <br />
               for public works, immigration, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">education,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the.</span> A change, without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">financial</span> improvement, would 
               <br />
               destroy all hope of any such thing as the loyal and cordial co-operation of our people with 
               <br />
               the Government of the Dominion. Expediency, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">therefore,</span> demands the subsidy. and expedi- 
               <br />
               ency justiﬁes the demand. In concluding my remarks. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sir.</span> on this subject, I will brieﬂy 
               <br />
               contrast the terms proposed by the Government and the terms <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suggested</span> by myself. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment scheme. as I have shown, calls for only , 507, instead of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$304,050</span> as alleged. Of 
               <br />
               the former sum it can draw in subsidies <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1085</span> of $213,000 as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intimated</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> by 
               <br />
               the terms which I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> proposed the three subsidies, \ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hﬁxed</span> subsid $80000 per annum,

               adding thereto the reserved revenue (the do of which have been explained) <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$50,000,</span> the
