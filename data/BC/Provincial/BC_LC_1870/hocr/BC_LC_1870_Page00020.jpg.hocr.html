               The Hon, Mn. HOLBROOK said z—Sir, In rising to continue this debate, after the able 
               <br />
               speech of the Hon. Chief Commissioner of Lands and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Works,</span> I feel that there is little left for me 
               <br />
               to say. as when we go into Committee I shall have an opportunity of expressing my opinion upon 
               <br />
               the terms; and it would be factions to oppose a measure which has to come before the people 
               <br />
               for their decision. The way, Sir, that I understand the question of Confederation to stand at 
               <br />
               present, is that it is not a mere abstract question of Confederation with Canada, but a question 
               <br />
               of certain terms which have to be laid before the people; therefore, I say that any opposition 
               <br />
               against this being done would be factions As regards myself, I shall abide by such decision, 
               <br />
               whatever it may be, as I consider the people themselves are the best judges as to whether they 
               <br />
               will “benefit, or otherwise, by becoming part and parcel of the Dominion of Canada. This matter 
               <br />
               has evidently been well considered by the Executive Council, most of whom are largely interested 
               <br />
               in the welfare of the Colony, and several of them have been as much opposed to immediate 
               <br />
               Confederation, when the question has been before this Council on other occasions, as l have 
               <br />
               been. But having had an opportunity of seeing the documents which have come from the 
               <br />
               Imperial Government on the subject. the Executive have arrived at the decision that it is best 
               <br />
               for this question to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">go</span> to the country, upon the assumption that the people will ask for Confed- 
               <br />
               eration to be carried out on certain terms; therefore, I say. Sir, let it go to the people and 
               <br />
               settlers of the Colony, and by their verdict let it be decided. Earl Granville has sent out a 
               <br />
               despatch which states, in pretty plain terms, that we were not able to govern ourselves; and 
               <br />
               there was, perhaps, more truth than poetry in this; for we have had the greatest liberty granted 
               <br />
               to us. and yet we have not been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">content.</span> Our Gold Mining Laws have been made by the Mining 
               <br />
               Board; we have had the most liberal Land Laws; and if we have had a want that the law 
               <br />
               could satis <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">5</span> it has been immediately granted. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ofﬁcials</span> are an honour to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">As</span> an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Englishman.</span> I am proud of them. 
               <br />
               Justice has been properly administered in the country; there has been absolutely security to

               life and property so much so that a man can travel in perfect safety from Cariboo to Victoria,

               that under it we should not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">even</span> have representation. as without a certain population, which
