               or not suffer, they insist upon it. I say nothing now of my convictions. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’</span> I think, however, that 
               <br />
               the theory of free trade goes too far. “ Free trade ” is quoted as if it were a golden rule. I 
               <br />
               believe that free trade is an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exceedingly</span> elastic idea; there is no orthodoxy in it. It is not a 
               <br />
               law of physics, like the law of gravitation, or some abstruse and elaborate theory like Sturn‘s 
               <br />
               problem. or the stability of the eccentricity of the planetary orbits, to which there is no exception. 
               <br />
               It is elastic, and suits one country and not another; it suits old countries and not new; it suits 
               <br />
               .England for the reasons I have stated. Her <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">manufactures</span> are her staples. She can undersell 
               <br />
               the world. People may say that free trade is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">applicable</span> equally to other places and to all 
               <br />
               classes of industries As to this, I have my own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opinions,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">But</span> so far as this discussion is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">coin</span> 
               <br />
               corned, I deal with the world as I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">find</span> it. New countries desire protection. Why? No matter 
               <br />
               why—they do desire it. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Dealing</span> with protection in a moderate way, I think it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may</span> be 
               <br />
               reasonably conceded that a moderate protection, in the way of customs duties at 
               <br />
               least, may he applied to staple productions and agriculture. But whether the opinion 
               <br />
               be sound or not, colonial experience shows us that this is the line of argument 
               <br />
               pursued and acted <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on.</span> Taking it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> granted, as admitted by some political writers 
               <br />
               of eminence, that we may reasonably protect staples until they can support themselves, 
               <br />
               let us see what legitimate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">protection</span> may be afforded to existing interests in this Colony. 
               <br />
               Agriculture may be protected, or rather fostered, in numbers of ways~—by facilities for the 
               <br />
               acquisition of land, by roads, by immigration of farm hands, by the admission <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> implements 
               <br />
               free, and by a moderate tari ‘on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">produce.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Agriculture,</span> it must be remembered, is not only the 
               <br />
               cultivation of the land; it is bound up with local interests, and carries with it a local population 
               <br />
               attached to the soil. It you want population localized you must encourage agricultural interests. 
               <br />
               Besides this, it must not be lost sight of that it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> practical remedy against poverty. If a man 
               <br />
               has certain faculties for acquiring or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">being</span> employed as a labourer on land, he need never go to 
               <br />
               the poor—house; it humanizes men. It is the duty of every politician to protect agricultural 
               <br />
               interests in a new country, to the best of his power. Now, with regard to staples: <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> say they 
               <br />
               may reasonably be protected and fostered in their infancy, because they are the real wealth of 
               <br />
               the nation. It is said that at ﬁrst the wool interest of Australia was carried on at a loss; and 
               <br />
               for a country like this, that can produce without limit, ﬁsh, lumber, and coals, to say nothing of 
               <br />
               gold, we must give all the facilities in our power to induce industry in these walks of life. Take 
               <br />
               the gold miner: We might give him his gold license cheap, and make the acquisition of claims 
               <br />
               easy; provide him with roads and trails; and in this way we might “protect” the miner and 
               <br />
               encourage mining interests. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Fisherieswhow</span> are they to be protected? By the promotion of 
               <br />
               information as to markets for ﬁsh; by pushing those markets; by local knowledge of the haunts 
               <br />
               of ﬁsh; by cheap implements, and by cheap salt. To promote the lumber interest, we might 
               <br />
               give cheap machiney, so far as we can. by admitting it free, and let persons acquire land easily. 
               <br />
               Shipwrights might also be legitimately protected and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">encouraged</span> by making implements and 
               <br />
               materials cheap, and by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">giving</span> encouragement to docks. Let us do everything to promote the 
               <br />
               - interests of ships. Where there are such natural inlets as ours, with coal at hand, and facilities 
               <br />
               for the importation of iron and steel for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">building</span> ships, we could build cheaper than anywhere 
               <br />
               on this coast; not. of course, so cheaply as on the Clyde, but still we might attract some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ship~</span> 
               <br />
               builders. Now as to trade— \port trade. This is surely an item, though possibly a small item, 
               <br />
               in our wealth; yet still, if we export only to Puget Sound, we might encourage such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commerce.</span> 
               <br />
               It is.an industry and a source of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wealth;</span> it causes foreign ships to come, and causes an expendi~ 
               <br />
               ture of money in our ports; it adds to the number of merchants, drays, and labourers, and 
               <br />
               increases <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">general</span> husin <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> ; a vitality is given by it which makes it an element of wealth; it 
               <br />
               seems to have been beneficial here, and certain it is that it is estimated in this Colony as a 
               <br />
               material <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interest,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">How</span> is this export trade <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*to</span> be protected? Some say by free port, that 
               <br />
               is to say. no Customs duties; others sa : “Reduce taxation to a minimum on goods in which 
               <br />
               there is a tangible export <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trade."</span> Within these limits of what we may call moderate protection, 
               <br />
               we may reasonably suppose the Colonists of British Columbia to be desirous to legislate: and 
               <br />
               suppose we desire to have implements of labour and machinery, and some goods cheap and 
               <br />
               free, and put ten per <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cent.</span> on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">imported</span> agricultural produce. This is the reverse of Canadian 
               <br />
               policy. As <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regards</span> machinery, I believe the Canadian tariff gives ﬁfteen per cent. on manu- 
               <br />
               factured machinery at least. There is nothing to prevent the Canadian tariff from being 
               <br />
               increased. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Protection</span> may run rampant in the Dominion. You have no guarantee. I say 
               <br />
               that: in these ﬁscal questions we are at issue as affects some of our most important elements of 
               <br />
