               impossible; and that he wished to force a negative is equally impossible. It is an error of 
               <br />
               judgment, in my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opinion.</span> If it had been left to the Council separately. it would have left 
               <br />
               Honourable Members more at liberty to consider the question freely. I was, in common with 
               <br />
               other Members, carried away in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">admiration</span> of the outburst of oratory of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Honourable</span> 
               <br />
               Member. But there was an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">allusion—a</span> warning. It is said that it was not a threat; but 
               <br />
               there was talk of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shouldering</span> muskets, and of blood and bloodshed, as it that was the proper 
               <br />
               way to get civil rights. I protest against these threats, these turgid speeches which oppress 
               <br />
               the ears of those who wish to listen to argument and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reason.</span> As to the opposition ot‘ the 
               <br />
               Government Members, it arises from no dislike to the system on the part of the head of the 
               <br />
               Executive. Responsible Government interposes a barrier between the people and the Governor, 
               <br />
               which is most useful to the Governor. I say that xve are not in a position to take advantage 
               <br />
               of Responsible Government. If the country thinks it necessary or desirable, what is there to 
               <br />
               prevent our getting it when we choose to ask for it? The Honourable Member for New West— 
               <br />
               minster himself told us that the Imperial Government were always ready to step in, and yet 
               <br />
               he hints at violence and disturbance. When the Honourable Chief Commissioner of Lands and 
               <br />
               Works proposed a Resolution last session, which was seconded by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">myself,</span> with respect to a 
               <br />
               change in the Constitution, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">asking</span> for a Council with a majority of one of representative 
               <br />
               Members, Honourable Members said we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">don’t</span> want the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">change.</span> and voted it down. If we had 
               <br />
               secured this, we should have been a step further in advance than we are in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constitutional</span> 
               <br />
               progress. I say we must hesitate before any body constituted as this Council is can pass 
               <br />
               resolutions of such a nature. Any such resolutions ought to express the full and deliberate 
               <br />
               opinions of the countr <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> As to the special merits of Responsible Government itself, it is hardly 
               <br />
               necessary to argue it here at such an inopportune time. I shall, therefore, merely say that I 
               <br />
               think it totally inapplicable at present to the circumstances of British Columbia, whore popu~ 
               <br />
               lation is so sparse, and lies at the circumference of a circle which contains an area of 300,000 
               <br />
               square <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">miles,</span> and where representation is so diﬂicult that the form suggested would be the most 
               <br />
               expensive that could be adopted, and instead of preventing agitation, will be likely to increase it. 
               <br />
               Much of the population is alien, and, in any case, this Council is not the proper body to pass 
               <br />
               upon it. If, however, the country is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> a different opinion, they can say so at the polls, and 
               <br />
               there is no power can prevent their getting Responsible Government. But, I would ask, what 
               <br />
               makes the system so particularly attractive to Honourable Members who advocate it? We are 
               <br />
               told that it is solely because it will be good for the Colony, but there is no attempt to prove 
               <br />
               the proposition that has been set up. Another thing strikes me as coming with a very bad 
               <br />
               grace from those who support this recommendation. It presupposes a-distrust of Canada, and 
               <br />
               assumes that men of the large experience of Canadian statesmen, and so reliable as they are, 
               <br />
               are not to be trusted to yield to a general cry from the country for enlarged representative 
               <br />
               institutions. 1 don’t think that this is the time to go into the question. I say, then, that 
               <br />
               whenever Responsible Government is wanted it can be had. I need hardly refer to the position 
               <br />
               of ofﬁcial Members in this matter. The terms already passed by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House,</span> so far as this 
               <br />
               question is in any way connected with Confederation, leave the ollicials free to express their 
               <br />
               opinions. I must. myself, vote against this recommendation, and I press upon the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Honourable</span> 
               <br />
               Members to do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> same, in order to prevent the complication of the terms with any such 
               <br />
               irrelevant question.

               Hon. CHIEF <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">COMMISSIONER—I</span> must endeavour in as few words as possible to state 
               <br />
               the position of the Government Members upon the subject now before the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House.</span> I fully 
               <br />
               understand that it was imperative upon some Hon. Members to bring forward this question of 
               <br />
               responsibility <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at'some</span> period of the present session, having advocated it by speech and pen as 
               <br />

               <br />
               that the question should be brought up by them for discussion; it was a logical necessity. 
               <br />
               Inexorahle fate, I say, impelled certain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Members to advocate Responsible Government. 
               <br />
               I had, however, hoped that the Hon. Members who advocated it would have reserved it for 
               <br />
               separate consideration. instead of bringing it up as an amendment to this clause now under 
               <br />
               consideration. [Mn <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Robson—"No,</span> not an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amendmentﬂ’l</span> Virtually it is an amendment. If 
               <br />
               this clause had prescribed that any future alteration in the constitution should have been 
               <br />
               dependent on Canada, then I could see the desirabilitv of Hon. Members on the other side of 
               <br />
               the House taking exception to it; but as it is I confess I am at a loss to comprehend their 
               <br />
               position. Although, as I said inexorable fate compelled Hon. Members to bring the subject
