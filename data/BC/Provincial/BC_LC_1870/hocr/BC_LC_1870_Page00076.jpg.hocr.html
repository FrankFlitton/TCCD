               delaying Confederation in 1868, and subsequently, and of which we heard from the Hon. Chief

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lolony</span> to Canada, for a pension to each, and it may be the cheapest mode of getting rid of them. 
               <br />
               Pensions are a modern discovery. The Romans granted triumpth entries as a reward to their 
               <br />
               most distinguished c‘ ‘zens; and the Greeks crowned those whom they would honour with lanrels; 
               <br />
               but now pensions are the fashion. How much more substantial! The whole secret of the 
               <br />
               opposition of the Government to Confederation lay in the question of pensions. [“No, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">110.”)</span> 
               <br />
               [“Yes, yes.”] Still I shall vote for the clause, as I believe this to be the cheapest way of 
               <br />
               buying out the present possessors, the virtual owners of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colony,</span> I think it ought to be

               pensions or compensation, but I will move no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amendment:</span>
