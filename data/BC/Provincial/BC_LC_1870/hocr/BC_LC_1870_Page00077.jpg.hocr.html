               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1808,</span> was because <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pensions</span> were not provided. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> Sir, I am glad the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon,</span> senior Member

               for Victoria City has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afforded</span> me an opportunity to explain the part that I tool; in pressing 
               <br />
               Confederation on the Council in 18,68. 1 ﬁrst endeavoured. with the Hon. Member for New 
               <br />
               Westminster. to enlist Governor Seymour in the matter,—get him to take it up as a Government 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measure—and</span> open negotiations with the Canadian Government. But he refused to interfere 
               <br />
               in it, and said the Council might deal with it. Without the support of the Governor, in a Council 
               <br />
               so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constituted,</span> there was no hope for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measure,</span> It then became a question whether any 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Zesolution</span> on it ought to be brought forward in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Council.</span> Some Confederates urged that it 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> not do to have a Resolution defeated. 0n the other hand, I thought it best to make some 
               <br />
               proposition, merely to elicit an expression of the Council’s opinion, and show the country its 
               <br />
               attitude on the question. For in agitating the question, unless it could be'proved incontestahly 
               <br />
               that the Council and Executive were opposed, the people could not he aroused to take action. 
               <br />
               I, therefore, hrought it up in a series of Resolutions before the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House,</span> and not in Committee of 
               <br />
               the Whole. If I had had the least hope that it would have passed, I would have had it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con»</span> 
               <br />
               sidered in Committee of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Whole,~the</span> proper place to settle such an important matter, after 
               <br />
               the terms had been settled between the two Governments. As a matter of course, the Resolu— 
               <br />
               tions were defeated. But subsequently, when it was urged upon the Governor, at the instance 
               <br />
               of the Collector of Customs, that the Council be allowed to take action, he said <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“No;</span> let the

               <br />
               remarks. The Council have had two objects mainly in view: ﬁrst, to bring in a scheme which 
               <br />
               should bring general prosperity; and, secondly, that no vested interests should he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affected</span> by 
               <br />
               the act of Confederation. The positions held by otlicial gentlemen are, I contend, vested 
               <br />
               interests, and as such, entitled to protection. As regards the way in which members have 
               <br />
               been treated in other Colonies, there are numbers who are now receiving pensions. I may
