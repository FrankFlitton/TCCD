               Indians are made presents of agricultural implements, seeds, and stock. Now, if we let it

               go forth to the Indians that their interests are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">being</span> considered, and that this will be greatly 
               <br />
               to their advantage. I say, by making the Indians feel all this, there will be less danger of 
               <br />
               exciting any unpleasant feeling among them, We should set the Indian mind at rest and let
