               think any the less of the Government scheme for the remarks which have fallen from the Hon. 
               <br />
               Member. The scheme proposed by him as an amendment to the financial clauses of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern»</span> 
               <br />
               ment, indicate a vast amount or research, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">calculation,</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thought.</span> I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">congratulate</span> the Hon. 
               <br />
               Member for Victoria District on the vast advance which he has made in the last two years. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> 
               <br />
               He then only asked for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$142,000,</span> inclusive of subsidy and head <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">money.</span> I think, Sir, that the 
               <br />
               Government has hit upon the soundest, best, and most feasible scheme. I consider it a real 
               <br />
               stroke of statesmunship, and am glad to find that the Unollicial Members of the Executive 
               <br />
               Council have added .so much to its value. With regard to the number at which it is proposed 
               <br />
               to estimate the population, it is all very well for Hon. Members to say that this is a ﬁction, but 
               <br />
               there is nothing dishonest in the assumption. If we were going to impose upon the Canadian 
               <br />
               Government it would be dishonest; but we cannot impose upon the Government at Ottawa 
               <br />
               any more than we can upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ourselves.</span> There is a real honest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intent,</span> The explanation of the 
               <br />
               Chief Commissioner is fair and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfactory</span> upon this point. The policy of the scheme proposed 
               <br />
               by the Government is less intricate than that of the Hon. Member for Victoria District; it is 
               <br />
               more businesslike. It is important also as a basis of representation. If we adopt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">40,000</span> as a 
               <br />
               basis of population, we shall only be entitled to a much smaller representation. By ﬁxing the 
               <br />
               basis at 120,000, we give the country a better status abroad, and with the Dominion Government, 
               <br />
               than it could have if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> basis were ﬁxed at 40,000. "his is where the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fiction</span> comes in, if at 
               <br />
               all. Besides. we are upon the brink of great changes, which will enormously increase our 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population.</span> We have every reason to expect our population to be doubled in a very short time. 
               <br />
               The public works which would commence immediately after Confederation will increase it ’at 
               <br />
               once, and it is fair to put our population up to meet that increase. There is, in my opinion, 
               <br />
               a great deal of reason in the arguments of those who say that as the population of this Colony 
               <br />
               increases the policy of the Dominion will tend to free trade l“ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">No,</span> no.” from Mr. DeCosmos], 
               <br />
               and the Canadian Government look forward to the time, and that very shortly, that Internal 
               <br />
               Revenue or Excise will exceed the External Revenue or Customs, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Customs <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Revenue</span> of 
               <br />
               this Colony will not increase much above its present standard <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> the reduction of duties and 
               <br />
               the importation of Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">goods.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lion,</span> Members may look surprised at this, but I will tell 
               <br />
               them that there are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">large</span> Canadian houses now in negotiation with merchants of this Colony 
               <br />
               respecting the transmission of goods to this Colony, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> believe that cargoes of Canadian 
               <br />
               goods will come in to this port <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ilxiniediately</span> after Confederation. This will be a relief to us. 
               <br />
               The Revenue <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> our own Customs will in a few years come to a standstill, or rather, notwith- 
               <br />
               standing the increase of our population, the Revenue will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">decrease.</span> Looking ahead, it is argued 
               <br />
               by some I-Ion. Members that these terms look good for the present time, but bad for the future. 
               <br />
               I believe, however, that the bargain about to be made is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">good</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one,</span> Let us, if we can, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strengthen</span> 
               <br />
               the hands <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the Government in asking more, but let us do nothing to weaken them and compel 
               <br />
               them to take less. We want more money just now. My idea is that the expenses of. Local 
               <br />
               Government are set down at a ﬁgure which is unnecessarily <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">high,</span> I think the expenses <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might;</span> 
               <br />
               be considerably reduced, and thereby a saving made to the Colony. The subsidy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> $35,000 is, 
               <br />
               I think, too small. I will, therefore, move to increase it to $50,000, and to increase the limit 
               <br />
               of representation from 400,000 to 1,000,000. I make this proposition with the more conﬁdence 
               <br />
               because I believe that the Dominion Government will think very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">little</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$15,000,</span> but they might 
               <br />
               think a good deal of the _ ,000 which would be necessary to increase the subsidy to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$80,000.</span> 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span> to the mines of this Colony, I think thev will he more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lasting</span> than some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hour</span> Members 
               <br />
               predict; and I also <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differ</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> those who think that our prosper' depends entirely upon our 
               <br />
               mines. I believe that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> is a great future for the Colony. I believe that the mineral resources 
               <br />
               will last our time, and that of our children. I believe, also, that our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agricultural</span> resources may 
               <br />
               be developed so as to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give‘</span> us one million ot‘ population within twenty years, and that this Colony 
               <br />
               will become of immense importax :e when the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Overland</span> Railway, the true <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">NorilrWest</span> Passage. is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">established.</span> I conceive that it is not at all an exaggeration to assume <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hat</span> this Colony will 
               <br />
               have a population of'one million within our lives. With such a climate as we have, and with 
               <br />
               such natural advantages, this Colony has stood still at a marv lions rate.
