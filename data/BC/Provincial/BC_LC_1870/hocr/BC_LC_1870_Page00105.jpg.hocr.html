               as I think, probably, have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said—His</span> Excellency had acted unwisoly? This question has been 
               <br />
               before the people; they would have been justiﬁed in jumping at the gilded bait ol’ Responsible 
               <br />
               Government if the Government had not proposed a new system; but as he has done so, the 
               <br />
               people will do well to consider before they swallowed the barbed hook that lies under the bait. 
               <br />
               I desire to disclaim speaking in the interest of oﬂicials; their position would, so far as I 
               <br />
               believe, not be injured in any way by the introduction of Responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> Thoso 
               <br />
               among them who were commissioned in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England</span> (I mean the heads of departments) will be 
               <br />
               rendered so independent that they will be above ﬁghting after their own interests. I think 
               <br />
               it unlikely that they will remain here. As to the balance of otlicials, if Canada is as liberal 
               <br />
               now as of old, or as liberal as Australia, they will be well provided for, whether we have 
               <br />
               Responsible Government or not. Probably they will be “utilized,” since that is the term we 
               <br />
               are to use. I claim for the system which His Excellency has foreshadowed, that it is more 
               <br />
               suitable to the present circumstances of this Colony than any other system which can be given 
               <br />
               us. Responsible Government has acted well in large communities, but in small ones I doubt 
               <br />
               its efﬁciency. It is like a painted ship on a painted ocean, If it were obtained in a small 
               <br />
               Colony like this, there would be a constant game of battledore and shuttlecock going on-—in 
               <br />
               to—day and out to-morrow. Fancy the Honourable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Member</span> for Victoria City presiding at the 
               <br />
               Lands and Works Department one day, and I, having paid him all the compliments I could, 
               <br />
               come over another day to have an interview with the Chief, and ﬁnd that there has been a 
               <br />
               change of Ministry, there is another man in. My ideas may be wrong; if so, they can be 
               <br />
               corrected at the polls. If I were a man of property, with a large stake in the Colony, I should 
               <br />
               decidedly object to Responsible Government. I have given my opinion candidly and honestly. 
               <br />
               I may never sit at this Council Board again. I have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">given</span> my advice to His Excellency, to 
               <br />
               this Board, and to my constituents. conscientiously. If I am <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wrong,</span> the people will correct me. 
               <br />
               I speak from conviction. No doubt there is talent in British Columbia; no doubt there is plenty 
               <br />
               of administrative ability; there are many better men than myself, I am very sure, and that 
               <br />
               is one reason that I oppose Responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[Laughter-.1</span> But the main <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculty</span> is 
               <br />
               that the best men won’t come here; the chaff is blown here, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whfs'it</span> remains behind.

               On motion of Hon. Mr. Drake, the debate was adjourned to Monday.

               <br />
               the House will accord me leave to say a few words. There have been submitted for the 
               <br />
               consideration of this House two amendments. and in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">observations</span> of the movers, two points

               of argument have been adduced,——the ﬁrst founded on supposed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reasoning,</span> and the second in 
               <br />
               the way of threats and military argument, grounded on the possibility of the Government 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">refusing</span> to insert this condition. I desire to disengage myself from this latter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">argument</span> 
               <br />
               When I hear anything tantamount to a threat from the people against the Executive, I desire

               to repudiate it. 11011. Members who put such a picture of warfare before us talk bunkuin. I 
               <br />
               address my humble petition to His Excellency, but if his judgment is against us I say to him, 
               <br />
               stand to your point and do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> way to threats; listen to no a mnents as to what may

               <br />
               to threats; don‘t be moved by them. I support the principle of Responsible Government, but I 
               <br />
               do so constitutionally. I say to Executive Members, I trust you will yield to reason and 
               <br />
               argument, but not to threats. I say we can ask for Responsible Government without the leave 
               <br />
               of the Organic Act; but I say let us repudiate all connection with Canada until we have secured 
               <br />
               Responsible Government; let us not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wait</span> till we are surrounded by Canadians. With regard to the

               <br />
               make this the main Resolution: without Responsible Government let us have no Confederation.

               Better bear the ills we have than fly to others that we know not of. Let us not run the risk
