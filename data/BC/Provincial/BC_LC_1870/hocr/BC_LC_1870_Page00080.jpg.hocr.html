               <br />
               the whole scheme. I quite concur in the opinion that no real union can take place without a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway.</span> Did I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">believe</span> that the Overland Railway would not be made. I should hesitate very 
               <br />
               much about Confederation, because l should he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">apprehensive</span> that the whole scheme would fall 
               <br />
               to pieces. I think that great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">haste</span> must he used to build up an English-speaking nation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">along»</span> 
               <br />
               side of another <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">existing</span> Illnglish-speaking <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> To accomplish this end, I think that the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Overland</span> Railway is necessary, and must: be pushed through to speedy completion to be an 
               <br />
               immediate success. In ten years’ time, without an Overland <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway,</span> I do not believe that we 
               <br />
               should have any British Territory here at all. The great work must be undertaken with the 
               <br />
               assistance of both the Canadian and Imperial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Governments,</span> and pushed through to a speedy 
               <br />
               success. It is true that a sort of union might exist without a Railway, such as the union 
               <br />
               between British Columbia and. Great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I31</span> am. But we propose to establish a union that will 
               <br />
               endure. and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> will render an Overland Railway just as necessary as the arteries in the 
               <br />
               human body are necessary to circulate the blood and to keep up life. I believe that $1,000,000 
               <br />
               is a mere nominal sum, as explained by the Hon. Chief Commissioner, a tangible security that 
               <br />
               the work will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">completed</span> The expenditure of the ﬁrst million will be a guarantee that any 
               <br />
               company or Government undertaking it will carry it through. Every reﬂecting mind will see 
               <br />
               that if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> company spend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,000,000</span> a year, they must spend more, and that it will he to 
               <br />
               their interest to push it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">through.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">To</span> say that because we only name a sum of $1,000,000, 
               <br />
               that it will be a matter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 100 years is absurd; my reply to this, I cannot call it an argument, 
               <br />
               is that capitalists could not be found in the world so silly as to spread the construction over 
               <br />
               one hundred, or ﬁfty. or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">twenty,</span> or even ten years. I cannot support the amendment of the

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon</span> Member for toria Dist ct; we must carefully <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">avoid</span> committing ourselves to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">route.</span> 
               <br />
               or terms of building. I think this may be safely left in the bands of the Dominion Govern- 
               <br />
               ment. It is useless to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">argue</span> that it is of vital importance to them to have be best route. The

               <br />
               it must be in British Columbia. and consequently a benefit to the whole <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colony.</span> I cannot see 
               <br />
               that it would be better to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">begin</span> in the middle I look upon it as an absolute necessity that the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway</span> should commence at the seaboard: moving the material is the great expense that has 
               <br />
               to be contended <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against,</span> and the advantage of being able to land the material and lay it down 
               <br />
               at once on the road, will be incalculable. If the Railway were to be constructed from a given 
               <br />
               point ten miles from the seaboard, it would probably <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pay</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contractors</span> to build that piece of

               <br />
               way of the Rocky Mountains. don‘t let us stultify ourselves by asking them to begin in the 
               <br />
               middle. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I:</span> is right that the work should be commenced simultaneously on the Atlantic and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Paciﬁc</span> sides. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fancy</span> that, as a matter of policy and economy, any company undertaking the 
               <br />
               work would so commence, without it being named in the terms, as it would undoubtedly be 
               <br />
               more economical to carry on the work by sea from the westward in British Columbia, and by 
               <br />
               land from the East. As for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> amount named in the conditions. as I have said. I look upon
