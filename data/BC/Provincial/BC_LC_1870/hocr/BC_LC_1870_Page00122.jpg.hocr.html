               resident Magistrate to administer <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> carry out the laws I believe that some Hon. Members 
               <br />
               of this House have mistaken the feelings of the country on this matter. Any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dissatisfaction</span> 
               <br />
               that exists is not with the present system of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span> but with the expense of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">carrying,r</span> the 
               <br />
               system out. We all feel that, and we all know that. it cannot be avoided, for reasons which 
               <br />
               have been given over and over again in this House, namely, the smallness of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population;</span> 
               <br />
               scattered as it is over so vast an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">area.</span> I have not heard during the debate any arguments that 
               <br />
               will prove to me or to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> House that under Responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> we could have a cheaper 
               <br />
               form of government. I for one could not be convinced that we should. I believe that the 
               <br />
               public moneys would be wasted. peculation and dishonesty would be the order of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">day</span> We 
               <br />
               are told by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ilion.</span> Member for Yale we must have a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">beginning.</span> I am aware of that fact. 
               <br />
               and for one shall assist to put off the evil day. I prefer for a time—until our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population</span> 
               <br />
               increases—to live under the present form of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government,</span> one under which, I am proud to say, 
               <br />
               I have ‘lived for eleven years without seeing the faults of maladministration and other evil 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accusations</span> that have been hurled at it by the Hon. Member for Lillooet. I am aware that 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> gentleman was himself in some subordinate position under the Government; he may 
               <br />
               of his own personal knowledge, while in that capacity, be aware of some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">malpractice,</span> but I 
               <br />
               defy him to point out a single instance brought before the notice of the Government that did 
               <br />
               not receive the strictest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">investigation</span> and in which the individual complained of, if the charges 
               <br />
               were proved, was not discharged. In conclusion, Mr. Chairman. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shall</span> take this opportunity 
               <br />
               of expressing my appreciation of the ofﬁcers generally that have carried on the Government of 
               <br />
               this Colony <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">during</span> the eleven years that I have lived here; and I challenge any Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentle</span> 
               <br />
               man to prove by the records of Her Majesty’s Colonies, that in any Colony or Dependency of 
               <br />
               the British Crown laws have been more justly administered, life and property better protected, 
               <br />
               or the affairs of the. Colony carried on with greater rectitude than in the one in which we are 
               <br />
               now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">living.</span> Holding these views, I must decline to support either of the recommendations 
               <br />
               before the Committee.

               Hon. Mn. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ALSTON—Sir.</span> I am in favour of Responsible Government, but not the form 
               <br />
               that has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discussed</span> in this House at so great a length I believe all representative <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern»</span> 
               <br />
               ments are responsible. The Hon. and learned Member for Victoria District has quoted John 
               <br />
               Stuart Mill I believe. Sir, that the words Responsible Government do not occur in his book; 
               <br />
               he shows that the form applicable to one country will not do for another. We have heard 
               <br />
               enough in this Council to make me believe that ‘the people do not want Responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern</span> 
               <br />
               ment; I believe that a representative form of Government is the only form that will suit this 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colonyl</span> It has been well shown by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mix</span> Wood, that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> the difﬁculty of getting 
               <br />
               districts represented, this Colony is not adapted for purely representative institutions. I think 
               <br />
               it most desirable that Executive Members should have seats in this Council, and I think that 
               <br />
               a partially elective House would best represent the interests of the entire community. The 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">American</span> form of Government is in a certain sense responsible, executive <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁcers</span> being elected 
               <br />
               for a term of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">four</span> years. England possesses a ditt‘eren‘t form, and Canada diifers again from 
               <br />
               England. The Colony from which Governor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Musgrave</span> came is the last that has received 
               <br />
               Responsible Government; thus we may fairly trust to His <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Excellency</span> to judge for us as to the 
               <br />
               probability of its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">working</span> well here. The smallest Colony po 'ing Responsible Government 
               <br />
               is Prime Edward‘s Island: <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> we who do not possess a popula on one-twelfth the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">size</span> of that 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland. are a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">use</span> for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Responsible</span> Govermnent. The lion. and learned Member 
               <br />
               for Victoria City (Mr. Drake). who seems to uphold Responsible Government against his own 
               <br />
               convictions. admits that all power would be held in Victoria; and he says that there would be 
               <br />
               no harm in such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">centrali</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ition.</span> I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">think,</span> Sir, that he has read John Stuart Mill to little 
               <br />
               purpose if such be his com ion.

               Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mn.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thll'l-lltblx'</span> Sir. I am more impressed than ever with the absolute need 
               <br />
               of Responsible Government. I think the Hon. Chief Commissioner particularly, and the Hon. 
               <br />
               Member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Victoria</span> Citv, have proved conclusively that two—thirds of the people 1‘ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iresenting</span> 
               <br />
               property are determined to have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Responsible</span> Government. The Hon. Member for the City 
               <br />
               told us the people were not in favour of Responsible Government. and in the same sentence he 
               <br />
               tells us that if Confederation were set before the people with Responsible Government mixed 
               <br />
               up with it, the people would take Responsible Government to the exclusion of material interests. 
               <br />
               I have said, and say again, I am in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">favour</span> of Confederation, and I earnestly hope that it will 
               <br />
               be for the beneﬁt of the Colony. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sometimes</span> think that some I-Ion. Members at the other end
