               Honourable Executive Member for ictorin City <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr,</span> Iiehncken). Sir, I know something about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span> 
               <br />
               the history of Confederation. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lip</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> opening of this Session <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span> 
               <br />
               a subject of agitation. It may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">properly</span> be divided into several heads: Firstly. agi

               tation; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">secondly,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">negotiation;</span> thirdly, inauguration; and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fourthly,</span> I hope. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">successful</span>

               operation. Now, Sir, it is apparent that every act of mine in reference to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation,</span> up 
               <br />
               to the time it was announced in Earl Granville’s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">desr</span> tcb, up to the time Ills Excellency the 
               <br />
               Governor sent down his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Message—everv</span> act of mine was in the line of agitation. It was with 
               <br />
               the view to bring about the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consideration</span> of terms with the Dominion Government; to hear 
               <br />
               what they would do; to bring the question before the people, and to canva its defects and 
               <br />
               advantages. that I for one have agitated the question. In doing so I have come in for blows

               from open enemies and treason from false political <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">friends.</span> Sir, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> era of agitation has now

               allusion to me. He said that when I brought this matter before the louncil in 1868, that the
