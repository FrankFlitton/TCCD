               Hon. Mn. HOLBROOK, whilst believing that the establishment of a free port at Victoria 
               <br />

               <br />
               my connection with it; my political standard was unfurled then as it is to-day. When I ﬁrst

               entered upon politics in this country 1 established a high political standard, which would take 
               <br />
               the measure of a political trickster as well as that of a statesman. There is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nothing,r</span> in the

               conduct of the hon. member for New Westminster either here or at Yale to entitle him to the 
               <br />
               name of statesman. I say, Sir, that I am as free as I was at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Yale</span> to vote for that clause, and 
               <br />
               it it can be got into the terms I will vote for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> I brought the question up at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Yale</span> because I

               knew that there \ 'as a party in Victoria favourable to free port, and I wished to see the question 
               <br />
               fought out after Confederation, not before. The Hon. gentleman was defeated; he could not get 
               <br />
               the Yale Convention to endorse the retaining of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Assay</span> Ofﬁce at New Westminster, and he

               tool; his defeat very much to heart. [l-lon. Mr. Robson—Untrue. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">untrue]</span> The Hon. Member

               tions. Since to this Colony I came, I have never swerved from protection. In the ﬁrst article I 
               <br />
               wrote for a newspaper in this Colony the word “protection” occurs. I want to see the Canadian 
               <br />
               revenue laws extended here; I want to see power in the Local Government to protect: the indus-

               <br />
               opinions. I spent my time and money in getting protection. I challenged a gentleman on the
