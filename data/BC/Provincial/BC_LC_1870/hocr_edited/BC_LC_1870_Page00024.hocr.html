               <br />
               although I fully admit that it is well put, I believe that no argument is more fallacious. It is 
               <br />
               delicate ground for me to touch when I presume to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differ</span> from what comes from so able a man. 
               <br />
               On this point I wish to make myself distinctly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">understood.</span> I do not profess to be a statesman 
               <br />
               or a politician, but as a lawyer of mature age, pretending to a fair share of common sense and 
               <br />
               a knowledge of human nature, I will venture to say, that if there is one passion more powerful in 
               <br />
               the minds of Colonists of Anglo-Saxon origin than another, it is the passion for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self―government;</span> 
               <br />
               in all English communities there is an ardent passion for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self-government.</span> Colonists here, as 
               <br />
               everywhere else, are animated by an intense desire to govern themselves in the way they think 
               <br />
               best; and to delegate that power to others is destructive of every feeling of self-respect and of 
               <br />
               social and political liberty. ‘ 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               It is not necessary for me to prove that this is the case, it is too notorious for comment; 
               <br />
               and as long as the spirit of liberty exists in the British Nation, we shall ﬁnd that no one Province 
               <br />
               will submit to legislation at the hands of a Legislature in which its interests and welfare are 
               <br />
               overwhelmed and overborne. To secure submission to a Legislature such as that of the Dominion 
               <br />
               of Canada, where the majority of the Canadian Members make the law, uniformity of interest 
               <br />
               and feeling is necessary; and not only will the feeling of any separate Province be wounded by 
               <br />
               the consciousness that self-government is withheld from it, but on ﬁnding that its interests, or 
               <br />
               its feelings, are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">overwhelmed</span> and subjected to the interests and feelings of a dominant portion, 
               <br />
               the sense of discontent and dissatisfaction will become universal and national, hence will ensue 
               <br />
               a condition <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">things</span> most perilous 'to British interests <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">generally.</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />The bond of union between Canada and the other Provinces bears no resemblance to the 
               <br />
               union between England and her Colonial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Possessions.</span> There is no natural love and original 
               <br />
               feeling of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">loyalty.</span> The feeling of loyalty towards England is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feeling</span> blind, instinctive, strong, 
               <br />
               born with us and impossible to be shaken off; and I believe it is impossible to transfer a feeling 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">loyalty</span> and fealty at will. The connection between the Mother Country and a Colony—even a 
               <br />
               Crown <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colony―is</span> well understood in principle and in practice. The Mother Country guarantees 
               <br />
               the Colony from enemies abroad and the entire work of inter-colonial management is, except in 
               <br />
               matters of prerogative, left to the Colonists themselves. The Crown pretends to no dictation, 
               <br />
               nor has it any interest at variance with the interests of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colonists,</span> Although in a Crown 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colony</span> the official element is supreme, it is well understood that it is to govern—and public 
               <br />
               opinion forces it to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern—according</span> to the well~understood and well-established wishes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 
               <br />
               the Colony at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">large.</span> The Government can not and dare not interfere except to prevent crude, 
               <br />
               irrational, or vicious legislation. There is no direct <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conflict</span> between the Mother Country and 
               <br />
               a Colony in these days; but it cannot be supposed that any British Province will submit patiently 
               <br />
               to injustice at the hands of a Canadian Ministry or a Canadian House of Commons. If any 
               <br />
               scheme has been devised more likely than another to raise and keep alive local irritation it is, 
               <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />in my judgment, the scheme of Confederation on the basis of the Organic Act of 1867.

               What is said by Lord Granville is true in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">theory,</span> but practically it is opposed to human 
               <br />
               nature; and in endeavouring to carry out elaborate and elevated views Great Britain stands a 
               <br />
