               Now, Sir, the objections that I raise are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">objections</span> to the provisions of the Organic Act, 
               <br />
               and I ﬁnd it necessary, for the purposes of my argument, to turn to those provisions. I do not 
               <br />
               mean to detain the Council at unnecessary length, but as the question before us is one which 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">concerns</span> the future of this Colony for all time, I trust that I shall be excused if I dwell for a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">few</span> moments upon these points. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               If we come into Confederation, we come in, as I understand it, under this Organic Act; and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> is on account of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">overwhelming</span> inﬂuence of Canada in the joint <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature</span> of the Dominion, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> given by that Act, that I object to the general principle of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> of the North 
               <br />
               American Provinces of Great Britain. I am told I am in error, that profound statesmen in 
               <br />
               Great Britain and in Canada have determined otherwise, and that Confederation, on the basis 
               <br />
               of the Organic Act of 1867, is the policy of Great Britain 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I regret, Sir, that I cannot be silenced by the weight of such authority. No statesmanship, 
               <br />
               no conclusion, is of any value except for the reasoning on which it is founded; and I am ready 
               <br />
               to rest the whole matter on simple argument and reason. All States large enough and populous 
               <br />
               enough to warrant such privileges, eagerly and passionately desire the power of self-government. 
               <br />
               It is the common passion of our race. Formerly, even now, in other places, it is British policy 
               <br />
               to give these powers; and as New South Wales has thrown off Victoria and Queensland, so 
               <br />
               would it appear to be reasonable to extend the principle to the British Provinces in North 
               <br />
               America, rather than to adopt a different policy, for the simple reason that it is in accordance 
               <br />
               with the instincts of the Anglo-Saxon race, and the just rights of man. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               We want <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self-government,</span> which means the protection of our own interests, and the estab- 
               <br />
               lishment of our own welfare in our own way; the passing of our own Estimates in our own way; 
               <br />
               the selection of those who rule, and the subsequent meeting of our rulers, face to face, in open 
               <br />
               Council, that they may show us the results of their ruling. It <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">means</span> the imposition and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">collec―</span> 
               <br />
               tion of our own taxes, fostering our own industries, and the power of the purse. These are the 
               <br />
               elements of self-government, and they are reserved to the Dominion Government, and taken from 
               <br />
               the Provinces; hence my objections to the Organic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act.</span> For these reasons I say that Confedera― 
               <br />
               tion—or rather union—with Canada cannot be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fair</span> and equal, on account of the overwhelming 
               <br />
               inﬂuence of Canada in the Dominion Parliament, now and in the future; for it always must be 
               <br />
               so. Canada can extend, and will extend, and even of herself would be able to sway the destinies 
               <br />
               of the Dominion. And are we to accept this position because we are told that British statesman- 
               <br />
               ship wills it? Statesmanship, Sir, is nothing more than very sound common sense put into 
               <br />
               practice—sound common sense, backed by a knowledge of mankind and of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subject matter</span> to 
               <br />
               which that statesmanship is applied. And, although it is not for me to depreciate the renown 
               <br />
               of my countrymen, it cannot be disguised that they have not unfrequently gone astray, and been 
               <br />
               forced to submit to the control of national interests and national will. It is not difficult to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               instances of error in British statesmanship, as applied to Colonial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> The errors of British 
               <br />
               statesmen, with a majority of the House <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Commons-and the British Nation to back them, cost

               <br />
               the House of Commons and the British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nation</span> to back them, have inﬂicted wrongs upon Ireland, 
               <br />
               which are only now in process of removal; and the policy of British statesmen, with the British 
               <br />
               Nation to back it, has created a difference which has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gone</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">far</span> to alienate tile affections of the 
               <br />
               Colonists of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> Zealand.

               In this question of Confederation it is impossible not to see the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self―intorest</span> of Great Britain 
               <br />
               underlying the whole matter. England is alarmed at the extent of her Colonial possessions, and 
               <br />
               her obligations to protect them by sea and land. Of all her possessions, the Dominion of Canada 
               <br />
               is the most assailabie; and, doubtless, Great Britain stands alarmed at the responsibility and 
               <br />
               cost of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">protecting</span> so enormous a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">frontier.</span> The question of Confederation is the question <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 
               <br />
               every tax-paying <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Englishman,</span> and whatever may be the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reasoning</span> put forth, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">motive</span> is 
               <br />
               economy and security to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tax―paying</span> public of Great Britain. Confederation is, doubtless, 
               <br />
               of value to Great Britain, as establishing a counterpoise to the United States of America, and 
               <br />
               probably inducing the Dominion of Canada to ask for and obtain independence, and so relieve 
               <br />
               the Mother Country from the cost and duty of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">defending</span> it. This is, I believe, the entire 
               <br />
               <span style="font-style: italic;">statesmanship</span><span style="font-style: italic;" class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measure—a</span> statesmanship meritorious in English <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eyes—but,</span> as I believe, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fraught</span> with extreme danger to British interests in this quarter of the globe.
