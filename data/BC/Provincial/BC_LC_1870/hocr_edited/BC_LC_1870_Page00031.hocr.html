               the Honourable gentleman. First, it is inopportune, because of the present depression; second, 
               <br />
               inopportune at the last election, because things looked so bright; thirdly, inopportune now, 
               <br />
               because we can save <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$50,000.</span> Your <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">predecessor</span> as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Minister</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Finance,</span> Mr. President, promised 
               <br />
               great things, but the Governor’s Message<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span> with the Estimates shows how <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> have turned out. 
               <br />
               I do not deal in prophesy, but in facts. Let any one look at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cariboo.</span> Look at Victoria. If we 
               <br />
               wait for the time to be opportune, we may wait until it is too late. Suppose any unforeseen 
               <br />
               accident were to happen to our gold mines. If the golden spring is dried up, the golden stream 
               <br />
               that now ﬂows from Cariboo to Victoria will be dried up also. We are asked by the Honourable 
               <br />
               Member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Victoria</span> to wait for the Census of 1871. What has the census of Canada to do with 
               <br />
               the question? The basis of population as set forth in these terms is all ﬁction. It does not come 
               <br />
               up to my idea of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nation-making.</span> Why not deal with facts? Why set up some legal ﬁction of 
               <br />
               John Doe and Richard Roe? I want facts, not ﬁction. Let us base our ﬁnancial calculations 
               <br />
               upon facts, and the rest will work <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">itself</span> out satisfactorily. Much has been said, during the 
               <br />
               debate, about the Red <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">River</span> Territory and its settlement. For my part I don’t care if the Red 
               <br />
               River <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difficulty</span> is never <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">settled,</span> so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">far</span> as it bears on the question before the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Council.</span> I believe 
               <br />
               that the Red River country and the valley of the two Saskatchewans are not so favourable for 
               <br />
               settlement as some amongst us are accustomed to assert. But whether the North―West Territory 
               <br />
               is confederated or not, I go in for Confederation, because I believe we can make terms, and 
               <br />
               good terms, with Canada. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> Honourable Member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Victoria</span> City talks of the drawbacks 
               <br />
               to Confederation arising out of the vast extent of country, and our great distance from the seat 
               <br />
               of the Federal Government. That will hardly scare anybody, with the example of the United 
               <br />
               States before us. Next he says that the Dominion is only an experiment, and that it may break 
               <br />
               up. How often have I heard people predict that the United States, as a nation, must break up, 
               <br />
               as it was only an experiment. Why, Sir, they forget that the States had existed as separate 
               <br />
               Government's for one hundred and ﬁfty years before their union. So with the Provinces of the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada; they existed as separate Governments for the last hundred to two hundred 
               <br />
               years, and Confederation is but the application of long-tried principles to a larger territory. 
               <br />
               Why did not the Honourable Member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Victoria</span> City, when he said there were defects in the 
               <br />Confederation machine, tell us what the great defects in the machine were? He has merely 
               <br />
               raised up a scarecrow. Then he says it is absurd to ally ourselves to people who were 3,000 
               <br />miles away; but nothing in his argument showed me that the absurdity was proven. I remem- 
               <br />
               ber, Sir, when the communication between California and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Washington</span> was by Panama and 
               <br />
               Nicaragua. Was California then less to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">United</span> States than now? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">We</span> now can hold com— 
               <br />
               munication with Ottawa by San Francisco and the Paciﬁc Railroad, and will be as near to our 
               <br />
               Central Government as Washington Territory. The Honourable Member speaks of people 3,000 
               <br />
               miles away being unable to do as well <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> us as we could do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> ourselves. I believe they could 
               <br />
               do just as well, so far as some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">general</span> principles are concerned, if we only settled the conditions 
               <br />
               properly. With regard to the States of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">neighbouring</span> Republic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">getting</span> on better than the 
               <br />
               Provinces or ourselves, I would ask, where is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">progress</span> of Washington <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territory,</span> as com―<br />
               pared with our own country? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[Dr</span> H<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">elmckn―“</span> It contains a much larger <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population”]</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> 
               <br />

            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The Honourable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> is pursuing the same devious course as he did in past years, 
               <br />
               when he opposed reform, when our Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might</span> have been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">beneficial</span> to the Colony, had 
               <br />
               it been based on the popular will. He <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">says</span> that the deposition of the Free Port drove people 
               <br />
               out of the Colony. I take this occasion to state that, in my belief, the deposition of the Free 
               <br />
               Port was the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commencement:</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> permanent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prosperity</span> of this city, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">brought</span> in its train 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dawning</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> prosperity <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">throughout</span> the whole district, from Comox to Sooke. which includes 
               <br />
               the district which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> have the honour to represent, and which now numbers six hundred voters, 
               <br />
               all of whom are prosperous. There, Sir, lies the key-stone of Confederation! If the terms 
               <br />
               between British Columbia and Canada do not protect the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">farming</span> interests, the largest and the 
               <br />
               only permanent interest in this Colony, Confederation will do no good. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">If</span> it does not protect 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">farming</span> interest, I vote <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> Confederation, ﬁrst, last, and all the time.

               It would be most unwise to join Canada with<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">protection.</span> We must have a control over 
               <br />
               certain imports in the terms, for a protective tariff is the only inducement to farmers to remain 
               <br />
               upon the soil. We depend upon them to build up a permanent interest in the country, that will
