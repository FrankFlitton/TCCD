               Yes, the Honourable gentleman said that the issue would be raised at the next election,

               <br />
               But the Honourable gentleman did threaten to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">raise</span> the issue of going somewhere else. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> 
               <br />
               Sir, where else except to Canada could we go? The Honourable Member talks of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agri―</span><br />
               cultural interests. Why, Sir, by going somewhere else, these interests from Comox to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sooke,</span> 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> Soda Creek and Kamloops to the Lower Fraser would be destroyed. The country<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><br />
               would be ﬂooded by produce from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Un</span>ited States. From Comox to Sooke, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> the delta of 
               <br />
               the Fraser to Cariboo, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">farming</span> interests would be destroyed by going somewhere else. If 
               <br />
               that question came up, Sir, the farmers would quickly put it down. The Honourable Member 
               <br />
               for Victoria City says that the question comes here by desire of Her Majesty‘s Government. 
               <br />
               Sir, I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span> again, that it comes here by desire of the people, a large proportion of whom have 
               <br />
               asked Her Majesty’s Government and the Government at Ottawa to bring it here. I am thank― <br />
               ful that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span> of Confederation is here. The Honourable gentleman says it is a 
               <br />
               Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measure,</span> and that the terms must he passed. I say, again, that I hope terms will 
               <br />
               be passed of such a character as will contribute to the prosperity and happiness of this Colony. 
               <br />
               The Honourable Executive Councillor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> that this is a Government measure, and that it 
               <br />
               ought to be an open question. Why does he not retire from his seat then? I would not be 
               <br />
               a candidate for his place. ’ 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[Dr</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Helmcken―“</span> There are no candidates. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> Executive Council are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appointed."]</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Then I am sorry for the choice that has been made. Why, Sir, the programme settled by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> 
               <br />
               Government would leave it virtually an open question by referring the terms to a popular vote. <br />
               I may have something to say upon that hereafter. How patriotic will the Honourable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span><br />
               be when he goes outside, and says that this nominative Council, pre ded over by a paid Colonial<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><br />
               Secretary, have done this! How very easy it is for an Honourable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> to talk about the<br />
               autocracy of Government, when it suits him to do so. Look at his conduct in voting supplies.<br />
               When my Honourable friend on my left (the Member for Lillooet) tried to bring in a Bill to<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> 
               <br />
               repeal the Crown Salaries Acts, was he not choked off by the Honourable Member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Victoria.</span> 
               <br />
               City objecting first? But I am only delaying the House. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[Hear,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hear.]</span> The Honourable 
               <br />
               Magisterial Member for Victoria City says “ hear, hear.” Now, Sir, as far as I am concerned, 
               <br />
               the Honourable Member has my full permission to withdraw. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[Laughter.]</span> I have always been 
               <br />
               ready to take a British subject<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span> vote on this question; but the Honourable Member for Victoria 
               <br />
               has always <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> dissented from that proposal. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> Honourable Member for Victoria City has a remarkable way of putting things. But a 
               <br />
               few days ago he stated in this House, that if the people will only support the Government in 
               <br />
               getting the terms proposed, all will be right. I quote from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colonist</span> newspaper of 20th 
               <br />
               February, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1870,</span> in which the Honourable gentleman is made to say, “I hope the people will 
               <br />
               support the Government in trying to get terms." He now comes down here and opposes them. 
               <br />
               [Dr. Helmcken—“I don't oppose the terms. I oppose Confederation."] <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">A</span> distinction without 
               <br />
               a difference<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> Honourable Executive <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Councillor</span> says the time is inopportune. I say, Sir. 
               <br />
               that now is the time. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">If</span> the new gold discoveries, which have been mentioned in the course <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 
               <br />
               this debate, really e<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">xist,</span> now is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">time</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confederate,</span> and to take means to attract and retain 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population.</span> I have spent ﬁve years of my life in the mining districts of California, and 
               <br />
               have helped to build up town after town; but how are they now? Many of these towns which 
               <br />
               had their 5,000 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inhabitants</span> have almost none now. It will be the same with our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gold-mining</span> 
               <br />
               towns. I fear the Honourable gentleman will always <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span> the time is inopportune, not only 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span> the population arrives, but when it is here, and after it goes. If we can make a good 
               <br />
               bargain with Canada, by all means let us make it, and make it now. I like the word bargain, 
               <br />
               it sounds like business. What did the Honourable Member for Victoria <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span> at the last election?— 
               <br />
               “ Don‘t let us have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation,</span> for we shall have a surplus revenue of $100,000 in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1869,</span> and 
               <br />
               we will do better without Confederation.” Confederation was inopportune then. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">There</span> was a 
               <br />
               large deficit or falling off in the revenue for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1869,</span> and yet he says it is inopportune <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now.</span> He 
               <br />
               said yesterday, we shall have a reduction <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the public debt in 1873 of about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$36,000,</span> and by 
               <br />
               fundin<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">g</span> the ﬂoating debt make another saving <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$15,000</span> per <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">year.</span> So that for a paltry saving 
               <br />
               of $50,000 three years hence, the Confederation question is now inopportune, I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">am</span> surprised at
