               I long for union as much as any man. In union of good there is strength and victory,

               <br />
               opinion I do my duty. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> Mr. Wood has told us that he counts professional honours 
               <br />
               as nought. I say nothing of prior claims to professional honours which I have lost, from, at

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all</span> times, conscientiously <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">supporting</span> what I conceived to be right. His Excellency says that 
               <br />
               we are not ﬁt for Responsible Government. I want to know on what local data he says so? 
               <br />
               Who has tried the people? On the scope of whose mind is it said they are not ﬁt? Who has 
               <br />
               examined them?

               The Hon. Member for Victoria District has properly said, if Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Members</span> were paid for 
               <br />
               their attendance in the House <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">you</span> would soon see whether men were capable or not to enter 
               <br />
               upon and fulﬁl the duties of Responsible Government. Then we should see whether the gentle- 
               <br />
               men disguised in mean apparel—Graduates of Oxford, Cambridge, and other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Universities who</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> cast; their lot in this Colony, but are unable to defray their travelling expenses from remote 
               <br />
               places to the Capital. We should see, I say, whether they were capable, or not, of enlightening 
               <br />
               and controlling by their wisdom the feeble powers of Governmental diplomacy. Sir, by enlarged 
               <br />
               representation we shall discover such men. We had one foot forward in the direction of 
               <br />
               freedom, it has been forced back. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">franchise</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span> been taken away. Sir, I have very feebly 
               <br />
               endeavoured to touch upon these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subjects.</span> In line, I afﬁrm that the matter has not been, 
               <br />
               discussed fairly. There must he an enlarged representation, that the people may tell the

               Government what they want.

               <br />
               a part in the great work in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hand-that</span> of hewing of<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">f</span> the rough corners of the block which

               Excellency are, I consider, a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fair</span> subject of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">congratulation</span> The manner in which they have

               been received <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> this House and the people is another subject of congratulation; and the paucity

               Excellency, this House, and the country. It is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wrong,</span> Mr. President, to Charge the desire for

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> on the part of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">its</span> promoters to a desire for change. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">So</span> far as my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constituency</span>

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">case—we</span> accepted the Organic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> constituting this Council, and agreed to work it out to its

               which other parts of this Colony have. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">desire,</span> before <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">going</span> further, to allude to a charge
