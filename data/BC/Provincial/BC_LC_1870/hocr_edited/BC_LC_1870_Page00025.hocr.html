               That these objections specially apply to the extension of the principle to this Colony no 
               <br />
               one can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">doubt.</span> Lord Granville admits that the distance is an objection, but thinks that a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway</span> will annihilate time and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">space.</span> He thinks that the Government can be carried on at 
               <br />
               a distance of 3,000 miles without difficulty<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> This Railway is to bridge over the vast desert that 
               <br />
               intervenes between this Colony and Ottawa. The notion that we can with any effect represent 
               <br />
               the interests of this Colony in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Parliament</span> at Ottawa at a distance <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 3,000 miles is to me 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">absurd.</span> With a population such as ours, even if we have the representation suggested by the 
               <br />
               terms, with eight Members of Parliament <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> one hundred and eighty-two, and four Senators 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seventy―two,</span> how can it be supposed to be possible that our voices could he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">heard?</span> 
               <br />
               When Lord Granville spoke of “comprehensiveness” am “impartiality” in a Legislature, surely 
               <br />
               he must have lost sight of the constituent elements of a House of Commons. For let us consider, 
               <br />
               without any reflection upon the House <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Commons at Ottawa, what is the nature of the House 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Commons of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England,</span> or of any other assembly of the same nature? Every House of Commons 
               <br />
               is but an assemblage of the Members of Parliament pledged to support the material interests of 
               <br />
               their constituents, whenever those interests are affected. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> never can anticipate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anything</span> but 
               <br />
               the representation of the views and the material interests of constituents in any House of 
               <br />
               Commons. I believe that members would always vote according to the interests of men whose 
               <br />
               votes they would have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">again</span> to solicit, and of whose interests public opinion holds them to he 
               <br />
               the acknowledged advocates.

               How can we ﬁnd eight men in a place like this, where at all events; the most valuable 
               <br />
               members of society are professional and business men, without selecting them from a class who 
               <br />
               are politicians by profession? Most men here are workers of some sort, and actively employed 
               <br />
               in their several professions and businesses, and we should have extreme difﬁculty in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁnding</span> eight

               sentatives only in name, or we should have to take eight representatives who will be content to

               make politics a profession, and we shall <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have to</span> pay them for their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">services.</span> To the insigniﬁ-

               <br />
               in favour of Confederation on the part of the Imperial Government, it is obvious throughout 
               <br />
               that the Imperial Government desires to obtain their end and aim of Confederation in a mer―

               cantile spirit of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bargain</span> and sale, which jars upon my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feelings</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">right</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wrong.</span>
