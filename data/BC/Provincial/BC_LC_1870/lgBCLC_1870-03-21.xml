<!-- GL, 2017-03-22, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 
            <!--<p>
     as I think, probably, have said—His Excellency had acted unwisely? This question has been 
     <lb/>
     before the people; they would have been justified in jumping at the gilded bait of Responsible 
     <lb/>
     Government if the Government had not proposed a new system; but as he has done so, the 
     <lb/>
     people will do well to consider before they swallowed the barbed hook that lies under the bait. 
     <lb/>
     I desire to disclaim speaking in the interest of oflicials; their position would, so far as I 
     <lb/>
     believe, not be injured in any way by the introduction of Responsible Government. Those 
     <lb/>
     among them who were commissioned in England (I mean the heads of departments) will be 
     <lb/>
     rendered so independent that they will be above fighting after their own interests. I think 
     <lb/>
     it unlikely that they will remain here. As to the balance of officials, if Canada is as liberal 
     <lb/>
     now as of old, or as liberal as Australia, they will be well provided for, whether we have 
     <lb/>
     Responsible Government or not. Probably they will be "utilized," since that is the term we 
     <lb/>
     are to use. I claim for the system which His Excellency has foreshadowed, that it is more 
     <lb/>
     suitable to the present circumstances of this Colony than any other system which can be given 
     <lb/>
     us. Responsible Government has acted well in large communities, but in small ones I doubt 
     <lb/>
     its efficiency. It is like a painted ship on a painted ocean.  If it were obtained in a small 
     <lb/>
     Colony like this, there would be a constant game of battledore and shuttlecock going on—in 
     <lb/>
     to-day and out to-morrow. Fancy the Honourable Member for Victoria City presiding at the 
     <lb/>
     Lands and Works Department one day, and I, having paid him all the compliments I could, 
     <lb/>
     come over another day to have an interview with the Chief, and find that there has been a 
     <lb/>
     change of Ministry, there is another man in. My ideas may be wrong; if so, they can be 
     <lb/>
     corrected at the polls. If I were a man of property, with a large stake in the Colony, I should 
     <lb/>
     decidedly object to Responsible Government. I have given my opinion candidly and honestly. 
     <lb/>
     I may never sit at this Council Board again. I have given my advice to His Excellency, to 
     <lb/>
     this Board, and to my constituents. conscientiously. If I am wrong, the people will correct me. 
     <lb/>
     I speak from conviction. No doubt there is talent in British Columbia; no doubt there is plenty 
     <lb/>
     of administrative ability; there are many better men than myself, I am very sure, and that 
     <lb/>
     is one reason that I oppose Responsible Government. [Laughter.]  But the main difficulty is 
     <lb/>
     that the best men won't come here; the chaff is blown here, the wheat remains behind. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>     On motion of Hon. Mr. Drake, the debate was adjourned to Monday.

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:RING1">Hon. Mr RING</persName> rose to assume the debate, and said:— Mr.
                  Chairman, I feel assured that <lb/> the House will accord me leave to say a few
                  words. There have been submitted for the <lb/> consideration of this House two
                  amendments. and in the observations of the movers, two points <lb/> of argument
                  have been adduced,—the first founded on supposed reasoning, and the second in
                  <lb/> the way of threats and military argument, grounded on the possibility of the
                  Government <lb/> refusing to insert this condition. I desire to disengage myself
                  from this latter argument. <lb/> When I hear anything tantamount to a threat from
                  the people against the Executive, I desire <lb/> to repudiate it. Hon. Members who
                  put such a picture of warfare before us talk bunkum. I <lb/> address my humble
                  petition to His Excellency, but if his judgment is against us I say to him, <lb/>
                  stand to your point and do not give way to threats; listen to no arguments as to
                  what may <lb/> happen in the nature of threats; stand to your points. I say to
                  Executive Members, don't yield <lb/> to threats; don't be moved by them. I support
                  the principle of Responsible Government, but I <lb/> do so constitutionally. I say
                  to Executive Members, I trust you will yield to reason and <lb/> argument, but not
                  to threats. I say we can ask for Responsible Government without the leave <lb/> of
                  the Organic Act; but I say let us repudiate all connection with Canada until we
                  have secured <lb/> Responsible Government; let us not wait till we are surrounded
                  by Canadians. With regard to the <lb/> railway, I say that in the life of the
                  youngest amongst us we shall not get it; but we must <lb/> make this the main
                  Resolution : without Responsible Government let us have no Confederation. <lb/>
                  Better bear the ills we have than fly to others that we know not of. Let us not
                  run the risk <lb/> of having to ask Canada for Responsible Government. Make it the
                  emphatic <hi rendition="simple:italic">sine qua non</hi> that <lb/> we must have
                  Responsible Government or no Confederation. <lb/>

            <p>
        <persName ref="pers:HUMP1">Hon. MR. HUMPHREYS</persName>—Out of deference to the amendment offered by the Hon. Member 
     <lb/>
     for New Westminster  (Mr. Robson) , I ask the leave of the House to withdraw my motion, so 
     <lb/>
     that the amendment, the latter part, of which I like better than my own, may stand. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:CREA1">Hon. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</persName>—I regret very much that a discussion so
                  inapposite, so <lb/> totally unnecessary, should have been forced on by the other
                  side of the House at a time so <lb/> inopportune. I am glad that the Hon. Member
                  for Lillooet has withdrawn his motion ; it leaves <lb/> the Council to deal with
                  the amendment of the Hon. Member for New Westminster; and I <lb/> deeply regret
                  that the Hon. gentleman did not accept the invitation to give up a special field
                  <lb/> day to the discussion of Responsible Government, as suggested by myself
                  after we had passed <lb/> clause 15 of the Terms. This, I stated at the time. the
                  House was quite competent to do. Then <lb/> Members on this side of the House
                  might have freely joined in the discussion ; perhaps some <lb/> might have
                  supported the principle. But no ! The Hon. proposer of the amendment, with the
                  <lb/> light of battle in his eye, had refused every suggestion ; and afterwards,
                  when he began to find <lb/> out his mistake, it was too late ; there was nothing
                  for it but to go on. The melee had begun ; <lb/> the glove is down ; the visors
                  are closed, and the lists barred. It cannot be put off. If the <lb/> Hon. Member
                  for New Westminster had been opposed to Responsible Government, he could not <lb/>
                  have devised a course more adapted, than mixing up the question with terms, for
                  shelving <lb/> Responsible Government for the session. One point which requires
                  special notice and correction <lb/> is, that nearly all speakers during the debate
                  seem to think that the Governor alone could grant <lb/> any alteration of
                  Constitution that may be required, merely for the asking ; but this is a mistake ;
                  <lb/> he cannot. The Constitution can only be changed by the same power that
                  created it—the <lb/> Imperial Parliament and the Queen in Council. The Governor
                  can only recommend it ; it is <lb/> for the Home Government to say what that
                  change shall be. As to the able speech of the <lb/> Hon. Member for New
                  Westminster, the eloquenceof which I was forced to applaud in spite of <lb/>
                  myself, it was an argument based upon fallacious premises throughout, asserting
                  that we should <lb/> only have a representative majority of one, which could only
                  lead to a false conclusion ; and I <lb/> take it that the Hon. Member is in favour
                  of Responsible Government as a <hi rendition="simple:italic">sine qua non</hi> for
                  <lb/> why all this tall talking of blood, wading knee deep in blood? Why this
                  encouragement of <lb/> rebellion in defence of our rights, and the like? And yet I
                  understood the .Hon.Member for <lb/> New Westminster to say that he does not make
                  Responsible Government a <hi rendition="simple:italic">sine qua non</hi> for <lb/>
                  Confederation. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>   <persName ref="pers:ROBS1">Hon. Mr. ROBSON</persName>—I said nothing of the kind. I do not choose
                  to state whether or not I <lb/> would make it a <hi rendition="simple:italic">sine
                     qua non</hi>. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>   <persName ref="pers:CREA1">Hon. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</persName>—I have an accurate
                  recollection, and have a note of it, and <lb/> I ask the Hon. Member to state
                  whether he will make it a <hi rendition="simple:italic">sine qua non</hi>. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:TRUT1">Hon. CHIEF COMMISSIONER</persName> —I understood the

                  would not pledge himself to make it a <hi rendition="simple:italic">sine qua

               </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:ROBS1">Hon. Mr. ROBSON</persName>—I said further That I did not pledge myself that
                  the people would not. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>   <persName ref="pers:CREA1">Hon. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</persName>—I then understand that the Hon. Member
                  for New West<lb break="no"/>minster puts it not as a <hi rendition="simple:italic"
                     >sine qua non</hi>.   <lb/>
               </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:ROBS1">Hon. MR ROBSON</persName> —No, Mr. Chairman, I never said
                  that. I will not be placed in such a <lb/> position. I refuse to have such an
                  issue forced upon us. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:CREA1">Hon. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</persName>—Either the Hon. Member puts it one way
                  or the other ; <lb/> one of two opposites must be true I can quite understand and
                  must prefer the direct and <lb/> simple issue of the Hon. Member for Victoria
                  District, for immediate Responsible Government <lb/> in any case, either with or
                  without Confederation.   I say, Sir, that the question is in no way <lb/>
                  connected with the discussion of this clause. I said that Responsible Government
                  ought not <lb/> to be considered until after the Council is reconstituted with an
                  increased representation, as <lb/> shadowed forth in His Excellency's speech. I
                  have said that we shall have the sole control <lb/> of the matter in our own hands
                  if we have Confederation. I say we, because I identify myself <lb/> with this
                  country.   I speak on this matter as a citizen. I say that if we have
                  Confederation <lb/> we shall have an opportunity of getting Responsible
                  Government. If we have not Confederation <lb/> then we shall have increased
                  representation, and under that we can get Responsible Government <lb/> if the
                  country as a unit goes for it. Honourable Members are complicating this question.
                  I <lb/> cannot imagine that it was the intention of the Honourable Member for New
                  Westminster to <lb/> complicate the question. I have too much respect for him to
                  allow myself to suppose so ; it is <lb/>
                  <pb n="107" facs="final/images/BC_LC_1870-03-21_Page_107.jpg"/>
                  <fw type="running">CONFEDERATION DEBATE.</fw>
                  <fw type="num">107</fw> impossible; and that he wished to force a negative is
                  equally impossible. It is an error of <lb/> judgment, in my opinion. If it had
                  been left to the Council separately, it would have left <lb/> Honourable Members
                  more at liberty to consider the question freely. I was, in common with <lb/> other
                  Members, carried away in admiration of the outburst of oratory of the Honourable
                  <lb/> Member. But there was an allusion—a warning. It is said that it was not a
                  threat; but <lb/> there was talk of shouldering muskets, and of blood and
                  bloodshed, as it that was the proper <lb/> way to get civil rights. I protest
                  against these threats, these turgid speeches which oppress <lb/> the ears of those
                  who wish to listen to argument and reason. As to the opposition of the <lb/>
                  Government Members, it arises from no dislike to the system on the part of the
                  head of the <lb/> Executive. Responsible Government interposes a barrier between
                  the people and the Governor, <lb/> which is most useful to the Governor. I say
                  that we are not in a position to take advantage <lb/> of Responsible Government.
                  If the country thinks it necessary or desirable, what is there to <lb/> prevent
                  our getting it when we choose to ask for it? The Honourable Member for New West<lb
                     break="no"/>minster himself told us that the Imperial Government were always
                  ready to step in, and yet <lb/> he hints at violence and disturbance. When the
                  Honourable Chief Commissioner of Lands and <lb/> Works proposed a Resolution last
                  session, which was seconded by myself, with respect to a <lb/> change in the
                  Constitution, asking for a Council with a majority of one of representative <lb/>
                  Members, Honourable Members said we don't want the change and voted it down. If we
                  had <lb/> secured this, we should have been a step further in advance than we are
                  in constitutional <lb/> progress. I say we must hesitate before any body
                  constituted as this Council is can pass <lb/> resolutions of such a nature. Any
                  such resolutions ought to express the full and deliberate <lb/> opinions of the
                  country. As to the special merits of Responsible Government itself, it is hardly
                  <lb/> necessary to argue it here at such an inopportune time. I shall, therefore,
                  merely say that I <lb/> think it totally inapplicable at present to the
                  circumstances of British Columbia, where popu<lb break="no"/>lation is so sparse,
                  and lies at the circumference of a circle which contains an area of 300,000 <lb/>
                  square miles, and where representation is so difficult that the form suggested
                  would be the most <lb/> expensive that could be adopted, and instead of preventing
                  agitation, will be likely to increase it. <lb/> Much of the population is alien,
                  and, in any case, this Council is not the proper body to pass <lb/> upon it. If,
                  however, the country is of a different opinion, they can say so at the polls, and
                  <lb/> there is no power can prevent their getting Responsible Government. But, I
                  would ask, what <lb/> makes the system so particularly attractive to Honourable
                  Members who advocate it? We are <lb/> told that it is solely because it will be
                  good for the Colony, but there is no attempt to prove <lb/> the proposition that
                  has been set up. Another thing strikes me as coming with a very bad <lb/> grace
                  from those who support this recommendation. It presupposes a distrust of Canada,
                  and <lb/> assumes that men of the large experience of Canadian statesmen, and so
                  reliable as they are, <lb/> are not to be trusted to yield to a general cry from
                  the country for enlarged representative <lb/> institutions. I don't think that
                  this is the time to go into the question. I say, then, that <lb/> whenever
                  Responsible Government is wanted it can be had. I need hardly refer to the
                  position <lb/> of official Members in this matter. The terms already passed by the
                  House, so far as this <lb/> question is in any way connected with Confederation,
                  leave the officials free to express their <lb/> opinions. I must, myself, vote
                  against this recommendation, and I press upon the Honourable <lb/> Members to do
                  the same, in order to prevent the complication of the terms with any such <lb/>
                  irrelevant question. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:TRUT1">Hon. CHIEF COMMISSIONER</persName>—I must endeavour in as few words as
                  possible to state <lb/> the position of the Government Members upon the subject
                  now before the House. I fully <lb/> understand that it was imperative upon some
                  Hon. Members to bring forward this question of <lb/> responsibility at some period
                  of the present session, having advocated it by speech and pen as <lb/> the
                  specific remedy for the ills that the Colony was labouring under. Consistency
                  demanded <lb/> that the question should be brought up by them for discussion; it
                  was a logical necessity. <lb/> Inexorable fate, I say, impelled certain Hon.
                  Members to advocate Responsible Government. <lb/> I had, however, hoped that the
                  Hon. Members who advocated it would have reserved it for <lb/> separate
                  consideration. instead of bringing it up as an amendment to this clause now under
                  <lb/> consideration. [<persName ref="pers:ROBS1">Mr. Robson</persName>—"No, not an amendment"] <supplied><persName ref="pers:TRUT1">Hon. CHIEF COMMISSIONER</persName></supplied> Virtually it is an
                  amendment. If <lb/> this clause had prescribed that any future alteration in the
                  constitution should have been <lb/> dependent on Canada, then I could see the
                  desirabilitv of Hon. Members on the other side of <lb/> the House taking exception
                  to it; but as it is I confess I am at a loss to comprehend their <lb/> position.
                  Although, as I said inexorable fate compelled Hon. Members to bring the subject <lb/>
                  <pb n="108" facs="final/images/BC_LC_1870-03-21_Page_108.jpg"/>
                  <fw type="num">108</fw>
                  <fw type="running">CONFEDERATION DEBATE.</fw> forward, it is a mistake to bring it
                  up in a Council constituted as this is, especially when the <lb/> Governor has so
                  distinctly expressed his views in opposition to the inauguration of Responsible
                  <lb/> Government at the present time. It would surely have been much more to the
                  advantage of <lb/> the cause they advocate for Hon. Members to have postponed the
                  consideration of the question <lb/> for the more representative House shadowed
                  forth in His Excellency's speech. I say shadowed <lb/> forth, for on reflection it
                  must be plain to all Hon. Members that His Excellency was not in a <lb/> position
                  to tell what the constitution of that House will be. He does not know. He has
                  <lb/> recommended certain changes for Imperial sanction; they may or may not be
                  favourably con<lb break="no"/>sidered. His Excellency does, however, tell you that
                  the representative element will be larger; <lb/> and I think, therefore, that it
                  would have been wiser on the part of the representative members <lb/> who advocate
                  Responsible Government to have left it to the next Council instead of bringing
                  <lb/> it forward while the present Resolutions are under discussion. The subject,
                  if not positively <lb/> irrelevant, is not connected with this Resolution, which
                  simply provides, as a matter of form, <lb/> power to change the constitution, in
                  accordance with the Organic Act when the people desire <lb/> it. In common with
                  the Hon. Attorney-General, I am surprised that Hon. Members who <lb/> cordially
                  support Confederation should be afraid to trust the Dominion Government upon this
                  <lb/> question. I am' surprised at the inconsistency of those who tell you that
                  the people could not <lb/> get Responsible Government under Confederation, and
                  that the wishes of the people would not <lb/> be allowed to prevail. I am
                  surprised particularly at the Hon. Member for New Westminster <lb/> expressing any
                  doubt upon this subject. I, as an individual member of this community, would <lb/>
                  willingly leave the interests of the Colony to the guardianship of the Canadian
                  Government. <lb/> If I did not think that that Govermnent would exercise whatever
                  power it might have for the <lb/> benefit of the people, instead of, as suggested
                  by Hon. Members, for its own aggrandiscment, <lb/> I would have no Confederation.
                  If under Confederation there would be no chance of Respon<lb break="no"/>sible
                  Government, how can the Hon, Member expect to get it from a Council constituted as
                  <lb/> this is? However, as the subject has been brought forward for discussion, it
                  behooves us to <lb/> consider it upon its merits. There were two propositions
                  before the House. The Hon. Member <lb/> for Lillooet has withdrawn his, which was
                  in reality but a vague expression of an abstract   <lb/> opinion in favour of
                  Responsible Government—a recommendation in general terms. We have <lb/> now to
                  confine our attention to the amendment of the Hon. Member for New Westminster; the
                  <lb/> preamble of which states that Confederation will not be satisfactory to the
                  people without <lb/> Responsible Government. The resolution itself, although
                  embodying the same principle as the <lb/> one which has been withdrawn,
                  contemplates a practical step towards obtaining the object <lb/> recommended, by
                  addressing the Governor. The Hon. Member for New Westminster was <lb/> careful to
                  reserve his own opinion, but he very positive that Confederation without Respon<lb
                     break="no"/>sible Government would not be acceptable to the people. Coming now
                  to the subject and matter <lb/> of the speeches of the two Hon. Members, I find
                  that the arguments of the Hon. Member for <lb/> Lillooet are simply invectives;
                  his entire logic is abuse of the Government and the persons <lb/> composing it. I
                  have always understood that assertion is not fact, and that invective is not <lb/>
                  argument. It may be that my inability to appreciate the force of his remarks
                  arises from my <lb/> not possessing the qualification which he told us was
                  essential to a proper understanding of <lb/> the people and the people's affairs.
                  It may he that I have not "eaten and drunk and slept <lb/> with the people," and
                  cannot, therefore, rightly estimate the strength of demonstration which <lb/>
                  general and indiscriminate abuse of Government officials may convey to some minds.
                  As to <lb/> the Hon. Member's earnestness of belief in his case, his
                  conscientiousness in the discharge of <lb/> his duty to his constituents and to
                  the Colony, had we ever any doubt of it, his positive and <lb/> repeated
                  assurances of the honesty of his intentions in this matter, of his uni-altering
                     deter<lb break="no"/>mination to do his duty to those he represents. must have
                  forced conviction upon us. But, <lb/> while giving him full credit for singlcness
                  of purpose, I must take leave to remark on his <lb/> singular mode of recommending
                  ,the subject to the favourable consideration of this Council, <lb/> since his
                  argument in its favour is to heap general accusation and vituperation on the
                  Official <lb/> Members of this Council, whom he invites to join with him by voting
                  in favour of his views,—to <lb/> confirm his view of their utter haseness and
                  worthlessness. I shall not place myself in opposi<lb break="no"/>tion to such a
                  line of argument. But, Sir, the argument of the Hon. Member for New West<lb
                     break="no"/>minster is of a very different character. I congratulate him, and I
                  congratulate the House, on <lb/> the manner in which the matter was treated by
                  him, and especially as regards the officials. I <lb/> acknowledge the courteous
                  manner in which he touched on those points in his arguments which <lb/> affected
                  the members at this end of the table. It is inseparable from the discussion of
                  this <lb/>
                  <pb n="109" facs="final/images/BC_LC_1870-03-21_Page_109.jpg"/>

                  <fw type="num">109</fw> question in this House that it must to some extent partake
                  of a personal character; it must <lb/> almost mean a vote of want of confidence in
                  Government officials. The smallness of the com<lb break="no"/>munity reduces it
                  almost to a question amongst individuals, and as the Government Members <lb/> have
                  been placed. unnecessarily and inexpediently, as I think, to some extent upon
                  their defence, <lb/> I must speak plainly on some points, but in doing so I must
                  deprecate any idea of giving offence. <lb/> I say, then, that Responsible
                  Government is not desirable. and is not applicable to this Colony <lb/> at
                  present; is practically unworkable. And here I would deprecate the impression
                  which is <lb/> being so studiously instilled into the people of this Colony
                  concerning what has been said of <lb/> the unfitness of the Colony for Responsible
                  Government. His Excellency the Governor has never <lb/> said, nor has any member
                  of the Government ever said, that the people are unfit, individually, <lb/> to
                  govern themselves. 1 say that, man for man. this community will compare favourably
                  with <lb/> any people on this coast. ["Hear, hear," from the <persName ref="pers:CREA1">Attorney-General</persName>.]
                  <supplied><persName ref="pers:TRUT1">Hon. CHIEF COMMISSIONER</persName></supplied> Nor is it even the <lb/> smallness of the population that I consider to be the
                  great objection, although I admit that <lb/> this is a drawback; but it is the
                  scattered character of that population. It would be practically <lb/> impossible
                  to organize electoral districts so that they should propeer represent the
                  interests of <lb/> the separate parts, and of the whole Colony. As Victoria is the
                  centre of wealth, and intelligence <lb/> also. it you will, under present
                  circumstances the Government would be centralized in the hands <lb/> of
                  Victorians, who would thus rule theColony, and this would be objectionable ["Hear,
                  hear," <lb/> from <persName ref="pers:HOLB1">Mr. Holbrook</persName>]; <supplied><persName ref="pers:TRUT1">Hon. CHIEF COMMISSIONER</persName></supplied> and I say also that there would be a great
                  difficulty in getting proper <lb/> representatives to represent the respective
                  districts. I do not agree with the Hon. Member who <lb/> has stated that only the
                  chaff of the people is blown into this House; for 1 say, Sir, that this <lb/>
                  Council, constituted as it is. has proved that men fit to represent the people do
                  come here. <lb/> Responsible Government will come as a matter of course when the
                  community is fit for it; but <lb/> that form of government is not fitted for
                  communities in their infancy. It has never been so <lb/> considered. Look abroad
                  into the world and you will find large populations without Responsible <lb/>
                  Govermnent. There is no necessity to look far off to see whether the Anglo-Saxon
                  race must <lb/> necessarily have Responsible Government. Look across the Straits,
                  where there is a population <lb/> of, I suppose, 30,000 people. and there they
                  have neither Responsible Government nor representa<lb break="no"/>tive
                  institutions. Look at Oregon, also with no representation until the population
                  exceeded <lb/> 45,000. Look at the Red River Settlement, also with a population
                  larger than ours; they do not <lb/> apply for Responsible Government. It does not
                  follow, according to the rule of Anglo-Saxon <lb/> minds, that this form of
                  government must prevail. I do not think the sort of responsibility <lb/> which is
                  advocated would be suitable to this Colony at present, or would promote its true
                  <lb/> interests. If T did think it desirable I should be found amongst its most
                  cordial advocates, as <lb/> this is a matter open for discussion without
                  Government direction. But I think, Sir, that our <lb/> present form of Government
                  is practically a more real responsibility to the people than that <lb/> proposed
                  by the Hon. Member for New Westminster; this form which the Hon. Member for <lb/>
                  Lillooet finds it so easy to animadvert upon. For we are in reality. if not
                  directly, responsible <lb/> to the people. We, as servants of the Crown, are
                  directly and immediately responsible to the <lb/> Governor, and the Governor is
                  responsible to the Queen, who is the guardian of the people's <lb/> rights. This
                  is no mere idea, for the fact of responsibility has been, over and over again,
                  <lb/> proved. If you have any good grounds of complaint you know where to lay them
                  and get <lb/> redress. This responsibility which we owe is more real, less
                  fluctuating. less open to doubtful <lb/> influences, and under it the rights of
                  the whole country are secured and protected and not <lb/> those of the majority,
                  to the prejudice of the minority, as under the so-called Responsible <lb/>
                  Government. which really means Party Government, advocated so warmly by the Hon.
                  Member <lb/> for New Westminster. Why, Sir. the Hon. Member has admitted to you
                  that under that system <lb/> the Government of the day might come down to pass
                  measures by unfair means. <lb/>

                  <persName ref="pers:TRUT1">Hon. CHIEF COMMISSIONER</persName>—The Hon. Member

                  Government might come down to the House and <lb/> carry measures by means not
                  excessively fair." I say that this cannot occur under the present <lb/> system;
                  that no corruption can be charged against this Government. 1 think the House is
                  <lb/> capable of being remodelled. i would rather see a larger element of
                  representative govern<lb break="no"/>ment in this Council, with such a majority
                  that the Government would have no opportunity <lb/> of passing a measure
                  objectionable to the people, as understood by their representatives; such <lb/> a
                  majority as I advocated in a resolution submitted to this Council. But the Hon.

                  <fw type="running">CONFEDERATION DEBATE.</fw> for New Westminster, for Victoria
                  District, and for Lillooet, tell you that the people desire <lb/> Responsible
                  Government ; that they must have it. and will have it. I say, Sir, that if they do
                  <lb/> say so. which I very much doubt, it is because the population have been
                  educated up to it by <lb/> those who have agitated the subject through the press
                  and through speeches. Some no doubt <lb/> press for it from conviction, and some
                  with a view to serving their own ends; but I believe, <lb/> Sir, that what the
                  people really want is such an administration of the Government as will <lb/> tend
                  to bring back prosperity to the Colony. You are told that the present oliicials
                  have no <lb/> sympathy with the people ; that they are not of the people; that
                  they move in a different sphere, <lb/> and constitute a class by themselves.    Is
                  this true—or is it not rather the fact that persons <lb/> who have ends to serve
                  have put us in a class by ourselves?   The Hon. Member says that the <lb/> hands
                  of the benefactors of the people must be callous with labour. Who, I ask, are
                  those <lb/> throughout the world who have laboured most for the people by speech
                  and pen? I say that <lb/> the great statesmen who have done most to advance the
                  truest interests of the people, have <lb/> not sprung from the ranks of those whom
                  the Hon. Member classes as the people. The Hon. <lb/> Member for New Westminster
                  says that the present Government Officials are well enough, <lb/> able and honest,
                  but that they cannot enjoy the confidence of the people because they are not <lb/>
                  <hi rendition="simple:italic">their</hi> officials ; they are not elected by them.
                  And, be as able as we might, and as honest, and <lb/> work as we might, and do
                  what we might for the people's good, we could not gain their con<lb break="no"
                  />fidence because we are not directly responsible to them. And the Hon. Member
                  sympathized <lb/> with us for the position. Now, Sir, if it be true, as he says,
                  that the Government have not the <lb/> confidence of the community when, he says,
                  they deserve it, whose is the fault? I say, Sir, it <lb/> is the fault of those
                  who, by voice and pen, have for years sedulously prejudiced the public <lb/> mind
                  of this community against that Government, not by pointing out faults to be
                  remedied, <lb/> but by general and indiscriminate fault finding, descending to
                  personal abuse, and even to the <lb/> verge of scurrility. We have striven to do
                  our duty.   Hon Members do not advance argu<lb break="no"/>ments, but content
                  themselves with saying that we are unpopular. I tell you why : If false <lb/>
                  impressions have gone abroad on this point let the responsibility of those
                  impressions rest <lb/> where it ought ; for I say that it has been the business of
                  certain persons to prejudice the public <lb/> mind against Government officials.
                  Let them settle the question of motives with their own <lb/> consciences and with
                  the people. If the officials in this House occupied the positions which <lb/>
                  would be held by officials under party government, I could understand the
                  persistent course of <lb/> the opposition offered by some members present ; but
                  when I see the changed position, that <lb/> there is no Responsible Government,
                  and that our mouths are closed and our pens cannot be <lb/> used in self-defence,
                  I feel that we have been struck in a cowardly manner, and let the public <lb/>
                  defend the motives of those who have attacked us. I invite all in this House, or
                  out of it, to <lb/> aid as to carry on the Government. and to act in a reasonable
                  way in promoting the general <lb/> interests of the Colony. Whether we are to have
                  Responsible Government or not I don't know. <lb/> I feel that it will come in good
                  time, when the circumstances of the Colony are so changed as <lb/> to admit of its
                  adoption—I think sooner with Confederation than without it. But whether we <lb/>
                  have it or not, I ask Hon. Members to assist us instead of endeavouring to
                  complicate matters <lb/> and retard the progress of the Colony. I ask them to give
                  us some credit for good intentions <lb/> Now, Sir, one remark in conclusion : the
                  Hon. Member for New Westminster, in his powerful <lb/> oration, has not only
                  allured us with the prospects of popularity under Responsible Govern<lb break="no"
                  />ment, but he has, I will not say threatened, warned us of the result of our
                  opposing him in <lb/> this matter. He tells us that unless Responsible Government
                  be conceded the cause of Confed<lb break="no"/>eration will be ruined ; that the
                  people would not have Confederation without Responsible <lb/> Government. This in
                  fact is embodied in the preamble of his Resolution, Sir, I have cordially <lb/>
                  supported Confederation because I honestly believe that it will be for the benefit
                  of the local <lb/> interests of this connnunity as well as for the security and
                  consolidation of Imperial interests; <lb/> but I believe that this community is
                  not ready for Responsible Government, 1 will not, there<lb break="no"/>fore, do
                  what I consider wrong that good may come ; I will not vote for Responsible
                     Govern<lb break="no"/>ment for the sake of gaining Confederation. I, for one,
                  say, if the people won't have Confedera» <lb/> tion without Responsible
                  Government; if they regard Responsible Government as the main <lb/> object of
                  Confederation ; if they do not appreciate the real advantages of Confederation,
                  let <lb/> Confederation wait a while. The Governor has sent down Resolutions which
                  he thinks can be <lb/> carried out. and we hold that, whether under Confederation
                  or not, this matter of Responsible <lb/> Government will ultimately have to be
                  settled by the vote of the people. When the proper <lb/>
                  <pb n="111" facs="final/images/BC_LC_1870-03-21_Page_111.jpg"/>
                  <fw type="running">CONFEDERATION DEBATE.</fw>
                  <fw type="num">111</fw> time comes we shall, I say, as a matter of course, have
                  Responsible Government ; and that <lb/> time will arrive sooner under
                  Confederation than without it. I trust the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment ; I
                  do not think they will go against the will of the people. I believe that in this,
                  as in <lb/> other matters, if they exercise influence at all, it will be for the
                  good of the country. A <lb/> Government of liberal institutions cannot be expected
                  to oppose the wishes of the people in <lb/> proper and reasonable matters.
                  Responsible Government ought not to be a condition of Con<lb break="no"
                  />federation ; and I say that in these Resolutions it is very properly left to be
                  settled in a new <lb/> and more fully representative Council, which the Governor
                  has told us he is going to obtain <lb/> Imperial sanction to establish. But if
                  Confederation is to depend on this question of Responsible <lb/> Government, then
                  I say let it be the test also of the reality of the supporters of Confederation.

               <p><persName ref="pers:ROBS1">Hon. MR. ROBSON</persName> —I expect the privilege of a general reply,
                  but I desire to explain, <lb/> now, that the Hon. Chief Connnissioner has made an
                  unfair use of what I said about "horny <lb/> hands and patched garments." I
                  disclaim having used it in that connection attributed to me; <lb/> his remarks are
                  unfair. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:WALK1">Hon. Mr. WALKEM</persName>—I think on an important question of this kind
                  every member should <lb/> give a reason for his vote. I have given the matter
                  great consideration, and had intended <lb/> entering somewhat fully into the
                  discussion, but the Hon. Chief Commissioner has anticipated <lb/> me. I have been
                  utterly astonished as I listened to what fell from him. I entirely coincide <lb/>
                  with him in his argument and in his views. Indeed, I can hardly help thinking that
                  either <lb/> he has copied my notes or I his. I must congratulate myself on coming
                  to this conclusion. <lb/> On the same ground I congratulate the House on the good
                  temper, good taste, intelligence, <lb/> and ability with which this question has
                  been launched for discussion. The main speech <lb/> —for the Hon. Member for
                  Victoria District did not deign to express his views—has been <lb/> that of the
                  Hon. Member for New Westminster. As I listened to that speech, Sir, one of <lb/>
                  the best ever uttered in this House. I almost felt that for live long years I had
                  been wrong,— <lb/> he almost made a convert of me ; but upon looking a little more
                  closely into it I find that <lb/> it is based upon false premises ; his arguments
                  are fallacious, and his conclusions wrong. The <lb/> Hon. Member says that
                  Responsible Government is a principle which may be applied either to <lb/> the
                  Great Eastern, or to a dairy churn. or to a lady's watch; that it is a principle
                  capable of <lb/> being carried out by three or three hundred. This is utterly
                  incorrect ; it is not a principle, but <lb/> a form, one element of which is
                  responsibility to the people. It is a form adopted by the people, <lb/> but it
                  does not follow, as a matter of induction, that it can be used or carried out in
                  every <lb/> place or by every community. In 1837 the rebellion in Canada, for the
                  purpose of acquiring <lb/> Responsible Government, took place. The rebellion was
                  raised and the question agitated <lb/> simply for changing the form of Government,
                  What was the population ? It was in the <lb/> neighbourhood of 2,000,000 in 1837.
                  and of 2,500,000 in 1861. Look at the difference of the <lb/> population of this
                  Colony ; after deducting the aliens and females, there is scarcely a voting <lb/>
                  population through the whole Colony of 3,000. Have the whole country mapped out
                  and show <lb/> me how much further the Governor can go in usefully extending the
                  representation. We <lb/> have nine members, and out of these nine, under
                  Responsible Government, we should have to <lb/> elect a Colonial Secretary, an
                  Attorney-General, a Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works, <lb/> and probably two
                  other Cabinet Ministers ; altogether five in office, and four struggling for <lb/>
                  power. Make the whole number eighteen and you then have a constant struggle for
                  power ; a <lb/> struggle such as we have not had in this Colony before. and such
                  as I hope we shall not see. <lb/> There are virtually two ends of the Colony which
                  represent all the wealth and property of the <lb/> community—Victoria and Cariboo.
                  Cariboo would be contending for the repeal of road tolls, <lb/> and Victoria would
                  be contending that they ought to be paid. It may be said that these <lb/> general
                  questions of taxation will be left to the Dominion Government, but there are many
                  <lb/> other subjects which will create differences between the two ends of the
                  Colony. The Hon. <lb/> Member for New Westminster says if we go in without
                  Responsible Government we shall go <lb/> in with agitation, Does any one believe
                  that if we had Responsible Government to-morrow, <lb/> politicians will have no
                  subject on which to agitate. Political agitation will never cease. Let <lb/> us go
                  further. As the Honourable Chief Commissioner says, we have the United States
                     advo<lb break="no"/>cating Responsible Government, and that form of it which is
                  said to be the best in theory, <lb/> a form in reality democratic ; but the people
                  are not educated to the extent of the principle <lb/> itself. Americans are averse
                  not only to granting small but large territories the freedom <lb/> which we now
                  ask, They say : "You shall be a Territory until you are properly educated." <lb/>

<p>
     For instance. there is Washington Territory, with a population of 27,000, sends a Delegate to 
     <lb/>
     Congress, who has no vote. Dakota, another Territory, has been refused admission as a State 
     <lb/>
     until it has a population larger than it now possesses. I am just reminded about Alaska, 
     <lb/>
     which is not even a Territory yet. General Thomas reported against giving it any other than 
     <lb/>
     a military form of Government How can we. then, expect Responsible Government with our 
     <lb/>
     population? I know that there are Honourable Members wavering; their interests tell them 
     <lb/>
     to vote one way, their conscience points to another. I say. vote according to your conscience. 
     <lb/>
     I say that a village can never have Responsible Government. I maintain that it would prove 
     <lb/>
     a curse, through the agitation that would follow, instead of a blessing. I coincide with the 
     <lb/>
     Honourable Member for New Westminster as to what he says as to callous hands. I believe 
     <lb/>
     there are men with tattered garments in the upper country quite capable of giving a sensible 
     <lb/>
     vote upon all questions likely to come before a Council in this Colony; but we find that they 
     <lb/>
     have too much to do; they have no time for politics; they have to earn their own bread. I 
     <lb/>
     believe that the Honourable Member for Caribou has uttered the true sentiments of the great 
     <lb/>
     majority of the district. I do not believe that Cariboo is favourable to Responsible Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Those gentlemen with the patched garments and callous hands have the same oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity that the Member for New Westminster has had of coming into the House. He has 
     <lb/>
     told us with pride of his hard work as a pioneer on the Fraser River; and today we hear him 
     <lb/>
     advocating, with most eloquent language, his views upon this great question. His voice has 
     <lb/>
     had much to do with shaping the councils of this House. and, I ask, are these doors shut to 
     <lb/>
     any man in the Colony of equal talent with the Honourable gentleman, who can be found 
     <lb/>
     willing to devote their time to the service of their country? I do not feel in the servile 
     <lb/>
     position or being obliged to vote one way or the other. I am as free to vote as the Honourable 
     <lb/>
     Member himself. I shall give my vote to the best of my ability. I believe that no compul<lb break="no"/>sion has been brought to bear upon any Member of this House, official or otherwise. The 
     <lb/>
     latter part of the speech of the Honourable gentleman (Mr. Robson) is hardly worthy of the 
     <lb/>
     former. It contains language which I am very sorry he has used; language which makes me 
     <lb/>
     believe that it is not from conviction, but that it is intended to go forth to the world to stir 
     <lb/>
     up the people; excellent stump oratory, if, without intending the slightest disrespect. I may 
     <lb/>
     use the term. I believe it is not the wish of the property owners of Victoria to' have Respon<lb break="no"/>sible Government. Do you suppose, Sir, that property owners are going, willingly, to entrust 
     <lb/>
     their interests to persons of whom they know nothing? I do not dread professional politicians; 
     <lb/>
     I believe they are as useful as any other professional men in their way; but I say, as a 
     <lb/>
     fact, there are no politicians here with the exception of those who have devoted their time to 
     <lb/>
     politics Why, I ask, is there so great an antipathy to leaving this question for the people to 
     <lb/>
     decide at the polls? "' Give us," says the other side, " an opportunity of educating ourselves, 
     <lb/>
     so that our mistakes, when made, may be remedied." I say that there is no better education 
     <lb/>
     than this Council, in which Hon. Members have education before they Come to Responsible 
     <lb/>
     Government; for under the scheme foreshadowed by the Governor, the position will be very 
     <lb/>
     little inferior to Responsible Government. Depend upon it, if the Canadian Government think 
     <lb/>
     we can manage Responsible Govermnent they will give it to us—they will be glad to get rid 
     <lb/>
     of the question. I say, however, this question is being agitated at an inopportune time. I, 
     <lb/>
     for one, would not consent to trust my interests to any such change. I do not believe in the 
     <lb/>
     present form of Government but if the form foreshadowed by the Governor be carried out, it 
     <lb/>
     will give the people a system very little interior, as l have said, to Responsible Government, 
     <lb/>
     and infinitely more workable. I trust that, Hon. Members will give due weight to the remarks 
     <lb/>
     of other speakers who have preceded me upon the question. and will well consider their votes.

                  <persName ref="pers:DRAK1">Hon. Mr. DRAKE</persName> —Mr. Chairman, I have a
                  strong objection to this clause being inserted; <lb/> it never ought to have been
                  in the terms. It presumes that this Colony is willing to go into <lb/>
                  Confederation with the form of Government that we have at present. It seems to
                  have been <lb/> put in as a sop to Canada; it ought to have been left out. I
                  cannot see why it is inserted, <lb/> or what advantage it can possibly be to us.
                  If we go into Confederation bound hand and foot <lb/> with the some form of
                  Government as now. we shall have no power to change the form. We <lb/> shall then
                  have Canada as a Queen Regnant. We shall then have an Executive who will, if <lb/>
                  so directed. vote against Responsible Government. This Colony would be a preserve
                  for <lb/> Canadian statesmen and Canadian patronage; we shall be no more advanced
                  then than now. <lb/> Without going into argument i may be pardoned, I trust, if I
                  quote three propositions of John <lb/>

                  <fw type="num">113</fw> Stuart Mill on Responsible Government: First, "Do the
                  people require it; or are they unwilling <lb/> to accept it?" We are told that
                  this has not been made a question; I deny this statement. <lb/> It has been made a
                  question, more or less, in Victoria at every election. Every election <lb/>
                  depends more or less on this point. Second, "Are the people willing to take the
                  burdens which <lb/> are imposed on them by such a form? " I say that we have the
                  answer to this proposition in <lb/> the fact of there being people willing to come
                  here where they are practically useless. Do not <lb/> persons come forward to
                  represent the people? A very large majority of the people take part <lb/> in every
                  election. Third, "Are the people willing and able to do that which will enable the
                  <lb/> Government to perform its functions properly?" This, I contend, is the
                  condition of the <lb/> Colony. The main argument of the Chief Commissioner in his
                  very able speech, a broad argu<lb break="no"/>ment and very well put, is that the
                  population is scattered. I say this argument cannot be <lb/> used with effect. We
                  are told that the Government would fall into the hands of Victoria as <lb/> the
                  centre of population and wealth; no great harm if it did. Victoria is dependent
                  upon all <lb/> parts of the Colony, and they on her; their interests are
                  identical, Another objection that has <lb/> been raised is, that we cannot get men
                  of proper intelligence and qualifications for positions of <lb/> honour and trust.
                  Looking round this Council Board we see men who have come out to this <lb/> Colony
                  to make their own fortunes and homes. Out of them the present members of the <lb/>
                  Government have been chosen, and out of our present population there can he found
                  an equal <lb/> number of men who can properly fulfil the duties of the Government.
                  I cannot see that it is <lb/> impossible to find proper men. If we find men
                  willing to sit in this Council now, we shall <lb/> find plenty ready and anxious
                  to share in the burdens of Responsible Government. The suffi<lb break="no"/>ciency
                  or insufficiency of population is not an element in this question. The United
                  States <lb/> has been pointed out to us as an example. I say there is no
                  Responsible Government in the <lb/> United States; it is an absolute despotic
                  democracy, absolutely irresponsible to the people, <lb/> except once in four
                  years. There is no such thing as responsibi ty in the form of government <lb/> of
                  the United States, The only means of getting rid of a minister is by impeachment.
                  The <lb/> Hon, Member for Cariboo, in his rambling speech, gives us no new
                  argument against Responsible <lb/> Government. He certainly reiterated much that
                  was forcibly put forward by the Hon. Chief <lb/> Commissioner. I can well believe
                  that the wheat was left at Cariboo, and the chaff came here. <lb/>

                  <persName ref="pers:HUMP1">Hon. MR. HUMPHREYS</persName> —Sir, I have listened to
                  the speeches of the Hon. Chief Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner of Lands and Works and
                  to the Hon. Government nominee, and I find them difficult <lb/> to answer, because
                  there is so little in them, The only way would be to have them printed <lb/> and
                  read them. They carry their answers with them. One Hon. Member says that it rests
                  <lb/> on numbers. I say that intelligence is the only qualification for
                  Responsible Government; <lb/> numbers have nothing to do with it. If I err I am
                  proud of erring with some of the greatest <lb/> men that England ever produced.
                  The Hon. Chief Commissioner has admitted that the popu<lb break="no"/>lation,
                  taken man for man, is equal to that of any country. Then, I say, we have the
                  proper <lb/> qualification. Let us have practical, and not theoretical, means of
                  governing. What is really <lb/> the case? Under the present term of Government the
                  people have to pay for the privilege and <lb/> benefit of a few gentlemen sitting
                  round this board. Take away this form of government and <lb/> make it more
                  liberal, and what is the danger? All the civil wars and troubles have not arisen
                  <lb/> from the uneducated, but from the ambition of the so-called educated
                  classes. The people have <lb/> been the conservatives who came forward to keep the
                  country going. Take away the so-called <lb/> intelligent and educated classes and
                  it will be no great loss; the labouring classes can always <lb/> supply men to
                  fill their places. But take away the working classes and you kill the world; the
                  <lb/> educated classes cannot fill their places. In my opinion, Sir, the people
                  want practical reality. <lb/> They have endured too long the law's delay and the
                  insolence of those in office. Why should <lb/> we come here, year after year, to
                  ask for a change in the form of government? I think that <lb/> Responsible
                  Government should be a <hi rendition="simple:italic">sine qua non</hi> of
                  Confederation. I shall move an amend<lb break="no"/>ment to that effect. <lb/>

<p>
     Government of, from, for, and by the people, without regard to the material interests of the 
     <lb/>
     Colony. This means government by politicians. These gentlemen will sacrifice every benefit 
     <lb/>
     to the Colony for Responsible Government. Confederation to me means terms; to them it 
     <lb/>
     means pickings, office. place, and power. This will be represented, I am well aware, as being 
     <lb/>
     the result of being in the Executive Council. It is said that there is a great difference between 
     <lb/>
     the atmosphere of the two Councils. I acknowledge it. There, with closed doors, people speak 
     <lb/>
     the truth, without any <hi rendition="simple:italic">ad captandum</hi> arguments addressed to the galleries. There people can 
     <lb/>
     state what their opinions really are. Here popularity ' has to be sought. We are told that the 
     <lb/>
     people will fight for Responsible Government. That is mere nothing—words only. The Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Member for New Westminster in his able speech erected a very handsome structure, but, like 
     <lb/>
     most fancy structures, it will be a very expensive one. He wants a Government like Ontario; 
     <lb/>
     that is a Government of one House, with eighty members. For a Government of that kind not 
     <lb/>
     less than forty or fifty would be absolutely necessary. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:ROBS1">Hon. MR. ROBSON</persName> —I never said like that of Ontario, but that
                  we wanted the principle <lb/> of Responsible Government as existing in Ontario.
                  <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:HELM1">Hon. MR. HELMCKEN</persName> —Then why not bring in a scheme embodying
                  it? The true prin<lb break="no"/>ciples of Responsible Government can only exist
                  satisfactorily with forty or lifity members in <lb/> the House. It would cost very
                  little short of $20,000 per annum. That, out of the very small <lb/> amount we are
                  to get from Canada, would reduce the amount likely to be available for public
                  <lb/> works to a fraction. You must have a large number to work Responsible
                  Government, or, <lb/> more properly speaking. party government. If we are to have
                  it, I would not have the heads <lb/> of departments responsible to the people; at
                  least not the working heads. If any head of a <lb/> department is to be
                  responsible to the people, let it be the political head; but I would make <lb/>
                  the working heads permanent. I have found, from my experience of the old Vancouver
                  House <lb/> of Assembly, that policy frequently changes and turns round. The same
                  thing would happen <lb/> under Responsible Government. If I wished to oppose
                  Confederation, I believe that I could <lb/> not do a better thing towards
                  effecting my object than to vote for Responsible Government; <lb/> but I want to
                  see the more material wants advanced by Confederation. I know that material <lb/>
                  interests were not the pivot, but that is was place, patronage, and office that
                  .was wanted. <lb/> With regard to the present system of Government, it is very
                  easy to say that it is bad, but <lb/> I have listened to all the speeches and have
                  not heard one word of practical fault-finding with <lb/> the present
                  Government—merely the assumption that the people desire change. This desire <lb/>
                  for change they have been educated to. I acknowledge many faults in the past, but
                  we have <lb/> now a new Executive, and we are promised a change in the form of
                  Government; but this is <lb/> apart from Confederation altogether, lt appear to me
                  that the first thing we have to arrange <lb/> is the money question; to get our
                  material interests first settled; to make sure that this Colony <lb/> should be
                  pecuniarily better off; to make the question of Confederation now turn upon <lb/>
                  material interest, and not allow our material interests to be jeopardized by a cry
                  for Respon<lb break="no"/>sible Government; not to allow Responsible Government to
                  be the sauce to make the public <lb/> swallow bad and unprofitable terms. All
                  Members have acknowledged that "money" is the <lb/> basis of all Govermnents; let
                  us get that money. I would not have the public vote for <lb/> Responsible
                  Government and forget or put in the background the money. Place the question <lb/>
                  upon material terms and the Colony will demand profitable terms; but mix it up
                  with Respon<lb break="no"/>sible Government and you got a divided opinion upon it,
                  and those who think Responsible <lb/> Government everything will vote for that to
                  the exclusion of any terms, or, at all events, <lb/> with unprofitable terms.
                  There are. doubtless, many who hope to live upon Responsible Gov<lb break="no"
                  />ernment; but, Sir, Responsible Government is not food and raiment. The people
                  can live <lb/> without Responsible Government. but they cannot live upon it. Give
                  them food and raiment <lb/> first; the rest will follow in natural succession.
                  These few words will give you my reasons for <lb/> consenting to the arrangement
                  proposed in the conditions. More than this, I am not pledged to <lb/> Responsible
                  Government, but I am pledged to representative institutions. The latter have been
                  <lb/> granted; my mission thus far is fulfilled. I have always asserted that we
                  must take our steps <lb/> to Responsible Government gradually. Having
                  representative institutions, we can go on to the <lb/> other. No one ever stated
                  that the people were unfit to govern themselves; all acknowledge <lb/> that they
                  have talent enough. But this I do assert, that thus far the people have shown an
                  <lb/> unwillingness to govern themselves—have taken but little interest in the
                  matter. It is not <lb/> that they are unfit, but unwilling. They prefer looking
                  after their own business; it pays them <lb/>

                  <fw type="num">115</fw> better. I need not refer to the difficulty of getting
                  members; and doubtless some of us sit here <lb/> from that cause; and it is no
                  doubt true, as has been said, that better could have been found <lb/> ouside. If
                  you have Responsible Government it will fall into the hands of those who wish to
                  <lb/> make a living by it. No one has said that it would be economical—it would
                  not be so. It <lb/> would require at least thirty members to carry on party
                  Government for six weeks at least <lb/> every year, or $150 per diem for
                  thirty-six days. which would amount to $5,400; and then the <lb/> mileage would
                  come to as much more—say, altogether, $10,000. Add to these the salaries of <lb/>
                  the political heads, say five at $2,000 per annum, and then you have the nice
                  little sum of <lb/> $20,000 a year. Then, I suppose, each Minister would require a
                  pension when he went out. <lb/> The real Executive oflicers would remain then as
                  now, and would have to be paid nearly as <lb/> much as at present. The truth is,
                  there would be a great difficulty in getting members, and <lb/> without a large
                  body of members it could not be carried on. You would find that the best men <lb/>
                  would avoid politics, and soon there would be very great corruption. There is a
                  great deal of <lb/> talk about voting away the people's money, but it must be
                  borne in mind that a part of that <lb/> money, under Confederation, will come from
                  Canada, and she will have a right to see it <lb/> properly expended. There is also
                  a great deal of talk about Hon. Official Members voting their <lb/> own salaries,
                  but would not the same thing be done under Responsible Government? Have not <lb/>
                  Hon. Representative Members voted themselves salaries this present session? IIon.
                  Members <lb/> say that if Responsible Government is not granted we will agitate. I
                  thought that everybody <lb/> was so much in favour of it that the people would
                  rise if it were not included in the terms; <lb/> that there would be employment
                  for every gunsmith in Victoria; and yet we are told " we will <lb/> agitate."
                  <lb/>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:ROBS1">Hon. MR. ROBSON</persName>—I never said that; I said that the people
                  would agitate. <lb/>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:HELM1">Hon. DR. HELMCKEN</persName>—It is much the same thing; the agitators
                  will "beat the bush" <lb/> once more, and they will perhaps be driving the birds
                  for other people once again. If the people <lb/> really desire Responsible
                  Government, why is there any necessity for all this agitation? I admit <lb/> that
                  many of the people of Victoria desire it, and think that it can be carried out.
                  Ask the <lb/> scattered districts in the country, and they will tell you that they
                  do not know or care about <lb/> it. Political opinion does not run high in the
                  Colony. I intend to support the Government <lb/> upon this clause, but I leave
                  myself perfectly free to vote for Responsible Government if I <lb/> think proper.
                  I want to secure the material interests of the Colony. Let the people say <lb/>
                  whether those material interests will be benefited by Confederation, but not mix
                  up the <lb/> question of Responsible Government with it. I am perfectly willing to
                  abide by the decision <lb/> of the people on Responsible Government, and on
                  Confederation on Terms, separately. My <lb/> sole desire is to see this country
                  materially benefited. If the people want responsibility I will <lb/> not say nay,
                  but we must have good terms. At the polls Responsible Government might carry <lb/>
                  Confederation with very indifferent terms. I am perfectly certain that the
                  Government have <lb/> acted wisely in not allowing the terms to be clogged with
                  Responsible Government. 1 say, <lb/> don't let Responsible Government take the
                  place of material benefits. <lb/>

                  honourable and learned <lb/> Member for Victoria City said about being bound hand
                  and foot to Canada. In my remarks <lb/> he can find no efforts to catch votes, and

                  of the Government Members. <lb/> Let the House decide whether it will go on with
                  this question now or postpone it. It seems to <lb/> me that the Hon.
                  Attorney-General is resorting to a parliamentary manoeuvre in forcing this <lb/>
                  matter on. It is a matter that Representative Members only ought to vote on. We
                  shall have <lb/> a large majoriy of Representative Members on this question, and
                  that is all we want. I say <lb/> that the Attorney-General did not fairly answer

               </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:BARN1">Hon. Mr. BARNARD</persName>—lt was not my desire to
                  hamper the Government; I desired to give <lb/> a hearty support to the Government,
                  and, at the same time, to do my duty to my constituents. <lb/> I have never felt
                  the weight of responsibility as I feel it to-day. I feel that I am about casting
                  <lb/> a vote which will affect, for weal or woe. the destiny of. this fine
                  Province. I am convinced that <lb/> if a majority of the elected Members of this
                  Council vote " aye " to-day on this question, Respon<lb break="no"/>sible
                  Government will be inaugurated conjointly with Confederation. It is beyond a
                  question <lb/> that the intelligent portion of the community are in favour of
                  Responsible Government, but <lb/> there is a grave question in regard to its
                  adaptation to the Colony. The words coming from <lb/> His Excellency are worthy of
                  careful consideration; they contain strong reasons against the <lb/> introduction
                  of Responsible Government. Public opinion is not settled on the Island, The <lb/>
                  Hon. senior Member for Victoria City has shown in his remarks that there is a
                  great want <lb/> of settled principle in the Colony. The principal men of Victoria
                  are averse to taking upon <lb/> themselves the duties and labour of legislating
                  for the country. Men of standing and wealth <lb/> stand aloof. The merchants,
                  manufacturers, and professional men take no interest in the <lb/> matter of
                  legislalion. There is a great difficulty in getting good representative men. There
                  <lb/> are. I admit. many good reasons which might be urged against the measure,
                  and I have no <lb/> doubt that dissatisfaction, to some extent, may ensue. I agree
                  with the Commissioner of Lands <lb/> and Works, in his remarks about the press
                  influencing the public unfavorably to the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment; but the
                  blame is not in the press, but in that system of Government which keeps the <lb/>
                  rulers silent. The members of the Government ought to be in a position {to defend
                  themselves, <lb/> both by pen and speech. I have glanced at a few reasons against
                  the admission of Responsible <lb/> Government, but I will now look at the other
                  side. Look at the fact of all the larger subjects, <lb/> under Union; being dealt
                  with by the Federal power. This fact, of itself, is as strong an <lb/> argument as
                  we need. What Hon. Member can go to his constituents and tell them that he <lb/>
                  thinks the local business of this Colony could be managed better at Ottawa than it
                  can be by <lb/> ourselves? The Official Members of this Government will,no doubt,
                  avail themselves of the <lb/> retiring pension. and appointees from Ottawa will
                  take their places. Will those latter officials <lb/> have to be pensioned off by
                  this Colony when we adopt Responsible Government? This is a <lb/> strong objection
                  to entering the Union under a system like the present. This Colony may <lb/> be
                  asked to pension another set of officials. Will the people be satisfied with this
                  sort of <lb/> Government if we are to have appointees from Ottawa? There are a
                  class of men who oppose <lb/> <pb n="117"

                  It is often asserted that this <lb/> Colony is not ready. How long are we to wait?
                  Canada was told the same story when she <lb/> had a population of 600,000. All the
                  other Provinces were told the same thing. Must we wait <lb/> for such an increase,
                  or must we fight as did Canada? Throw us on our own resources as a <lb/> Colony,
                  and we will soon learn valuable lessons in the science of Government. There were
                  <lb/> gentlemen of good families and of good education who came here in early
                  days, who had never <lb/> suffered privations of any sort before they came here;
                  sent out to make fortunes, or, at all <lb/> events, homes for themselves; their
                  roughing it was rough indeed. Bad news had come from <lb/> the mines; the avenues
                  of trade were closed; there were no agricultural pursuits for them to <lb/> turn
                  to; the consequence was they had to lie round hotels; after failing to get
                  Government <lb/> employment,-for which, as a matter of course, they applied,—some
                  kept bars whilst waiting <lb/> for remittances. The reason was that they never had
                  been taught self-reliance. We shall be <lb/> in the same position if we are
                  constantly to have rulers from England, or Canada; but throw <lb/> us on our
                  resources and we shall succeed. Self-reliance is the best means of education in
                  <lb/> politics as in anything else. If our rulers are sent us from England or
                  Ottawa we will always <lb/> lack seltlreliance. Self-reliance is written on every
                  line of the British North America Act. <lb/> Rely upon yourselves, is the cry of
                  the people of England. It is better to grapple with the <lb/> difficulties now
                  when the issues are small and comparatively unimportant; and should we make <lb/>
                  blunders they will not be so serious when our interests are small; and for what
                  errors we do <lb/> commit, the consequences will fall upon ourselves. We will, no
                  doubt, blunder at first, and <lb/> there may be chaff blown here. If Responsible
                  Government will bring the scum to the top, <lb/> dross will go to the bottom. The
                  scum will be ladled off—the chart will be blown away by the <lb/> breath of public
                  opinion. The Governor's promise of a majority will not satisfy the people, <lb/>
                  and we should, therefore. urge upon His Excellency to give us Responsible
                  Government. I am <lb/> not in favour, however, of making that condition a <hi
                  rendition="simple:italic">sine qua non</hi> of Confederation. I would <lb/> accept
                  Confederation with good terms, even without Responsible Government. There may he
                  <lb/> a few arguments against it, but there are many in its favour. Under no
                  circumstances would <lb/> I like Confederation and Responsible Government to go to
                  the polls together. I hope the people <lb/> will sever the two. Let us have
                  Confederation and we shall get Responsible Government. <lb/> </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:WOOD2">Hon. MR. WOOD</persName>—In rising to address myself to the motion now
                  before this Committee, <lb/> I do so with a double object: I feel myself
                  challenged to uphold my opinion on the subject <lb/> of Responsible Government, as
                  applied to this Colony, and I am desirous to add a few words <lb/> on the bearing
                  of the subject, in the matter of Confederation, now before the Council. First,
                  <lb/> with respect to the subject of Responsible Government. As to this, Sir, my
                  views have been <lb/> for a long time settled, and I shall endeavour to express
                  them as clearly as I can. The result <lb/> of them is expressed in a few words. I
                  am in favour of the extension of representative institu<lb break="no"/>tions
                  little by little, to the utmost verge of safety; but I am opposed, in this
                  community at <lb/> least, to the establishment of what is called Responsible
                  Government. These are my views <lb/> shortly. I believe them to be the settled
                  convictions of most moderate and experienced men <lb/> not bound to flatter
                  popular constituencies. And I believe I am doing a service to society in <lb/>
                  upholding such moderate views against the popular error and the popular bias in
                  favour of the <lb/> rash application of Responsible Government in such
                  communities. I will start, Sir, at once <lb/> from an historical point of view.
                  The Hon. Member for New Westminster has, as I under<lb break="no"/>stand him,
                  asserted that Responsible Government is the immemorial birthright ot' Englishmen,
                  <lb/> and that the principle of Cabinet Ministers going in and out with votes of a
                  majority of the <lb/> House of Commons is a principle of ancient date. My
                  understanding of the history of my <lb/> country leads to a different conclusion;
                  and however much it may be clear and obvious that <lb/> representative
                  institutions are our natural and inalienable birthright; however much it may <lb/>
                  he established that the power of self-taxation resides and has always resided in
                  the represent<lb break="no"/>atives of the country, in the Commons of England,
                  carrying with it the overwhelming power <lb/> of the purse—it is, I believe,
                  clearly admitted that the principle of Responsible Government, <lb/> as now
                  understood, has existed for little more than 100 years, —say from the accession of
                  <lb/> George III. and the termination of Lord Bute's administration,— so that I
                  admit the Hon. <lb/> gentleman's proposition only so far as this. Representative
                  institutions are the birthright of <lb/> the British nations—representative
                  institutions and the privilege of taxing ourselves. Now, <lb/> Sir, I believe the
                  whole scope of representative institutions to be greatly misrepresented. It <lb/>

                  <fw type="num">118</fw>
                  <fw type="running">CONFEDERATION DEBATE.</fw> is the fashion for Honourable
                  Members to say that the Government of this or any other com<lb break="no"/>munity
                  are bound to govern according to the well understood wishes of the people; that
                  the <lb/>
                  <hi rendition="simple:italic">vox populi</hi> is the <hi rendition="simple:italic"
                     >vox dei</hi>; that Ministries and Governments are responsible to the people.
                  But: <lb/> the true principle, as we all very well know, is that Governments and
                  Ministries are responsible, <lb/> not to the people as a populace, but to the
                  representatives of the people, properly and reasonably <lb/> chosen. Governments
                  and Ministries are responsible, not to numerical majorities, but to the <lb/>
                  country. Now, Sir, representative institutions are liable to this obvious and
                  well-known <lb/> danger. I will quote the words of a well-known political writer,
                  Herbert Spencer: "When<lb break="no"/>ever the profit accruing to the
                  representative individually, from the passage of a mischievous <lb/> measure,
                  largely exceeds his loss as a unit in the community from the operation of the
                  injurious <lb/> law, his interest becomes antagonistic to that of his
                  constituents, and sooner or later will sway <lb/> his vote." How true and bow
                  obvious this is. I might go further, when the private and <lb/> personal, the
                  direct and immediate, interest of the representative or of the constituents, whose
                  <lb/> advocates and delegates they are, is opposed to any matter of legislative
                  action, the direct <lb/> and material interest will, of a certainty, prevail over
                  the distant and more remote welfare <lb/> of the, community, in all but very rare
                  instances. This is the danger that threatens all <lb/> representative
                  institutions, and the only safeguard against it is the qualification—the pecuniary
                  <lb/> and material qualification of the representative, the pecuniary and material
                  qualification of <lb/> the elector; and, accordingly, we see representative
                  institutions flourishing and successful <lb/> only when this safeguard practically
                  exists. Let us turn to the example of England. In <lb/> England representative
                  institutions and Responsible Government work smoothly—and why? <lb/> Because of
                  the notoriously aristocratic and plutocratic character of the Legislature of Great
                  <lb/> Britain. Political life is a sealed book to any but the wealthy classes.
                  Every member of <lb/> Parliament is a man of property; no other can afford the
                  luxury of legislative life; and <lb/> society is secure in the hands of
                  representatives whose property would suffer from the results <lb/> of vicious or
                  reckless legislation. I say nothing of the question of peace and war, probably
                  <lb/> the most momentous and disastrous subject of vicious and reckless
                  legislation, a question <lb/> which will not arise in the Colony. The cream of all
                  legislation is taxation, and my solid <lb/> conviction is that representative
                  institutions and Responsible Government will fail whenever <lb/> the working
                  majority is in the hands of an unsubstantial class of representatives or of
                  electors. <lb/> I have thus, Sir, treated or representative institutions and
                  Responsible Government somewhat <lb/> in the abstract. I will now refer more
                  particularly to its application to this Colony, and this <lb/> apart from any
                  question of Confederation;, and I will repeat that I am in favour of the exten<lb
                     break="no"/>sion to'the utmost possible limits of the representative elements
                  of this Council, but adverse <lb/> to Responsible Government. With respect to the
                  constitution of the Legislative Council of <lb/> British Columbia, it might, I
                  think, hardly be necessary, in the present condition of the <lb/> Colony, to
                  advocate a second chamber—a council as distinct from an Assembly. However <lb/>
                  advisable this may be in an advanced condition of the Colony, advanced in numbers
                  and <lb/> wealth, few, if any, would advocate such an institution as a second
                  chamber. The elements <lb/> for forming such a chamber are sadly wanting in the
                  present state of affairs, and the matter <lb/> may be dismissed without further
                  comment—without discussing the advisability in a general <lb/> way of such an
                  institution at all, or the constitutional elements of such a body. But with <lb/>
                  regard to the Legislature on the supposition of its consisting of one single
                  House, it will be <lb/> necessary to speak at somewhat greater length. Of what
                  elements ought such a legislative <lb/> body to consist? At present it consists of
                  official members, heads of departments; official <lb/> members not heads of
                  departments, but representing. for the most part, different magisterial <lb/>
                  districts; a few nominated members—nominated. I think it is reasonable to presume,
                  from an <lb/> impression of their being tolerably intelligent and moderate; and a
                  few representative mem<lb break="no"/>bers. It is asked whether the constitution
                  of this Council should be altered so as to establish <lb/> direct Responsible
                  Government, or what may be looked upon almost as its equivalent, a large <lb/>
                  working majority of responsible members. I leave out of the question at present
                  all reference <lb/> to any modification of the constitution of the Council in the
                  event of Confederation, and I <lb/> consider the matter at present only in
                  reference to the Council and the Colony in their actual <lb/> condition. At
                  present it is obvious. and must be felt by all of us, by official members no less
                  <lb/> than by independent members, that our po on as a Crown Colony is what is
                  commonly <lb/> called a <hi rendition="simple:italic">false position</hi>. We are
                  individually as well fitted for self-government as our brothers <lb/>or our
                  cousins in the Old Country or in Canada. I will go further: I will say that the
                  <lb/>community, taken individually, in this Colony is <hi
                     rendition="simple:italic">better</hi> qualified to demand and have repre<lb

                  <fw type="num">119</fw>sentative institutions. I say taken <hi
                     rendition="simple:italic">individually</hi>—and I mean it in its strict sense.
                  Man for <lb/> man, I believe the Colonist a better politician than his English
                  cousin. The aristocratic class <lb/> hardly exists, it is true. It is an injustice
                  to presume for a moment that the Colonist in this, <lb/> or any other Colony of
                  Anglo- Saxon origin. is in any way unfit for the enjoyment of the freest <lb/>
                  political liberty. Higher class we have none, but the middle and lower classes
                  are—I do not <lb/> hesitate to say it—superior to the middle and lower classes at
                  home. The Colonist is more <lb/> enterprising and more pushing than the
                  stay-at-home Englishman. He has better knowledge <lb/> of the world and of human
                  nature; he graduates in a school in which politics are prominent, <lb/> and he is
                  free from an immense amount of ignorance and prejudice which is thought and <lb/>
                  written and acted in the Old World. But then comes the consideration, what
                  elements are <lb/> indispensable in the community to form the representative body,
                  if, as is contended, that <lb/> element is to be supreme; or, what is the same
                  thing in point of actual power, when that <lb/> element constitutes the working
                  majority? I will answer: (1) Localized and permanent <lb/> population. (2)
                  Established diversified interests; wealth, whether capital or regular income,
                  <lb/> the well—doing of professions, businesses and industries, agriculture,
                  substantial industries, <lb/> staples. Population herein we are deficient—6,500
                  adult white men-sporadic, scattered, and <lb/> temporary. How many care to vote?
                  How many are aliens? Established interests here also <lb/> are deficient;
                  isolation our drawback; staples we have, but they are undeveloped or unlucky;
                  <lb/> gold mining depressed; agriculture under a disadvantage, and no good market;
                  coal not much <lb/> sought after, and minerals a speculation; lumber unfortunate;
                  fisheries unestablished, and <lb/> commerce in the way of export killed by the
                  abolition of the free port, or inferior from the <lb/> absence of a large home
                  demand. These are all our material elements of wealth, and we have <lb/> them in
                  no great abundance. Now, without them, what have we? A sparse community, in <lb/>
                  which the only thriving interest is agriculture, and that only because supply is
                  not equal to <lb/> demand; or, in other words. small in numbers and importance,
                  and no wealthy class at all. <lb/> Can self-government be trusted to such a
                  population? I say emphatically no! Now, I am <lb/> not greatly in favour of a high
                  qualification for representatives—for Members of the Council. <lb/> It is
                  sufficient for me that they represent substantial interests; but when we have
                     unsubstan<lb break="no"/>tial representatives representing unsubstantial and
                  small constituencies, I can hardly under<lb break="no"/>stand anything more
                  dangerous, and, I might add, more ridiculous or more extravagant. That <lb/>
                  representatives should be substantial people is desirable, but that they should
                  represent sub<lb break="no"/>stantial interests is indispensable. if
                  representatives are unfaithful to their trust the remedy <lb/> is possible; but
                  where the class of electors is needy and unsubstantial, it seems impossible to
                  <lb/> conceive anything more disastrous. Taxation, as before has been observed, is
                  the cream of <lb/> legislation; and taxation at the hands of unsubstantial men, or
                  men forced to advocate the <lb/> interests of unsubstantial constituencies, will
                  be nothing but tyranny. Opinions may be divided <lb/> in many other matters; the
                  votes of a party may be split on many points; but in the hands <lb/> of the masses
                  the substantial class will be heavily and unmeasurably taxed to suit the views
                  <lb/> of those who have nothing to lose and all to gain by any contemplated
                  movement. Take the <lb/> example of Vancouver Island in old days as an example of
                  a small and a narrow community; <lb/> again, the example of Victoria, in
                  Australia, where legislation is effected by the enormous <lb/> majority of the
                  advocates of the interests of constituents elected on a low qualification,- <lb/>
                  manhood suffrage. I cannot but understand that if the Government is in the hands
                  of the <lb/> representatives of the people. and a working majority of them.
                  supreme representative Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, if not equivalent to, is, in
                  effect, equal to Responsible Government. In the hands of <lb/> the representatives
                  of the people, supplies would all be voted, except conditions were exacted, <lb/>
                  favourable to the popular will. And, Sir, having treated on representative and
                  Responsible <lb/> Governments as applied to this Colony, let us see its bearing on
                  the subject of Confederation; <lb/> and here I follow in the footsteps of the Hon.
                  Member for New Westminster; his reasoning <lb/> is mine, but not his conclusions.
                  Without Responsible Government, or its equivalent, or its <lb/> approximate
                  Government by a representative majority, we have no safeguard against a Govern<lb
                     break="no"/>ment of Canadian officials. British Columbia will be a Colony of
                  Canada, a dependency of <lb/> a dependency, and Canadian interests will prevail.
                  Dependence on England is bearable; they <lb/> have no interests apart from ours;
                  but dependence on Canada would be unbearable; their <lb/> interests are different
                  from ours. That is the conclusion that is inevitable; it is but a logical <lb/>
                  conclusion. Confederation without Responsible Government, or Government by a
                  working <lb/> majority of representative members, is out of the question. Such a
                  Government cannot be <lb/>

                  <fw type="num">120</fw>
                  <fw type="running">CONFEDERATION DEBATE.</fw> had; therefore Confederation is out
                  of the question. I have thus, Sir, given my opinion on <lb/> a point which is sure
                  to meet with popular disfavour, but I am proud to support the Executive <lb/> when
                  I think it is right; and I would share the responsibility of a measure which would
                  make <lb/> that Executive obnoxious to blame. I have no chronic feeling of
                  opposition to Government. <lb/> I have no objection to individuals, nor do I
                  impute to them sordid motives, but in the matter <lb/> of Confederation the
                  Executive of this Colony are in a false position; they act primarily, <lb/>not for
                  the good of the Colony, but for the good, or supposed good, of Great Britain; and
                  <lb/>they exercise the power of Government in a matter in which the interests of
                  the Colony <lb/>are mainly at stake to carry out, and effect an organic change of
                  great importance to local <lb/>interests. It is somewhat unfair to me to say I
                  impute motives to the Executive. 1 only <lb/>quarrel with them when they place
                  themselves in a false position, as in the question of <lb/>education; and in this,
                  as in education, I say they oppose their own views to the views of, <lb/>the,well
                  understood wishes of all classes of the community; and here the carry through a
                  <lb/>scheme of Confederation; they start the stone, and it is hard to see how or
                  where it will roll. <lb/>I sincerely feel for their position. The Colony will
                  demand representative institutions, and they <lb/>will be forced to yield them or
                  back out of the position they have undertaken. The answer of <lb/>the Executive
                  Government to this is as given by the Hon. Attorney-General. The Attorney- <lb
                     break="yes"/>General says that after Confederation we are bound to have what we
                  require—Responsible <lb/>Government. This is taking the matter for granted. It may
                  be attained, but with a struggle. <lb/>It is impossible to doubt that the
                  Executive of the new Province will oppose representative <lb/>Government or any
                  diminution of their own rights or their own power. He says it is inoppor<lb
                     break="no"/>tune and beside the question. The Hon. Member for Cariboo (Dr.
                  Carrall) says: "If the <lb/>people of British Columbia want Responsible Government
                  no power on earth can prevent their <lb/>having it." This is but a promise for the
                  future. The Hon. Chief Commissioner says the <lb/>community is not fit for
                  Responsible Government, but the matter is to be left to the new <lb/>Council.
                  Responsible Government will assuredly come with Confederation. The Hon. Member
                  <lb/>for Victoria (Dr. Helmcken) says: "This is the argument of the Government.
                  But something <lb/>must counterbalance Canada, otherwise with a working majority
                  in the House the Dominion <lb/>Government will keep things as they are when we are
                  a Province of Canada." <lb/>

           <!-- <p>
     TUESDAY, MARCH 22ND, 1870. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. MR. HOLBROOK—Mr. Chairman, I rise with some diffidence to give my opinion 
     <lb/>
     as to whether we are fitted for Responsible Government or not, after the able speeches that 
     <lb/>
     have been delivered by Hon. Members on the subject. The Hon. and learned Member for 
     <lb/>
     Victoria City (Mr. Drake) has affirmed that Responsible Government would give the real 
     <lb/>
     government of the Colony to Victoria. This I believe is true, and if such were the case what 
     <lb/>
     injury it would inflict on New Westminster and the Mainland generally. I feel that we are 
     <lb/>
     not yet fit for Responsible Government; but nevertheless, I think that the extent of the popu<lb break="no"/>lation is very much under-estimated. It has been stated that after the most careful calculation 
     <lb/>
     that can be made the white population cannot be calculated at over 5,000 adults; but I think 
     <lb/>
     this is wrong, and no doubt it has been taken from the Government Accounts, which do not 
     <lb/>
     include Kootenay, Big Bend, or the settlements around New Westminster; and I would make 
     <lb/>
     the adult white population to be 10,000, besides 40,000 Indians; and these Indians ought not 
     <lb/>
     to be ignored. If they are not represented will it not be difficult to make them contented with 
     <lb/>
     the change from the Imperial Government to Canada? And it is for this reason that I have 
     <lb/>
     given a notice of motion in this House to show them that they are not forgotten, and that they 
     <lb/>
     may go on with their settlements and improvements in safety. But if we are to have Respon<lb break="no"/>sible Government I will not be answerable for the consequences. We are told the question is 
     <lb/>
     to be submitted to the people. I say let us wait for their decision. I have confidence in 
     <lb/>
     Canada, and am content to take my chance of being well governed by the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, rather than try something of the working of which we know nothing. I have no doubt 
     <lb/>
     that great agitation on the subject of Responsible Government will be got up by the press, and 
     <lb/>
     that many members will gain their elections by confusing the questions of Confederation and 
     <lb/>
