               The Hon. Mr. WOOD said :—Sir, I rise to support the amendment of the Honourable Junior 
               <br />
               Member for Victoria, to postpone the consideration of these Resolutions for six months. I desire, 
               <br />
               Sir, to express my unqualified opposition to what is termed the Confederation of this Colony 
               <br />
               with the Dominion of Canada on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> basis of the Organic Act; and in dealing with the subject 
               <br />
               I shall address myself to three several heads <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> objection: 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Firstly, to the principle of the Organic Act of 1867, as applied to the British North American 
               <br />
               Provinces; 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Secondly, to the special application of the principle to this Colony; 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Thirdly, to the mode in which the consent of its adoption is now attempted to be obtained.

            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Referring for a moment to my own personal position in this Council, I should wish to say 
               <br />
               that I feel bound as a non―representative and non―official member to present my own views. 
               <br />
               My mouth is not closed by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">official</span> reticence, nor do I represent any constituency. I am here, 
               <br />
               bound by my duty as a Member of this Council, to express my own conscientious views in 
               <br />
               respect of the measure in explicit terms, in the interests no less of this Colony than of Great 
               <br />
               Britain, which in this, as in every Colonial question, I cannot but hold to be identical. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               With respect to the general principle of Confederation of the British North American 
               <br />
               Provinces, it will be remembered that, in 1867, I was one of those Members who did vote 
               <br />
               that Confederation, on fair and equitable terms, was desirable I am of that opinion still; 
               <br />
               but my objection is that no terms based on the Organic Act of 1867 can be fair or equitable. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               It cannot be denied that the idea of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confederation</span> and general alliance between the 
               <br />
               British Colonies in North America is a very captivating idea. The existence of a homogeneous 
               <br />
               nation tending to act as a counterpoise to the great Republic to the south of us, is a grand<br />
               political idea, but it is an idea most dangerous and difﬁcult to carry out. When I voted in 
               <br />
               1867 for Confederation on fair and equitable terms, I had in my mind Confederation in the 
               <br />
               general acceptance of the word as understood by all political writers and by the world in 
               <br />
               general— a union of free and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self-governed</span> States, united by a federal compact for purposes 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of offence</span> and defence, of peace and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">war,</span> and for the purposes of maintaining and preserving 
               <br />
               uniformity in laws and institutions which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affect</span> the social and commercial relation of life; 
               <br />
               such laws <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">institutions</span> as criminal law and practice, the general administration of justice, 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> laws regulating commerce and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">navigation.</span> Such a Confederation I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">then</span> believed to be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possible,</span> I am foolish <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enough</span> to believe it to be possible still; but Confederation as understood 
               <br />
               by Canadian and Imperial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">statesmen—Confederation</span> as effected by the Organic Act of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1867—</span> 
               <br />
               is not Confederation at all. I would, indeed, throw the word Confederation to the winds, since 
               <br />
               by Confederation is obviously meant union, incorporation, and absorption. The Organic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1867,</span> provides for the entire transfer of all effective <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislative</span> power and control to Ottawa, 
               <br />
               as the seat of the Dominion Government, where, owing to the much greater wealth and population 
               <br />
               of Canada, the influence and authority of Canada bear all before it. It is a principle too obvious 
               <br />
               for proof or dissertation, that Confederation in its proper sense can only thrive where the States 
               <br />
               bound together by the federal compact are not only free, but where they are nearly equal. 
               <br />
               Excess of power in any one State is fatal to the interests of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rest.</span> No, Sir, the word Con— 
               <br />
               federation has no application to the intended <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">movement</span>. Lord Granville. in his despatch, no 
               <br />
               longer calls it by such a term. Union and Incorporation are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">spoken</span> of, not Confederation, and 
               <br />
               the movement really is one of incorporation, absorption, and annihilation.
