               next, I believe in external trade. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Allow</span> these terms as brought down by the Government to 
               <br />
               pass, and in a few years you will reduce Victoria to the position of a mere smuggling village. 
               <br />
               Protection is a necessity. So long as there are nations and national interests, so long will it be 
               <br />
               necessary to have laws to protect those interests. Allow me, Sir, on this point to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span> that there 
               <br />
               is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revolution</span> in the value of realty, capital, and labour commencing on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Paciﬁc</span> Coast. 
               <br />
               The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">equalization</span> of the value of realty, capital, and labour has commenced. The whole tendency 
               <br />
               of events in the countries to the south of us is to equalize the value of labour, of real estate, of 
               <br />
               capital, of manufactures, and of produce on this coast with their value on the Atlantic side. 
               <br />
               No such revolution in values has over occurred on the Pacific Coast, except that produced by 
               <br />
               the discovery of gold, as has been produced since the opening of the Pacific Railroad. Take off 
               <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">protection,</span> then, from our farmers, and they are reduced to the condition of agriculturists to the 
               <br />
               south of us, who will be reduced to the condition of those in the east. No doubt the prices of 
               <br />
               our farmers will be reduced by the revolution that is going on; but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> them protection against 
               <br />
               foreign competition, and there will still be inducement for them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> remain. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Honourable</span> <br />
Chief <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Commissioner</span> referred to this in a very proper spirit; and the Honourable Member for 
               <br />
               New Westminster <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">says</span> that it is one of the most important questions. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> hope, therefore, that 
               <br />
               the subject will have due weight with them. 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               The Government of Canada, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">acco</span>rding to the proposed terms, would give us a surplus revenue 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$200,000.</span> [Dr. Helmcken—“ No."] The Honourable Member says no. He may be right. But 
               <br />
               upon the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">calculation</span> that we shall have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$200,000</span> surplus revenue, I say that this subsidy will be 
               <br />
               equivalent to four hundred <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">farmers</span> who earn in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colony</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$500</span> each, annually. By taking 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">off</span> protection from our farmers. to get the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$200,000,</span> we would injure the country instead of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">benefiting</span> it. But get the surplus of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$200,000,</span> and at the same time protection for our farmers, 
               <br />
               and we will do a prosperous business under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation.</span> This is what we have to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arrange,</span> 
               <br />
               what we have to get into the terms, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[Dr.</span> Helmckn―"<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">All</span> right! I will help <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">you”]</span> I would 
               <br />
               say that “ extremes meet,” for I now meet in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Honourable</span> friend (I mean political enemy) [“ No, 
               <br />
               no,”] to secure <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">protection.</span> I do not see, with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Honourable</span> Member for Victoria City, that we 
               <br />
               can get all we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">want</span> without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> a judicious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arrangement</span> of tour own tariff. I can 
               <br />
               show that what we want most in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colony</span> population, and that population employed in a 
               <br />
               remunerative manner. Isolation will not secure population. Confederation on proper terms will 
               <br />
               give us <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population;</span> will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> us means to employ labour remuneratively; will enlarge our com- 
               <br />
               merce, and build up our industry. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">If it</span> give us public works,—if it give us a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">railroad</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> a 
               <br />
               point on the Fraser, below Yale, to Savona’s Ferry on Lake Kamloops,—and if we connect Lake 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Okanagan</span> with the Spel-mah-cheen River, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> railway, which is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">only</span> about thirteen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">miles—not</span> 
               <br />
               only will the whole country from Osoyoos Lake<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> on the boundary, behind the Cascades, be 
               <br />
               opened up and connected with our chief commercial city, with a cheap and speedy means of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">transportation,</span> but all this tract of country traversed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> the railways and lake communication 
               <br />
               will be utilized in producing wheat <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wool,</span> and other articles for exportation. Victoria, then, 
               <br />
               will be built up, and will be the chief <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commercial</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">city</span> of British Columbia, with all other parts 
               <br />
               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colony</span> tribute to her. This <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> what Confederation on proper terms will do for us. The 
               <br />
               Honourable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Member</span> tor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Victoria</span> said that no lasting union could be maintained, unless the 
               <br />
               interests of British Columbia are preserved, if I look (for argument sake) at these things from 
               <br />
               a Canadian point of view, I find <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> by serving<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interests</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Brilish</span> Columbia, the interests 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Canada will be served. Canada, as well as British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Columbia,</span> will beneﬁt by a protective duty 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">here.</span> Canada will get the revenue under protection, and British Columbia will have its industry 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">protected</span> from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">foreign</span> competition. And there is no reason that we should not have our 
               <br />
               interests <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">protected,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[Dr.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Helmcken—“The</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Organic</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">says</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">no.”l</span> The Organic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">says</span> no

               such thing. Confederation is diversity in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unity:</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">really</span> and ess<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">entially</span> a general unity, and an

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act,</span> gets a temporary subsidy of $<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">63,000</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">per</span> anuum. None <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the other Provinces receive any 
               <br />
               temporary subsidy under that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> Brunswick is allowed to collect <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">export</span> dues on lumber. 
               <br />
               All the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">other</span> Provinces are prohibited from levying dues on lumber. Now, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">if</span> New Brunswick 
               <br />
               gets an additional subsidy, and levies a lumber tax prohibited to the other Provinces, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">why</span> cannot
