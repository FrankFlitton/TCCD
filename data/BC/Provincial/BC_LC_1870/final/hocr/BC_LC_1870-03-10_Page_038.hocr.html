               The Honourable and learned Member for Victoria City has referred to the possibility of 
               <br />
               a Fenian invasion, and said what will become of the Railway in such an event. I believe, Sir, 
               <br />
               on such an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extraordinary</span> occasion, such as invasion, each one in the Colony would be patriotic 
               <br />
               enough to do without a few miles of Railway, until the invasion may be put down. 
               <br />

               It has been asked what is the gain under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation.</span> 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               At present we have no surplus revenue. But with Confederation on equitable terms, there<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"></span> 
               <br />
               will be a clear gain of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$384,000</span> annually from subsidies and reduction of tariff; therefore, as 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$3</span>84,000 is to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nothing,</span> so is Confederation to Isolation. There are a great many points to 
               <br />
               which I could allude were I disposed to trespass longer on the time of the Council; but I reserve 
               <br />
               them until we go into Committee. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               There are, however, some few things to which I will passingly allude. It is important to 
               <br />
               British Columbia to know what will be the qualification of Members to the Dominion Parliament 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[Hear,</span> hear, from Dr Helmcken] and the qualiﬁcation of electors. And with reference to 
               <br />
               the Local Constitution, it may be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessary</span> for us to know whether our Governors cannot be 
               <br />
               elected as in the United States. instead of being appointed on the English principle; and 
               <br />
               whether we may not acquire the right to pass local laws over the veto of the Governor, by a 
               <br />
               two-third vote of the Legislature. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> usury laws, imprisonment for debt, and many other 
               <br />
               matters will require careful consideration and attention. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               With respect to the main principle, I am in favour of Confederation, provided the ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               terms are right in amount, and if the other terms will contribute to the advancement and 
               <br />
               protection of our industry. If we cannot get favourable terms, which I believe we can, it will 
               <br />
               then be for the people of this country to say whether we shall remain in isolation or seek <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some</span><br />
               other more favourable union.

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perseverance</span> and confess that on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">many</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subjects</span> he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enlightens</span> Members on both sides of the

               I lament to ﬁnd that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">having</span> alluded to the opening speech of the Attorney-General, he 
               <br />
               thought ﬁt to cast unwarrantable imputations upon that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> and the members of the

               Government. He suddenly turned aside and quoted a text, which he applied to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ofﬁcial</span> 
               <br />
               Members of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Council,</span> He likened one of them to a woman who forgets her modesty and 
               <br />
               shame and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">goes</span> after lovers for broad; to her who has a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">harlot’s</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forehead,</span> and refuses to 
               <br />
               be ashamed. Sir, I deprecate such allusions; they throw no light upon the subject. I think 
               <br />
               that an Honourable and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grave</span> body like this, on hearing such charges, should have at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">once</span> 
               <br />
               risen to express their indignation rather than have condoned it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> their silence. Nothing is 
               <br />
               more easy than to take any one act of a man, or of a body of men, and apply it to a sinister 
               <br />
               motive, when it is capable of an honourable one, Sir. I was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">very</span> glad that the Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Attorney.</span>
