<!-- GL, 2017-03-15, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

           <!-- <p>
     should be stopped till the Governor can send down a scheme for Responsible Government. If 
     <lb/>
     we do not get Confederation we shall still have our own Representative Institutions. and once 
     <lb/>
     possessed of Representative Institutions under the Imperial Statute of Victoria, the Colony 
     <lb/>
     will, if it be such a unit as described, be able at once to get Responsible or Party Government. 
     <lb/>
     Now, I earnestly deprecate, on the part of the Government, the unfair allegation which one 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Member has so improperly insinuated that the Government or Government Officials con<lb break="no"/>sidered the people  of British Columbia unfit for self-government. Why, Sir, neither the Gover<lb break="no"/>nor nor any member of the Government, or any other official, ever said or thought that the 
     <lb/>
     people of this Colony were individually or collectively unfit for Responsible Government. The 
     <lb/>
     utmost that has ever been said on this side of the House has been that, under the present cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances of the Colony, it would be unwise, excessively costlyâ€”nay impracticable. As I 
     <lb/>
     have said before, and again repeat, the Governor has no power of himself to alter the Consti<lb break="no"/>tution. He can only refer it where it has already gone, to the decision of the Queen in 
     <lb/>
     Council, which we ought in common justice to await before bringing forward any Resolution 
     <lb/>
     for Responsible Government. Now, how would the country, if a unit on this point, get 
     <lb/>
     Responsible Government after Confederation? After Confederation the people can have 
     <lb/>
     Responsible Government, if they desire it, under clause 92 of the "British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act, 1867," by which power is given for the Provinces to change their own Constitution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Hon. Member for Victoria City (Dr. Helmcken) has alluded to the Hon. Member for 
     <lb/>
     Victoria District having prepared a scheme for Confederation, now on the Journals of this 
     <lb/>
     House, which did not contain any reference to Responsible Government, or the Overland 
     <lb/>
     Railway, possibly in view of this very section 92 of the Organic Act. The Hon. Member for 
     <lb/>
     Victoria District may have considered that Confederation would, as a natural consequence 
     <lb/>
     after Union, bring Responsible Government. 1f so, I trust he will vote with us now [Hear, 
     <lb/>
     hear, hear], and leave a matter of such importance to be settled, not by a House constituted 
     <lb/>
     as this is, but by a House containing a majority of Representative Members elected by the 
     <lb/>
     country, after the question of party Government has been specially submitted to the polls. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I ask the House to deal with this subject on its merits, apart from all side issues, such as 
     <lb/>
     the special form of the Government which is to subsist at the time of Union, which is really 
     <lb/>
     not now before us. I ask them to place a generous trust in Canada. I acknowledge the 
     <lb/>
     encouraging manner in which the Council has dealt with this question, and sincerely trust that 
     <lb/>
     all parties and sections in the House, setting aside all prejudices and sectional issues, will 
     <lb/>
     unite cordially, frankly, and unanimously in giving a generous support to the Government, 
     <lb/>
     and thus strengthen their hands for the country's good in all future negotiations. [Hear, hear, 
     <lb/>
     heal.] 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The Hon. Mr. Drake, junior Member for Victoria. asked permission to withdraw his 
     <lb/>
     amendment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Leave having been granted, the amendment was withdrawn. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The motion of the Hon. Attorney-General to go into Committee was then put, and carried 
     <lb/>
     unanimously. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The House then went into Committee of the Whole on the Confederation Resolutions, and 
     <lb/>
     immediately rose, reported progress, and asked leave to sit again. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Leave was granted to sit again on Monday, at one o'clock.

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:CREA1">The Hon. the ATTORNEY-GENERAL</persName> said:â€”Sir, I rise to propose
                  the adoption of the <lb/> Resolution as sent down to the House. having as its
                  object the Confederation of this Colony <lb/> with the Dominion of Canada. I
                  desire to consult the wish of the Council as to the particular <lb/> mode in which
                  the terms should be discussed. whether as a whole or in detail, paragraph by <lb/>
                  paragraph. But before doing so I think it right, Sir, to make a few brief remarks
                  on the <lb/> Resolution as a whole. The conditions have been prepared with great
                  care, and after the <lb/> exercise of deep thought and mature deliberation on the
                  part of His Excellency the Governor <lb/> and the Executive Council. The subject
                  is one of so large a nature, and of such paramount <lb/> importance, so many
                  interests both here and in Canada are at stake, and the issues involved <lb/> are
                  so extensive. that I sincerely hope that all Hon. Members will bring to its
                  discussion an <lb/> earnest desire to combine their individual efforts to work out
                  a successful result, and to throw <lb/> aside, for such an occasion, all former
                  prejudices and distrust; and as we have unanimously <lb/> affirmed the principle,
                  the House is committed to Confederation in the abstract [" No, no," from <lb/>
                  <persName ref="pers:HELM1">Hons. Helmcken</persName>, <persName ref="pers:WOOD2">Wood</persName> and <persName ref="pers:DRAK1">Drake</persName>]. Well, I think so, and the House will think so
                  too. It <lb/> has so voted. However that may be, I hope that we can all now act
                  harmoniously together, <lb/> and see whether we cannot now turn out such a scheme
                  as will work well in practice; he <lb/> just and equitable to Canada, who will
                  certainly be just and equitable to us, and yet be so <lb/> favourable to this
                  Colony as to insure the terms ratification when submitted to the popular <lb/>
                  vote All Hon. Members, whatever their opinions, desire the same thing, namely, to
                  get the <lb/> best terms practicable for the country ; and the proposition now
                  sent down, which is based <lb/> upon the "British North America Act, 1867,"
                  contains, I submit, the best terms that can be <lb/> devised, and will give the
                  Local Government as large an annual balance of cash for local <lb/> purposes as we
                  can venture to ask. There is one danger against which I think it my duty <lb/> to
                  warn Hon. Members, and I do particularly caution those who favour the idea of
                     Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion against attempting to weigh the conditions by
                  additional suggestions and recommendations <lb/> so as to overload them, and
                  against suggesting alterations in the terms which could not be <lb/> granted by
                  Canada, I believe we are all equally anxious to gain good terms, and we should
                  <lb/> be careful not to take away from the interest of the proposition before us
                  by suggesting any <lb/> other conditions that are not of material importance. I
                  have observed a report in a newspaper <lb/> of the previous proceedings of the
                  Council. if I may be allowed to notice it without producing <lb/> the paper, in
                  which an Hon. Member is stated to have said, that any amendments of the <lb/>
                  Resolution would be accepted. I think it right to say, on behalf of the
                  Government, that, <lb/> while the Government cannot consent to imperil the unity
                  of their scheme by amendments, <lb/> they will still be happy to receive, and
                  fully consider, all suggestions of a practical and <lb/> reasonable character :
                  and I invite Hon. Members to bring forward such suggestions, particu<lb break="no"
                  />larly such as will be calculated to remove any of the disadvantages of the
                  scheme, and so to <lb/> improve its working and insure its more general
                  acceptance. As the majority of the Council <lb/> seem to be in favour of dividing
                  the Resolution into parts, and discussing it paragraph by <lb/> paragraph. I will
                  follow the suggestion. I therefore, now propose the adoption of the first <lb/>
                  paragraph :â€” <lb/>
               </p>

     quote from the Returns sent down this day by the Governor, which give the full details of 
     <lb/>
     these liabilities. showing that our funded debt on the 10th of March instant, consisted of the 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia and Vancouver Island Loans secured by Act, amounting in all to $1,194,000 Â  
     <lb/>
     against which $346,820 Â  has been paid and invested as a Sinking Fund in reduction of Loans, 
     <lb/>
     leaving a balance of $817,180 still to be invested. and floating debt of all kinds of $319,000, 
     <lb/>
     including over $40,000 Savings Bank deposits. This floating debt it is in contemplation to 
     <lb/>
     consolidate by a Statutory Loan, at a lower rate of interest, and to procure the money from 
     <lb/>
     Canada, which, as Hon. Members are aware, is now rich, or elsewhere. For this purpose the 
     <lb/>
     Governor proposes to submit an Ordinance for the approval of this House, conferring the 
     <lb/>
     necessary powers. Owing to the mode in which the Sinking Fund is invested, there is reason 
     <lb/>to believe that it will be paid off at least a your before the time stated. Regarded as a whole,
<lb/>our public debt is by no means extravagant, as compared with that of other countries; but in<lb/>
               our isolated position as a young self-dependent Colony it is felt as it very heavy burden; of<lb/>

     this burden, Confederation will relieve us; a benefit so apparent needs not a single word. 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Members are aware that this debt is a heavy tax upon the country, and prevents the 
     <lb/>
     undertaking of public works. The assumption of this debt by Canada, on fair terms, will not 
     <lb/>
     only relieve us of this burden, but will save us a large balance of cash, which will be available 
     <lb/>
     for public works to open up the country. I will now proceed to the next item.

                  nominal, and has been arrived at by <lb/> comparison of the revenue and
                  population, because in the absence of actual census, and to <lb/> facilitate
                  financial arrangements, it has been deemed best to calculate according to the
                  revenue <lb/> producing powers of British Columbia compared with Canada. Thus we
                  have it officially <lb/>
                  <pb n="56" facs="final/images/BC_LC_1870-03-14_Page_056.jpg"/>
                  <fw type="num">56</fw>
                  <fw type="num">CONFEDERATION DEBATE.</fw> from Canada, that her Customs and Excise
                  produced $2.75 per head of her population; at the <lb/> same rate, $2.75 per head,
                  our Customs represent the same present revenue as a population of <lb/> 120,000
                  Canadians produce. This estimate of 120,000, therefore, though nominal, is really
                  <lb/> just and fair; hence 120,000 population has been adopted as the basis of our
                  financial calcula<lb break="no"/>tions. The $35,000 in paragraph 3. allowance for
                  the general support of the Government, is <lb/> an arbitrary sum adopted by Canada
                  in negotiating with Newfoundland and New Brunswick. <lb/> The allowance of 5 per
                  cent. interest on the difference between our public debt and that of <lb/> Canada
                  is arrived at in this way: We have it officially from Canada that her debt on
                  February <lb/> 9thâ€”say 1st March if you likeâ€”amounted to $22 per head of her
                  population. This would entitle <lb/> us, with 120,000 people, to come in with a
                  much larger debt than our own, which at the time <lb/> of Union would be, say,
                  $1,000,000. The interest at five per cent. on the difference of these <lb/>
                  amounts would give us the annual allowance of $82,000 named in the papers before
                  the House. <lb/> The 80 cents a head on our population of 120,000 is the usual
                  allowance prescribed by the Organic <lb/> Act of Confederation. <lb/>

            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:TRUT1">Hon. CHIEF COMMISIONER</persName>â€”Mr. Chairman, I think that on these
                  two clauses depends <lb/> the whole stability of our scheme; and as I believe them
                  to be of very vital importance <lb/> ["Hear, hear," from <persName ref="pers:DECO1">Mr. DeCosmos</persName>], I trust I
                  shall be excused if I offer a few remarks <lb/> upon them, although it is possible
                  I may travel over the same ground as the Hon. Attorney- <lb break="yes"/> General
                  has taken up in introducing these clauses. I say. Sir, that 120,000 may appear
                  <lb/> wxtravagant at first sight. The basis of the population of 1861 is taken as
                  the basis on which <lb/> other schemes rest; but that would not do for this
                  Colony. It would not give us an equal <lb/> advantage with other Provinces. It
                  has, therefore, been found necessary to take some other <lb/> basis. And here,
                  Sir, I desire to say that I am permitted to inform this House that the <lb/>
                  Executive are very much indebted to the Hon. Member for Victoria City, who is also
                  a <lb/> Member of the Executive Council (Dr. Helmcken), for his able assistance
                  and suggestions <lb/> in preparing this scheme. I trust that this Council will.
                  find that the Hon. Member has been <lb/> most practical and ardent in his
                  endeavours to obtain good terms, if he has not been an <lb/> enthusiastic advocate
                  of Confederation. With regard to the reasons for adopting the number <lb/> of
                  120.000 as the basis of population, we ask something for undeveloped resources.
                  The <lb/> expenses of living in this Colony are much higher than on the Atlantic
                  Coast; there is more <lb/> per head paid for taxes here than in any other part of
                  the Dominion. One dollar here is in <lb/> reality worth no more, that is to say it
                  goes no further, than one shilling in the Eastern <lb/> Provinces; and one man
                  here pays as much to the Revenue as four on the other side. The <lb/> basis is in
                  fact the basis of Customs paid by each individual in this Colony, compared with
                  <lb/> the Customs Revenue paid per individual in Canada. Taking the estimate of
                  the present year, <lb/> the Canadian Customs and Excise yield $2.75 per head on
                  the present population; and our <lb/> Customs being $330,000, is equal to $2.75
                  per head on a population of 120,000, upon comparison <lb/> with Canada.
                  Practically and equitably, I believe this to be a fair basis. It may be open <lb/>
                  to some logical objection, but I believe it is equitable. The estimate which we
                  propose to hand <lb/> over yields at that rate, as we now farm it. We turn it over
                  into the hands of those who are <lb/> to manage it. It is not for us to consider
                  how. If they reduce the Customs, it is nothing to <lb/> us; we must have a basis
                  as favourable as this. ["Perhaps more so" â€”<persName ref="pers:HELM1">Hon. Mr. Helmcken</persName>.) <lb/> Perhaps more
                  so, as the Hon. Member says. The debt of Canada amounts to $22 per head <lb/> on
                  the population, and this on a population of 120,000 gives a debt of $2,640,000. We
                  may <lb/> claim to have our debt taken over on the same basis as other Colonies,
                  as before Union can <lb/> be consummated we may expect our debt to be reduced to
                  $1,000,000, leaving a balance of <lb/> $1,640,000, on which we will have a right
                  to claim interest at 5 per cent., that is to say: <lb/> $82,000, as stated in the
                  printed particulars now before the Committee. The subsidy of $35,000 <lb/> is
                  equal to that given to Newfoundland. Referring again to the printed figures, you
                  will find <lb/> that the amount of Revenue retained by British Columbia is
                  $151,050.. Add this to the subsidies. <lb/> including the interest on the
                  difference of the debt, amounting to $213,000, and we have a total <lb/> Revenue
                  of $364,050. As we shall be relieved of all expenses but $212,000.75, we shall
                  have <lb/> left a clear balance of $ 152,040.25 to be spent in local works. This
                  constitutes the Financial <lb/> Scheme, and although it is open to argument, it is
                  about what we are entitled to receive, and <lb/> what we must receive to place us
                  in a fair position under Union. <lb/>

                  by Canada, I may possibly be <lb/> wasting my breath, and the time of the House;
                  but although that may be the case, my duty <lb/> to my constituents and the
                  country demands tha; I should do so. With respect to Confedera<lb break="no"
                  />tion, I have ever looked at it from one point: it must have a money value. {"
                  Hear, hear," <lb/> from Dr. Helmchen.) A great deal has been said about the form
                  of Governmentâ€”about <lb/> Responsible Governmentâ€”but I say this: that every
                  Government, whether responsible or <lb/> irresponsibleâ€”must have money. It is
                  impossible for the most perfect political system to <lb/> move without it. Ways
                  and Means must be provided. Now, I have always said, and I still <lb/> maintain,
                  in view of Confederation, that the amount that ought to be placed at the disposal
                  <lb/> of our Local Government when we enter Union ought. to be an annual surplus
                  of $200,000, <lb/> or nearly so, after having provided for the annual current
                  expenditure of our Local Govern<lb break="no"/>ment; that is, for all the offices
                  and services that must be kept up at the expense of the <lb/> Colony, in order to
                  keep it moving as a Province of the Dominion. We know by reference to <lb/> the
                  Estimates what they are; but in addition, there must be a certain sum provided for
                  <lb/> keeping in repair public works, such as the Main Trunk Road from Yale to
                  Cariboo, and our <lb/> public buildings. After these expenses have been defrayed,
                  I should expect a surplus to the <lb/> credit of the Local Government of about
                  $200,000. <lb/>

                  that surplus? By the proposition before us, for which the Hon. Member <lb/> for
                  Victoria City (Dr. Helmcken) gets the credit as the originator? No, Sir. But I
                  will not <lb/> anticipate the answer to these questions. Let us first examine, the
                  Government financial scheme, <lb/> of which the Hon. Member for Victoria is the
                  financier. The first proposition made by the <lb/> Government is that we shall
                  assume for financial purposes that our population is 120,000. <lb/> Now, Sir, I am
                  one of that number who do not believe in assumptions in matters of finance,â€” <lb/>
                  one of those who deem it to be dangerous to found financial measures on fiction
                  instead of fact; <lb/> for in no department of Government ought there to be
                  maintained a stricter regard for truth <lb/> and fact than in the department of
                  finance. The financier who resorts to fiction, no matter <lb/> how
                  well-intentioued, nor how patriotic, may justly be doubted. It may be as the Hon.
                  Chief <lb/> Commissioner has said: that the assumption of a population of 120,000
                  may be illogical and <lb/> untrue, yet the result may be equitable. But, Sir, I do
                  not think that we ought to assume, <lb/> neither do I see the necessity for
                  assuming, that we have a population of 120,000 instead of <lb/> 40,000, as I
                  believe it to be, as it is recognized to be, and as it is in fact. The magnitude
                  of <lb/> the subject, the historical aspect of the terms, the dignity of the
                  contracting parties, the noble<lb break="no"/>ness of the work of nation-making,
                  our own self-respect, ought to lift us above the atmosphere <lb/> of assumption
                  and fiction, ought to guide us by an accurate and genuine political standard,
                  <lb/> and ought to inspire us with such pure and lofty political sentiments as
                  would stamp the <lb/> financial terms with the indelible marks of truth, fact, and
                  statesmanship, and for ever shut <lb/> out the possibility of posterity
                  associating our public men with mere parish politicians, instead <lb/> of ranking
                  them with enlightened and able statesmen. At the utmost, our population does <lb/>
                  not exceed 40,000, including men, women, and children.â€”Whites, Chinese, and
                  Indiansâ€”10.000 <lb/> civilized, and 30,000 semicivilized. It would be a mistake to
                  estimate an Indian to be equal <lb/> to a white man as a consumer; but when we
                  consider that in our white population the males <lb/> are largely in excess of the
                  females, and that in this country they are very large consumers, it <lb/> would
                  not be incorrect to conclude that there is no unfairness in making our whole
                  populationâ€” <lb/> Whites and Indiansâ€”as equal to 40,000 consumers in the Dominion.
                  Starting, therefore, <lb/> with a population of 40,000, we base our calculations
                  on facts, and not on fiction, as in the <lb/> governmental assumption of a
                  population of 120,000. I will now, Mr. Chairman, proceed to <lb/> deal with the
                  financial proposition of the Hon. gentleman for Victoria Cityâ€”which is the <lb/>
                  Government schemeâ€”by which he proposes to get $152,000 surplus revenue for the
                  Colony <lb/> after the Union. The proposed sources of revenue to produce this
                  surplus are four in number, <lb/> viv : (1) an annual subsidy of 80 cents per head
                  of our population, which is assumed to be <lb/> 120,000, and on that basis of
                  population would yield $96,000; (2) a fixed subsidy of $35,000 <lb/> per annum;
                  (3) interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum on the difference between the
                  <lb/> actual amount of the debt of the Colony, at the date of Union, and the
                  proportion of the public <lb/>

                  <fw type="num">58</fw>
                  <fw type="running">CONFEDERATION DEBATE.</fw> debt of Canada for 120,000 of the
                  population of Canada at the time of Union, which is esti<lb break="no"/>mated at
                  $82,000 per annum; and (4) the balance of our presont revenue (not including the
                  <lb/> Customs, Excise, Postage, &amp;c., that go to the Dominion), estimated at
                  $151,050 per annum. <lb/> Now, Sir, I have already shown that our maximum
                  population does not exceed 40,000. If <lb/> we estimate the population of the
                  Dominion on our admission in 1871 at 4,300,000, and the <lb/> public debt at
                  $86,000,000, the rate per head would be $20. Now, $20 per head for our <lb/>
                  40,000 people would entitle us to a public debt of $800,000; and as our public
                  debt, after <lb/> deducting Sinking Fund, would be in 1871 about,$1,050,000, the
                  Colony would enter the <lb/> Dominion with a debt of about $250,000. So no revenue
                  can be acquired from the third <lb/> source of revenue on the basis of 40,000
                  population. Again, if the proposed terms allowed us <lb/> to enter with the same
                  debt per head as old Canada entered the Dominion, that is $25 per <lb/> head, our
                  population of 40,000 would only entitle us to a debt of $1,000,000, leaving us
                  still <lb/> in debt $50,000 on our admission. No revenue still, Let us now take a
                  passing glance at <lb/> the Newfoundland terms of Union. The debt per head allowed
                  to New Brunswick on her <lb/> admission was, we are told, accepted on behalf of
                  Newfoundland by those who negotiated the <lb/> terms, and that was $27.77 per
                  head. Now 40,000 people at $27.77 per head would entitle <lb/> the Colony, on
                  admission in 1871, to a public debt of $1,110,800, instead of $1,048,644, our
                  <lb/> public debt then leaving a difference of $62,150, on which. on the basis of
                  the third source of <lb/> revenue, we would be entitled to draw interest at 5 per
                  cent. That difference, $62,150 at 5 <lb/> per cent, would yield only $3,107,â€”a sum
                  very far below $82,000 per annum, the estimate in <lb/> the terms proposed. So it
                  is neither on the Newfoundland basis, nor on a basis of fact, that <lb/> the Hon.
                  Member for Victoria City has framed the Government scheme of Union. I will <lb/>
                  now come, Sir, to the real point of issue. I will try, with all fairness, to
                  discover whether <lb/> there is or is not any ground on which to base the
                  assumption of a population of 120,000. <lb/> We have been told by the Hon. the
                  Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works, and by the <lb/> Hon. and learned
                  Attorney-General, that the financial calculations are based on the proportion
                  <lb/> between the receipts of Customs and Excise in this Colony and the receipts
                  from Customs and <lb/> Excise in the Dominion of Canada. Now, Sir, from statistics
                  in my possession, I find that <lb/> the Customs of. Canada yield $8,640,000. That
                  amount, with a population of 4,300,000, would <lb/> be equal to $2 per head per
                  annum. Let us now see what the Customs Revenue yields per <lb/> head in British
                  Columbia. In 1869, the Customs were $342,126. The difference between the <lb/>
                  average percentage of Customs duty imposed in British Columbia and in Canada is 7
                  per cent. <lb/> less under the Canadian than under our tariff. Now, as we imported
                  in 1869 $1,775,000, 7 <lb/> per cent. on that amount would be equal to $124,250.
                  If we deduct $124,250 from $342,126, <lb/> our Customs receipts in 1869, we shall
                  have $217,876, the total revenue Canada would have <lb/> received from British
                  Columbia in case we had been in the Dominion. If we divide this <lb/> $217,876 by
                  our population, 40,000, we shall have 5 3/20 per head; in round numbers, 5 1/2.
                  <lb/> We can now easily discern the reason why the basis of population has been
                  fixed at 120,000 <lb/> for financial purposes in the Government scheme of Union.
                  It is apparent that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment estimate of population has been
                  founded on the conclusion that in British Columbia the <lb/> Customs would be
                  about $6 per head. and in Canada $2 per head, or three times higher here <lb/>
                  than there; and, therefore, our population of 40,000 ought for financial purposes
                  to be <lb/> 120,000, or three times greater than it really is. If there were not
                  reasons for the opinion <lb/> that under Confederation the Customs and Excise of
                  the Dominion, as applied to this Colony, <lb/> would not perceptibly exceed the
                  rate per head in the Dominion East, I would cheerfully <lb/> assent, for financial
                  purposes, to the assumption of 120.000 as our basis of population. I <lb/> cannot,
                  however, conscientiously do so, for with the extension of the Dominion to the
                  Pacific, <lb/> I hold, will come the' equalization of political rights, and the
                  equalization of taxation. The <lb/> equalization of political rights will be
                  established with the extension of the Dominion; but <lb/> equalization of
                  taxation, though it may not come in the first year after Union, yet it is bound
                  <lb/> to come within two or three years after Union shall have been proclaimed. In
                  proof of this <lb/> assertion, I could direct the attention of the Council to what
                  I deem facts: (1) That as soon <lb/> as Union shall have been proclaimed, Canadian
                  manufacturers will enter our ports duty free, <lb/> and that the reduction of
                  Customs receipts from this source will, on the basis of our imports <lb/> for
                  1869, be $58,400 per annum; (2) The reduction of Customs receipts after Union, for
                  <lb/> Canadian produce entered duty free, and by the increase of agricultural
                  produce in the Colony, <lb/> will be, on the imports of 1869, $66,100. Now these
                  two reductions are equal to $124,500, <lb/>
                  <pb n="59" facs="final/images/BC_LC_1870-03-14_Page_059.jpg"/>
                  <fw type="running">CONFEDERATION DEBATE.</fw>
                  <fw type="num">59</fw> and if we deduct $124,500 from $217,876, the amount that
                  has been assumed by Government <lb/> that Canada would draw from this Colony in
                  Customs receipts, we shall have only $93,376; <lb/> and thus $93,376 will be only
                  a fraction more than $2 per head for our 40,000 populationâ€” <lb/> very nearly the
                  same rate per head of Customs taxation on the Pacific as on the Atlantic. I <lb/>
                  might enter into explanations at greater length to show the correctness of this
                  conclusion, but <lb/> I deem it undesirable. The certainty of the equalization of
                  taxation all over the Dominion <lb/> renders the assumption of a population of
                  120,000 for financial purposes a pure fallacy. and <lb/> nothing more nor nothing
                  less, It is simply taking a temperorary, a transitory state of <lb/> things, a
                  state of things that will pass away in a year or two, as the basis for permanent
                     condi<lb break="no"/>tions, Besides, there is a serious disadvantage in
                  assuming that we will pay $6 per head per <lb/> annum in Customs duty to the
                  Dominion after Union, and it is this Nearlyevery one <lb/> would like to see all
                  kinds of foreign merchandize, except such as would enter into competition <lb/>
                  with home-grown produce and home-made manufactures, entered duty free in Victoria,
                  in <lb/> order to foster and extend 'commerce. Now, it the Dominion Government
                  made such an <lb/> exemption from Customs for our benefit, it is but natural that
                  we should make good to Canada <lb/> in some other way what her revenue would lose
                  by such an exemption. If Vancouver Island <lb/> were exempted from Customs, and
                  its population were taken to be 20,000, the Local Govern<lb break="no"/>ment would
                  he expected to pay to the Dominion $0 per head, or $120,000 per annum, for the
                  <lb/> exemption. But if instead of the temporary rate of $0 per head, the
                  permanent rate of $2 <lb/> per head were taken, the 20,000 people of Vancouver
                  Island would only have to provide <lb/> $40,000 per annum in lieu of $120,000, a
                  saving of $80,000. The advantage of adhering <lb/> strictly to facts, instead of
                  fallacious assumptions, is consequently perceptible to every one. <lb/> By
                  following facts we can have a scheme of union with a true correlation of parts, a
                  thing <lb/> impossible if we follow the proposed assumptions. I have stated that
                  $93,376 is all the <lb/> Revenue that Canada is likely to receive in Customs from
                  British Columbia, on the basis of <lb/> Population and Imports of 1869, Now, if a
                  wide margin be allowed, and these figures be <lb/> raised to $120,000 per annum,
                  it would only, at $2 per head, entitle us to a population of <lb/> 60,000, That
                  population would entitle the Colony to a debt of $1,200,000, or only $150,000
                  <lb/> in 1871 over our present debt, and on which the interest would be but $7,500
                  per annum. <lb/> It is useless for me to follow the matter further to Show that
                  the financial terms are not based <lb/> on correct premises. But before I conclude
                  this section of the subject I would remark that <lb/> I have not taken into
                  account the amount of Internal Revenue, such as Excise, Postage, <lb/> Stamps,
                  Malt Tax, &amp;c., that the Colony is likely to contribute to the Dominion
                  Treasury; for, <lb/> so far as I can estimate the rate, it will not exceed $1, or
                  $1.25 per head, and offers little or <lb/> no grounds on which to base financial
                  terms. The only difference, it appears to me, between <lb/> the Customs and
                  Internal Revenue laws of Canada, as applied for Revenue purposes to this <lb/>
                  Colony, is: that the Internal Revenue Taxes are likely to be, from the date of our
                  admission, <lb/> at the same rate per head here as in other parts of the Dominion;
                  whereas the Customs will <lb/> be higher here per head for a few years than there.
                  Turning now, Sir, to that portion of the <lb/> financial terms that proposes to
                  get $151,050 30 from sources of revenue to be reserved after <lb/> Union to the
                  Colony, 1 cannot help thinking that: there has been a mistake all through the
                  <lb/> Governmental scheme, and that the amount of revenue proposed to be obtained
                  from those <lb/> sources is another instance of Governmental blundering. As I sum
                  up these sources of <lb/> revenue from the Estimates of 1870, they are as follows:
                  â€”Road Tolls, $50,000; Land Sales, <lb/> $6,000; Land Revenue, $4,000; Rents,
                  $1,500; Miners' Certificates, $11,000; Mining <lb/> Receipts. $12,000; Spirit
                  Licences. Â  25,000; Trading Licences, $15,000; Fees of Court, <lb/> $4,200: Fees
                  of Office, $6,050; and Vancouver Island Road Tax. $6,000 - makingÂ  a total of
                  <lb/> $141,250, instead of '$131,050, as in the Governmental estimate submitted
                  with the proposed <lb/> Terms of Union. The way in which I make the difference is
                  by not taking into account as <lb/> permanent sources of revenue such items as
                  Arrears of Vancouver Island Real Estate Tax, <lb/> $8,000; Over-payments
                  Recoverable, $500; Sale of Unserviceable Stores, $1,500. There can <lb/> be no
                  grounds for including such accidental sources of revenue under the head of
                  permanent <lb/> sources of revenue. Hence we must reduce the $151,000 of local
                  revenue to $141,000. But <lb/> the latter amount must also be reduced by deducting
                  the Vancouver Island Road Tax $6,000, <lb/> therefrom, thus leaving only $135,000
                  as permanent sources of revenue; for if the Vancouver <lb/> Island Road Tax be
                  included in our estimate of permanent revenue, we ought also to include <lb/> the
                  annual revenue of the cities of Victoria and New Westminster, which is simply
                  absurd. <lb/>

<p>
     The Vancouver Island Road Tax is a purely municipal matter, and so the Government has 
     <lb/>
     blundered in mixing up municipal with provincial revenue. The Yale-Cariboo Road Tolls are 
     <lb/>
     estimated as a permanent source of revenue at $50,000. This is another mistake. for the 
     <lb/>
     Road Tolls are falling off every year. In 1868 they were $67,823 ; in 1860, $46,500; and in 
     <lb/>
     all probability will be much less in 1870; and as mining diminishes in the upper country, 
     <lb/>
     year by year, so will the Tolls. If ever the proposed Railway be built, away go the Tolls 
     <lb/>
     altogether, Besides that, the present Road Tolls are oppressively high. On the receipts of 
     <lb/>
     last year, they are equal to $150 per waggon load of 6,000 lbs., or 2 1/2 cents per lb.,â€”an enor<lb break="no"/>mous tax that no one in his senses would ever think of regarding as permanent. If any toll 
     <lb/>
     at all were levied permanently, it could not be fixed at a higher rate than one- sixth of a cent 
     <lb/>
     per pound. or $10 per load of 6,000 lbs., from Yale to Cariboo. At that rate the Road Tolls, 
     <lb/>
     instead of yielding $50,000 per year, would only produce $3,333, which for all practical 
     <lb/>
     purposes might as well be abolished. for the cost of collection would exceed the receipts. For 
     <lb/>
     another and all-important reason, I think a great mistake has been made in entering the Road 
     <lb/>
     Tolls as permanent revenue after union. It is this: the entire people of the upper country 
     <lb/>
     have determined to abolish the Road Tolls as soon as possible. No compromise will be accepted. 
     <lb/>
     So, under this head our future revenue cannot he estimated higher than $3,333, or nothing. 
     <lb/>
     The revenue from Land Sales is also put higher than we are justified in fixing it, In 1868, 
     <lb/>
     the receipts under the head of Land Sales were only $1,200; in 1869, $5,564; and as permanent 
     <lb/>
     revenue, for all time to come. under union, at $6,000. Now, as it is alike our policy and our 
     <lb/>
     interest not to make Land Sales a source of revenue, I do not think that we would act judiciously 
     <lb/>
     in considering the terms of union if we estimate a higher amount of permanent revenue from 
     <lb/>
     this source than the receipts of 1869, $1,200. Neither Land Revenue nor Rents appear to be as 
     <lb/>
     uncertain in their returns as Land Sales; so I will pass on to the items of Miners' Certificates, 
     <lb/>
     $11,000, and Mining Receipts, $12,500. Here again it appears to me another mistake has been 
     <lb/>
     made. Such gold mines as are worked in British Columbia will be worked out. Such diggings 
     <lb/>
     are sure to he deserted in a very few years. The white miners will retire, and the Chinese will 
     <lb/>
     take their place. When the Chinaman leaves, the mines are worked out. I can, therefore, see 
     <lb/>
     but little hope of permanent revenue from the gold mines, Already the mining revenue has 
     <lb/>
     begun to fall off. In 1867, Miners' Certificates yielded $13,645; in 1868, $11,535; in 1869, 
     <lb/>
     $10,500; and is likely to be less in 1870, although the estimate is $11,000. In 1867, Mining 
     <lb/>
     Receipts were $22,208; in 1808, $15,756; in 1869, $11,500; and yet for 1870 the estimate is 
     <lb/>
     $12,500. At the utmost, from all departments of mining, we cannot, in my opinion, estimate 
     <lb/>
     higher than $10,000 as permanent revenue, and but little of that amount will ultimately be 
     <lb/>
     drawn from gold-mining. Now, Sir, with respect to Spirit Licences, which have been estimated 
     <lb/>
     by the Government at $25,000 as permanent revenue, there could be no greater blunder made. 
     <lb/>
     The Hon. gentleman who framed these terms seems to have had no notion whatever of the 
     <lb/>
     sytems of taxation that obtain in the Dominion, and has consequently repeated his mistake of 
     <lb/>
     mixing Municipal taxation with Provincial. In the Dominion there are three forms of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, viz : Municipal, Provincial, and Dominional, and each has its own system of taxation. 
     <lb/>
     Here we have but Provincial and Municipal Governments, with their respective systems of 
     <lb/>
     taxation. Now it appears that consideration has only been given, in framing these terms, to 
     <lb/>
     taxation under the Customs and Internal Revenue Laws of the Dominion. But Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Taxation ought also to have been considered, and the starting point should have been the 
     <lb/>
     equalization of our Provincial Taxes with the Provincial Taxes of the Eastern Provinces. This 
     <lb/>
     is made very apparent with respect to Spirit Licences. Here the Provincial Government levies 
     <lb/>
     $200 per annum on retailers in towns and in the country $50 per annum. In Ontario the retail 
     <lb/>
     spirit licence is $20 per annum in cities, $17 in towns, and $10 in the country. In estimating our 
     <lb/>
     future revenue from this source, we are not justified in placing it higher than the rate of Ontario, 
     <lb/>
     and that would reduce the receipts from Spirit Licences from $25,000 to about $6,250 per annum. 
     <lb/>
     The excess above the latter amount, if levied, ought to he levied for Municipal purposes. The 
     <lb/>
     Trade Licence here is also estimated too high. Now, after careful study of these sources of 
     <lb/>
     Provincial Revenue which it is proposed that the Colony, after union, shall exclusively possess, 
     <lb/>
     I cannot make the permanent receipts higher than $50,000 per aununl. The difference, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     between my estimate of Provincial taxation and that of the framer of these terms, is $101,050, 
     <lb/>
     or as $151,050 is to $50,000, If a larger amount than the latter be levied by our Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Government after admission, our taxes will be out of proportion to the taxes in the Eastern 
     <lb/>
     Provinces for Provincial purposes. Before propounding what I consider ought to be the financial 
     <lb/>

     terms of union, I will conclude this part of the subject by stating that the terms submitted in 
     <lb/>
     the Resolutions, and illustrated by the printed Estimate, instead of giving the Colony a per<lb break="no"/>manent total revenue of $364,050 per annum, will only produce $248,567,  unless higher Provincial 
     <lb/>
     taxation be levied here than in other parts of the Dominion. The way in which I make up these 
     <lb/>
     results is as follows :-By the terms submitted by the Government, there is (lst) Fixed subsidy, 
     <lb/>
     $35,000 ; (2nd) Interest on difference of Public Debt, $82,000; (3rd) 80 cents per head on 120,000 people, 
     <lb/>
     population, $96,000 ; (4th) Reserved revenue, $151,050 :  Total, $364,050. By my interpretation of 
     <lb/>
     the proposed terms, there is: (1) Fixed subsidy, $35,000; (2) 80 cents per head on 120,000 people, 
     <lb/>
     $96,000 ; (3) Interest on difference of debt, taking $20 per head as the debt of Canada, $67,567 ; 
     <lb/>
     (4) Reserved revenue, $50,000: Total, $248,567. Now, if we deduct from the latter amount the 
     <lb/>
     Government estimate of current: expenditure, viz.: $211,009, there would only remain a surplus 
     <lb/>
     revenue of $36,558, instead of $151,050, as anticipated. I, therefore, sincerely think that the 
     <lb/>
     Government scheme is wrong, and ought to he revised. Mr. Chairman, I therefore propose to 
     <lb/>
     bring under the notice of the Council what I consider ought to he the financial terms, taking for 
     <lb/>
     granted always that Canada will become liable for our public debt at the time of admission. 
     <lb/>
     When the Provincial Delegates met in Quebec and London, to decide on the terms of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, they divided the Provinces into three groups, viz. : Upper Canada, Lower Canada, and the 
     <lb/>
     Maritime Provinces. Lower Canada was taken as the initial point. Now, Sir, in deciding 
     <lb/>
     finally as to the terms, I consider that British Columbia ought to be treated as the fourth 
     <lb/>
     group, whilst: the Northwest Territory may be regarded as the fifth. The first thing that 
     <lb/>
     strikes me, on looking at the Eastern Provinces, is their territory. Ontario has 121,260 square 
     <lb/>
     miles; Quebec, 210,000 ; and all the Maritime Provinces, 88,065. Territorially, then, we are 
     <lb/>
     their equal, and greater than either of them. The natural capacity of our territory to support 
     <lb/>
     population is as great as Lower Canada. We have a finer climate, and more varied natural 
     <lb/>
     resources. Quebec sustains a population of about 1,250,000, or more. Ontario has 2,000,000. 
     <lb/>
     It is true that they are two centuries ahead of us, and we are in our infancy, with a handful 
     <lb/>
     of people. But that is no reason why, in framing terms, that we should not look forward to 
     <lb/>
     the rapid development of the Colony, and to the possession of a large settled population. Con<lb break="no"/>sidering our geographical position, our natural resources, our wide-spread population, and our 
     <lb/>
     future, I think that we are entitled to as large a fixed subsidy as Ontario, that is $80,000. 
     <lb/>
     The proposed terms, submitted by the Government, ask only $35,000 per annum. Now, this 
     <lb/>
     is placing British Columbia, with its 220,000 square miles, its great natural resources, and 
     <lb/>
     the best climate in the world, on a par with Newfoundland, with its 40,000 square miles, its 
     <lb/>
     sterile soil and inhospitable climate,â€”a country that has never yet developed any capacity 
     <lb/>
     for anything but catching and selling codfish.  Prince Edward's Island is also offered a fixed 
     <lb/>
     subsidy of $35,000 per annum,-a little insular community with a territory of 2,100 square 
     <lb/>
     miles, a hundred times less in area than our own country, and with a climate far inferior to 
     <lb/>
     ours. It is simply absurd to propose such a thing as ranking this Colony in subsidies with 
     <lb/>
     either of the Provinces except Ontario. I want neither more nor less than what the latter 
     <lb/>
     Province gets as a fixed annual subsidy.  Every Hon. gentleman present who gives the matter 
     <lb/>
     a moment's consideration must agree with me that $35,000 is entirely out of the question, and 
     <lb/>
     that the least we can accept is a fixed subsidy of $80,000 per annum. [Hear, hear.]   In the 
     <lb/>
     next place, I propose that our population be taken at 40,000, and at no time shall it be con<lb break="no"/>sidered less ; and that we shall be entitled to receive 80 cents per head annually until our 
     <lb/>
     population shall have reached 1,000,000. By this proportion we have truth and fact on our 
     <lb/>
     side. Our population will he subsidized at its actual number and not increased by a fiction 
     <lb/>
     -an unnecessary   assumption-as in the terms proposed.  Under this head we would get, on 
     <lb/>
     entering the Dominion, $32,000 per year. Besides that, as our population increases, this <hi rendition="simple:italic">per 
     <lb/>
     capita</hi> subsidy would increase annually in amount, till it reached the maxunum number of 
     <lb/>
     inhabitants of 1,000,000, and then it would stop. Now, the terms sent down to us by the 
     <lb/>
     Government assume, as I have shown before, the existence of a population of 120,000, and 
     <lb/>
     propose that we shall receive 80 cents on that number at once, and that we shall receive no 
     <lb/>
     increase till our population shall  have actually reached and passed that number; so it may be 
     <lb/>
     twenty years or longer before our actual population shall be equal to the assumed population, 
     <lb/>
     120,000; and in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">interim</hi> the <hi rendition="simple:italic">per capita</hi> subsidy will remain unchanged. But this is not 
     <lb/>
     all. The Government scheme proposes  to limit our maximum population to 400,000, the same 
     <lb/>
     as in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and as proposed in the terms to Newfoundland and Prince 
     <lb/>
     Edward's Island. This is part of the same error made in copying the fixed subsidy. If we 
     <lb/>
           

            <pb n="62" facs="final/images/BC_LC_1870-03-14_Page_062.jpg"/>

     sum up the maximum of population entitled to a <hi rendition="simple:italic">per capita</hi> subsidy in the four Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, it will amount to 1,000,000. Now, if we rank our population with our extent of 
     <lb/>
     territory, we who possess three times as much territory as the Maritime Provinces, and equal 
     <lb/>
     capacity to support population, ought, at least to be entitled to fix our maximum number of 
     <lb/>
     inhabitants entitled to the <hi rendition="simple:italic">per capita</hi> subsidy at one million. (Hear, hear.) Now, Sir, neither 
     <lb/>
     of these two subsidies, nor both, would meet the current expenditure of the Government,- <lb/> keep the necessary offices and services of the Colony moving. Both only amount to $112,000 
     <lb/>
     per annum, and we require at least $162,000 to meet current expenditure, on the basis of the 
     <lb/>
     Estimates of 1870. But, as it accidentally happens, if we add the proposed fixed subsidy, 
     <lb/>
     $80,000, and the <hi rendition="simple:italic">per capita</hi> subsidy, $32,000, to the reserved revenue, which I have previously 
     <lb/>
     shown ought not to be estimated higher than $50,000, we shall have $162,000 and nothing 
     <lb/>
     over,â€”no surplus to enable the Local Government to do anything to develop or settle up the 
     <lb/>
     country. If we were to receive nothing more than those two subsidies and reserved revenue, 
     <lb/>
     we would gain nothing by joining,r the Dominion. It would be simply jumping out of the frying- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     pan into the fire,â€”a change without financial improvement. Under such circumstances, I 
     <lb/>
     would oppose Confederation. Now, Sir, in addition to the fixed and <hi rendition="simple:italic">per capita</hi> subsidies, I 
     <lb/>
     ask for a temporary subsidy of $150,000. (Hear, hear.)

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:DECO1">Hon. Mr. DECOSMOS</persName>â€”I ask for a temporary subsidy of $150,000
                  per annum, to be <lb/> diminished annually in amount, in proportion as our
                  population shall exceed 40,000. New <lb/> Brunswick has a temporary subsidy of
                  $63,000 for ten years. Nova Scotia a temporary subsidy <lb/> of $82,000 for ten
                  years. The grounds on which I ask a temporary subsidy for British <lb/> Columbia
                  are: firstly, that the cost of living here is greater than in the Eastern
                  Provinces, <lb/> and, consequently, public officers must be paid higher salaries,
                  and necessary services cost more <lb/> in this country than there; secondly, our
                  country isvery large, and our population is small <lb/> and widely scattered. and,
                  consequently. requiring a larger staff of officials than a more compact <lb/> and
                  more populous community might require elsewhere; lastly, we require the additional
                  <lb/> temporary subsidy on the highest of all gromidsâ€”expediency, that has
                  governed politics in all <lb/> times and countries. Without a surplus of at least
                  $150,000 per annum, the Local Government <lb/> will be ahle to do nothing to
                  advance the interests and settlement of the country. Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion
                  would soon prove itself a source of disappointment, if there were no money spent
                  annually <lb/> for public works, immigration, education, &amp;e. A change, without
                  financial improvement, would <lb/> destroy all hope of any such thing as the loyal
                  and cordial co-operation of our people with <lb/> the Government of the Dominion.
                  Expediency, therefore, demands the subsidy. and expedi<lb break="no"/>ency
                  justifies the demand. In concluding my remarks Sir. on this subject, I will
                  briefly <lb/> contrast the terms proposed by the Government and the terms
                  suggested by myself. The Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment scheme. as I have shown, calls
                  for only , $248,567, instead of $364,050 as alleged. Of <lb/> the former sum it
                  can draw in subsidies $198,567, in lieu of $213,000 as intimated. Now, by <lb/>
                  the terms which I have proposed the three subsidies, viz : - fixed subsidy $80000
                  per annum, <lb/>
                  <hi rendition="simple:italic">per capita</hi> subsidy, $32,000, temporary subsidy:
                  $150,000, would yield $262,000 per annum, and <lb/> adding thereto the reserved
                  revenue (the details of which have been explained) $50,000, the <lb/> Colony on
                  and after Union would have a Revenue amounting to $312,000 per annum. If we <lb/>
                  deduct $162,000, the sum required by the Estimates of 1870, to keep up and pay for
                  our <lb/> Provincial officers and services and make the necessary ' repairs to
                  certain roads and buildings. <lb/> we will have a clear surplus of $150,000 per
                  annum to be devoted to Education, Charity, Public <lb/> Works and Immigration
                  Besides which the equalization of taxation for Provincial purposes <lb/> would
                  reduce taxation at least $100,000 more. If we deduct the current expenditure of
                  the <lb/> Government, viz: $162,000 from $248,507, the actual total amount of
                  Revenue to be received <lb/> under the terms submitted by Government to the
                  Council, the surplus Revenue will be $86,567, <lb/> as against $150,000 in that
                  which I have proposed, making a difference between them of $63,433. <lb/> ("Hear,
                  hear.") I shall hereafter move a Resolution suggesting the adoption of the terms
                  <lb/> that l have explained, and as an amendment to the Resolutions now under
                  discussion. [" Hear, <lb/> hear.") <lb/>

                  <fw type="num">63</fw> who has just spoken, attempts to show that Canadian
                  manufactures will come in free. <lb/> Twenty years hence Canadian manufactures may
                  come in, but I will not go into that <lb/> question ; why should Canada complain
                  of her goods coming in. what she gains will be more than <lb/> she loses. She
                  desires a large market for her manufactures, and she must pay us for that ; <lb/>
                  she cannot complain that she is losing by supplying us with her manufactured
                  goods. The <lb/> Hon. Member for Victoria District (Mr. DeCosmos) says that
                  equalization of labour, and of <lb/> value of property and productions. will come
                  about. I admit that it may be so, but in my <lb/> opinion it will not be for some
                  years to come. If there is equalization of labour, there will <lb/> also be
                  equalization of taxation and offices. The Local Government can look after this
                  when <lb/> it happens. I do not suppose that Canada will be disposed to look at
                  our terms critically ; <lb/> they are getting this Colony far too cheap ; I think
                  $250,000 is too cheap. The Hon. gentleman <lb/> (Mr. DeCosmos) says that we should
                  go to Canada and ask $80,000 per annum, because another <lb/> Province has the
                  same, and that this Colony, which is larger in extent of territory than the <lb/>
                  largest of the Provinces, should have $80,000. But the Hon. gentleman must
                  recollect that we <lb/> do not produce revenue equal to what the other Provinces
                  produce. With regard to the limit <lb/> of population for the.] purposes of
                  representation, I think 400,000 is too small ; it ought to have <lb/> been
                  1,000,000, not indefinite, 120,000 gives us the right to have eight members to
                  represent <lb/> us ; this is a matter of expediency. There is a fault in the
                  Resolution to which I will draw <lb/> attention, it is this, that we do not get
                  any increase of Revenue to the Colony until we get <lb/> a population of over
                  120,000 persons. We have to calculate what our Revenue will be now <lb/> under
                  Confederation. and we cannot look for any increase for years to come. Whichever
                  way <lb/> we look at it. the figures come back to the same thing, we want
                  $250,000, and there are several <lb/> ways in which we can get it ; in point of
                  fact we ask Canada to lend us that sum of money. <lb/>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:DECO1">Hon. MR. DECOSMOS</persName>â€”My proposition would give, $650,000 more
                  than the Government <lb/> scheme and set free Internal Revenue for local or
                  municipal purposes. <lb/>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:HELM1">Hon. MR. HELMCKEN</persName>-The Hon. Member wants $150,000 now, and as
                  the population <lb/> increases the sum is to decrease. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:DECO1">Hon. MR. DECOSMOS</persName>-We should always have $150,000, with our

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:HELM1">Hon. MR. HELMCKEN</persName>â€”The long and the short of the story is,
                  that the two propositions <lb/> amount to much the same thing. We go to Canada and
                  say we want $250,000. According to <lb/> this scheme, Canada'will only be out of
                  pocket $128,000. I say that Canada's expenses will <lb/> diminish in two years
                  from this time by $60,000. so that Canada. will only be paying $68,000 <lb/> a
                  year. This is a very low rate of payment, far too low in my opinion. I say, Sir,
                  that if one <lb/> thousand miners go to Peace River this year, our revenue will be
                  increased by $100,000. and <lb/> if Peace River succeeds,"pans out well." as the
                  saying is. I am quite certain that $250,000 <lb/> a year will not purchase this
                  Colony. If Peace River is a failure, Canada may get it. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:HOLB1">The Hon. MR. HOLBROOK</persName> said - Sir, I rise to support the
                  motion of the Hon. Attorney <lb/> General for the adoption of these clauses. I
                  prefer the scheme put forward by the Government <lb/> to that suggested by the
                  Hon. Member for Victoria District; it is more statesmanlike and <lb/> deals with
                  the subject in a larger manner. I agree with the Hon. Member who has just sat
                  <lb/> down (Mr. Helmchen) that there is a great probability of one having a large
                  increase of <lb/> revenue from the Peace River mines. It is impossible at present
                  to form any opinion. beyond <lb/> mere. conjecture, on this head; but still I
                  think we ought to be prepared for the contingency. <lb/> I believe, Sir, that in a
                  short time the Dominion Government will be drawing a large amount <lb/> of revenue
                  from this Colony, probably a million, or a million and a half of dollars, and I am
                  <lb/> of opinion that provision ought to be, made, by which the Province will
                  derive some material <lb/> advantage from that large, increase. The United States
                  Overland Railroad is producing such <lb/> an effect as to turn California's
                  attention to the Pacific Coast I should be glad to see a <lb/> scheme proposed, by
                  which we should get back a part of any such increase of revenue, and if, <lb/> any
                  Hon. Member will bring in an amendment, to secure to us some local advantage out
                  of any <lb/> such prospective increase of revenue, I will support it: failing such
                  amendment, I am prepared <lb/> to support the clause as it stands. <lb/>

                  to support the amend <lb/> ment of my Hon. colleague (Mr. DeCosmos). In my
                  opinion, Sir, the magnificent, bold, and <lb/> statesmanlike scheme propounded by
                  the Hon. Member for Victoria District (Mr. DeCosmos), <lb/> has entirely
                  demolished that of the Government. Hon. gentlemen have said much about Peace <lb/>

                  <fw type="running">CONFEDERATION DEBATE.</fw> River mines, so much, that they
                  would almost lead us to suppose that if Peace River was to <lb/> fail in
                  fulfilling the expectations that seem to have been formed respecting it, the
                  Government <lb/> measure will also be a failure. I say, Sir, that nothing is known
                  about Peace River, which will <lb/> justify any such expectations. It is folly to
                  talk about the revenue to be derived from the <lb/> Peace River mines ; the amount
                  of prospecting in that district has been too trifling to afford <lb/> any data
                  upon which to base even an argument or suggestion, so far as the terms,
                  financially <lb/> speaking, are concerned. I think that the proposition laid down
                  by the Hon. Member for Victoria <lb/> District (Mr. DeCosmos), is worthy of the
                  serious attention and consideration of this House. I <lb/> should like, Sir, to
                  see a scheme carefully laid down, which would involve no subsequent reflec<lb
                     break="no"/>tions and troubles, such as we have seen in Nova Scotia and New
                  Brunswick ; it is better to go <lb/> through all the squabbling and discussion
                  that we have to do in this House now, than leave it <lb/> to involve us in serious
                  trouble hereafter. <lb/>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:BARN1">Hon. Mr. BARNARD</persName>â€”The Hon. Member says that the scheme
                  proposed by the Hon. <lb/> Member for Victoria District has quite demolished that
                  of the Government. I should be glad <lb/> to hear the Hon. Member for Lillooet
                  point out the distinguishing differences between the two <lb/> schemes. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:HUMP1">Hon. Mr. HUMPHREYS</persName>â€”The difference is apparent. I think that 1
                  have said enough to <lb/> show this Council the advantages of the scheme
                  propounded by my Hon. friend ; if Hon. <lb/> Members cannot see differences which
                  are so plain, it is not for me to supply them with brains. <lb/>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:WOOD2">The Hon. Mr. WOOD</persName> saidâ€”Sir., I speak with considerable
                  diffidence upon matters connected <lb/> with finance. It is a subject which I have
                  not made my particular study. The class of observa<lb break="no"/>tions which I
                  shall feel it my duty to make upon these clauses, will be more for the purpose of
                  <lb/> enquiring whether this Council has taken properly inlo consideration the
                  possibility of the <lb/> population of this Colony increasing within ten or
                  fifteen years to 100,000, or about that number, <lb/> if such an increase should
                  take place, with the debt of British Columbia paid off, as it will be. <lb/> by
                  that time, Canada will gain enormously under those terms. Of the prospect of there
                  being <lb/> a large consumption of Canadian goods here, I can say nothing. I do
                  not think it likely that <lb/> the Railway will supersede sea carriage in bulky
                  staples. There are great difficulties connected <lb/> with the transport of any
                  goods, and until the Railway is in operation, I apprehend that the <lb/> bulk of
                  our dry goods will come as heretofore, from Englnnd, whilst that claim of
                     unmanufac<lb break="no"/>tured articles, which we are now importing from
                  America, will still be likely to come into the <lb/> market cheaper than Canadian
                  goods, even though they are subject to a tariff. It is the <lb/> difficulty of
                  transport, our isolation in fact, as the Hon. Attorney-General has stated, and not
                  <lb/> the tariff, which is the real and substantial impediment to trade. I cannot
                  help thinking that <lb/> it is the probable destiny of this Colony to be numbered
                  by hundreds of thousands, rather than <lb/> by millions. This is the ultimate part
                  of the world. We are in this Colony further removed <lb/> from the great centres
                  of civilization than probably any other known portions of the globe ; we <lb/> may
                  almost be called the last country in the world ; and it is probable that only
                  exceptional <lb/> articles of manufacture will come to us from Canada. The
                  consumption of manufactured articles <lb/> imported from England, which can
                  produce every kind of manufactured article cheaper and <lb/> better than Canada,
                  is not likely to decrease. Canada cannot compete with the facilities afforded
                  <lb/> by England and the United States in manufactures. With regard to the
                  advantages to be <lb/> derived by Canada from the terms, I take it that the
                  present population of consumers in British <lb/> Columbia is in reality about
                  25,000, instead of 40,000. As the population increases the Customs <lb/> Revenue,
                  which will always be the main source of income, will increase; the advantage,
                     con<lb break="no"/>sequently, will be entirely on the side of the Dominion ;
                  their profits grow in proportion as our <lb/> population increases, whilst their
                  burdens are becoming less. Customs would increase and <lb/> judicial fees would
                  increase ; in fact, with a population of 100,000, I think I am not far wrong <lb/>
                  in stating, that Canada would take from $800,000 to $1,000,000 from this Colony in
                  the shape <lb/> of Revenue every year, and would leave British Columbia with an
                  increased expenditure neces<lb break="no"/>sary for carrying on the Local
                  Government, without any Corresponding increase of income. The <lb/> clauses
                  proposed show, in my humble opinion, a present temporary and uncertain advantage,
                  <lb/> against a certain and prolonged future loss. <lb/>

                  clauses, and have endeavoured to follow the Hon. <lb/> Member for Victoria

                  <fw type="num">65</fw> think any the less of the Government scheme for the remarks
                  which have fallen from the Hon. <lb/> Member. The scheme proposed by him as an
                  amendment to the financial clauses of the GovernÂ» <lb/> ment, indicate a vast
                  amount or research, calculation, and thought. I congratulate the Hon. <lb/> Member
                  for Victoria District on the vast advance which he has made in the last two years.
                  <lb/> He then only asked for $142,000, inclusive of subsidy and head money. I
                  think, Sir, that the <lb/> Government has hit upon the soundest, best, and most
                  feasible scheme. I consider it a real <lb/> stroke of statesmanship, and am glad
                  to find that the Unofficial Members of the Executive <lb/> Council have added so
                  much to its value. With regard to the number at which it is proposed <lb/> to
                  estimate the population, it is all very well for Hon. Members to say that this is
                  a fiction, but <lb/> there is nothing dishonest in the assumption. If we were
                  going to impose upon the Canadian <lb/> Government it would be dishonest; but we
                  cannot impose upon the Government at Ottawa <lb/> any more than we can upon
                  ourselves. There is a real honest intent. The explanation of the <lb/> Chief
                  Commissioner is fair and satisfactory upon this point. The policy of the scheme
                  proposed <lb/> by the Government is less intricate than that of the Hon. Member
                  for Victoria District; it is <lb/> more businesslike. It is important also as a
                  basis of representation. If we adopt 40,000 as a <lb/> basis of population, we
                  shall only be entitled to a much smaller representation. By fixing the <lb/> basis
                  at 120,000, we give the country a better status abroad, and with the Dominion
                  Government, <lb/> than it could have if the basis were fixed at 40,000. This is
                  where the fiction comes in, if at <lb/> all. Besides. we are upon the brink of
                  great changes, which will enormously increase our <lb/> population. We have every
                  reason to expect our population to be doubled in a very short time. <lb/> The
                  public works which would commence immediately after Confederation will increase it
                  at <lb/> once, and it is fair to put our population up to meet that increase.
                  There is, in my opinion, <lb/> a great deal of reason in the arguments of those
                  who say that as the population of this Colony <lb/> increases the policy of the
                  Dominion will tend to free trade [" No, no." from <persName ref="pers:DECO1">Mr. DeCosmos</persName>], <lb/> and the
                  Canadian Government look forward to the time, and that very shortly, that Internal
                  <lb/> Revenue or Excise will exceed the External Revenue or Customs, and the
                  Customs Revenue of <lb/> this Colony will not increase much above its present
                  standard from the reduction of duties and <lb/> the importation of Canadian goods.
                  Hon. Members may look surprised at this, but I will tell <lb/> them that there are
                  large Canadian houses now in negotiation with merchants of this Colony <lb/>
                  respecting the transmission of goods to this Colony, and I believe that cargoes of
                  Canadian <lb/> goods will come in to this port immediately after Confederation.
                  This will be a relief to us. <lb/> The Revenue from our own Customs will in a few
                  years come to a standstill, or rather, notwith<lb break="no"/>standing the
                  increase of our population, the Revenue will decrease. Looking ahead, it is argued
                  <lb/> by some Hon. Members that these terms look good for the present time, but
                  bad for the future. <lb/> I believe, however, that the bargain about to be made is
                  a good one. Let us, if we can, strengthen <lb/> the hands of the Government in
                  asking more, but let us do nothing to weaken them and compel <lb/> them to take
                  less. We want more money just now. My idea is that the expenses of Local <lb/>
                  Government are set down at a figure which is unnecessarily high. I think the
                  expenses might <lb/> be considerably reduced, and thereby a saving made to the
                  Colony. The subsidy of $35,000 is, <lb/> I think, too small. I will, therefore,
                  move to increase it to $50,000, and to increase the limit <lb/> of representation
                  from 400,000 to 1,000,000. I make this proposition with the more confidence <lb/>
                  because I believe that the Dominion Government will think very little of $15,000,
                  but they might <lb/> think a good deal of the $45,000 which would be necessary to
                  increase the subsidy to $80,000. <lb/> in regard to the mines of this Colony, I
                  think they will be more lasting than some Hon. Members <lb/> predict; and I also
                  differ from those who think that our prosperity depends entirely upon our <lb/>
                  mines. I believe that there is a great future for the Colony. I believe that the
                  mineral resources <lb/> will last our time, and that of our children. I believe,
                  also, that our agricultural resources may <lb/> be developed so as to give us one
                  million of population within twenty years, and that this Colony <lb/> will become
                  of immense importance when the Overland Railway, the true North-West Passage is
                  <lb/> established. I conceive that it is not at all an exaggeration to assume that
                  this Colony will <lb/> have a population of'one million within our lives. With
                  such a climate as we have, and with <lb/> such natural advantages, this Colony has
                  stood still at a marvellous rate. <lb/>

                  Members have said and <lb/> I think with reason, that the policy of the Dominion

                  applied for local purposes. If the inequalities foretold should <lb/> arise, then
                  with such representation as we shall have, we shall have the means of securing
                  <lb/> a due proportion of the surplus. If the Canadian Government do not give us a
                  fair share, <lb/> we will force it from them. We shall be strong enough even with
                  the number of Representatives <lb/> proposed by these Resolutions. If the
                  population really increases, as it is said it will, we shall <lb/> have a vast
                  representation. As regards the Indian population, it is roughly estimated by the
                  <lb/> Vicar-General at 60.000. <lb/>

                  <persName ref="pers:DRAK1">The Hon. MR. DRAKE</persName>, Junior Member for Victoria City, said
                  :â€”Sir, I do not think that <lb/> the advantages to Canada have been fairly put; it
                  has been said that the sum of $35,000 is an <lb/> arbitrary sum similar to the
                  subsidy allowed to Newfoundland. From the expenses of carrying <lb/> on the
                  Government of this Colony in proportion to the expense of the Government of New<lb
                     break="no"/>foundland, in comparison to the population. I say that the sum is
                  out of proportion and too <lb/> small for the requirements of this Colony. I would
                  put it up to $70,000. Canada will receive, <lb/> after paying subsidies and
                  expenses, $128,000. Canada will no doubt fund the debt at a smaller <lb/> rate of
                  interest. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:TRUT1">Hon. CHIEF COMMISSIONER</persName>â€”Canada cannot fund it at less. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:DRAK1">Hon. MR. DRAKE</persName>â€”It is a matter of assertion, but I am of
                  opinion that she will, and with <lb/> the payment of debts in five years, Canada
                  will pay out about $53,000 only a year, therefore <lb/> I move a recommendation to
                  the Governor that " $70,000 " be inserted in the conditions, instead <lb/> of "
                  $35,000." <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:TRUT1">The Hon. CHIEF COMMISSIONER</persName>, said :â€”Mr. Chairman, I shall be
                  glad, speaking for <lb/> myself as an individual member of this House, to accept
                  any reasonable suggestion, and <lb/> shall not oppose the recommendation of the
                  Hon. Member for New Westminster. With refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the amount of
                  our debt, the Government scheme gives the Colony the full benefit of <lb/> the
                  debts to come in. I say that the debt of British Columbia, after Confederation,
                  cannot <lb/> be funded, or the greater part of it cannot, for this reason, the
                  debt is payable in Debentures <lb/> which fall due at certain dates. After
                  Confederation the price of Debentures will go up, and <lb/> Canada can get no
                  further benefit by funding, except as regards the Floating Debt. With <lb/> regard
                  to the remark of the Hon. Mr. Wood, who says the Resolution is framed with
                  reference <lb/> to present gain and future loss, I say we may wait and the horse
                  may starve while the grass <lb/> is growing. When we enter Confederation we must
                  do so in the expectation that we shall <lb/> participate in all the advantages of
                  Confederation; any increase of revenue or population will <lb/> bring its share to
                  us; we must believe that Canada will deal fairly with us. Now, Sir, I <lb/>
                  followed the Hon. Member for Victoria District through his figures when he
                  propounded his <lb/> new scheme, and I must say that I am better pleased with the
                  Government measure than I <lb/> was before; ours comes out on a stronger basis
                  than before, in contradistinction to his. By <lb/> his scheme he proposes to ask a
                  clear gift; we ask much the same amount, but show the grounds. <lb/> The Hon.
                  Member has based his argument on assumption more than the Government have. <lb/>
                  It is wrong to look upon the estimate of population as a fiction, it is not so. it
                  is based upon <lb/> calculation. Call it an expediency if you will, but it is no
                  fiction. He seems to treat British <lb/> Columbia as if it were an estate to be
                  parted with for a <hi rendition="simple:italic">quid pro quo</hi>, which is not a
                  fair way <lb/> of treating the subject. If Canada sends us goods she will derive
                  greater advantages from <lb/> doing so than we shall, but nevertheless we shall
                  participate. When our population increases <lb/> rates of taxation will be
                  reduced; a lower tariff. cheaper manufactured goods, and lower rents, <lb/> are
                  amongst the advantages that I look for out of Confederation. With regard to the
                  Road <lb/> Tolls, I look upon it as essential that they should be kept up to meet
                  the expenses of main<lb break="no"/>taining the roads and keeping them in repair.
                  It has been a question, and perhaps it is still <lb/> open for debate, whether the
                  care and maintenance of the Main Trunk Road should not be <lb/> thrown upon the
                  Dominion Government; if we regard the road as military work necessary for <lb/>
                  the defence of the country, its maintenance may fairly be a charge upon the
                  federal revenue. <lb/> I think we shall be in a better position to uphold the
                  terms after this discussion. I. believe <lb/> that our future will be speedily
                  prosperous, and I am quite satisfied that the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment
                  should share in our prosperity. It will not do for us to depreciate our own future
                  <lb/> prospects. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:HELM1">Hon. MR. HELMECKEN</persName>â€”I have not much to say in favour of
                  Canada, but this much I will <lb/> say: if British Columbia prospers by reason of
                  Canada's works and capital, surely Canada has <lb/> a right to an ample share of
                  the increased Customs Revenue which will be so produced. <lb/>

 <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:DECO1">Hon. Mr. DECOSMOS</persName>â€”Mr. Chairman, the credit of the Government
                  proposition now before <lb/> us has been given to the Hon. Member for Victoria
                  (Mr. Helmcken). Now, Sir, I am perfectly <lb/> content that he should enjoy the
                  credit, and the whole credit. In speaking briefly he has <lb/> quoted a word used
                  by myselfâ€”"Expediency." Now, I again say that the whole thing is a <lb/> matter of
                  expediency. I have not heard anything, however, either from that Hon. gentleman
                  <lb/> or others who followed me, to disturb the solid foundation of my scheme,
                  resting as it does <lb/> on truth and fact. and a plain out-spoken statement of
                  our monetary requirements. I have <lb/> always said that this question of
                  Confederation was one of a monetary characterâ€”that it <lb/> had a money value, and
                  I maintain, as l have always done, without shadow of turning. that <lb/> we ought
                  to have a surplus revenue of about $200,000 on entering the Dominion. I have
                  always <lb/> said that we must have that surplus, or its equivalent, with
                  Confederation, or else no Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. That is the point round
                  which I have been revolving. I have made no stride in advance, <lb/> none to the
                  rear, the Hon. gentleman opposite to the contrary. I have ever kept before the
                  <lb/> public the same idea, that when the terms of union were negotiated, they
                  must bring that sum <lb/> in a surplus revenue into our Treasury. It was a simple
                  point that every one could under<lb break="no"/>stand and not forget. It is the
                  sum that I asked at first; it is the sum that I ask now; and <lb/> it is the sum
                  that I propose now in amendment to the Resolution of the Government. The <lb/>
                  real surplus in the Government scheme is so far below what it ought to be, that it
                  will be <lb/> repudiated as an absolute failure, if ever it comes before the
                  people for ratification. They will <lb/> reject it. It will create just as much
                  dissatisfaction here as there was felt in Nova Scotia. I <lb/> will now, Sir, as I
                  promised, move the following as a recommendation to His Excellency, and <lb/> in
                  substitution of Resolutions 2 and 3:- <lb/>
               </p>
            <p>1. That the Council recommend to His Excellency the Governor, the following Resolutions 
     <lb/>
     for his consideration:â€”2. The population of British Columbia shall be estimated at 40,000. 
     <lb/>
     3. The following sums shall be paid semiannually by Canada to British Columbia for the 
     <lb/>
     support of the Local Government and Legislature. to wit:â€”'An annual grant of $80,000, and 
     <lb/>
     a further sum of 80 cents a head per annum of the population, both payable half yearly in 
     <lb/>
     advance, the population of British Columbia being estimated as aforesaid. Such grant of 80 
     <lb/>
     cents per head to be augmented till the population shall be shown to be One Million, at which 
     <lb/>
     number it shall thereafter remain. Canada shall also pay to British Columbia, in semi-annual 
     <lb/>
     advances, the sum of $150,000 per annum, which shall from time to time be reduced in proportion 
     <lb/>
     as the population may exceed 40,000.

            <p>
                  <persName ref="pers:ROBS1">Hon. Member for New Westminster</persName>â€”I object to the basis of

                  time be prepared to give my assent and <lb/> support to any sensible
                  recommendations that are proposed. It strikes me that the Resolution <lb/> of the
                  Hon. Member for Victoria District (Mr. DeCosmos) is based on proper grounds. It is
                  <lb/> a mistake to say that the allowance for representation is based on a
                  fictitious estimate of <lb/> population. The Executive Council must have estimated
                  it on the area and extent of the Colony. <lb/> I believe that our representation
                  would accord with the recommendation of the Hon. Member <lb/> for Victoria
                  District. I do not think that Canada is advancing in the direction of free trade.
                  <lb/> Her advance is more likely, in my opinion, to be towards protection. I have
                  no doubt that <lb/> Confederation will open the door for Canadian goods to be
                  brought in. I have no hesitation <lb/> in voting for a larger subsidy, because I
                  believe that in a few years, from the increase in our <lb/> revenue, Canada will
                  have very little to pay, and in the Government Resolutions there is no <lb/>
                  suggestion for any refund from Canada, if the Customs Duties should amount to a
                  very large <lb/> sum. I shall, therefore, vote for the Resolutions, but I shall
                  support the recommendation of <lb/> the Hon. Member for Victoria District, because
                  I consider that it is grounded on common sense. <lb/>

                  particularly the estimate of 120,000. New Brunswick, with <lb/> a population of
                  250,000, is entitled to fifteen members in the Dominion House of Commons. <lb/> If
                  the basis of representation is to be taken from population, then 40,000 would only
                  entitle <lb/> us to two members in the House of Commons, instead of eight. For
                  that reason, in my opinion, <lb/> if for no other, 120,000 ought to stand.
                  Besides, as a matter of fact, our population exceeds <lb/> 40,000. There is not an
                  Indian in the Colony who does not contribute as much to the revenue <lb/> as a

            <p>
     Committee sat at a quarter-past one. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Hon. ATTORNEY GENERAL moved the adoption of Clause 4:<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <p>"4. The Dominion shall guarantee Interest at the rate of 5 per centum per annum on 
     <lb/>
     "such sum, not exceeding Â£100,000, as may he required for the construction of a first-class 
     <lb/>
     " Graving Dock at Esquimalt." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     He said :â€”It is pretty generally known that a company was started for the construction 
     <lb/>
     of a Graving Dock at Esquimalt, and that negotiations with that object in view had taken 
     <lb/>
     place under a former administration; but although both the Admirals and Governor Seymour 
     <lb/>
     had reported in favour of it, the thing had fallen through. owing to the inability of the company 
     <lb/>
     to obtain the necessary funds. They were, only able to get a small loan in aid from the 
     <lb/>
     Admiralty. The Dominion guarantee of 5 per cent. on Â£100,000 sterling, with a prospect of 
     <lb/>
     ultimate profits from the undertaking itself, will, it is believed, secure the whole amount of 
     <lb/>
     capital required, which has been variously estimated ; but from preliminary surveys and investi<lb break="no"/>gations which have been made, the sum of Â£100,000 is deemed sufficient, and there is little 
     <lb/>
     doubt that if a company can get a guarantee for that amount, they can carry out the under<lb break="no"/>taking on the largest practicable scale. I am aware that some opposition has been expressed 
     <lb/>
     to the locality ; but it is to be supported on general grounds. It will be general to the whole 
     <lb/>
     Colony. Â£100,000 cannot be spent in any part of the Colony without benefiting the rest of 
     <lb/>
     it. The Navy are at Esquimalt. Esquimalt is the first port which ocean ships reach when 
     <lb/>
     they want repair. and the last point they leave when they receive sailing orders. Captain 
     <lb/>
     Richards, and all the Admiral from first to last, have reported in favour of Esquimalt for a 
     <lb/>
     dock. Without Admiralty patronage and aid the thing could not succeed. Another advantage 
     <lb/>
     in a dock would be, that it would enable us to utilize our great white elephant, the dredger. 
     <lb/>
     As to any opposition to the locality for Burrard Inlet and New Westminster, though as much 
     <lb/>
     interested as any Hon. Member round this Board in those places, I must say that they already 
     <lb/>
     have the larger share of benefit from the terms ; for in my opinion the Overland Railway must 
     <lb/>
     follow down the main artery of the Colony. Fraser River. and have its terminus either at New 
     <lb/>
     Westminster or Burrard Inlet. Therefore, on public grounds, and because I believe that it will 
     <lb/>
     be a public benefit. I support the establishment of a Graving Dock at Esquimalt.
