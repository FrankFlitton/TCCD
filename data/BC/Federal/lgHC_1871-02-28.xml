            <p>
     Hon. Mr. CONNELL (whose remarks were very indistinctly 
     
     heard in the reporter’s gallery) referred to a mistake which had been 
     
     made in the report of his speech yesterday with regard to the 
     
     settlement of accounts between New Brunswick and the Dominion. 
     
     He had been represented as saying that “it would be necessary to 
     
     get an alteration of the Union Act.” He would not like to have it go 
     
     abroad to his constituents that he had made such an absurd 
     
     statement. He had no wish to have the Union Act disturbed for a 
     
     settlement of the accounts between New Brunswick and the 
     
     Dominion. He had no doubt that a just and equitable arrangement 
     
     would be made.

    <head> THE ELECTION LAW </head>
     
   
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir GEORGE-É. CARTIER introduced a bill to make 
     
     temporary provision for the election of members for the House of 
     
    <fw type="num">67</fw>
     Commons. (<hi rendition="simple:italic">Hear, hear from the Opposition</hi>.) He expected that his 
     
     hon. friends opposite would say “hear, hear” at the very mention 
     
     of the measure. He would explain that since we were about to have 
     
     another province comprised in this Dominion, it was obvious that 
     
     the government could not yet enact a law to affect all the provinces 
     
     of the Dominion, as far as the representation of this House was 
     
     concerned. The circumstances of Manitoba having been recently 
     
     admitted into the Union and British Columbia being on the eve of 
     
     joining the Confederation, had led the Government to the 
     
     conclusion that it would be better to carry on the next election for 
     
     the Dominion under the laws as they now prevail in the several 
     
     provinces. (<hi rendition="simple:italic">Hear, hear from the Opposition</hi>.) He might state that the 
     
     bill too, contained a provision with regard to the number of days on 
     
     which elections were to take place. This Bill provided that the 
     
     elections should take place on one day. (<hi rendition="simple:italic">Hear, hear</hi>.) 
     
    </p>
            <!--Milestone merged into previous para.-->
            <!--Para "
     Commons. (Hear, hear from the Opposition.) He expected that his 
     
   ..." merged into previous para.-->
   
            <p>
     Mr. BLAKE said that aﬁer two permanent Electoral Bills had 
     
     been passed, the House was now asked to enact a temporary one. 
     
     Last session one had been passed, the session before the House had 
     
     passed one, and now they were asked to deal with another one. The 
     
     hon. gentleman had explained that the reason why he now 
     
     submitted this temporary measure, was because of the introduction 
     
     of the new Provinces into Confederation. At what period since the 
     
     lst July, 1867, was not the House favoured with the news that new 
     
     Provinces were to be added? Every day they were told they were 
     
     coming in, though they didn’t come. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir FRANCIS HlNCKS: Yes! yes! 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BLAKE: And yet the Hon. Minister of Militia had asserted 
     
     that it was in view of these additions to the Dominion that this 
     
     temporary Act was provided. Last session the Opposition had 
     
     pointed out the effect that the new measure then submitted would 
     
     have in the East and in the West. They had shown that it would be 
     
     impossible to work it in Manitoba, and that difﬁculties would arise 
     
     in other Provinces too. But they were told that their arguments were 
     
     fallacious, and that the Union would overcome all the difﬁculties 
     
     which were then deprecated. He was glad to hear that, taught by 
     
     experience, they had admitted the truth of the arguments then 
     
     advanced by the Opposition, that it was necessary to respect the 
     
     views of the different Provinces on the subject and by degrees as 
     
     they became more acquainted with the franchise laws of other 
     
     countries, the Government had made some approach towards 
     
     providing for a common franchise for the Dominion. He was not 
     
     surprised that it was merely a temporary Act. It would be coming 
     
     down too far to propose as a permanent Act what they opposed so 
     
     consistently before, but, he had no doubt that it would contain for 
     
     some years to come the principle at the base of our Parliamentary 
     
     representation, founded on the motion of the hon. member for 
     
    <pb n="068" facs="final/images/BC_H_of_C_18710228_Page_068.jpg"/>

     Hochelaga, that the franchise should be for the Dominion the same 
     
     as by law established for each of the Provinces. (<hi rendition="simple:italic">Hear, hear</hi>.)

            <p>
     Hon. Sir GEORGE-É. CARTIER said he did not intend to 
     
     discuss the measure at this moment, but he felt it to be his duty to 
     
     answer some of the observations made by the hon. gentleman 
     
     opposite. The Manitoba measure was submitted to the House as the 
     
     result of the negotiations carried on between the Dominion of 
     
     Canada and the gentlemen sent as delegates from Manitoba. No one 
     
     knew at the close of last session that Manitoba would certainly be a 
     
     member of the Confederation. There was no necessity or intention 
     
     at the outset that Manitoba should form a province and be 
     
     comprised in the Confederation. It was intended that it should be a 
     
     Crown colony, and that very reason induced the Government at the 
     
     time to withdraw the Bill. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BLAKE: Hear, hear! 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir GEORGE-E. CARTIER: Then with regard to the 
     
     remarks of the hon. member for Lambton, he would say that the Bill 
     
     was proposed last year as there was no hope that we should have 
     
     British Columbia so soon. Every one expected of course, that 
     
     sooner or later that colony would be comprised as one of the sister 
     
     colonies in the Dominion. It would be useless at the close of this 
     
     Parliament, with one Province just admitted and another shortly to 
     
     be admitted into the Confederation, to endeavour to assimilate the 
     
     laws. They could not make a law now which would apply to British 
     
     Columbia. He hoped his hon. friend would take with a better feeling 
     
     the good intention of the Government in adopting this course. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The Bill was read a ﬁrst time.

     of my elevation to the Peerage.

     The expression of your acquiescence in the favourable view

     is highly to be valued, as conveying the good opinion of the freely

     The North West Territories already added to the Confederation 
     
     and the willing accession of British Columbia, which, it is to be 
     
     hoped, will shortly take effect, as they extend your bounds, so they 
     
     proportionately augment the cares and responsibilities of those who 
     
     are in the high places of the land', but the legislature and people of 
     
     the Dominion will, I feel persuaded, prove equal to the lofty task, 
     
     the vast and varied interests throughout the wide domain will be 
     
     safe in their charge and gradually cemented into one compact and
