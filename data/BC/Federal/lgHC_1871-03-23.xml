    <head>BRITISH COLUMBIA DEBATES</head>
     
     
            <p>Hon. Sir GEORGE-E. CARTIER announced that the 
     Government had made no further arrangement for special reports of 
     the debates on the British Columbia measure. 
     <fw type="num">247</fw>
     Hon. Sir A.T. GALT said he was sorry that the Government had 
     
     arrived at that conclusion, for the debates would be particularly 
     
     interesting to British Columbia, and would not reach there in as full 
     
     a form as they would otherwise have done had his suggestion been 
     
     adopted. He trusted that the energy usually displayed by the reports 
     
     would on this occasion supplement the necessity that would exist 
     
     for full reports. 
     
    </p>

            <p>
     Mr. JONES (Leeds North and Grenville North) believed the 
     
     Government deserved credit for the decision to which they had 
     
     come. He was about to proceed further, when 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The SPEAKER called him to order. There was no question 
     
     before the House. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. JONES (Leeds North and Grenville North) thought he 
     
     had as good a right to speak on the subject as other hon. gentlemen. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The SPEAKER explained that a minister of the Crown had 
     
     simply answered a question put on a former occasion by the hon. 
     
     member for Sherbrooke, and there the matter should drop. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. JONES (Leeds North and Grenville North) said he was 
     
     sorry to be obliged to resort to extreme measures, but he had a 
     
     precedent for it only the other day. He moved the adjournment of 
     
     the House. (<hi rendition="simple:italic">Laughter</hi>) He continued at some length to explain that 
     
     he was elected on the Independent ticket, and though he might have 
     
     erred in judgment, he had always endeavoured to preserve economy 
     
     in the administration of public affairs. (At this point the hon. 
     
     gentleman’s voice became inaudible, owing to the slamming of 
     
     desks and other noises in the House resorted to, to silence him.) He 
     
     did not approve of going to any additional expense in the British 
     
     Columbia matter. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The SPEAKER suggested that it would be as well to postpone 
     
     the discussion until the British Columbia Bill should be before the 
     
     House. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. JONES (Leeds North and Grenville North) bowed to the 
     
     opinion of the Speaker, and withdrew his motion. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. RYMAL rose to reply to some remarks made by the hon. 
     
     member for Leeds and Grenville, with respect to his (Mr. Rymal’s) 
     
     course in Parliament. The hon. member had seen ﬁt to take him 
     
     (Mr. Rymal) to task and would fain make the House believe that he 
     
     would encourage extravagance in the administration of public 
     
    <pb n="248" facs="final/images/BC_H_of_C_18710323_Page_248.jpg"/>
               <fw type="running">COMMONS DEBATES</fw>
               <fw type="num">248</fw>
     affairs. He (Mr. Rymal) believed that his course would show that he 
     
     had advocated economy whenever it was in the interest of the 
     
     public, and he had no desire that every man’s utterances should be 
     
     fully reported in the case. He had no desire that a column should be 
     
     given to his own speech, though the hon. member for Leeds might. 
     
     Whether that hon. gentleman was reported in the regular way or 
     
     not, he (Mr. Rymal) could not say, but he had frequently noticed 
     
     that if the hon. member only spoke for ﬁve minutes in the House, a 
     
     column report of it, at least, appeared in the papers. (<hi rendition="simple:italic">Laughter</hi>) No 
     
     doubt the hon. member engaged a special reporter to record his wise 
     
     sayings. As for the charge of inconsistency and want of 
     
     independence, he (Mr. Rymal) left it to those who had known them 
     
     to say whether he or the hon. member for Leeds was the more 
     
     deserving of the charge. The hon. member’s course had been what 
     
     Wm. Lyon Mackenzie had said of such members—that those who 
     
     boasted of independence in the House were those who never could 
     
     be depended on. (<hi rendition="simple:italic">Laughter</hi>)

     Mr. FORBES asked whether, in view of the business between

     intention of the Government to increase the mail accommodation

     ST. CLAIR FLATS CANAL

     On the order for Mr. Mackenzie’s resolution for the

     Government at St. Clair Flat,

     Mr. MACKENZIE said the ﬁrst Minister of the Crown had

     if that correspondence could be brought down now. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir GEORGE-E. CARTIER said it would not be

     correspondence. The correspondence was still going on between the 
     
     Canadian and Imperial Governments and the Government of the 
     
     United States. He hoped the hon. gentleman would accept his 
     
     declaration, that it would not be in the public interest to bring any of 
     
     it down. </p>

     Mr. BLAKE moved that this House do resolve itself into a

     1. That the sense of the Houses of the respective Legislatures of 
     
     the Provinces <hi rendition="simple:italic">Canada</hi>, <hi rendition="simple:italic">Nova Scotia</hi> and <hi rendition="simple:italic">New Brunswick</hi> was taken 
     
     as to, and formed the basis of the Imperial Legislation under which 
     
     the said Provinces were federally united into the Dominion of 
     
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Canada</hi>. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     2. That it was by the <hi rendition="simple:italic">British North America Act</hi> (1867) enacted 
     
     that it should be lawful for the Queen, by and with the advice of the 
     
     Privy Council, on Addresses from the Houses of Parliament of 
     
     <hi rendition="simple:italic">Canada</hi>, to admit <hi rendition="simple:italic">Rupert ’s Land</hi> and the North Western Territory, 
     
     or either of them, into the Union by the said Act created, on such 
     
     terms and conditions as the Queen should think fit to approve 
     
     subject to the provisions of the said Act; and that the provisions of 
     
     any such Order in Council should have effect as if they had been 
     
     enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     3. That Addresses have been passed by both Houses of 
     
     Parliament of <hi rendition="simple:italic">Canada</hi> touching the admission of the said Territories

     liabilities in order to accomplish such admission, and an Order in 
     
     Council has been made by the Queen for such admission. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     4. That the Parliament of <hi rendition="simple:italic">Canada</hi> has assumed to exercise

     and for the establishment of federal relations between the said 
     
     Provinces and <hi rendition="simple:italic">Canada</hi>. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     5. That it has been made to appear to this House that the 
     
     Canadian Government has requested the Government of the United 
     
     Kingdom to submit to the Parliament of the United Kingdom a Bill 
     
     touching the said North Western Territories or some part thereof', 
     
     and that the Government of the United Kingdom in consequence of 
     
     such request has proposed to the Canadian Government to submit a 
     
     Bill, a draft of which it has forwarded to the Canadian Government. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     6. That in the opinion of this House the sense of both Houses of 
     
     the Parliament of <hi rendition="simple:italic">Canada</hi> should be taken as to and should form the 
     
     basis of such proposed Legislation. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BLAKE said that he proposed in these resolutions to
