               Her Majesty’s Government has decided upon referring the 
               <br />
               Fishery question, along with other questions pending between the

               <br />

               <br />
               the various matters in controversy will, I trust, lead to their 
               <br />

               <br />
               address of His Excellency tomorrow. It was desirable on so 
               <br />
               important a matter, if there was any correspondence relative to the 
               <br />
               appointment of the Joint High Commission that the House should 
               <br />

               discussing it during the debate tomorrow. It was a matter of far too 
               <br />
               much importance to this country, looking at it simply as one 
               <br />
               respecting our national rights, that the House should pass durnbly

               some extent, at least, the questions that everyone could see were 
               <br />
               involved in it. The Commission, for anything they might know to 
               <br />
               the contrary, might adopt some course that this Parliament might 
               <br />
               not think consistent with the national interests in this Dominion', 
               <br />

               <br />
               expression of the opinion of public men in the country should be

               Hon. Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD said it was not the intention
