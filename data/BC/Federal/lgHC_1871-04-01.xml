     Mr. CURRIER introduced a Bill to incorporate the Dominion 
     
     Construction Co. The Bill was read a first time and referred to the

     Bill respecting Insurance companies.

            <p>
     Mr. BLAKE objected to the measure, as limiting the class of 
     
     securities to be deposited with the Government. He also objected to 
     
     establishing a system of inspection. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir FRANCIS HlNCKS assured the hon. member that 
     
     there was no disposition to limit the class of securities, but, on the 
     
     contrary, to relieve companies of the necessity of depositing cash 
     
     with the Government.

     Hon. Sir GEORGE-E. CARTIER moved the second reading of 
     
     the Address to Her Majesty for the union of British Columbia with 
     
     the Dominion.

     Mr. MACKENZIE did not propose to reply to the speeches of 
     
     the hon. members opposite delivered last night. They extended over 
     
     a good space of time, but there was nothing in them. He merely 
     
     wished to enter his protest against the extraordinary address now 
     
     about to be read a second time. He, therefore, moved the following: 
     
    <fw type="num">315</fw>
     “Resolved that this House, while willing to give its best 
     
     consideration to any reasonable terms of union with British 
     
     Columbia, is of opinion that the terms embodied in the said address 
     
     are so unreasonable, and so unjust to Canada, that this House 
     
     should not agree thereto.”

            <p>
     Hon. Mr. TUPPER said he had not taken any part in the debates 
     
     on this subject so far. He had listened with mingled pain and 
     
     pleasure to the speeches of hon. members. He had heard with pain 
     
     old friends of Confederation opposing this union movement. He 
     
     defended the policy of the Government at considerable length, 
     
     arguing that everything conspired to favor the construction of the 
     
     Pacific Railway. While the United States had to contend against 
     
     great natural difficulties in pushing their railways to the Pacific, the 
     
     territory through which the Canadian route would lie, was of great 
     
     natural fertility, and presented comparatively few engineering 
     
     difficulties to the construction of a railway. It gave us a pass 
     
     through the Rocky Mountains 2,000 feet lower than the best pass 
     
     through that chain on American territory. The hon. member for 
     
     Lambton had endeavored to show that the route from Nipissing to 
     
     Fort Garry was an almost impassable wilderness. Only last session 
     
     the hon. member had taken a very different view of the question 
     
     and had stated that the very best route to the west lay through 
     
     Canadian territory North of Lakes Huron and Superior. The hon. 
     
     gentleman could not say that he had heard anything to present the 
     
     matter in a different light. There were then, all these favourable 
     
     circumstances to aid this great enterprise, but in addition to all that, 
     
     the route once opened would place Canton and Liverpool 1,000 
     
     miles nearer than by any other line of communication that could be 
     
     found. The hon. member had pleaded for delay in order to submit 
     
     this question to the people, but the hon. gentleman had taken the 
     
     ground on a former occasion that Parliament, representing the 
     
     people, could act for them in a case like this. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. MACKENZIE said this was a very different matter. When 
     
     the Confederation scheme was first mooted he (Mr. Mackenzie) 
     
     went before his constituents and presented the matter to them in 
     
     twenty speeches held in different parts of his constituency and told 
     
     them that if they were not favourable to Confederation they might 
     
     elect some one who would oppose it in Parliament, he would not. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. TUPPER admitted that the honourable member for 
     
     Lambton was an important member of the House, and honoured the 
     
     intelligent electors who sent him to Parliament, but he did not 
     
     represent the whole people, and the Confederation scheme was not 
     
     submitted to the country generally. But this question had been 
     
     submitted to the people of British Columbia and the terms had been 
     
     accepted by them. It was not new to the people of Canada. Six 
     
     months ago the Toronto <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> had published the terms and they 
     
    <pb n="316" facs="final/images/BC_H_of_C_18710401_316.jpg"/>
               <fw type="num">COMMONS DEBATES</fw>
               <fw type="num">316</fw>
     had appeared in other leading papers. No objections were urged 
     
     against them that he had heard of, till now. He did not believe the 
     
     people were so wanting in intelligence that they would silently 
     
     submit to terms which did not meet their approval without 
     
     protesting against them. When a small question of duties came 
     
     before this Parliament, the people who disapproved of them 
     
     petitioned against them, and the Press generally discussed the 
     
     question very thoroughly. It was absurd, therefore, in the face of 
     
     these facts to say that the people were taken by surprise on this 
     
     question, or that the scheme met with their disapproval. But if this 
     
     House had accepted the position which the hon. members of the 
     
     opposition wished to force the country into, they would bring 
     
     discredit on this country which would probably be fraught with 
     
     consequences which might be irreparable.

     The hon. member for Sherbrooke had raised a question as to how 
     
     far this enterprise lay within our means. The hon. member had done 
     
     better justice to the position of the Dominion in a former speech in 
     
     which he had depicted the prosperity which Confederation had 
     
     brought upon the country. It showed that the hon. member who first 
     
     presented Confederation in a tangible shape, in the year 1858, had 
     
     spoken with prophetic zeal when he referred to it as the great means 
     
     of elevating them, not only in the political, but in the financial and 
     
     commercial scale. The friends of Union might proudly point to the 
     
     present position of the Dominion as irrefragable proof of the 
     
     correctness of that statement for the prophecy had been more than 
     
     realized. The Confederation was but a movement of yesterday, and 
     
     the result already was a large surplus in the treasury after meeting 
     
     all the Dominion engagements that the necessities of the Local 
     
     Governments required, but the Government of this Dominion could 
     
     come down, and not only point to the prosperity of every one of its 
     
     component parts, but at the same time, show that this Dominion 
     
     had entered on a career of ﬁnancial prosperity hitherto unknown to 
     
     Canada. If this had been the result in the past, what might we not 
     
     expect in the future? Two years ago the hon. member for 
     
     Sherbrooke, in his criticism on the budget speech, had complained 
     
     of what was not in it, rather than of what it did contain, and had said 
     
     that some provision should have been made for opening up the 
     
     North West. He (Hon. Mr. Tupper) thought the Government 
     
     deserved credit rather than censure for having adopted the 
     
     suggestion. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     In reply to the objections of the hon. member for Lambton about 
     
     the cost of the proposed railway, he referred to the fact that its 
     
     construction would be undertaken by a private company. No one 
     
     had disputed the necessity of providing means of communication 
     
     with the North West in order to settle it, yet hon. gentlemen 
     
     opposite complained that large grants of land should be made to any 
     
     company undertaking the construction of a railway. Yet it was only 
     
     by means of a railway that the country could ever be settled, and the 
     
     Dominion could give infinitely better land for the purpose than the 
     
     United States had offered or could now offer to American 
     
     companies. The reservation of large blocks of lands, which would 
     
     be greatly enhanced in value through the construction of this 
     
     railway, would enable the Government to cover largely any outlay 
     
     they should be called on to make. Confederation had changed the 
     
    <fw type="dateline">April 1, 1871</fw>
            <!--Milestone merged into previous para.-->
            <!--Para "
     April 1, 1871 
     
    ..." merged into previous para.-->
   
       
     whole story of financial deficit, and had enabled the Government 
     
     the other day, partly without their consent, to reduce the taxation of 
     
     the country by $1,000,000—thus, too, at a time when they were 
     
     constructing the lntercolonial and other kindred works and 
     
     preparing to improve the canal system of the country—without 
     
     embarrassing the Government. He believed, also, that if this railway 
     
     were built, the Northern Pacific road would either be abandoned or 
     
     become a branch of the Canadian Pacific. It could never compete 
     
     with our line, running as it did through a much less fertile country 
     
     than our North West, and lying between our line and the Central 
     
     Pacific route. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     This union was a question of such magnitude, when regarded in 
     
     the light of the status it was going to give to this Dominion that it 
     
     naturally tempted him to descant upon it. He believed God and 
     
     nature had placed it in the power of this Parliament to take up this 
     
     question and give us advantages in connection with becoming the 
     
     great highway of communication, not only across this continent, but 
     
     between Europe and Asia. The Government would be recreant to 
     
     their trust if they failed to meet the wishes of this country as 
     
     expressed by the majority in this Parliament and carry it forward to 
     
     a successful issue. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. SCATCHERD was surprised to find that in the debate on 
     
     the present question there was less enthusiasm than was shown on 
     
     the first scheme of Confederation. He complained that only one 
     
     party to this compact, the people of British Columbia had had an 
     
     opportunity of pronouncing on this subject, while the greater party 
     
     of the people of Canada had received no such opportunity. Already 
     
     we had the lntercolonial Railway on our hands, for which we had 
     
     had to submit to increased expenditure and taxation. Yet we were 
     
     told that a larger and more difficult work would not add to our 
     
     burdens. A more monstrous and unreasonable proposition was 
     
     never urged than this vast road could be built without increasing the 
     
     burdens of the people. He held that Confederation so far had not 
     
     proved the success predicted. In various sections there were 
     
     jealousy, ill-feeling and discontent in relation to this Union and 
     
     three sections, Nova Scotia, Quebec and Manitoba might be cited in 
     
     support of his theory that Confederation had not been very 
     
     satisfactory. He saw no difference between the position of the 
     
     minority in 1865, and that of the minority now. The conduct of the 
     
     Government was as unreasonable and arbitrary now as then. He 
     
     believed this scheme would but add to difficulties and taxation on 
     
     the country, and that its ill effects would be felt for 50 years. 
     
     Holding these opinions he would vote for the amendment. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. HUNTINGTON said he was prepared and desirous to 
     
     see this scheme of Confederation carried to a magnificent success, 
     
     and that he was prepared to go quite as far as the hon. member for 
     
     Cumberland, or indeed any one, in the great scheme of 
     
     Confederation, but while he claimed credit for earnestly and 
     
     sincerely entertaining the desire to consummate successfully that 
     
     great scheme, he could not shut his eyes to the fact that, 
     
     Confederation was not a machine that would run without winding, 
     
     but that it contained many details which from time to time required 
     
     serious consideration. When the Dominion Parliament had first 
     
    <pb n="317" facs="final/images/BC_H_of_C_18710401_317.jpg"/>
               <fw type="running">COMMONS DEBATES</fw>
               <fw type="dateline">April 1, 1871</fw>

     assembled, the obligations of the country had been largely 
     
     increased, and now all at once the whole debt of the country was to 
     
     be doubled. Surely this was a serious matter, and even the Hon. 
     
     Minister of Militia had termed it a “big job” though he had 
     
     afterwards tried to make it a very little job. It was useless to say that 
     
     the country would not be expected to accomplish impossibilities, 
     
     and that no burden would be added to the people, for when they had 
     
     entered into a compact, they must carry out their promise, and when 
     
     they went to England to raise money they would find this obligation 
     
     considered a charge on the credit of the country. Notwithstanding 
     
     the glowing terms in which the grandeur of Confederation had been 
     
     depicted, the fact still remained that the debt had first been 
     
     increased fifty per cent and now it was sought to be doubled. 
     
    </p>
            <!--Milestone merged into previous para.-->         <!--Milestone merged into previous para.-->         <!--Milestone merged into previous para.-->         <!--Milestone merged into previous para.-->

            <p>
     He maintained, however, that the measure of Confederation had 
     
     been carried, not by the Government but in consequence of the 
     
     loyal respect of the people for the policy of the Imperial 
     
     Government which was known to favor the scheme, and now the 
     
     Government was breaking away if not from Imperial policy at least 
     
     from Imperial aid, in proposing to carry out the work of 
     
     communication alone and unassisted. If it had been the duty and the 
     
     policy of the Imperial Government to aid the construction of the 
     
     Intercolonial Railway it was a hundred fold their duty and policy to 
     
     aid the construction of the Pacific, and he would ask the 
     
     Government for what reasons they had absolved the Imperial 
     
     Government from all duties in the work of consolidating British 
     
     power on this continent. He referred to rumours which he said had 
     
     been greatly inﬂuenced by the presence of Capitalists and 
     
     Contractors who were opposed to the Northern Pacific Railway, and 
     
     who thought that if the Canadian Government would decide 
     
     definitely to construct the Canadian line, it would operate strongly 
     
     against the Northern Pacific, and said he could not but think that 
     
     those rumours had gained weight by the utterance of the President 
     
     of the Council that if the Canadian line was constructed the 
     
     Northern Pacific would never get beyond Red River. That hon. 
     
     gentleman had also urged as a reason for hurry in this matter, that if 
     
     they did not hasten to accept the terms proposed, British Columbia 
     
     might exact conditions still more difficult, but such an argument 
     
     was absurd. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     British Columbia was a Crown colony, and if it were really, the 
     
     policy of the Imperial Government, to consolidate British power on 
     
     this continent, though every man in that colony might be in favor of 
     
     annexation, their power to bring about such a result would be as 
     
     light as a feather, it would be as nothing. If ever the British 
     
     possessions on this Continent should become part of the United 
     
     States, it could only be at the cannon’s mouth, and as the 
     
     consequence of the total ruin and prostration of British power on 
     
     this continent. The same reason for hurry had been urged in the 
     
     discussion on Confederation, and he very much deprecated it as 
     
     tending very much to unsettle the minds of the people. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     These great questions should be discussed solely on their merits 
     
     without the fulmination of insincerities in regard to alternatives that 
     
     might ensue in case of the scheme being rejected. He had no doubt 
     
     that many, hon. gentleman, had been writing to their constituents 
     
    <fw type="num">

     speaking of the wonderful benefits of Confederation as evinced in 
     
     their being no longer a deficiency in the revenue, but a surplus of 
     
     two millions, and he could not but cornmiserate them in having now 
     
     to write that that surplus of two millions had disappeared to be 
     
     replaced by a debt of one hundred millions.

     Mr. RYMAL had hoped that the Government would have been 
     
     forced to explain in what way the money for the railway was to be 
     
     raised. He ventured to say that the Minister of Finance was not 
     
     properly performing the functions of his office, in failing to explain 
     
     fully the financial aspect of the matter. He feared nothing he could 
     
     say would change one single vote, but he was convinced that if the 
     
     question had been one of policy and not of party, the resolutions 
     
     would never have been carried. Richelieu had said that many 
     
     persons who, as private members might be saved, were in great 
     
     danger of being damned for having wandered into public life, and if 
     
     Richelieu had lived in these days and uttered those words, he (Mr. 
     
     Rymal) would have been quite sure that his eyes were fixed on the 
     
     gentlemen of the Canadian Government.

     Mr. THOMPSON (Ontario North) desired to explain why he 
     
     should support the amendment, which was because no explanation 
     
     had even been attempted as to how so large a debt as that proposed 
     
     could be incurred without crippling most seriously the resources of 
     
     the country.

     Mr. MACKENZIE’S amendment was then put with the

     Hon. Sir A.T. GALT rose and said, it might be considered that 
     
     the address was practically carried, but he desired before the final 
     
     passage, to place on record an explanation of the terms under which 
     
     the address was understood to be adopted. The Government had 
     
     stated as a reason why these terms should be accepted, that it was 
     
     not their intention to undertake the whole cost of the railway out of 
     
     the money reserves of the Dominion, but that they proposed to do it 
     
     through the intervention of companies to whom they would be 
     
     prepared to give subsidies of land and money, and further that this 
     
     was the understanding between themselves and the delegates from 
     
     British Columbia. He therefore moved: That the word “now” be 
     
     left out, and the words “on Monday next, and that meantime it be 
     
     Resolved, That in accepting the terms of Union with <hi rendition="simple:italic">British 
     
     Columbia</hi>, this House understands that the engagement for the 
     
     construction of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Pacific</hi> Railroad within ten years is subject to 
     
     the understanding had between the Government of the Dominion 
     
     and the Commissioners from <hi rendition="simple:italic">British Columbia</hi> that the said 
     
     Railroad should be constructed through the medium of private 
     
     Companies, receiving subsidies in money and land, and that it was 
     
     not intended to pledge the Dominion beyond the application of its 
     
     money and resources to the loyal and earnest prosecution of the 
     
     work, without entailling undue and excessive burdens upon the 
     
     people.” </p>

<p> Hon. Sir GEORGE-É. CARTIER said this amendment was 
     
     equally objectionable with the others that had been moved to 
     
     prevent to passing of the address, and he would announce to the 
     
     House, and to the hon. member for Sherbrooke, that the 
     
     Government intended and determined that this great railway should 
     
     be carried out by companies and not by the Government, and 
     
     through the means principally of land grant and small money 
     
     subsidies, and further that early in the ensuing week, the 
     
     Government would place before the House a resolution by which to 
     
     take the sense of the House with regard to the manner in which that 
     
     Railway should be built, and he might announce beforehand that the 
     
     determination of the Government was that, when the sense of the 
     
     House had been so taken, they would carry it out more prudently 
     
     with regard to the Exchequer of the country than was proposed in 
     
     the amendment of the hon. member for Sherbrooke.

     Mr. MACKENZIE said that the terms of the amendment were 
     
     so general that he was not prepared to vote for it. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BLAKE said he must oppose the amendment not only for 
     
     the reason named by the hon. member for Lambton, but because he 
     
     considered that no action could put an interpretation on the terms 
     
     other than that they literally contained.

            <p>
     Mr. BOWELL said his great objection to the amendment was 
     
     that it did not go far enough for it would not prevent the 
     
     Government from carrying on the Railway after its construction.

     The amendment was lost, the vote being—Yeas, 7; Nays, 126.

     The main motion was then carried and the address read a second 
     
     time, and on the motion of Hon. Sir GEORGE-É. CARTIER the 
     
     address was ordered to be engrossed, and a motion for an address to 
     
     His Excellency, praying His Excellency to transmit the address to 
     
     Her Majesty the Queen was carried; the address to His Excellency 
     
     was ordered to be engrossed, and to be presented by such members 
     
     of the House as belonged to the Privy Council.

     SUPPLY

            <p>
     On the motion of Hon. Sir FRANCIS HINCKS to go into 
     
     Committee of Supply, 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. HOLTON called the attention of the Government to 
     
     the manner in which a certain parcel of land belonging to the 
     
     Dominion was leased to the Montreal Warehousing Company. The 
     
     history of the land was this: In 1865 Government purchased from 
     
     private parties in Montreal a lot of land adjoining the canal basin, 
     
     on the recommendation of Mr. Allan, for the purpose of increasing 
     
     the wharfage and shed accommodation there. For this lot the 
     
     Government paid the sum of $25,000. The Warehousing Co., 
     
     through Mr. Brydges, made application to Government for the 
     
     purchase of the lot subsequent to confederation of the Provinces, 
     
     but on the advice of the officers of the Public Works Department, 
     
     the Government refused to sell it. On the 19th July, 1870, the hon. 
     
     the Minister of Militia, in the absence of the Minister of Public 
     
     Works, and acting for that minister, reported to the Council in favor 
     
     of granting the lease of this lot to the Warehousing Company for a 
     
     term of 21 years with an annual rental of $700, that being 
     
     considered less than simple interest on one half the cost. This report 
     
     was made to the Privy Council without being supported by any of 
     
     the professional gentlemen connected with the Department. One of 
     
     the conditions, however, was that the Government might resume 
     
     possession of the property on giving three months’ notice, on 
     
     condition of paying for any building that might be erected thereon, 
     
     subsequent to the lease of the property. He, therefore, moved an 
     
     amendment to the motion to go into Committee of Supply, reciting 
     
     the facts above stated, and resolving “that this House is of opinion 
     
     that it is the duty of this Government to take immediate steps to 
     
     resume possession for public uses, of the said lot of ground.” 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. LANGEVIN said he would take the full responsibility 
     
     of the transaction on himself. He had no desire to shield himself 
     
     behind the Minister of Militia in this matter. The action in the 
     
     matter was taken while he (Hon. Mr. Langevin) was absent, but it 
     
     was with his entire approval. What he had to complain of was that 
     
     the hon. member for Châteauguay had not gone farther back in the 
     
     history of this affair. The hon. member knew quite well that in order 
     
     to arrive at the true position of affairs, it was necessary to go back 
     
     further than 1865. In 1851 the Government of the day offered for
