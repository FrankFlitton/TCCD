     BRITISH COLUMBIA

            </head>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JONE1">Mr. JONES</persName> (Halifax) resumed the debate on the Bill to admit 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia into the Dominion. He moved that the following 
     <lb/>
     words be inserted after the word "purpose" in the amendment: 
     <lb/>
     "The proposed engagements respecting the said Pacific Railway 
     <lb/>
     would, in the opinion of this House, press too heavily on the 
     <lb/>
     resources of the Dominion." He argued that the Government might 
     <lb/>
     well hesitate to enter into such engagements after the fears and 
     <lb/>
     doubts expressed by the hon. member for Sherbrooke and other 
     <lb/>
     fathers of the Confederation. But, the Government would do well to 
     <lb/>
     hesitate if they desired to consummate the Union. There were other 
     <lb/>
     colonies to be added to the Dominion. Newfoundland and Prince 
     <lb/>
     Edward Island had yet to be brought in and it was not likely that 
     <lb/>
     they could be induced to join the Confederation under less 
     <lb/>
     advantageous terms than were now offered to the Pacific Colony. 
     <lb/>
     Hon. members opposite argued that if the Dominion was not 
     <lb/>
     immediately extended to the Pacific, the Western colony would be 
     <lb/>
     absorbed into the American Union, but the hon. members were 
     <lb/>
     adopting the very measures which would promote that movement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The strongest argument against annexation had always been that 
     <lb/>
     our taxes were light, that while the Americans had a debt amounting 
     <lb/>
     to $60 per head, ours was not quite $27 per head of our population. 
     <lb/>
     Let these engagements be entered into by the Dominion, which 
     <lb/>
     were now before the House, and the result would be to leave us 
     <lb/>
     with a heavier debt in proportion to our resources than at present 
     <lb/>
     weigh down the American Union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The cause of our prosperity hitherto had been the contrast 
     <lb/>
     between the United States and the Dominion, but the Government 
     <lb/>
     proposed to reverse the present position of the two countries. While 
     <lb/>
     the Americans were paying off their debt and reducing their taxes, 
     <lb/>
     Canada was about to incur liabilities too great for her to bear. He 
     <lb/>
     referred to the immense charge which the construction of the 
     <lb/>
     Pacific Railway would bring on the country. He asked the House to 
     <lb/>
     take a business view of this engagement, and ask themselves should 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion undertake it. (<hi rendition="simple:italic">Hear, hear</hi>.) This extravagant proposal 
     <lb/>
     was the natural sequence of the Finance Minister's budget speech in 
     <lb/>
     which that hon. member had spoken of the advantages of a great 
     <lb/>
     national debt, and quoted from Macaulay in support of this view. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
   <cb/>
            
          
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HINC1">Hon. Sir FRANCIS HINCKS</persName> said he had not advocated the 
     <lb/>
     creation of a national debt, nor had he quoted from Macaulay in 
     <lb/>
     support of such a view. He had merely quoted the passage referred 
     <lb/>
     to, to show how the great resources of England had enabled her to 
     <lb/>
     surmount the difficulties of a great national debt. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JONE1">Mr. JONES</persName> (Halifax): Then why refer to it at all. If the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Finance Minister had no intention to foreshadow the creation of a 
     <lb/>
     great debt, why quote the passage? There was no doubt that the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman had that end in view, and the House should unite in 
     <lb/>
     opposing such a suicidal policy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BODW1">Mr. BODWELL</persName> in seconding the amendment of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Halifax, spoke at considerable length against incurring 
     <lb/>
     the heavy liabilities which the construction of a Pacific railway 
     <lb/>
     would cause. He denied that there was any danger that British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia would be annexed to the United States if it were not 
     <lb/>
     brought into the Confederation. Did hon. members opposite 
     <lb/>
     suppose that Great Britain would allow the republic to absorb any 
     <lb/>
     portion of Her Majesty's possessions without a struggle? If the 
     <lb/>
     cause was so weak that the government was obliged to resort to 
     <lb/>
     such an argument in order to coerce their followers into voting for 
     <lb/>
     this measure, it would be better to drop it altogether. He quoted 
     <lb/>
     from the speech of the hon. member for Brome in the report of the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation debate to show how some of the advocates of this 
     <lb/>
     measure had once been most bitterly opposed to Confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MORR1">Hon. Mr. MORRIS</persName> said it was most surprising, in looking back 
     <lb/>
     on the past history of Canada, to see what great tasks had been 
     <lb/>
     accomplished. The government had been taunted time after time 
     <lb/>
     with not being sincere in the great work of building up a British 
     <lb/>
     power on the Continent, but they could turn to their record, and 
     <lb/>
     challenge their opponents on the other side of the House, by what 
     <lb/>
     they had really done. Was it nothing that the Dominion already 
     <lb/>
     stretched from the Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains! And now the 
     <lb/>
     question was whether they should or whether they should not make 
     <lb/>
     what had once been considered a dream a living reality, by doing 
     <lb/>
     their utmost to weld the provinces from one ocean to the other into 
     <lb/>
     one solid Dominion. He was surprised at the course taken by some 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen in the present debate, and especially at that taken by 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Sherbrooke, who had formerly taken the 
     <lb/>
     deepest interest in the question, and had spoken most earnestly in 
     <lb/>
     favour of the union now proposed; and he was more than surprised 
     <lb/>
     at the course of the hon. member for Lambton, who, though a later 
     <lb/>
     convert to the benefits of Confederation, had, with his party, stated 
     <lb/>
     that he should set himself to assist to establish and consummate the 
     <lb/>
     work. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     But now, after speaking so often of his zeal for union, placed on 
     <lb/>
     record a motion which, while admitting the Pacific Railway to be an 
     <lb/>
     "urgent political necessity," attempted to prevent the House from 
     <lb/>
     entering on the discussion of, and adopting the proposed terms of 
     <lb/>
     union. The member for Sherbrooke had dealt with the matter on a 
     <lb/>
     broader basis than had more recently been introduced into the 
     <lb/>
     debate, and, while admitting that he had no quarrel with the amount 
     <lb/>
     of subsidy to be granted to British Columbia, stated that he would 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="299" facs="final/images/BC_H_of_C_18710330_Page_299.jpg"/>
           <fw type="dateline">March 30, 1871</fw> <fw type="running">COMMONS DEBATES</fw>
            <fw type="num">299</fw>
          
     have preferred the terms originally proposed by British Columbia to 
     <lb/>
     those now proposed by the Government. He was sure, however, that 
     <lb/>
     that preference would not be shared by the House or the country. 
     <lb/>
     The original terms had provided the building of a coach road within 
     <lb/>
     three years of union, and that the railway also should be built as 
     <lb/>
     early as possible, with a specified expenditure of a million a year. 
     <lb/>
     The member for Lambton stated that he had never contemplated 
     <lb/>
     anything more than a road from Lake Superior, but of what benefit 
     <lb/>
     would such a road as that be. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     He also told the House that he was opposed to locking up the 
     <lb/>
     lands of the country by handing them over to a company, but he 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. Mr. Morris) maintained that the course being pursued by that 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman would lock up the lands for ever. How could the 
     <lb/>
     lands be available for settlement and cultivation unless facility of 
     <lb/>
     access was provided? The Illinois road, which had been used by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman as an illustration of the danger of locking up lands 
     <lb/>
     by handing them over to a company, was a proof that the very 
     <lb/>
     reverse was the case, for the results of that road were that Illinois 
     <lb/>
     was peopled rapidly, and the lands, instead of being locked up, were 
     <lb/>
     almost entirely disposed of, for out of a grant of two and a half 
     <lb/>
     millions of acres, only half a million remained in the hands of the 
     <lb/>
     company. He asked the House seriously the nature and character of 
     <lb/>
     the land proposed to be acquired. That land consisted of the United 
     <lb/>
     Province of British Columbia and Vancouver's Island, and no one, 
     <lb/>
     who understood the matter, could deny that the addition of that 
     <lb/>
     province would increase enormously the wealth, the resources, and 
     <lb/>
     the prosperity of the Dominion. He had several extracts from works 
     <lb/>
     on the country, showing its valuable nature and character, and 
     <lb/>
     thought the member for Lambton was not justified in the remarks 
     <lb/>
     he had used to the effect of there being scarcely any arable land in 
     <lb/>
     the whole of British Columbia. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACK1">Mr. MACKENZIE</persName> stated that what he had said was that after 
     <lb/>
     descending the slopes of the Rocky Mountains, the country was the 
     <lb/>
     roughest on the continent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MORR1">Hon. Mr. MORRIS</persName> thought the construction he had put on the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member's remarks was not very far wrong, but he could state 
     <lb/>
     on the undisputable authority of Mr. Trutch, the Surveyor General 
     <lb/>
     of British Columbia, that taking the whole of British Columbia and 
     <lb/>
     Vancouver Island fully one-third, or about 50,000,000 of acres was 
     <lb/>
     good farming land, while the whole acreage of Ontario was 
     <lb/>
     77,000,000 acres. It appeared to him that throughout the whole 
     <lb/>
     debate a strange fallacy had existed. The Railway had been spoken 
     <lb/>
     of as a mere bargain to induce British Columbia to enter the Union, 
     <lb/>
     whereas that work was of more importance to Canada than it was to 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia, for, having already acquired the great North West 
     <lb/>
     they were compelled by force of circumstances to go forward and 
     <lb/>
     render it a valuable acquisition, and he was convinced that if the 
     <lb/>
     House turned its back on British Columbia by adopting the 
     <lb/>
     amendment of the member for Lambton, it would do a grievous 
     <lb/>
     injury to the cause of Confederation which might prove irreparable. 
     <lb/>
     The present position of Canada was analogous to that of the States 
     <lb/>
     some years ago, when that country, recognizing the importance and 
     <lb/>
     necessity of communication from one side of its territory to the 
     <lb/>
               
               <cb/>
            
           
     other, both as a bond of union between the people of the east and 
     <lb/>
     west, and as a means of securing the vast trade between Europe and 
     <lb/>
     Asia, had taken steps which in a short time would result in three 
     <lb/>
     different lines from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and the reasons that 
     <lb/>
     had urged America should be equally powerful with Canada, and he 
     <lb/>
     believed the Canadian line could be constructed in a satisfactory 
     <lb/>
     manner, by means of the proposed land grand without in the least 
     <lb/>
     degree overburdening the people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The House in the course of the debate had rung with cries that a 
     <lb/>
     debt of a $100 million was being incurred, but the speakers knew 
     <lb/>
     well that by means of the land, the line could be constructed 
     <lb/>
     without any approach to a burden that the people could not bear, 
     <lb/>
     and no Ministry would ever dare to propose to incur such a debt as 
     <lb/>
     had been spoken of in this case. The Northern Pacific was being 
     <lb/>
     constructed on a land grand only, and could it be doubted therefore, 
     <lb/>
     that Canada, with better lands and fewer difficulties, would be able 
     <lb/>
     to devise such a scheme as would attract foreign capital, as the 
     <lb/>
     Americans had done. The House must be aware that before a dollar 
     <lb/>
     could be expended or an acre of land granted, a scheme would have 
     <lb/>
     to be submitted to and endorsed by the House, and therefore the 
     <lb/>
     whole matter would be within the control of Parliament. The 
     <lb/>
     question was whether or not British Columbia should be invited to 
     <lb/>
     join the Union, and whether or not the railway should be 
     <lb/>
     constructed, and he believed that when the Union should be 
     <lb/>
     accomplished and representatives from British Columbia should sit 
     <lb/>
     in that House, there would be no doubt of the railway being 
     <lb/>
     proceeded with as rapidly as the resources of the country would 
     <lb/>
     admit. He had every confidence not only that the House would 
     <lb/>
     endorse the proposition of the Government, but that it would be 
     <lb/>
     approved by the people of the country also, and it would be a bright 
     <lb/>
     day for the Dominion when the first sod was cut on the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Pacific Railway, and in time to come many of his friends opposite, 
     <lb/>
     who were really desirous of consummating Confederation, though 
     <lb/>
     they might now oppose this scheme, would rejoice that the 
     <lb/>
     Government had not been deterred from following out the work, but 
     <lb/>
     had persevered in their determination to carry forward the work of 
     <lb/>
     union with the Pacific colonies. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALT1">Hon. Sir A.T. GALT</persName> would not again have spoken but for the 
     <lb/>
     allusions made to him, but under the circumstances he felt bound to 
     <lb/>
     express his views on the important question before the House. 
     <lb/>
     Referring to the remarks of the Minister of Inland Revenue he 
     <lb/>
     (Hon. Sir A.T. Galt) considered that the course he was pursuing 
     <lb/>
     would tend much more to build up Confederation on a sound basis 
     <lb/>
     than that pursued by the government, and that a policy of prudence 
     <lb/>
     and foresight was more necessary for the future progress of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion than the unwise incurring of obligations now proposed 
     <lb/>
     could possibly be. They should not lose sight of the real interests of 
     <lb/>
     the country in rushing forward in the path, which, though all might 
     <lb/>
     desire to follow it ultimately, if too hastily followed would defeat 
     <lb/>
     the very object desired to be obtained. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     As to the coach road proposed by British Columbia, involving a 
     <lb/>
     useless expenditure of money, he maintained that the necessities of 
     <lb/>
     the railway would require the construction of such a road so that it 
     <lb/>

     would have to be made in any case. As to the railway, the people of 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia had only asked for an expenditure of a million 
     <lb/>
     yearly, and even if that were continued in perpetuity it could not 
     <lb/>
     represent more than twenty millions. Those people had never 
     <lb/>
     presumed to demand that the line should be completed within a 
     <lb/>
     given time, and the proof that they had not done so had been shown 
     <lb/>
     by the Minister of Inland Revenue himself, who had argued that it 
     <lb/>
     was Canada that wanted the railway and not British Columbia.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MORR1">Hon. Mr. MORRIS</persName> stated that what he had said was that, 
     <lb/>
     throughout the discussion, the matter of the railway had been 
     <lb/>
     deliberately treated as if the whole benefits were to accrue to British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia, whereas Canada also had an equal interest in the work. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALT1">Hon. Sir A.T. GALT</persName> said he could not admit the statement that 
     <lb/>
     if the Government's resolutions were carried, Parliament would still 
     <lb/>
     retain the control of the matter. The details of the measure might 
     <lb/>
     come before them, but the obligation would remain that the work 
     <lb/>
     must be carried through <hi rendition="simple:italic">coûte que coûte</hi>. Five years ago, it had been 
     <lb/>
     decided that the lntercolonial Railway could not be undertaken 
     <lb/>
     without an Imperial guarantee; five years ago, the Province of 
     <lb/>
     Canada had to take a portion of the circulation of the country to 
     <lb/>
     meet her floating debt, two years ago, the Government had to 
     <lb/>
     borrow $2,500,000 from the Bank of Montreal, to enable them to 
     <lb/>
     say that the money borrowed for the lntercolonial was still within 
     <lb/>
     their control, and only one year ago, the Finance Minister had to ask 
     <lb/>
     an increase of 5% on all duties to provide against a possible 
     <lb/>
     deficiency of revenue, but yet, when it now fortunately happened 
     <lb/>
     that we had a surplus, it seemed to be believed that this state of 
     <lb/>
     things must continue, and that it was safe to incur any amount of 
     <lb/>
     obligation. He thought the people of British Columbia, if they really 
     <lb/>
     desired union, would be quite satisfied that the Dominion would 
     <lb/>
     construct a railway as rapidly as her resources would admit, and 
     <lb/>
     would not ask for any more. He hoped and believed the House 
     <lb/>
     would confirm the amendment of the member for Lambton.

     <persName ref="pers:OLIV2">Mr. OLIVER</persName> resumed the debate arguing that the pacific colony 
     <lb/>
     should be admitted into the Union on the same terms as the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces. He denied that those who favoured the amendment were 
     <lb/>
     opposed to the admission of British Columbia, or even to the 
     <lb/>
     building of the Pacific railway. He favoured these schemes, but 
     <lb/>
     thought we should consider the effect of such a very large 
     <lb/>
     expenditure at the present time. He considered that to allow six 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen from British Columbia to take their seats as representing 
     <lb/>
     only 100,000 people, was unfair to the other parts of the Dominion. 
     <lb/>
     Another feature in the scheme was unfair. The debt of British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia was taken at $1,666,620, which was assumed by the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion. This amounted to $20 odd per head of the population, 
     <lb/>
     whereas in Quebec and Ontario the amount per head of debt 
     <lb/>
     assumed by the Dominion and subsidies was only $2.07. lt had 
     <lb/>
     been proposed that thirteen million of acres of lands running 
     <lb/>
               
               <cb/>
           
            
     alongside the railway should be appropriated. If so, these lands 
     <lb/>
     would be a constant cause of expenditure for management and 
     <lb/>
     surveying. (<hi rendition="simple:italic">Hear, hear</hi>.) lt would be better that these lands should 
     <lb/>
     remain in the lands of the Local Government of British Columbia; 
     <lb/>
     otherwise they might pass into the hands of land speculators, a state 
     <lb/>
     of things which would prove ruinous to the settlement of the 
     <lb/>
     country. If these lands were not locked up, they would be sufficient 
     <lb/>
     to support a population of two millions, and it would be better that a 
     <lb/>
     money bonus should be given and these lands opened up to the 
     <lb/>
     people for settlement. (<hi rendition="simple:italic">Hear, hear</hi>.) He believed that the railway 
     <lb/>
     should be prosecuted with energy, and all the money that could be 
     <lb/>
     spared spent upon it. That was the proposition contained in the 
     <lb/>
     amendment before the House. It was the duty of the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Minister in introducing this scheme, which pledged the country to 
     <lb/>
     complete the road in ten years, to tell the House where the money to 
     <lb/>
     build it was to come from. He calculated that our present debt, and 
     <lb/>
     obligations already or soon to be incurred, would amount to 
     <lb/>
     $127,000,000, and if to this were added $100,000,000 for the 
     <lb/>
     Pacific Railway, the amount would be $227,000,000; the interest 
     <lb/>
     per annum would be $11,350,000. He for one was not prepared to 
     <lb/>
     go that length. To do so would injure the present and future 
     <lb/>
     prospects of the Confederation. He would support the amendment.

     <persName ref="pers:MAGI1">Mr. MAGILL</persName> was in favour of bringing all British North 
     <lb/>
     America into the Union, but on terms equitable and fair to all the 
     <lb/>
     provinces. The terms proposed by the Government were not of that 
     <lb/>
     nature, and if the measure were carried, it would have the effect of 
     <lb/>
     driving immigration from our shores. It was proposed to sap the 
     <lb/>
     very foundations of the constitution which had been framed with 
     <lb/>
     such care and at such a cost. It was too much to expect this colony 
     <lb/>
     with its 13,000 of a population to override our constitution and 
     <lb/>
     create dissensions in this Dominion with its four millions of people. 
     <lb/>
     He protested against the position in which the Government had 
     <lb/>
     placed the House by bringing down this measure, framed by 
     <lb/>
     themselves, without having had the opinion of this House or of the 
     <lb/>
     people of this Dominion on the subject, and say that it should not be 
     <lb/>
     altered in any degree. It was unfair and he, for one, should record 
     <lb/>
     his vote against it. (<hi rendition="simple:italic">Hear, hear</hi>.)

     <persName ref="pers:COLB1">Mr. COLBY</persName> believed that the hon. member for Lambton 
     <lb/>
     expressed the opinion of the whole country when he said that it was 
     <lb/>
     desirable to bring British Columbia into the Union, that it was 
     <lb/>
     expedient to prosecute the construction of the Pacific Railway and 
     <lb/>
     to commence and push it through as soon as the financial condition 
     <lb/>
     of the country would permit it. That was exactly the policy 
     <lb/>
     announced by the Government. They brought down no cast-iron 
     <lb/>
     treaty. No one supposed that if they failed to complete the railway 
     <lb/>
     within the 10 years they would be guilty of a breach of faith. They 
     <lb/>
     proposed to do their best to complete it within that period. All the 
     <lb/>
     opposition which had been offered to this measure now before the 
     <lb/>
     House, had been presented in exactly the same manner as the 
     <lb/>
     opponents to Confederation had fought against the Union in the 
     <lb/>
     past. He would not be surprised if the people of British Columbia 
     <lb/>
     should fail to obtain this union with Canada, if they looked to the 
     <lb/>
     United States for the introduction of capital to open up their 
     <lb/>
     country.

     <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">Hon. Mr. ANGLIN</persName> said this was a matter of too great 
     <lb/>
     importance to be made a party question. He hoped every 
     <lb/>
     member would look upon it in a purely practical light, and 
     <lb/>
     oppose it as a utopian measure brought in by the visionaries who 
     <lb/>
     were hurrying the country to ruin. Looking at the measure on its 
     <lb/>
     merits there was something objectionable in every one of the 
     <lb/>
     clauses. He disapproved of the unfair Parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     representation, giving six members to 13,000 people; to 
     <lb/>
     pensioning officers, and to the payment of $100,000 per annum 
     <lb/>
     to sustain a corrupt and extravagant Government, given, too, 
     <lb/>
     under the pretence that it was rent for public lands. Let the 
     <lb/>
     House know all the meaning of these terms. The Government of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion were to undertake the construction and 
     <lb/>
     completion, under any contingency, of a Pacific railway within 
     <lb/>
     ten years after the date of the union. Why could not the 
     <lb/>
     Government come forward honestly and friendly and tell the 
     <lb/>
     truth, that they knew it would lay a heavy burden on the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion to carry out this engagement? But no, each member 
     <lb/>
     of the Government tried to make light of the difficulties to be 
     <lb/>
     encountered in the construction of this road. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The Red River expedition, in their march to Fort Garry, had 
     <lb/>
     given evidence as to the nature of the country between the head 
     <lb/>
     of Lake Superior and Red River, and they had proved it to be of 
     <lb/>
     the most sterile character. It was proved to be, for hundreds of 
     <lb/>
     miles, a wilderness of rock, swamp and lake, quite 
     <lb/>
     uninhabitable, and presenting the greatest difficulties to the 
     <lb/>
     construction of a railway. At the Rocky Mountains, fresh 
     <lb/>
     difficulties were to be met, and the <hi rendition="simple:italic">British Colonist</hi>, a paper 
     <lb/>
     published at Victoria, V.I., favourable to confederation, spoke 
     <lb/>
     of the route through which it was proposed to run the railway, as 
     <lb/>
     a "sea of mountains." If this account were correct, it would be 
     <lb/>
     difficult to find those vast tracts of fertile country spoken of by 
     <lb/>
     hon. members opposite, and it could be no easy matter to run a 
     <lb/>
     railway through it. With this much known, this House should be 
     <lb/>
     enabled to understand how much of a burden they were 
     <lb/>
     expected to bear, before they were asked to vote for this 
     <lb/>
     measure. He spoke of the resources of the United States as very 
     <lb/>
     superior to those of Canada.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">Hon. Mr. ANGLIN</persName> said that the proposed debt would take 
     <lb/>
     away Canada's only advantage over the States, and the policy of 
     <lb/>
     the Government was breaking down all barriers and would 
     <lb/>
     ultimately tend to annexation. He condemned the proposed 
     <lb/>
     expenditure as enormous, and pointed out how a proposition to 
     <lb/>
     incur an amount in England equal, in proportion to her wealth, 
     <lb/>
     would be received, and said it could not be supposed that the 
     <lb/>
     amount could be paid without a greatly increased taxation. He 
     <lb/>
     spoke of the present surplus revenue as very exceptional, and 
     <lb/>
     spoke of the difficulties and deficiencies of former years, and 
     <lb/>
     said that the Minister of Finance himself understood that in the 
     <lb/>
     proposals now before the House, a debt of $100,000,000 was 
     <lb/>
               
               <cb/>
           
            
     incurred, under which the Dominion would stagger. In addition 
     <lb/>
     to this amount for cost of construction there would be the 
     <lb/>
     working expenses to add to the burden, and the result would be 
     <lb/>
     as described the previous night by the member for Wentworth. 
     <lb/>
     Where was the amount to be obtained? It could not be obtained, 
     <lb/>
     and the obligation was only to be incurred because some few 
     <lb/>
     thousands of people on the Pacific coast were discontented and 
     <lb/>
     would otherwise seek annexation to the United States. The 
     <lb/>
     Statement that the cost incurred would only amount to a million 
     <lb/>
     and a quarter, could not be believed by a single member of the 
     <lb/>
     House. They would pledge themselves to construct the line in 
     <lb/>
     ten years, and who could say that the country would not have to 
     <lb/>
     pay every dollar. A company had been spoken of, but where was 
     <lb/>
     the company? How could any company raise seventy-five 
     <lb/>
     millions of dollars on fifiy million acres of barren waste land, 
     <lb/>
     and the Government only played with the House and imposed on 
     <lb/>
     the credulity of their supporters in saying the work would be 
     <lb/>
     done by a railway. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The question should be viewed calmly and dispassionately 
     <lb/>
     and not as a party question, as the Minister of Militia had tried 
     <lb/>
     to make it. The Minister of Customs had imagined a teeming 
     <lb/>
     and prosperous population in British Columbia and the North 
     <lb/>
     West, but were they to base their vote on baseless imaginings. 
     <lb/>
     Where was this population to come from when it was well 
     <lb/>
     known that the population of British Columbia had materially 
     <lb/>
     decreased of late years! It could only be explained by the fact 
     <lb/>
     that the country was not inviting to settlers. It was hard to 
     <lb/>
     persuade settlers to come even to Ontario and the other parts of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion, and how could it be supposed that a larger 
     <lb/>
     immigration could be directed to these new colonies. The House 
     <lb/>
     had been told that it was bound to construct the railway to the 
     <lb/>
     Rocky Mountains, but he would like to know how, when and 
     <lb/>
     where that obligation was incur;—they were bound to do 
     <lb/>
     nothing of the kind unless the finances of the country fully 
     <lb/>
     justified it. It had also been stated that although they incurred 
     <lb/>
     the obligation, they would not be compelled to carry it out 
     <lb/>
     unless they chose. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MORR1">Hon. Mr. MORRIS</persName> said he had stated that the House was not 
     <lb/>
     to be led away, but was to remember that any scheme for 
     <lb/>
     carrying out the work would have to be submitted to it, and that 
     <lb/>
     it would control the whole matter, and those were the facts.

     he would repudiate the whole Government scheme. Let not the

     <lb/>
     was doubled the expenditure would not be met, but when the 
     <lb/>
     debt and taxation was then increased, the way to annexation 
     <lb/>
     would well be opened, and he stood there to do what he could to 
     <lb/>
     save the country from the fate, and from the irresistable ruin that 
     <lb/>
     would ensue from this scheme. He implored the House to ignore 
     <lb/>
     party and think of the country.

     <persName ref="pers:HINC1">Hon. Sir FRANCIS HINCKS</persName> had been anxious before speaking 
     <lb/>
     to hear the views of others. He had listened with great attention to 
     <lb/>
     the gentleman who had preceded him, and there could only be one 
     <lb/>
     opinion that the whole tone of his remarks showed opposition to the 
     <lb/>
     acquisition to British Columbia, and opposition to the constructions 
     <lb/>
     of a railway, and the coalition that had taken place on the opposite 
     <lb/>
     side showed only opposition to the cause of union with the Pacific 
     <lb/>
     colonies. He would ask members on both sides to consider the 
     <lb/>
     position of the Government, and he assumed they were all in favour 
     <lb/>
     of Confederation. He desired to call particular attention to the fact 
     <lb/>
     that all proceedings were of the character of negotiations between 
     <lb/>
     two parties, as to the best means of accomplishing an object on 
     <lb/>
     which both were agreed. The Government entered into the 
     <lb/>
     negotiations, and with one or two exceptions the whole House 
     <lb/>
     seemed in favour of the Union with British Columbia and of the 
     <lb/>
     construction of the railway. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     He was surprised, however, to hear the member for Gloucester 
     <lb/>
     cheered by the gentleman round him when speaking of ignoring the 
     <lb/>
     whole population except the whites. The remainder of the 
     <lb/>
     population contributed most largely to the revenue, and he could 
     <lb/>
     speak from experience that the Chinese were an exceedingly 
     <lb/>
     valuable class as a duty paying people. The objections of hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen had dwindled down entirely to the matter of the railroad. 
     <lb/>
     The proposition made was that the railway was an absolute 
     <lb/>
     necessity, and that Canada should use every exertion to construct it 
     <lb/>
     at as early a date as possible. In the negotiations that took place, it 
     <lb/>
     was found impossible that Canada could undertake to commence 
     <lb/>
     this railway and make a stated payment annually, and it had never 
     <lb/>
     been understood that the Government themselves should undertake 
     <lb/>
     the work, but that it should be done by means of Companies with a 
     <lb/>
     land grand and money grant. Every calculation had been based on 
     <lb/>
     that understanding. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACK1">Mr. MACKENZIE</persName>: Give us the calculations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HINC1">Hon. Sir FRANCIS HICKS</persName> said it was necessary to give 
     <lb/>
     minute details, and he had already given a rough estimate based on 
     <lb/>
     statements of the most eminent engineers. Hon. gentlemen had 
     <lb/>
     admitted the necessity of the railway, but that had not been the tone 
     <lb/>
     of the member for Gloucester. His views were widely different 
     <lb/>
     from those of the representatives of Ontario. During the course of 
     <lb/>
     the discussion, he could not help thinking of the important 
     <lb/>
     proceedings at Washington, and thinking of those and of the 
     <lb/>
     important negotiations with the delegates from British Columbia, he 
     <lb/>
     was surprised at the cavilling on small matters which had taken 
     <lb/>
     place. The member for Gloucester seemed entirely opposed to the 
     <lb/>
     railway, but that was not the view of the member for Sherbrooke, 
     <lb/>
     who was well known as a promoter of such a railway, and a 
     <lb/>
     believer in its practicability. The Government scheme was a 
     <lb/>
     modification of the propositions of British Columbia, and although 
     <lb/>
     they would not undertake a stated annual expenditure, they fully 
     <lb/>
     admitted the necessity of the construction of the railway. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCAT1">Mr. SCATCHERD</persName> asked whether if the land would not build 
     <lb/>
     the road, the road would not be built. 
     <lb/>
            
       <cb/>     
     <persName ref="pers:HINC1">Hon. Sir FRANCIS HINCKS</persName> said no, he had already stated that 
     <lb/>
     it was estimated that the Dominion would have to pay about a 
     <lb/>
     million and a quarter a year, but it was well understood that if 
     <lb/>
     insurmountable difficulties arose, the Government could not be 
     <lb/>
     supposed to proceed to anything ruinous. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     But it was necessary to satisfy British Columbia that Canada was 
     <lb/>
     in earnest in going on with the work, and therefore a time was 
     <lb/>
     specified. No one had answered the argument that the railway was 
     <lb/>
     not entirely a bargain with British Columbia, for if that colony had 
     <lb/>
     not consented to join the Union would not a railway to the Rocky 
     <lb/>
     Mountains still have been a necessity. The negotiations had 
     <lb/>
     necessarily to assume the shape of a Treaty, and in all such matters 
     <lb/>
     concessions had to be made on both sides. The delegates 
     <lb/>
     themselves had been of different opinions, and the result of the 
     <lb/>
     conferences that had taken place was embodied in the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     before the House, and no amendments could be made without 
     <lb/>
     throwing open the whole question. These were questions on which 
     <lb/>
     the people of British Columbia dissented from the terms now 
     <lb/>
     settled, and any amendment would reopen the whole matter. The 
     <lb/>
     matter must be dealt with and accepted or rejected as a whole. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Very many more forebodings had been expressed as to the 
     <lb/>
     financial result of the propositions. The debt of Canada was about 
     <lb/>
     $20 a head and that of America $60 a head, and yet they could 
     <lb/>
     undertake three different lines of road, and he did not think Canada 
     <lb/>
     need have any fear on the matter. As to the debt of $100,000,000 
     <lb/>
     Government had no intention of incurring anything of the sort. Of 
     <lb/>
     course the Government undertook the work in ten years, but if after 
     <lb/>
     doing everything to carry out the engagement in good faith, it 
     <lb/>
     should be found that untoward circumstances should prevent the 
     <lb/>
     completion of the work, could it be supposed that Canada would be 
     <lb/>
     required to proceed to her own serious disadvantage, even if the 
     <lb/>
     work might be delayed for some years? He referred to the strictures 
     <lb/>
     of the member for Wentworth as to the Municipalities Laws, and 
     <lb/>
     shewed that the measure he had proposed had been most generally 
     <lb/>
     supported, and yet he was charged individually with the whole 
     <lb/>
     matter. All that had been done however, was to enable 
     <lb/>
     municipalities to borrow money in their own discretion. He spoke 
     <lb/>
     of what the member for Oxford South had said, as to his departure 
     <lb/>
     from, and return to Canada, explaining the circumstances that had 
     <lb/>
     led to his doing so, denying all charge of inconsistency. He then 
     <lb/>
     continued, they had either to spurn or accept British Columbia, and 
     <lb/>
     the result of the amendment, if carried, would be to do away with 
     <lb/>
     all hope of bringing British Columbia into the Union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WORK1">Mr. WORKMAN</persName> deprecated any party feelings in the 
     <lb/>
     discussion, the question being one of the utmost importance to the 
     <lb/>
     future of the country. He regretted very much that he would have to 
     <lb/>
     dissent from the Government scheme, which appeared calculated to 
     <lb/>
     damage the country. He was friendly to the completion to 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, notwithstanding. It was his opinion that this railroad 
     <lb/>
     would involve Canada in an expenditure of at least fifty millions. 
     <lb/>
     The cost of this work, the great difficulties natural and other in its 
     <lb/>
     way were reasons for our carefully considering this scheme and its 
     <lb/>
     consequences before rashly embarking in it. He ridiculed the 
     <lb/>

     spread-eagle anticipations and flourishes indulged in respecting this 
     <lb/>
     railway, and particularly the notion that the trade of China and 
     <lb/>
     Japan could be attracted over North America by this trans<lb break="no"/>continental road. Any merchant or intelligent man knew that the 
     <lb/>
     products of the East would be damaged by railway carriage, and 
     <lb/>
     that the shipping presented the best means of transportation. It was 
     <lb/>
     all nonsense to attribute to Confederation the credit for the present 
     <lb/>
     prosperity of the country. As to the expectations connected with the 
     <lb/>
     Intercolonial, he believed from reliable information that it would be 
     <lb/>
     a source of expense, trouble and anxiety to us. But at any rate let us 
     <lb/>
     see how it worked before entering upon another and longer railway. 
     <lb/>
     It was bad enough to have one elephant on our shoulders without a 
     <lb/>
     second. In the name of his constituents and of the trade and 
     <lb/>
     commerce of the country he protested against this scheme, which 
     <lb/>
     made him tremble for it; and it was because he thought it would be 
     <lb/>
     ruinous to the Dominion that he would vote against these 
     <lb/>
     resolutions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCDO8">Hon. Mr. McDOUGALL</persName> (Lanark North) said that although 
     <lb/>
     the debate had extended over three days there were two or three 
     <lb/>
     points to which no reference had yet been made, to which he felt it 
     <lb/>
     his duty to draw attention. He believed that a very large majority of 
     <lb/>
     the members of this House were desirous of seeing British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia united to the Dominion. Some twenty years ago, when he 
     <lb/>
     first entered into public life as a journalist, he had placed on his 
     <lb/>
     political platform as one of its most prominent planks Union of the 
     <lb/>
     British North American Provinces. In 1859 he was present at the 
     <lb/>
     Reform Convention in Toronto when the political condition of the 
     <lb/>
     country was discussed, and on that occasion he moved a resolution 
     <lb/>
     which embodied the principle on which this great scheme was 
     <lb/>
     founded. It received the assent of a majority of that assembly, and 
     <lb/>
     ever since then he had been endeavouring to the best of his ability 
     <lb/>
     to promote and advance this great measure. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Along with hon. members opposite, it had been his good fortune 
     <lb/>
     to help push forward Confederation, and he now accused them of 
     <lb/>
     having failed in the performance of their duty in the final 
     <lb/>
     accomplishment of the work. He said so boldly, looking at it from 
     <lb/>
     no political or party standpoint, and feeling no desire, as might be 
     <lb/>
     the case with some hon. members of the Opposition, to see the 
     <lb/>
     Government displaced from their seats at the present moment if 
     <lb/>
     they would only do their duty. Taking an impartial view of the case, 
     <lb/>
     he must charge them with having struck a fatal blow at the great 
     <lb/>
     measure with which for the last few years they had been connected, 
     <lb/>
     and for the success of which they were pledged to this House and 
     <lb/>
     responsible to the country. They propose, in order to induce, as they 
     <lb/>
     alleged, British Columbia to enter the Union, to load the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     with a debt double that under which the country now suffered, 
     <lb/>
     under which, at all events, it now labored. For the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     accomplishing this Union, no such sacrifice, no such burden, no 
     <lb/>
     such evil consequences were at all necessary. He failed to hear any 
     <lb/>
     decent reason why this Government should, without the authority of 
     <lb/>
     Parliament and without submitting the proposition in any form for 
     <lb/>
     public discussion, spring it on the House as they had done. Under 
     <lb/>
     the constitution, no such authority was delegated to the 
     <lb/>
               
               <cb/>
           
           
     Government. No authority was given them, of their own motion, to 
     <lb/>
     enter into, and finally conclude, negotiations which, as the House 
     <lb/>
     was told, must be accepted without qualification of amendment.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TILL1">Hon. Mr. TILLEY</persName>: What did you do at the Quebec conference? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCDO8">Hon. Mr. McDOUGALL</persName> (LanarkNorth) had expected to hear 
     <lb/>
     this question asked, but he would tell the hon. member that this was 
     <lb/>
     an entirely different case. The Quebec conference was a body of 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen assembled together to discuss the propriety of passing 
     <lb/>
     the law which regulated this very matter. The terms of that law 
     <lb/>
     were publicly discussed in the press and in the various existing 
     <lb/>
     legislative bodies of the several Provinces. It was agreed by them 
     <lb/>
     and alterations were made in accordance with expressions of 
     <lb/>
     opinion at the very last moment in England to meet the difficulties 
     <lb/>
     developed by these discussions. These circumstances were 
     <lb/>
     altogether different from those which surround the present case. In 
     <lb/>
     the Union Act were the <hi rendition="simple:italic">ipsissima verba</hi> which show how the Union 
     <lb/>
     of the other colonies is to be consummated. The Constitutional Act 
     <lb/>
     points out the parties who are to negotiate. It declares that the 
     <lb/>
     members of this House are one body, and the members of the other 
     <lb/>
     House another body, who are to settle its terms.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CART2">Hon. Sir GEORGE-É. CARTIER</persName> said the proper way to bring 
     <lb/>
     in the colony was through the Government of the day. It involved a 
     <lb/>
     pecuniary expenditure, and could not emanate from any other 
     <lb/>
     source. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCDO8">Hon. Mr. McDOUGALL</persName> (Lanark North) said the proposition 
     <lb/>
     which had been under debate for the last three days was not subject 
     <lb/>
     to the ordinary rule. The Government had taken every precaution to 
     <lb/>
     tell the House that this measure was in the nature of treaty, that not 
     <lb/>
     one of its details could be altered, and that it must be accepted as it 
     <lb/>
     was submitted to the House. Now, the meaning of the constitution 
     <lb/>
     was very different. It was only after full consideration in this 
     <lb/>
     Parliament that the measure should be accepted. Of what use was 
     <lb/>
     this debate at all, if the measure must be adopted without 
     <lb/>
     amendment? He would remind the House, that British Columbia 
     <lb/>
     was a Crown colony, with a population principally of miners and 
     <lb/>
     adventurers, and a very small number of permanent settlers. It was 
     <lb/>
     so at the time of Confederation, possibly the population was larger 
     <lb/>
     then. There was no popular representation at that time. This position 
     <lb/>
     did not fail to strike the attention of the Conference. It was the 
     <lb/>
     policy of the Imperial Government, and the four Provinces to 
     <lb/>
     complete the Union and all British America as soon as possible. He 
     <lb/>
     with others at the Conference had contended that it was the duty of 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial Government to bring pressure to bear on its own 
     <lb/>
     officers of British Columbia to submit to reasonable terms in order 
     <lb/>
     to secure Union with Canada. The small number of the inhabitants 
     <lb/>
     did not justify the admission of a colony on more favourable terms 
     <lb/>
     than those offered to the older and more populous Atlantic 
     <lb/>
     Provinces. The circumstances were entirely different and it was 
     <lb/>
     absurd to say that the future destiny of that country was in the hands 
     <lb/>
     of a few adventurers who were mining there. Since Confederation 
     <lb/>
     was agreed upon, the Imperial Government has put it out to their 
     <lb/>
     power to use that effective influence they might have used to secure 
     <lb/>

     proper terms and compel their acceptance by the Government and 
     <lb/>
     people of that colony. He did not believe there was any desire on 
     <lb/>
     the part of the majority of the people of British Columbia to make 
     <lb/>
     demands unreasonable or impracticable. What right had they in 
     <lb/>
     discussing terms with Canada to stipulate for construction of public 
     <lb/>
     works not only inside their own territory, but in the North West 
     <lb/>
     territories or in Ontario? He did not believe the people of that 
     <lb/>
     Colony ever expected that privilege or would have insisted on this 
     <lb/>
     railway on the present conditions. The railway would have three 
     <lb/>
     sections, differing as to character of country, quality of the land and 
     <lb/>
     other features. We know that no person would settle along the 
     <lb/>
     Ontario end of the line stretching to a distance of a thousand miles 
     <lb/>
     between the Ottawa valley and the Lake of the Woods, for it 
     <lb/>
     presented no agricultural or trading advantages to attract settlers. 
     <lb/>
     The middle sections consisted of good land, but had too sparse a 
     <lb/>
     population to afford a business for a railway for many years to 
     <lb/>
     come. Through and beyond the Rocky Mountains the country was 
     <lb/>
     of a nature most difficult for a railway and most discouraging as 
     <lb/>
     regards the prospects of settlement and traffic. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     It was absurd and unreasonable then for us to rush into a vast 
     <lb/>
     expenditure for a work of this kind without accurate knowledge of 
     <lb/>
     the country, without surveys, without any means of enabling us to 
     <lb/>
     form a reliable estimate as to its cost. Did the Government, then, in 
     <lb/>
     the absence of any knowledge, that capitalists would undertake this 
     <lb/>
     road, contemplate the construction of the line themselves? Or did 
     <lb/>
     they really intend to delay the completion of the road if serious 
     <lb/>
     difficulties arose, notwithstanding the pledge and promise now 
     <lb/>
     offered British Columbia? If that was the intention of the 
     <lb/>
     Government, why not say so frankly and honestly? All, he thought, 
     <lb/>
     that should be promised or undertaken at present was the 
     <lb/>
     construction of a telegraph and coach road, or at the utmost, of a 
     <lb/>
     railway from Pembina to the Rocky Mountains. In a short time the 
     <lb/>
     American road from the borders of Ontario to Pembina would be 
     <lb/>
     completed, and be as accessible and serviceable to our people as to 
     <lb/>
     themselves. Besides the Government of Canada would shortly 
     <lb/>
     establish a mixed land and water communication from Lake 
     <lb/>
     Superior to Fort Garry, which would provide all the facilities we 
     <lb/>
     needed for the present, perhaps for years. He saw no difficulty, 
     <lb/>
     whatever, in making use of the American road to reach Fort Garry 
     <lb/>
     and the Rocky Mountains. By giving liberal land grants to a 
     <lb/>
     company, and retaining alternate sections of land we might secure a 
     <lb/>
     railway across the plains and promote the rapid settlement of the 
     <lb/>
     fertile belt. Beyond that a good serviceable post road could be 
     <lb/>
     opened to the Pacific coast, realizing all the people of that colony 
     <lb/>
     some short time ago solicited, and accomplishing all the trade and 
     <lb/>
     interest of the Dominion, generally, required. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     He was as anxious as any man to see this Confederation 
     <lb/>
     completed; but denied he was therefore bound to accept every 
     <lb/>
     absurd, extravagant scheme proposed professedly with that object, 
     <lb/>
     and not shown to be either necessary or practicable. Was he to be 
     <lb/>
     blamed for hesitating to agree to every wild proposition of this 
     <lb/>
     kind? If we assented to this proposition we should weigh down the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion to a position which would not only excite dissatisfaction 
     <lb/>
               
               <cb/>
           
            
     among her own inhabitants, but destroy all confidence in our future 
     <lb/>
     among the people of other nations. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     With respect to the political arrangements he considered that the 
     <lb/>
     representatives for so small a number of people was a violation of 
     <lb/>
     the principles laid down in the Union Act, but the evil would be 
     <lb/>
     cured in a few years if the matter was not of serious consequence. 
     <lb/>
     The Manitoba measure had been passed under peculiar 
     <lb/>
     circumstances and was no precedent to sanction the present 
     <lb/>
     violation of the fundamental principles of the constitution, but, as 
     <lb/>
     he had said, the evil would be temporary, and might be conceded to 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia. The same might be said of the money grant, 
     <lb/>
     which, though based on a larger population than really existed, did 
     <lb/>
     not form a serious objection, for it had always been understood that 
     <lb/>
     the small Provinces should be enabled to carry on their Government 
     <lb/>
     and local works and he would be quite ready to vote directly a 
     <lb/>
     sufficient sum to enable British Columbia to meet her expense. 
     <lb/>
     While, however, the matter of the railway stood on its present basis 
     <lb/>
     he had no hesitation in opposing the Government scheme, although 
     <lb/>
     he yielded to no one in his desire to complete Confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     He was astonished that Government should have attempted to 
     <lb/>
     impose the condition that no alteration should be made, for the Act 
     <lb/>
     of Union gave to the two Houses of Parliament and to no other 
     <lb/>
     body the right to make any amendment they might deem expedient, 
     <lb/>
     and while the Legislative Council of British Columbia had 
     <lb/>
     discussed every detail of the scheme, he contended that the same 
     <lb/>
     right belonged to the people and Parliament of this Dominion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BEAT1">Mr. BEATY</persName> had received no intimation from his constituents to 
     <lb/>
     oppose the Government scheme, and he believed the general 
     <lb/>
     impression in Ontario was that Confederation could not be 
     <lb/>
     completed without British Columbia. He had every confidence in 
     <lb/>
     the Ministry both in legislation for the present and future, and he 
     <lb/>
     believed the interests of the country would be well cared for by 
     <lb/>
     them. In the matter of Manitoba the people of Ontario had been 
     <lb/>
     warned against the narrow minded Frenchmen, but he maintained 
     <lb/>
     that for every liberty they possessed, civil and religious, they were 
     <lb/>
     mainly indebted to the representatives of Lower Canada. If the 
     <lb/>
     present scheme carried and the railway was constructed 
     <lb/>
     successfully, as he believed it would be, the honour would belong 
     <lb/>
     to the Minister of Militia and his noble band of reformers. The 
     <lb/>
     matter had been fully discussed, and what was the policy—well, his 
     <lb/>
     idea was that the policy was whether the gentlemen of the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition should be allowed to sit on the Government benches. 
     <lb/>
     That was their policy, and they did not care whether the North West 
     <lb/>
     was developed or not. The Government now proposed, however, a 
     <lb/>
     scheme of opening up the country and numbers of emigrants would 
     <lb/>
     come in, instead of leaving for the States as at present, and before 
     <lb/>
     many years elapsed, thousands of emigrants would be attracted if 
     <lb/>
     the Government were allowed to carry out their plans of 
     <lb/>
     development. He looked forward to a great future for Canada on 
     <lb/>
     these grounds, and having every confidence in the resolutions he 
     <lb/>
     should support them, and if he did otherwise, he would think he had 
     <lb/>
     degraded himself.

     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">Hon. Mr. DORION</persName> said the question had two aspects, the 
     <lb/>
     political and the financial; the latter, however, was much the most 
     <lb/>
     important and had listened to the Government statements on that 
     <lb/>
     head in hope of being able to vote for the resolutions, but the 
     <lb/>
     minister of Finance had been able to give no favourable statement. 
     <lb/>
     He took great care not to give any details, and beyond the assertion 
     <lb/>
     that a cost of $100,000,000 would be practicable, they had heard 
     <lb/>
     nothing. The American lines had been cited as examples, but it had 
     <lb/>
     not been stated that in addition to the land grants an enormous 
     <lb/>
     amount of money had also been granted. The Minister of Finance 
     <lb/>
     ought to be able to state definitely the amount involved so that the 
     <lb/>
     House might not have to make a blind vote, and he regretted the 
     <lb/>
     humiliating proposal of the Minister of Inland Revenue, that after 
     <lb/>
     the pledge had been given it might afterwards be retracted. He 
     <lb/>
     spoke of the heavy obligations the Dominion already sustained, and 
     <lb/>
     maintained that the Union Act provided that the canal system ought 
     <lb/>
     to have been completed before any other responsibilities were 
     <lb/>
     incurred. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TILL1">Hon. Mr. TILLEY</persName> read the resolution at Quebec to show that 
     <lb/>
     the North West question was to be an express object of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DORI1">Hon. Mr. DORION</persName> said that matter had already been attained. 
     <lb/>
     He had never had, and had not now, any faith in Confederation, but 
     <lb/>
     he had felt in duty bound not to oppose it, but if he were most 
     <lb/>
     anxious for the downfall of Confederation, he could desire for 
     <lb/>
     nothing more than the present scheme to attain that object. 
     <lb/>
     Reverting to the canal improvement, he considered it unjust that the 
     <lb/>
     credit of the country should be pledged to this immense extent 
     <lb/>
     before that canal improvement was completed. He quoted from a 
     <lb/>
     report of Mr. Fleming, characterising the Pacific Railway as a 
     <lb/>
     commercial absurdity and that the maintenance of such a line would 
     <lb/>
     cost eight millions annually, and in fact that it was altogether 
     <lb/>
     impraticable, and stating that a macadamized road to the Rocky 
     <lb/>
     Mountains would require seventeen years for construction, and yet 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen opposite presumed to say that this gigantic work 
     <lb/>
     could be commenced and completed within ten years. What greater 
     <lb/>
     absurdity could be uttered in any intelligent Assembly? If 
     <lb/>
     Confederation must be had in some direction better have it with the 
     <lb/>
     150,000 of Newfoundland and the 100,000 of Prince Edward's 
     <lb/>
     Island than with the 10,000 of British Columbia, while the 
     <lb/>
     inhabitants in one case were settled, and in the other mere roving 
     <lb/>
     adventurers. He did not admit the necessity of a Canadian Pacific 
     <lb/>
     line, but thought the American lines should be used, and expend the 
     <lb/>
     money rather in opening up the North West by roads. He thought 
     <lb/>
     the four millions of people inhabiting the basin of the St. Lawrence 
     <lb/>
     were entitled to greater consideration than the small population of 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia, and if this large expenditure were to be incurred 
     <lb/>
     rather let it be used in enlarging the canals and so securing the great 
     <lb/>
     trade of the West.
