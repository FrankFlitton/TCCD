<p>
     NEW MEMBER</p>

<p>
     Mr. SMITH (Selkirk), the newly elected member for Selkirk, 
     
     Manitoba, was introduced by Hon. Sir George-E. Cartier and Mr. 
     
     Simpson, and took his seat immediately behind Hon. Mr. Tupper’s 
     
     place.

     Mr. SMITH (Selkirk), the newly elected member for Selkirk,

            <p>
     Mr. MACKENZIE called attention to the fact that the hon. 
     
     member who had just taken his seat did so under an Act, the 
     
     conﬁrmation of which was now being sought for at the hands of the 
     
     Imperial Parliament, and as doubts existed as to the propriety of any 
     
     member taking his seat under that Act, he thought that, following a 
     
     precedent set by Government themselves lately, the matter should 
     
     be referred to a Committee. This case seemed to demand the same 
     
     treatment as the Govemment had followed lately itself The 
     
     Opposition divested themselves of all responsibility after having 
     
     given this notification. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir GEORGE-E. CARTIER said that the hon. member 
     
     who had just been introduced had taken his seat under an Act of this 
     
     House which had met with the sanction of the Imperial 
     
     Government, and which had not been disallowed or declared null 
     
     by any legal authority. Consequently if it was binding upon 
     
     anybody it was on this House, which had passed the Act. But, at the 
     
     same time, he might add, if any hon. member should raise a 
     
     question of privilege with regard to the assumption of a seat in this 
     
     House by the hon. member for Selkirk, the Government would be 
     
     ready to discharge their duty and advise the House with regard to 
     
     the law as it was to be applied in the present case. Until the present 
     
     law should be set aside the Govemment could not act otherwise 
     
     than they had done. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The subject was dropped. </p>

     Mr. MACKENZIE asked why the Govemment had not brought 
     
     down a statement of the allowances granted under the 
     
     Superannuation Act of last session. They should also have furnished 
     
    <fw type="num">287</fw>
     a statement respecting conﬁdential printing. Neither of these

     Hon. Sir FRANCIS HlNCKS said he would inquire the cause 
     
     of the delay, and let the House know why the law had not yet been 
     
     complied with.

     BRITISH COLUMBIA DEBATE 
     
    </head>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir GEORGE-É. CARTIER said the debate on the British 
     
     Columbia resolutions would be resumed aﬁer recess this evening.

     it was known that when the Ottawa and St. Lawrence had been 
     
     navigable, that canal had fallen into comparative disuse, and it 
     
     should be considered whether the amount annually expended 
     
     could not be saved. The opening of the Upper Ottawa would 
     
     conduce more than anything to developing and improving the 
     
     country, and was sorry the Government had gone no further than 
     
     propose to improve a few local works, as he thought they ought to 
     
     be able to initiate a distinct policy on the subject, making the 
     
     present appropriations a mere commencement of an ultimate plan.

            <p>
     Hon. Mr. LANGEVIN stated that the works being now 
     
     undertaken were really only part of the plan proposed by the 
     
     Commissioners. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. MACKENZIE was glad such was the case, and he asked 
     
     the serious attention of the Government to what he had indicated as 
     
     to the want of accommodation at Montreal. Those engaged in 
     
     developing the mineral resources of the West were daily 
     
     complaining on this subject. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir FRANCIS HINCKS said the defective arrangements 
     
     at Montreal certainly deserved consideration. He referred to the 
     
     Lake Ste. Marie Canal, and admitting its importance, he thought 
     
     that, considering the present negotiations at Washington, a plan to 
     
     construct that work would really be a doubtful policy. He read an 
     
     extract from the papers before the House, being a minority report 
     
     from Mr. Laidlaw, showing that as the recommendation of the 
     
     Commission was that the canal should be built on the same plan as 
     
     the Welland Canal, it would not be large enough for the vessels 
     
     passing through the American Canal, that no tolls would be 
     
     obtained, and would not be of the slightest possible use except in 
     
     case of war. Of course the Government had not adopted this view, 
     
     but they thought it inadvisable to proceed with the work at present. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. MACKENZIE said that such were the facilities for 
     
     constructing the Canadian Canal that if it were built it would be 
     
     used at once to its utmost capacity, and he regarded Mr. Laidlaw’s 
     
     report as most puerile. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. WORKMAN spoke of the want of accommodation at 
     
     Montreal, and explained the way in which the Harbour was worked, 
     
     and he was sure that the Harbour Commissioners had done 
     
     everything that could be expected of them. As to the petroleum, the 
     
     absence of shipments arose from the transfer of the article itself, but 
     
     as regarded the staple products of the country, matters were 
     
     conducted more cheaply, more efficiently and more expeditiously 
     
     than at any other port on the continent, and he had heard many 
     
     captains of vessels testify to such being the case. Of course he 
     
     would not object to Government aid but certainly he would not ask 
     
     for it. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. RYAN (Montreal West) thanked the member for Lambton 
     
     for having drawn attention to the matter, but could not agree with

     his colleague from Montreal. The Harbour Commissioners might 
     
     have done what they could, but if that body were differently 
     
     constituted, very much more might have been done.

            <p>
     The Committee rose, reported progress, and asked leave to sit 
     
     again.

     THE BRITISH COLUMBIA DEBATE 
     
    </head>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir GEORGE-É. CARTIER moved the resumption of the 
     
     adjourned debate on the proposed motion that the Speaker do leave 
     
     the chair, for the House to go into committee of the whole to 
     
     consider certain resolutions respecting the admission of British 
     
     Columbia into union with Canada, and the motion of Mr. 
     
     Mackenzie in amendment thereto. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Carried. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. GRAY resumed the debate. He said that it mattered 
     
     little how this House might regard the measure unless they were 
     
     backed up by public opinion, and that opinion was greatly affected 
     
     by statements made in this House. The measure should be viewed 
     
     by the light of the ledger, in the practical light of the present day, 
     
     rather than in the light of the past. This House should regard it too, 
     
     in the light of the experience of the neighboring Republic, and see 
     
     how we might profit by it. As had been observed by the hon. 
     
     member for Sherbrooke, there were two precautions to be taken. 
     
     The constitution was in no way to be infringed and the Dominion 
     
     was not to incur a financial burden too heavy to be borne. In this 
     
     view, he believed every member in the House concurred. And first, 
     
     with regard to the objection urged against the representation of 
     
     British Columbia that it was too large, he would say that the British 
     
     North America Act did not limit representation to the white 
     
     population but even if it were so limited, the number of 
     
     representatives under the circumstances of that Colony was not too 
     
     great. When the Manitoba Act was passed last session exception 
     
     was taken in the debate to the representation given to the new 
     
     Province, but the reply was that the expected increase in the 
     
     population would, <hi rendition="simple:italic">within a very short</hi> period, be proportionate

     to the representation. This view was not disputed by the hon. 
     
     member for East Toronto, or by his hon. friend from Bothwell.

     Hon. Mr. GRAY would quote from the hon. member’s own 
     
     speech to show that he had not objected to it.

     Mr. MILLS said he would not accept any report made last 
     
     year as a correct one.

            <p>
     Hon. Mr. GRAY would quote from the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> report, which 
     
     the hon. member would hardly object to. The passage of the 
     
     hon. member’s speech referred to, contained the following: 
     
     “The representation was based no doubt, on the expectation of 
     
     an immediate increase of the inhabitants, but he contended that 
     
     it would be better to give representation to the number of 
     
     people, increasing the number if it was thought best, every two 
     
     years, or leaving to the local legislature if they thought it 
     
     better.” Here was the expression of opinion from the hon. 
     
     member, and thus, though the point was raised, there was no 
     
     record on the journals of the House, no action taken, no 
     
     resolution or amendment moved to show that the representation 
     
     of Manitoba was unconstitutional. The objection that was taken 
     
     in debate last session by the hon. gentleman was as to the power 
     
     of the Parliament to give representation at all—not as to its 
     
     numerical character. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Here then was a precedent for this case before the Hous—ia 
     
     precedent established by the House itself. He had no fear that 
     
     the smaller Provinces would be overridden through this Act. If 
     
     the representation were to be based strictly upon population 
     
     according to the law as at present interpreted by the hon. 
     
     member for Bothwell, British Columbia would have but one 
     
     representative, if any. Now, in that colony there were two 
     
     separate and distinct interests, the insular and continental. The 
     
     country was divided into two sections, Vancouver Island and the 
     
     main land. 1f the colony were permitted to send but one member 
     
     to this House, which section would he represent? He could not 
     
     represent both very well, and one of them would remain 
     
     unrepresented. It was clear, therefore, that no other course could 
     
     have been adopted with reference to this point, than that 
     
     embodied in the measure before the House. The position he took 
     
     with reference to this question was this, that until the Province 
     
     became a member of the Federal compact, it would not be 
     
     governed by the provisions of the British North America Act. 
     
     That the terms and conditions on which British Columbia came 
     
     in were to be agreed on, and ifit as an independent province she 
     
     chose to say her interests required our representatives in the 
     
     House, she could, and there was nothing in the British North 
     
     America Act to prevent our acceptance of such a proposition, 
     
     but aﬁer she came in, her future representation must be 
     
     governed by the 31st section of the British North America Act, 
     
     and must revolve like that of the other Province, around the 
     
     representation of Quebec as a pivot. ln accepting her therefore,

     as set forth in the resolutions in that respect there was no 
     
     infringement of our Constitutional rights under the British North 
     
     America Act, and thus the ﬁrst point stated by the member from 
     
     Sherbrooke was complied with. For it must be assumed that if 
     
     there were other important constitutional objections they would 
     
     not have escaped the acumen of the member for Durham West. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The next point was as to our capability to enter upon the 
     
     contemplated arrangements respecting the Paciﬁc Railway. The 
     
     necessity, of course of communication with the Paciﬁc was 
     
     admitted by every hon. member who had spoken on this subject. 
     
     The Government did not propose to build the railway 
     
     themselves, but it would be done by companies, and if the land 
     
     grants should prove nearly as valuable as it was alleged they 
     
     would, the cry of one hundred millions which was used to create 
     
     so much alarm would prove to be a mere bugbear. With regard 
     
     to the part of the line falling in Ontario he was not prepared to 
     
     speak, but with respect to the other portions he desired to say 
     
     something. The hon. gentleman here described the mode and 
     
     means by which the Paciﬁc Railway from Omaha to Sacramento 
     
     was built, shewing the companies, the land grants, and 
     
     Government Bond subsidies in aid, describing the character of 
     
     the country, and the difﬁculties which met the constructors of 
     
     the road, the unstable nature of the soil about the Missouri 
     
     River, the arid character of the American desert, and the Alkali 
     
     plains, the elevation of the passes of the Rocky Mountains, and 
     
     of the Sierra Nevada Range, and went on to explain how the 
     
     Government Bond subsidies were divided, increasing 
     
     proportionately with the cost of construction of different parts 
     
     thus preventing the Government aid being entirely used on the 
     
     easy gradient, and thereby obviating further calls on the 
     
     Government. The American Government had divided the 
     
     subsidy, giving one amount for the easy part of the line, and a 
     
     larger amount for the difﬁcult sections. The whole bond subsidy 
     
     amounted to fifty-eight millions, and in addition a land grant 
     
     was made of alternate lots of 20 miles along the route. The cost 
     
     of the entire road had also been largely increased to the extent 
     
     of twenty millions by a stipulation that no rails should be used 
     
     except those of <hi rendition="simple:italic">home</hi> make,—a limitation which would certainly 
     
     not be imposed by us—as our rule was to buy in the cheapest 
     
     market.

     Hon. Mr. McDOUGALL (Lanark North) said he supposed

     Hon. Mr. GRAY resumed his description of the construction of 
     
     the American line, and the difﬁculties met with in that work. He 
     
     quoted from a speech of the member for Lambton made last session 
     
     during the Manitoba debate, shewing that the Canadian line would 
     
     pass through an inﬁnitely better country than that through which the 
     
     American line had passed.

     Mr. MACKENZIE said his words had applied to the portion 
     
     lying between Red River and the Rocky Mountains.

            <p>
     Hon. Mr. GRAY said he admitted that he had spoken in that 
     
     limited sense, but that covered 1,400 miles of the distance. As the 
     
     American line had been built at an expense of sixty millions, what 
     
     fear need there be as to the cost of the Canadian line, which would 
     
     pass through an infinitely better country, and the elevation to be 
     
     attained would be much less. (The hon. gentleman here read 
     
     extracts of Cheadle &amp; Milton’s work, shewing that whereas the 
     
     highest elevation of the American line was 7,400 and 8,000 feet 
     
     above the level of the sea, the Jasper House or Yellow Head Pass 
     
     through the Rocky Mountains, with us was only 3,760 feet, with a 
     
     gradual slope on either side; and also showing the nature and 
     
     character of the country on this side of the Rocky Mountains, and of 
     
     the valley of the Fraser River on the other.) It had been alleged that 
     
     the line must necessarily be built within ten years, and that if a 
     
     company would not undertake it, the Government would be obliged 
     
     to do it. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Now, the Americans had built their line in three and a half years, 
     
     and could it be supposed that the Canadians were so inferior that 
     
     they could not build a line of comparatively easy construction in ten 
     
     years. And in the light of the experience of that country, how could 
     
     it be said companies would not be found to build the line. British 
     
     Columbia possessed every means of becoming one of the most 
     
     prosperous Provinces in the Dominion, and indeed its union had 
     
     been one of the stipulations of, and inducements for Confederation. 
     
     He then spoke of the prosperous condition of the Dominion at 
     
     present to show that Canada need have no fear of the responsibility 
     
     it was proposed to incur, and referred to statistics to prove his 
     
     position. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The Member for Durham West had based his statements that 
     
     Canada could not bear the burden to be laid on her, under the 
     
     impression that the Dominion would have to pay one hundred 
     
     millions, but that was not the case. There was a vast difference 
     
     between the burden of a work of that amount—say 100,000,000 
     
     borne by various parties—public Companies—land grants and aids 
     
     of different characters—and the cost of the same work borne by one 
     
     exchequer. It was not intended that the exchequer or revenues of 
     
     Canada should bear the charge of the work, but simply that they 
     
     would aid it. If Canada should refuse to give this aid, the work 
     
     would pass out of her hands, British Columbia would not be 
     
     included, and the Dominion, instead of becoming a great and 
     
     leading power on the continent, and advancing in material wealth 
     
     and prosperity, would revert to its old position of discontented and 
     
     opposing Provinces, small and insignificant—the worse for having 
     
     thrown away the opportunities which had been afforded her.

     Mr. JOLY said when he had listened to the discussion, he could 
     
     not help thinking of the fable of the frog and the ox. The frog had 
     
     admired the size of the ox, and deciding that it was its duty to 
     
     become as large as the ox, it went on swelling until it burst, and 
     
     when he had heard the description and glowing terms of the 
     
    <fw type="dateline">March 29, 1871</fw>
     

            <!--Milestone merged into previous para.-->

     Minister of Militia, he thought he could see the Dominion swell like 
     
     the frog. It was very fortunate the Paciﬁc made a boundary to the 
     
     land to be annexed, although it was true China and Japan were 
     
     beyond, and perhaps the Pacific might yet be made a Canadian sea. 
     
     When the Minister of Militia had named ﬁfty-two millions as the 
     
     cost of the railway, he could only have referred to the cost to the 
     
     Dominion, and in the same way the population had been much 
     
     exaggerated. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir GEORGE-É. CARTIER said he had stated the 
     
     population correctly at 63,000, being 15,000 to 17,000 Europeans, 
     
     some 5,000 Chinese and the remainder Indians. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. JOLY must, of course, admit his mistake. He could not 
     
     consider the railway a Canadian but an Imperial Policy, and, of 
     
     course, it was natural that England should desire to see British 
     
     North America confederated and independent of the United States, 
     
     and if that was her desire, the best thing she could do would be to 
     
     aid in constructing this line of communication. The great advantage 
     
     Canada possessed over the States was her freedom from debt and 
     
     taxation, but if, to the present debt of $100,000,000 was added 
     
     another $100,000,000 for the construction of the railway, the debt 
     
     of Canada would become in proportion almost as large as that of the 
     
     United States, and Canada would lose her only advantage. He came 
     
     to conclusion that an additional debt of $100,000,000 would be 
     
     mentioned on account of the construction of the railway, from the 
     
     remarks of the member of the St. John. The Americans had paid 
     
     ﬁfty-eight millions of dollars as a subsidy, and had made twice as 
     
     large a land grant; the money grant would have to be larger. For 
     
     years to come, the line could not pay a tenth part of its cost, and no 
     
     Company would undertake it unless they received every assistance, 
     
     for the line would not obtain anything like the trafﬁc that the Union 
     
     Pacific obtained, and he believed the result would not be that the 
     
     Government itself would have to build the line. As to the time that 
     
     would be required to build the line, if the same energy were shown 
     
     as had been exhibited in the construction of the lntercolonial, the 
     
     Pacific would take twenty years. Why not say to British Columbia, 
     
     “we are willing for you to join us, but we cannot pledge ourselves 
     
     to this heavy expenditure—but if British Columbia only wanted to 
     
     see which country, Canada or the States would give them the best 
     
     terms, he, for one, was not prepared to buy them that way.” The 
     
     present position of Canada and the States to each other could not 
     
     last much longer, and if more friendly relations should be 
     
     established, why should not Canada avail herself of the Northern 
     
     Pacific road until she was able to build a line for herself 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. JACKSON was glad to see the unanimity of belief that 
     
     union with British Columbia was a necessity, and that the 
     
     construction of a line of railway was also a necessity. It had been 
     
     conceded that the amount to be granted to British Columbia was not 
     
     extravagant, but objection was taken as to the mode of payment. 
     
     Objection had also been raised that the proposed representation was 
     
     too large for the population, but looking at the matter in a common 
     
     sense view only, although the abstract principle of 
     
     representation according to population might be right, he 
     
     thought area should enter into the arrangement, and he saw

               <fw type="dateline">March 29, 1871</fw>

     nothing in the objection. As to the objection of the railway 
     
     having to be constructed in ten years, British Columbia was to 
     
     be taken into the Union, and the understanding was that the 
     
     whole Dominion should be connected. The responsibility 
     
     might be great, but in all agreements certain conditions were 
     
     implied, which might operate to change the agreement. If the 
     
     present prosperity continued, there was no reason to doubt the 
     
     ability of the Government to construct the railway within ten 
     
     years, but if circumstances should prevent that, what danger 
     
     could ensue? He should certainly support the resolutions of the 
     
     Government on the grounds he had stated.

     Some years ago he had entertained doubts of the success of 
     
     Confederation, but he was very glad to see how satisfactory 
     
     the results had been. He thought the definitiveness of the 
     
     proposition for the construction of the line, would obtain for it 
     
     greater consideration and greater confidence on the part of 
     
     English capitalists. He would not try to foreshadow the future, 
     
     but there was every reason for hope. The member for 
     
     Lotbiniere had said that the increased responsibility would 
     
     make Canada’s debt equal to that of the United States, but the 
     
     view was most erroneous, for while the Canadian line would 
     
     open up a splendid country and consolidate the country, the 
     
     Americans had only destroyed property and desolated homes 
     
     without result. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. MILLS would not have spoken but for the remarks of 
     
     the member for St. John. That hon. gentleman entirely 
     
     misapprehended the system of Government provided by the 
     
     British North American Act. He disputed his reading of the 
     
     constitution as affecting powers and duties of Canada in 
     
     relation to the colonies to be admitted into the Union. He had 
     
     contended the Indians should be embraced in framing the basis 
     
     for representation. That had not, however, been done as 
     
     regards the other Provinces. The Indians did not enter into the 
     
     social bond, and could not stand on the same footing as the 
     
     white population. The member for St. John argued that 
     
     because the principle of representation by population had been 
     
     violated in the treatment of Manitoba, it should be in the case 
     
     of British Columbia, and he had stated representation by 
     
     population was not the principle established by the 
     
     constitution, but the Union Act plainly showed it was and the 
     
     representation was to be altered every ten years in harmony 
     
     with the growth of the country and population, and in a 
     
     prescribed relation to the sixty-ﬁve members always to be 
     
     possessed by Quebec. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     In answer to the member for St. John, he contended that the 
     
     phraseology of the Union Act proved that the terms applicable 
     
     to the four Provinces of the Confederation as to representation, 
     
     applied also to the Provinces after-admitted. The Union could 
     
     be extended only on the federal principle, and the principle he 
     
     now contended for governed his objections to the Manitoba 
     
     Bill last year. He held now as before that the very principle of 
     
     our constitution was violated in the terms we granted that

     Province last year, that we had no authority to grant her 
     
     representation beyond that to which by population she was 
     
     entitled. So much for the precedent cited by that hon. 
     
     gentleman. He did not believe British Columbia would 
     
     complain of our altering terms before us in obedience to our 
     
     reasonable wishes and interests. If she was prepared to accept 
     
     reasonable terms he would not oppose her entrance into the 
     
     Union. If she was not so prepared, it would simply show the 
     
     time had not come for her admission. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     As to the remark that we ought to be able to construct a 
     
     railroad in less than ten years, and that the Americans 
     
     constructed theirs in three years and a half, it was apparently 
     
     forgotten that their railroads previously extended a thousand 
     
     miles further west than ours, that they had thirty millions this 
     
     side of the Rocky Mountains against our four, and had a large 
     
     population on the Pacific coast and infinitely greater resources 
     
     on both sides of the Rocky Mountains than ours. He would 
     
     like to know how we could build it in ten years when at the 
     
     present rate of progress, and with our adequate means and 
     
     other advantages that Intercolonial would require seven years. 
     
     At its rate of construction, it would take 37 years to build the 
     
     Pacific Road. He was convinced we should not draw so largely 
     
     upon the future, should not incur obligations we had not 
     
     certainty of being able to meet. On this ground alone, were 
     
     there no other objections to the resolutions, he would be 
     
     disposed to oppose them. The geological survey of the country 
     
     was an incident of the local possession and management of the 
     
     lands, and it should be undertaken by the local authorities 
     
     alone. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     We had no power to enter upon this work, the proposal of 
     
     which was another instance of irregular or illegal Acts we 
     
     were asked to perform. He would oppose the resolutions and 
     
     support the very proper amendment before the House. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. LANGEVIN then proceeded to explain in French 
     
     the proposals and policy of the Government on this subject, 
     
     and to recite the circumstances that led to the submission of 
     
     this scheme, dating back to the period of Confederation. He 
     
     reminded the House that these terms had been accepted by the 
     
     Legislative Assembly of British Columbia on the 
     
     understanding that they would not be altered by the Parliament 
     
     of Canada. In reply to the hon. member for Sherbrooke and 
     
     other gentlemen, he contended that the present terms were not 
     
     less favourable to Canada than the former, because in the ﬁrst 
     
     instance the colony was to have four senators at Ottawa and 
     
     eight Commoners, while now she was allowed but three of the 
     
     former and six of the latter. With regard to the railway, he 
     
     urged that there was no comparison between the Intercolonial 
     
     and the Pacific road, because it would not be undertaken by 
     
     the Government but by a company upon the basis of a liberal 
     
     land grant and an annual payment of money within the means 
     
     of Canada, and without augmenting its debt. </p>

            <p>
     Hon. Mr. LANGEVIN: Who could doubt their ﬁnding a 
     
     company with the double inducement of land and money, 
     
     when in the States and other countries railways were begun 
     
     and completed on the basis of land grants only? We were 
     
     bound, irrespective of British Columbia, to construct a railway 
     
     to the Rocky Mountains, certainly through a magnificent 
     
     country for hundred of miles; but what would be the use of 
     
     stopping there? Would it not be to a certain extent money ill- 
     
     spent, when the road stopped short of the natural boundary of 
     
     the Dominion, of the natural ocean outlet on the Pacific? Our 
     
     interests undoubtedly dictated that prolongation. He 
     
     maintained that in a revenue point of view Canada would not 
     
     lose by this measure, for, as he had pointed out, the 
     
     consumption of dutiable goods per head of the population was 
     
     much greater that in Canada. There was already a population 
     
     of 60,000, including Chinese and Indians, many of whom were 
     
     civilized and useful inhabitants. He denied the statement of the 
     
     member for Lotbinière that we already owed $100,000,000, 
     
     our debt being but $80,000,000, and as the Government 
     
     intended having the railway built by a private company they 
     
     would incur nothing like another hundred millions of debt. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     As to the pension list, several of the recipients could be 
     
     made useful to the Dominion as public officers. It was absurd 
     
     to suppose Canada could depend on the American Northern 
     
     Pacific Railway, and if we wished to extend our population 
     
     and trade and colonize our vast Western region, we must 
     
     possess a railroad through our own territory, instead of 
     
     travelling westward by one 100 or 200 miles from our frontier. 
     
     It was necessary to satisfy the Columbians, as well as to give 
     
     conﬁdence to British capitalists, that a period should be ﬁxed 
     
     for the completion of the road; but if in seven or eight years it 
     
     should appear with representatives from that Province sitting 
     
     among us, that despite our good faith and utmost efforts it was 
     
     impossible to complete the work within the time named they 
     
     could not and would not ﬁnd fault with us. He did not 
     
     anticipate any failure, but looked at the worst contingency. He 
     
     believed it was our duty and our interest took to complete 
     
     Confederation and establish a British empire in North 
     
     America, with the freest institutions in the world, under the 
     
     British Flag now protecting us, and which would continue to 
     
     protect us so long as we desired. He believed his countrymen 
     
     of all origins and classes desired this result, and that triﬂing 
     
     difficulties would not induce them to abandon reasonable 
     
     effort for its attainment. British Columbia did not merit the 
     
     treatment proposed by the amendment and he hoped the House 
     
     would not refuse to adopt cheerfully the resolutions of the 
     
     Government. (<hi rendition="simple:italic">Cheers</hi>.) 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. SMITH (Westmorland) thought the subject was 
     
     one of the greatest magnitude, and Government ought to have 
     
     absolved all parties to allow every one to give the matter the 
     
     freest possible consideration. He had at ﬁrst done his best to 
     
     oppose Confederation but he was now friendly to the Union, 
     
    <fw type="dateline">March 29, 1871</fw> 
     
  
            <!--Milestone merged into previous para.-->

     and would be glad to see the whole of British North America 
     
     united. There were two very important considerations—one 
     
     was that there was a great departure from the principles of the 
     
     constitution in the matter of the representation. With regard to 
     
     the financial aspect, however, he could not but believe that 
     
     lasting injury would be done to the country by the expenditure 
     
     to be incurred. The cost of the railway could not be less than 
     
     $100,000,000, and it was equivalent to the Imperial 
     
     Government asking England to embark in an enterprise 
     
     involving a thousand millions. Was not the matter, therefore, 
     
     sufficiently grave to merit the most serious consideration—and 
     
     he entreated the Government to pause. The faith of the country 
     
     was pledged by the resolution to complete the railway within 
     
     ten years, no matter if the result should be ruin. No verbal 
     
     reservations could have effect, the written record alone could 
     
     hold, and the words of the resolution were clear, and if in two 
     
     years the railway was not commenced, British Columbia could 
     
     appeal to the Imperial Government. They had been told that 
     
     the expenditure would not burden the people, but could that be 
     
     believed, and no one would undertake to say that a Company 
     
     would undertake the work as a remunerative scheme, and 
     
     therefore sooner or later, the Government would have to pay 
     
     every dollar of the expense, and the contractors would want 
     
     the land as a profit. No one could suppose that even after the 
     
     road was built, it would pay one tenth of its working expenses, 
     
     and how, therefore, could British capitalists be expected to 
     
     undertake the work. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The Minister of Customs had intimated that if they did not 
     
     strike quickly, they would alienate British Columbia from the 
     
     enterprise, but was that an element for discussion; no, if such 
     
     were the case, the matter belonged to the Imperial Government 
     
     only. Was the House ready to involve the country in so large 
     
     an increase of debt? That debt was already $100,000,000 and 
     
     there were many burdens that would arise from the 
     
     Intercolonial and other works. The Union Act had provided for 
     
     the extension of the Canal system and that had only been 
     
     delayed because of the deficient state of the ﬁnances of the 
     
     Dominion. The cost of the railway could not be named, it 
     
     might be much greater than the amount named and yet <hi rendition="simple:italic">coûte 
     
     que coûte</hi> the country would stand pledged to complete it. He 
     
     should oppose the measure because it would impose burdens 
     
     on the people that they were not able to bear and would 
     
     involve the country in ruin and disaster. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. RYMAL like the previous speaker, had not much faith in 
     
     the blessings of Confederation, and should oppose the present 
     
     measure, because he believed it violated their constitutional rights. 
     
     In the Confederation scheme the principle of representation by 
     
     population had been conceded, and yet that principle was now 
     
     being violated. The Minister of Militia himself represented many 
     
     times the whole number of white men in British Columbia, and 
     
     there were many similar cases in the House, and the thing was so 
     
     absurd and unjust that if it were the only objection, he would 
     
     oppose the scheme for while he asked nothing more than justice, he 
     
     would take nothing less. </p>

     As to the financial aspect the responsibilities about being 
     
     incurred, added to the cost of lntercolonial and the enlargement of 
     
     the canals, a debt of $300,000,000, would be incurred, which at five 
     
     per cent would involve an annual expenditure of $15,000,000. 
     
     Added to this there would be the yearly and ever increasing burden 
     
     of maintaining the railway, all of which would fall on the poor tax 
     
     payers. To use a well known phrase, he would say “whither are we 
     
     drifting,” and the only answer was that bankruptcy and ruin stared 
     
     them in the face, and the credit and good reputation of Canada 
     
     would be a thing of the past. The Minister of Finance had well nigh 
     
     ruined the country before, and he would do so again, if the present 
     
     Ministry retained their seats, and were led on by the Minister of 
     
     Finance. Language failed him to express his detestation of the 
     
     Government that thus prejudiced the good interest of the country, 
     
     and it appeared to him that the prospects of the Confederation were 
     
     being destroyed.

     Hon. Mr. DUNKlN said the question proposed was the adoption 
     
     of resolutions for the admission of British Columbia into the Union, 
     
     and the objection raised in the amendment was a very narrow one. 
     
     No sufficient reason was given for the postponement proposed, 
     
     which was in effect the adjournment of the whole scheme. He 
     
     referred to the circumstances connected with Confederation, and the

     feelings with which it was regarded at ﬁrst, and after its 
     
     accomplishment. The experiment was tried, one of its express 
     
     objects being to bring in the British North West Territory, and 
     
     construct a Railroad from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and were they 
     
     now to hesitate, letting <hi rendition="simple:italic">I dare not wait upon I would</hi>. He argued that 
     
     British Columbia and the North West could not be retained without 
     
     a railway. They had already incurred the greater part of the 
     
     expenditure, independent of British Columbia, and they must 
     
     advance; they could not recede. Without executing the policy these 
     
     Resolutions embodies we should expose ourselves, our present 
     
     constitution and national position. Not to advance was to go back 
     
     the whole distance. He argued that the road could be built to the 
     
     Pacific at a cheaper rate than one to the Rocky Mountains only, and 
     
     possibly for a smaller amount than to this point.
