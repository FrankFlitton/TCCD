     LACHINE CANAL BRIDGE 
     
    </head>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. HOLTON asked if the Grand Trunk Railway had 
     
     asked permission to erect an additional bridge on or near the 
     
     Lachine Canal, at the Wellington Bridge, Montreal, and if so, when 
     
     the permission was applied for and when granted. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. LANGEVIN said the Railway company was allowed 
     
     to cross the canal with a swing bridge at Wellington Street, to be 
     
     built at the place and in the stead of the existing bridge, and subject 
     
     to the conditions he would lay before the House. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. HOLTON: When was the permission applied for, and 
     
     when granted? 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. LANGEVIN: Applied for on 17th January, 1871, and 
     
     granted 28th January.

     GRAND TRUNK RETURNS

            <p>
     Mr. MACKENZIE moved for returns of statements, showing 
     
     the gross earnings of the Grand Trunk Railway during certain 
     
     years. — Carried.

     NORTH WEST INSTRUCTIONS 
     
    </head>
   
            <p>
     Mr. MACKENZIE moved an address for copies of all 
     
     instructions to Lieutenant-Govemor Archibald, also copies of all 
     
     reports and ofﬁcial correspondence between the Lieutenant- 
     
     Governor and the Dominion Government from the date of his 
     
     appointment. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD said that while no objection 
     
     would be urged to furnishing the returns asked for, it would be as 
     
     well to mention exactly the papers which were wanted. There was a 
     
     very large amount of correspondence continually passing between 
     
    <fw type="num">13</fw>
     the Local Government and the Dominion Government, only a 
     
     portion of which could be of any service to the hon. member. 
     
    </p>
            <!--Milestone merged into previous para.-->
            <!--Para "
     the Local Government and the Dominion Government, only a 
     
     porti..." merged into previous para.-->
   
            <p>
     Mr. MACKENZIE said he only wished to obtain that portion 
     
     relative to the new system of Government, the division of the 
     
     Province into electoral districts, and everything, in fact, connected 
     
     with the new order of things. He did not want the formal 
     
     correspondence. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir GEORGE-É. CARTIER called the attention of the 
     
     hon. member to the fact that Lieutenant-Governor Archibald was 
     
     the Governor of the North West Territory as well as of Manitoba, 
     
     and correspondence relevant to both capacities should be included. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The motion was amended in accordance with the suggestion, and 
     
     carried.

            <p>
     Hon. Sir FRANCIS HINCKS submitted the public accounts for the year.
     
    </p>
            <p>(<hi rendition="simple:italic">Applause</hi>) </p>
    
<p> Mr. MACKENZIE: It will save us a great deal of trouble. 
     </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir FRANCIS HlNCKS also laid on the table details of 
     
     expenditure for the defence of the country. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. MACKENZIE: Perhaps the hon. member will give us 
     
     details of all the expenditure from the fund for unforeseen expenses. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir FRANCIS HINCKS said they would be submitted in a 
     
     few days.

     BRITISH COLUMBIA CORRESPONDENCE 
     
     MOTIONS 
     
    </head>
   
            <p>
     Mr. MACKENZIE moved for an address for copies of all 
     
     correspondence between the Government and British Columbia, its 
     
     delegates, or the Imperial Government relative to the admission of 
     
     such colony into the Dominion', also copies of all orders in council 
     
     or other documents relating to such negotiation.—Carried. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD said all correspondence 
     
     would be brought down by message, and the motion was 
     
     unnecessary.
