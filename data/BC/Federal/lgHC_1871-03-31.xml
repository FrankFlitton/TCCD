            <p>
     Hon. Sir GEORGE-É. CARTIER moved the reception of the 
     
     report of the Committee of the Whole on certain resolutions 
     
     respecting the admission of British Columbia into Union with 
     
     Canada. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. MACKENZIE said that in the speech of the Hon. Minister 
     
     of Militia, the statement had been made that one-third of the land in 
     
     British Columbia was fit for agriculture. But it was admitted that 
     
     this statement embraced the Island of Vancouver. Now, in dealing 
     
     with this question, the Island must not be taken into consideration at 
     
     all. From all the evidence he could obtain respecting the main land, 
     
     not one-fifth of it was available for settlement by farmers, and the 
     
     remaining four-fifths through which the road was likely to run, had 
     
     yet to be proved good for mining purposes. It was simply absurd to 
     
     put the price of that land at $1 dollar per acre. The Hon. Minister of 
     
     Customs, in his speech the other evening, had advocated entering 
     
     into an obligation which he could not say the country would be able 
     
     to perform. It had been said the other evening over and over again 
     
     during the debate, that he (Mr. Mackenzie) had stated that he 
     
     regarded the construction of the Pacific Railway as a pressing 
     
     political necessity. He denied having made any such a statement. 
     
     He would admit, however, that he would be willing to subject the 
     
     country to some inconvenience in order to obtain communication 
     
     with the Pacific through Canadian territory. He was in favour of 
     
     opening up communication immediately through the country lying 
     
     between the head of Lake Superior and Red River. From that point 
     
     to the Rocky Mountains the way was comparatively easy and quite 
     
     clear enough for the use of emigrants passing into the North West 
     
     country. On the Pacific slope, there was no doubt that it would be 
     
     necessary to expend large sums of money from time to time as the 
     
     Financial condition of the Dominion permitted in opening up a 
     
     good route to this side of the Rocky Mountains. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     But this country should not be bound to construct, within so short 
     
     a time, such a gigantic work. The Grand Trunk had never yet paid 
     
     one per cent on the capital expended on it, though passing through a 
     
     well peopled country and having no scarcity of traffic, yet the hon. 
     
     gentlemen opposite wished to lead the House to believe that this 
     
     Pacific Railway which was to run for 2,500 miles through an 
     
     uninhabited wilderness, would be a paying enterprise. We had 
     
     unfortunately 200 mile lying between the head of Lake Superior 
     
     and Winnipeg, which was an uninhabitable desert. Now, he would 
     
     recommend a cheap narrow gauge railway with steamers on the 
     
     smaller lakes, as the proper means of communication with the open 
     
     prairie extending west of Fort Garry and through which it would be 
     
     unnecessary to construct a road for years to come. He considered 
     
     this attempt as one of the most foolish things that could be 
     
     imagined—and what was it for? In order to get some 10,000 people 
     
     into the Union, they were actually agreeing to pay $10,000 a head 
     
     on their account. 
     
    </p>
   
            <fw type="dateline">March 31, 1871</fw>

<p>
     Such terms argued either insane recklessness on the part of the 
     
     Government and their supporters, or a painful want of patriotism, 
     
     which would damage the country and the character of the hon. 
     
     Minister of Militia. For thirty years to come it would be 
     
     unnecessary to construct the greater portion of this line. The only 
     
     part of the road which would need to be constructed immediately 
     
     was in British Columbia itself. He would be prepared to consider 
     
     that as soon as estimates of the cost, &amp;c., should be submitted to 
     
     this House. Holding these views, he moved that all the words after 
     
     “that” be omitted, and the following inserted: “having regard to 
     
     the vast importance of the questions involved in the said 
     
     Resolutions, (including the obligation to construct within ten years 
     
     the Pacific Railway, the cost of which is estimated to exceed one 
     
     hundred millions of dollars), time should be afforded to the people 
     
     and their representatives for consultation before coming to a final 
     
     decision; and that the consideration of the said Resolutions should, 
     
     therefore, be postponed to the next Session.”

            <p>
     Hon. Sir GEORGE-É. CARTIER said that he had hoped after 
     
     the discussion of the last three days all the arguments against this 
     
     measure would have been exhausted, and that he would not be 
     
     called upon to speak again. But after the remarks just made by the 
     
     hon. member for Lambton, he felt called upon to make some reply. 
     
     He was willing to give credit to the hon. members who opposed this 
     
     measure, for sincerity. He (Hon. Sir George-E. Cartier) was much 
     
     surprised, at the line of argument which they had followed. He was 
     
     surprised that the member for Larnbton should try to meet such a 
     
     great question on the mere ground of cost. He admitted that the 
     
     Union was a necessity and that the railway also was a necessity, but 
     
     the honorable gentleman objected to be tied down to a specified 
     
     time. He objected to being bound to build a line of 2,500 miles in 
     
     ten years—but in past years even when the country was new and 
     
     with comparatively few resources she had built 2,000 miles in eight 
     
     years. Had Canada been ruined by those works, had her agricultural 
     
     interests suffered on this account. And in addition to this, Canada 
     
     had built the Victoria Bridge at Montreal, itself equal to 500 miles 
     
     of railway, and other large bridges in different parts of the country. 
     
     Had she suffered from building those works? No. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     It was true that the G.T.R. proprietors were not receiving so good 
     
     a return as he would like. If the railway was practicable at all, every 
     
     one would admit that it could well be built in ten years. If there had 
     
     been any complaint it should have been that the time allowed was 
     
     too long. When it had been proposed to extend the Customs Laws 
     
     of Canada to Manitoba, it had been objected to as unfair, and that 
     
     the people of that country were beyond the circle of Canada, and 
     
     therefore a delay of three years had been allowed until the countries 
     
     could be more effectively joined and connected. Let the member for 
     
     Lambton and his friends read their speeches on the North West 
     
     question. Then no expense was too great, no haste too much, no 
     
     trouble too great, if only the North West could be acquired, but now 
     
     they said don’t go so fast. He wanted to get hold of the Red River 
     
     country at any cost, and now from the very same mouth that had 
     
     spoken of the fertility of the North West, they heard the very 
     
     opposite. He had then been willing to send any number of men to 
     
     obtain possession of the country. </p>

<p>
     Mr. MACKENZIE had stated his willingness to send any 
     
     number of men not to acquire the country, but to establish the 
     
     supremacy of law over insurrection.

            <p>
     Hon. Sir GEORGE-É. CARTIER resumed the comparison of 
     
     the expressions of the member for Lambton last year, and this, then 
     
     he had stated distinctly that the acquisition of the North West would 
     
     be the only way to obtain British Columbia, but now he did not 
     
     want the Union. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. MACKENZIE denied this; he was as much in favour of 
     
     Union as ever. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir GEORGE-É. CARTIER said the member for 
     
     Lambton had stated distinctly that in swallowing the Quebec 
     
     scheme he had made a mistake, and now the great Reformer of 
     
     Upper Canada, the representative of everything good, the 
     
     representative of the great Party of Progress, said no, we must pull 
     
     up, we must stop. The Government were really the Party of 
     
     Progress and action, and the member for Lambton, and those who 
     
     had followed him would at the next election be taken to task by 
     
     their constituents for having in order to make a case against the 
     
     Government made the humiliating confession that they had made a 
     
     mistake in accepting the scheme of Confederation. The member for 
     
     Lambton in his argument had said that between Thunder Bay and 
     
     Fort Garry there was no soil and the railway could not be built but 
     
     that question could be settled by Parliament hereafter, when the 
     
     railway scheme should be submitted. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. MACKENZIE: What about the obligations? 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir GEORGE-E. CARTIER said, suppose the hon. 
     
     gentleman undertook an obligation, could he be obliged to fulfil it, 
     
     if he should be prevented by unforeseen circumstances. No one 
     
     could be compelled to perform an impossibility. The time was too 
     
     long, and the objection could only come from an economical 
     
     Scotchman, and he would predict that in a very few years the hon. 
     
     gentleman would be one of the most ardent supporters of the 
     
     railway. He had not been sorry to lose his motion yesterday, and he 
     
     was not sincere in his present proposal. That proposal was to entail 
     
     a delay of seven months; what object could there be in so doing? 
     
     The matter had already been discussed sufficiently, and the time 
     
     was now come for settlement, and he would say that without the 
     
     prospect of British Columbia, they would never have persuaded a 
     
     majority of the House to consent to acquire one inch of the North 
     
     West. For the sake of the member for Lambton himself he trusted 
     
     his speech would not be well reported, and especially that part in 
     
     which he had spoken of the character of the land in most 
     
     disadvantageous terms, and yet he said he was in favour of building 
     
     a railway as soon as possible. If the land was as described by the 
     
     hon. member, why should a railway be built at all? He reiterated 10 
     
     years was too long, and as to the mode of building the railway that 
     
     would all be submitted to Parliament, and within the next few days 
     
     the Government would ask for an appropriation for the preliminary 
     
     survey. He maintained that Canada was better able to-day to 
     
     undertake the Pacific railway than she had been years ago to 
     
    <fw type="num">311</fw>

            <!--Milestone merged into previous para.-->
            <!--Para "

     advance fifteen millions to the Grand Trunk. The whole affair of the 
     
     hundred millions was a bugbear. There was no such thing as 
     
     incurring that debt in a few years—it was an absurdity to make such 
     
     a statement. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The policy was purposely to retain the lands of the country in 
     
     order to build railways and open ways of communication. Canada 
     
     would not have to bear the expenditure alone. British Columbia 
     
     would be represented in the House, and would be equally interested 
     
     in the work. Speaking of the cost of the railway, he maintained the 
     
     gentlemen on the other side had played the parts of old nurses, but 
     
     the children on his side of the House were not so easily frightened. 
     
     He spoke of the North Pacific, quoting from a statement showing 
     
     the whole length to be 2,000 miles, and the entire estimated cost 
     
     seventy-six million dollars in greenbacks. lt had been objected that 
     
     the estimate for the Canadian Pacific might not be correct. He 
     
     admitted that, but the argument worked both ways. The cost might 
     
     prove very much below the estimate, and an immense amount of 
     
     land was reserved to cover it. He quoted a statement showing the 
     
     average cost of railway communication in the United States, 
     
     showing 2,600 miles of line in operation, the average cost being, in 
     
     the different States, from $25,000 to $33,000 per mile. It was 
     
     admitted that there was a large extent of prairie land to be crossed, 
     
     and the smaller expenditure necessary there would leave means to 
     
     overcome difficulties in other portions. The hon. members opposite 
     
     had been sufficiently unpatriotic to represent the country as that it 
     
     would never attract immigration, and he quoted from the 
     
     proceedings of the House of Representatives of the State of 
     
     Minnesota speaking of the Canadian line as practicable, and the 
     
     territories of the North West and British Columbia, as fertile, and 
     
     the most valuable of the Continent, and yet men in this country, the 
     
     leaders of their party, did their utmost to decry their country. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. MACKENZIE denied that he had done anything to decry 
     
     the country. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir GEORGE-É. CARTIER was glad he had given the 
     
     hon. member an opportunity to correct himself. He quoted from an 
     
     article from an American paper, copied into the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi> 
     
     characterising the Saskatchewan country as most valuable in soil 
     
     and minerals, and British Columbia as possessing rich mineral 
     
     resources, magnificent climate and ﬁne soil. It was fortunate that 
     
     the truth could be ascertained even if it came from opponents. The 
     
     Government had stated again and again that they themselves would 
     
     not build the railway, but that it would be constructed by 
     
     Companies assisted by such subsidies as would not oppress the 
     
     people. It was absurd to speak of building a line to the Rocky 
     
     Mountains only, a vote could not be obtained for such a purpose, 
     
     but when it was proposed to extend the line to the ocean, the 
     
     question assumed a very different aspect. Many great works had 
     
     been accomplished in England, but what were any compared with 
     
     the scheme now proposed, and he could say that already there 
     
     was a motion in England to assist the measure, and there would 
     
     doubtless be capitalists to take the matter in hand, and 
     
     everything was in favor of the successful construction of the 
     
     road. The Minister of Justice had telegraphed him to present his 
     
     congratulations to his friends on the vote of yesterday. </p>

<p>Mr. BLAKE said the member for Lambton (Mr. Mackenzie) 
     
     in his amendment had pointed out the importance of the matter 
     
     the grave nature of the burden proposed to be incurred, and 
     
     therefore suggested the postponement of the consideration of 
     
     the matter, and it was impossible to answer those statements. 
     
     Much had been heard that the railway would not cost the 
     
     Dominion in cash $100,000,000, but no one attempted to deny 
     
     that the railway would cost that amount and where could the 
     
     money come from but from the resources of the country. It 
     
     might be in lands and it might be in money, but the result was 
     
     the same, and the only argument the Minister of Militia had 
     
     used was to speak of the American lines and contrast 
     
     greenbacks with gold. He complained of the system of alternate 
     
     sections not being followed in land grants. The argument 
     
     seemed to be that they would not be compelled to perform 
     
     impossibilities, but an honest man would fulfil an obligation, 
     
     though the result might be bankruptcy. 1f rashly the national 
     
     credit and faith were pledged to build that road in ten years, he 
     
     said that any one who voted for that obligation with the mental 
     
     reservation that they would not be compelled to fulfil the 
     
     obligation unless such should be desirable was a base man. The 
     
     spirit and the letter of the bond were alike binding, and the 
     
     question was most serious.

     The Bill was not one that could be repealed but was an 
     
     irrevocable determination to build the road in ten years 
     
     whatever the hazard, whatever the results, and should they not 
     
     seek to communicate with their people before arriving at this 
     
     irrevocable determination. It had been urged in order to secure 
     
     votes that there was a reserve power of repudiation, but if the 
     
     obligation was undertaken, the people would hold themselves 
     
     bound by it, and could gentlemen be prepared to meet an 
     
     indignant people if they incurred this responsibility without 
     
     consulting those they represented, and if the gentlemen did so 
     
     act, though they might go back to their people, they would not 
     
     come back to that House. The question was whether the debt of 
     
     the country should, at a stroke, be doubled, or whether they 
     
     should have an opportunity of consulting their people before 
     
     taking such a step. They had been urged to haste, but he 
     
     maintained that there had been too much haste in bringing 
     
     about Confederation already, and he was not anxious to ruin 
     
     entirely that portion of the scheme which had been too hastily 
     
     consummated. He had not heard what harm could result from 
     
     postponement and as to the argument that British Columbia was 
     
     hanging in the balance, he would say that while England was 
     
     true to herself, the result did not lie with British Columbia, and 
     
     therefore time for consideration should not be refused.

     Hon. Mr. TILLEY said it was a great advantage to be able to 
     
     hear both sides of a question, but he could see no very great 
     
     difference in the proposition of the Government and the 
     
     amendment proposed. The hon. member for Lambton after his 
     
     defeat last night was obliged to adopt the more successful stand 
     
     which had been taken by the hon. member for Dundas. There 
     
     was no talk about the necessity of this delay from the hon. 
     
     gentleman opposite before this evening. It was all very well to 
     
    <fw type="dateline">
     March 31, 1871</fw>
            <!--Milestone merged into previous para.-->
            <!--Para "

     ask for this delay now, but the scheme had been before the 
     
     people and had been discussed in the papers for months. The 
     
     terms were published in Toronto papers three months ago, and, 
     
     in fact, the Union had been talked of ever since the 
     
     commencement of the Confederation. In reply to the arguments 
     
     of the hon. members opposite, he said that a grant of $10,000 
     
     per mile in addition to the land grant would place the 
     
     construction of the railway beyond the possibility of a doubt. 
     
     There could be no difficulty in disposing of the lands at a fair 
     
     price. The fertile belt was spoken of by the American writers 
     
     who had visited it, as being of immense extent and of great 
     
     fertility. The Northern Pacific railway looked to it for a portion 
     
     of their future trade. It was, therefore, in the interest of this 
     
     Dominion to construct a road through our own territory to the 
     
     Pacific.

     Hon. Mr. McDOUGALL (Lanark North) said the House 
     
     should not be led away by claptrap speeches from the hon. 
     
     gentleman opposite. Let them look at the facts. Here was a 
     
     statement of Mr. Hind, an officer appointed by this Government, 
     
     who explored the North West, and submitted his report thereon. 
     
     This gentleman stated that in the whole of the fertile belt there 
     
     were not 40,000,000 acres of available land. Taking a fertile belt 
     
     in the Rocky Mountains which was not mentioned in that report, 
     
     to contain 10,000,000 acres more, there were but 50,000,000 
     
     acres of any commercial or exchangeable value, in the North 
     
     West. Where then were the Government lands to come from 
     
     after granting large sections to the railway? The experience of 
     
     the United States had shown that it was not in the interest of a 
     
     country to grant its unsettled lands in large blocks to private 
     
     companies. The proposition before the House was to give all the 
     
     valuable lands of the North West to a company which was not 
     
     yet formed. After the experience of English capitalists on 
     
     Canadian railways, it was not likely that capital could be got to 
     
     construct this railway. The money must be had in some way 
     
     even at the risk of involving the Dominion in ruin. In reply to 
     
     the statement of the Hon. Minister of Customs that this question 
     
     had been before the public for some time, he would refer the 
     
     hon. gentleman to the files of papers in the reading room. If he 
     
     would look at them he would see that the country was startled at 
     
     the gigantic proportions of this scheme. On the 27th of that 
     
     month, the <hi rendition="simple:italic">ipsissima verba</hi> of the scheme were presented to this 
     
     House, and that was the first time the public had an opportunity 
     
     of passing judgment on it. It was only after it was taken up and 
     
     discussed in this House the other day, that it might be said to 
     
     have been placed before the people. Could the hon. gentleman 
     
     then deny that delay should be granted before passing this 
     
     measure. It had not been presented to the House in the 
     
     constitutional manner and it was only right to give the people an 
     
     opportunity to express their approval or disapproval of it.

     representation in the House of Commons is enormously in excess of

     Mr. JONES (Leeds North and Grenville North) said though 
     
     both sides deprecated the party considerations, he had never heard a 
     
     question made so completely one of party. He did not think the 
     
     country was in a position to undertake the expenditure proposed. He 
     
     considered the Imperial Government ought to share in the expense 
     
     of any scheme for opening up the North West. He maintained that 
     
     the country was not suitable for settlement, or the present 
     
     population would have been much larger. He objected to the 
     
     Indians being taken into account, as they had done but little good to 
     
     Canada. He was in favor of the consideration of the matter being 
     
     postponed and should vote for the amendment.

     Mr. BOLTON in explaining the reference made to him by the 
     
     Minister of Customs, said he had not charged him with making 
     
     reckless statements, but that while giving him and the Government 
     
     every credit for being in earnest in desiring to construct the road, he 
     
     thought it very doubtful whether a company would be found to 
     
     undertake it.

     Mr. MACKENZIE’S amendment was then put, and the

            <p>
     Mr. CARTWRIGHT believe that the Government had been led 
     
     into the inconceivable blunder of naming a period for the 
     
     construction of the road and the amendment he was about to 
     
     propose differed from others in these respects, it did not interfere 
     
     with the pledge to commence the railway, and only pledged that 
     
     they would use their utmost exertions to go on with the work as fast 
     
     as practicable, and it need involve but a very short delay. He moved

     Mr. BLAKE moved in amendment to leave out all the words

     a tract of waste land on the route of the proposed Pacific Railway to 
     
     aid in its construction, while any such land required for that purpose
