     BRITISH COLUMBIA 
     
    </head>
   
            <p>
     Mr. JONES (Halifax) resumed the debate on the Bill to admit 
     
     British Columbia into the Dominion. He moved that the following 
     
     words be inserted after the word “purpose” in the amendment: 
     
     “The proposed engagements respecting the said Pacific Railway 
     
     would, in the opinion of this House, press too heavily on the 
     
     resources of the Dominion.” He argued that the Government might 
     
     well hesitate to enter into such engagements after the fears and 
     
     doubts expressed by the hon. member for Sherbrooke and other 
     
     fathers of the Confederation. But, the Government would do well to 
     
     hesitate if they desired to consummate the Union. There were other 
     
     colonies to be added to the Dominion. Newfoundland and Prince 
     
     Edward Island had yet to be brought in and it was not likely that 
     
     they could be induced to join the Confederation under less 
     
     advantageous terms than were now offered to the Pacific Colony. 
     
     Hon. members opposite argued that if the Dominion was not 
     
     immediately extended to the Pacific, the Western colony would be 
     
     absorbed into the American Union, but the hon. members were 
     
     adopting the very measures which would promote that movement. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The strongest argument against annexation had always been that 
     
     our taxes were light, that while the Americans had a debt amounting 
     
     to $60 per head, ours was not quite $27 per head of our population. 
     
     Let these engagements be entered into by the Dominion, which 
     
     were now before the House, and the result would be to leave us 
     
     with a heavier debt in proportion to our resources than at present 
     
     weigh down the American Union. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The cause of our prosperity hitherto had been the contrast 
     
     between the United States and the Dominion, but the Government 
     
     proposed to reverse the present position of the two countries. While 
     
     the Americans were paying off their debt and reducing their taxes, 
     
     Canada was about to incur liabilities too great for her to bear. He 
     
     referred to the immense charge which the construction of the 
     
     Pacific Railway would bring on the country. He asked the House to 
     
     take a business view of this engagement, and ask themselves should 
     
     the Dominion undertake it. (<hi rendition="simple:italic">Hear, hear</hi>.) This extravagant proposal 
     
     was the natural sequence of the Finance Minister’s budget speech in 
     
     which that hon. member had spoken of the advantages of a great 
     
     national debt, and quoted from Macaulay in support of this view. 
     
    <fw type="dateline">March 30, 1871</fw>
            <!--Milestone merged into previous para.-->
            <!--Para "
     March 30, 1871 
     
    ..." merged into previous para.-->
   
          
     Hon. Sir FRANCIS HlNCKS said he had not advocated the 
     
     creation of a national debt, nor had he quoted from Macaulay in 
     
     support of such a view. He had merely quoted the passage referred 
     
     to, to show how the great resources of England had enabled her to 
     
     surmount the difficulties of a great national debt. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. JONES (Halifax): Then why refer to it at all. If the Hon. 
     
     Finance Minister had no intention to foreshadow the creation of a 
     
     great debt, why quote the passage? There was no doubt that the hon. 
     
     gentleman had that end in view, and the House should unite in 
     
     opposing such a suicidal policy. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BODWELL in seconding the amendment of the hon. 
     
     member for Halifax, spoke at considerable length against incurring 
     
     the heavy liabilities which the construction of a Pacific railway 
     
     would cause. He denied that there was any danger that British 
     
     Columbia would be annexed to the United States if it were not 
     
     brought into the Confederation. Did hon. members opposite 
     
     suppose that Great Britain would allow the republic to absorb any 
     
     portion of Her Majesty’s possessions without a struggle? If the 
     
     cause was so weak that the government was obliged to resort to 
     
     such an argument in order to coerce their followers into voting for 
     
     this measure, it would be better to drop it altogether. He quoted 
     
     from the speech of the hon. member for Brome in the report of the 
     
     Confederation debate to show how some of the advocates of this 
     
     measure had once been most bitterly opposed to Confederation. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. MORRIS said it was most surprising, in looking back 
     
     on the past history of Canada, to see what great tasks had been 
     
     accomplished. The government had been taunted time after time 
     
     with not being sincere in the great work of building up a British 
     
     power on the Continent, but they could turn to their record, and 
     
     challenge their opponents on the other side of the House, by what 
     
     they had really done. Was it nothing that the Dominion already 
     
     stretched from the Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains! And now the 
     
     question was whether they should or whether they should not make 
     
     what had once been considered a dream a living reality, by doing 
     
     their utmost to weld the provinces from one ocean to the other into 
     
     one solid Dominion. He was surprised at the course taken by some 
     
     hon. gentlemen in the present debate, and especially at that taken by 
     
     the hon. member for Sherbrooke, who had formerly taken the 
     
     deepest interest in the question, and had spoken most earnestly in 
     
     favour of the union now proposed; and he was more than surprised 
     
     at the course of the hon. member for Lambton, who, though a later 
     
     convert to the benefits of Confederation, had, with his party, stated 
     
     that he should set himself to assist to establish and consummate the 
     
     work. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     But now, after speaking so often of his zeal for union, placed on 
     
     record a motion which, while admitting the Pacific Railway to be an 
     
     “urgent political necessity,” attempted to prevent the House from 
     
     entering on the discussion of, and adopting the proposed terms of 
     
     union. The member for Sherbrooke had dealt with the matter on a 
     
     broader basis than had more recently been introduced into the 
     
     debate, and, while admitting that he had no quarrel with the amount 
     
     of subsidy to be granted to British Columbia, stated that he would

     have preferred the terms originally proposed by British Columbia to 
     
     those now proposed by the Government. He was sure, however, that 
     
     that preference would not be shared by the House or the country. 
     
     The original terms had provided the building of a coach road within 
     
     three years of union, and that the railway also should be built as 
     
     early as possible, with a specified expenditure of a million a year. 
     
     The member for Lambton stated that he had never contemplated 
     
     anything more than a road from Lake Superior, but of what benefit 
     
     would such a road as that be. 
     
    </p>

            <p>
     He also told the House that he was opposed to locking up the 
     
     lands of the country by handing them over to a company, but he 
     
     (Hon. Mr. Morris) maintained that the course being pursued by that 
     
     hon. gentleman would lock up the lands for ever. How could the 
     
     lands be available for settlement and cultivation unless facility of 
     
     access was provided? The Illinois road, which had been used by the 
     
     hon. gentleman as an illustration of the danger of locking up lands 
     
     by handing them over to a company, was a proof that the very 
     
     reverse was the case, for the results of that road were that Illinois 
     
     was peopled rapidly, and the lands, instead of being locked up, were 
     
     almost entirely disposed of, for out of a grant of two and a half 
     
     millions of acres, only half a million remained in the hands of the 
     
     company. He asked the House seriously the nature and character of 
     
     the land proposed to be acquired. That land consisted of the United 
     
     Province of British Columbia and Vancouver’s Island, and no one, 
     
     who understood the matter, could deny that the addition of that 
     
     province would increase enormously the wealth, the resources, and 
     
     the prosperity of the Dominion. He had several extracts from works 
     
     on the country, showing its valuable nature and character, and 
     
     thought the member for Lambton was not justified in the remarks 
     
     he had used to the effect of there being scarcely any arable land in 
     
     the whole of British Columbia. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. MACKENZIE stated that what he had said was that after 
     
     descending the slopes of the Rocky Mountains, the country was the 
     
     roughest on the continent. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. MORRIS thought the construction he had put on the 
     
     hon. member’s remarks was not very far wrong, but he could state 
     
     on the undisputable authority of Mr. Trutch, the Surveyor General 
     
     of British Columbia, that taking the whole of British Columbia and 
     
     Vancouver Island fully one-third, or about 50,000,000 of acres was 
     
     good farming land, while the whole acreage of Ontario was 
     
     77,000,000 acres. It appeared to him that throughout the whole 
     
     debate a strange fallacy had existed. The Railway had been spoken 
     
     of as a mere bargain to induce British Columbia to enter the Union, 
     
     whereas that work was of more importance to Canada than it was to 
     
     British Columbia, for, having already acquired the great North West 
     
     they were compelled by force of circumstances to go forward and 
     
     render it a valuable acquisition, and he was convinced that if the 
     
     House turned its back on British Columbia by adopting the 
     
     amendment of the member for Lambton, it would do a grievous 
     
     injury to the cause of Confederation which might prove irreparable. 
     
     The present position of Canada was analogous to that of the States 
     
     some years ago, when that country, recognizing the importance and 
     
     necessity of communication from one side of its territory to the 
     
    <fw type="num">299</fw>

     other, both as a bond of union between the people of the east and 
     
     west, and as a means of securing the vast trade between Europe and 
     
     Asia, had taken steps which in a short time would result in three 
     
     different lines from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and the reasons that 
     
     had urged America should be equally powerful with Canada, and he 
     
     believed the Canadian line could be constructed in a satisfactory 
     
     manner, by means of the proposed land grand without in the least 
     
     degree overburdening the people. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The House in the course of the debate had rung with cries that a 
     
     debt of a $100 million was being incurred, but the speakers knew 
     
     well that by means of the land, the line could be constructed 
     
     without any approach to a burden that the people could not bear, 
     
     and no Ministry would ever dare to propose to incur such a debt as 
     
     had been spoken of in this case. The Northern Pacific was being 
     
     constructed on a land grand only, and could it be doubted therefore, 
     
     that Canada, with better lands and fewer difficulties, would be able 
     
     to devise such a scheme as would attract foreign capital, as the 
     
     Americans had done. The House must be aware that before a dollar 
     
     could be expended or an acre of land granted, a scheme would have 
     
     to be submitted to and endorsed by the House, and therefore the 
     
     whole matter would be within the control of Parliament. The 
     
     question was whether or not British Columbia should be invited to 
     
     join the Union, and whether or not the railway should be 
     
     constructed, and he believed that when the Union should be 
     
     accomplished and representatives from British Columbia should sit 
     
     in that House, there would be no doubt of the railway being 
     
     proceeded with as rapidly as the resources of the country would 
     
     admit. He had every confidence not only that the House would 
     
     endorse the proposition of the Government, but that it would be 
     
     approved by the people of the country also, and it would be a bright 
     
     day for the Dominion when the first sod was cut on the Canadian 
     
     Pacific Railway, and in time to come many of his friends opposite, 
     
     who were really desirous of consummating Confederation, though 
     
     they might now oppose this scheme, would rejoice that the 
     
     Government had not been deterred from following out the work, but 
     
     had persevered in their determination to carry forward the work of 
     
     union with the Pacific colonies.

     Hon. Sir A.T. GALT would not again have spoken but for the 
     
     allusions made to him, but under the circumstances he felt bound to 
     
     express his views on the important question before the House. 
     
     Referring to the remarks of the Minister of Inland Revenue he 
     
     (Hon. Sir A.T. Galt) considered that the course he was pursuing 
     
     would tend much more to build up Confederation on a sound basis 
     
     than that pursued by the government, and that a policy of prudence 
     
     and foresight was more necessary for the future progress of the 
     
     Dominion than the unwise incurring of obligations now proposed 
     
     could possibly be. They should not lose sight of the real interests of 
     
     the country in rushing forward in the path, which, though all might 
     
     desire to follow it ultimately, if too hastily followed would defeat 
     
     the very object desired to be obtained.

     As to the coach road proposed by British Columbia, involving a 
     
     useless expenditure of money, he maintained that the necessities of 
     
     the railway would require the construction of such a road so that it

     would have to be made in any case. As to the railway, the people of 
     
     British Columbia had only asked for an expenditure of a million 
     
     yearly, and even if that were continued in perpetuity it could not 
     
     represent more than twenty millions. Those people had never 
     
     presumed to demand that the line should be completed within a 
     
     given time, and the proof that they had not done so had been shown 
     
     by the Minister of Inland Revenue himself, who had argued that it 
     
     was Canada that wanted the railway and not British Columbia.

     Hon. Mr. MORRIS stated that what he had said was that, 
     
     throughout the discussion, the matter of the railway had been 
     
     deliberately treated as if the whole benefits were to accrue to British 
     
     Columbia, whereas Canada also had an equal interest in the work. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir A.T. GALT said he could not admit the statement that 
     
     if the Government’s resolutions were carried, Parliament would still 
     
     retain the control of the matter. The details of the measure might 
     
     come before them, but the obligation would remain that the work 
     
     must be carried through <hi rendition="simple:italic">coûte que coûte</hi>. Five years ago, it had been 
     
     decided that the lntercolonial Railway could not be undertaken 
     
     without an Imperial guarantee; five years ago, the Province of 
     
     Canada had to take a portion of the circulation of the country to 
     
     meet her floating debt, two years ago, the Government had to 
     
     borrow $2,500,000 from the Bank of Montreal, to enable them to 
     
     say that the money borrowed for the lntercolonial was still within 
     
     their control, and only one year ago, the Finance Minister had to ask 
     
     an increase of 5% on all duties to provide against a possible 
     
     deficiency of revenue, but yet, when it now fortunately happened 
     
     that we had a surplus, it seemed to be believed that this state of 
     
     things must continue, and that it was safe to incur any amount of 
     
     obligation. He thought the people of British Columbia, if they really 
     
     desired union, would be quite satisfied that the Dominion would 
     
     construct a railway as rapidly as her resources would admit, and 
     
     would not ask for any more. He hoped and believed the House 
     
     would confirm the amendment of the member for Lambton.

     Mr. OLIVER resumed the debate arguing that the pacific colony 
     
     should be admitted into the Union on the same terms as the other 
     
     provinces. He denied that those who favoured the amendment were 
     
     opposed to the admission of British Columbia, or even to the 
     
     building of the Pacific railway. He favoured these schemes, but 
     
     thought we should consider the effect of such a very large 
     
     expenditure at the present time. He considered that to allow six 
     
     gentlemen from British Columbia to take their seats as representing 
     
     only 100,000 people, was unfair to the other parts of the Dominion. 
     
     Another feature in the scheme was unfair. The debt of British 
     
     Columbia was taken at $1,666,620, which was assumed by the 
     
     Dominion. This amounted to $20 odd per head of the population, 
     
     whereas in Quebec and Ontario the amount per head of debt 
     
     assumed by the Dominion and subsidies was only $2.07. lt had 
     
     been proposed that thirteen million of acres of lands running

     alongside the railway should be appropriated. If so, these lands 
     
     would be a constant cause of expenditure for management and 
     
     surveying. (<hi rendition="simple:italic">Hear, hear</hi>.) lt would be better that these lands should 
     
     remain in the lands of the Local Government of British Columbia; 
     
     otherwise they might pass into the hands of land speculators, a state 
     
     of things which would prove ruinous to the settlement of the 
     
     country. If these lands were not locked up, they would be sufficient 
     
     to support a population of two millions, and it would be better that a 
     
     money bonus should be given and these lands opened up to the 
     
     people for settlement. (<hi rendition="simple:italic">Hear, hear</hi>.) He believed that the railway 
     
     should be prosecuted with energy, and all the money that could be 
     
     spared spent upon it. That was the proposition contained in the 
     
     amendment before the House. It was the duty of the Finance 
     
     Minister in introducing this scheme, which pledged the country to 
     
     complete the road in ten years, to tell the House where the money to 
     
     build it was to come from. He calculated that our present debt, and 
     
     obligations already or soon to be incurred, would amount to 
     
     $127,000,000, and if to this were added $100,000,000 for the 
     
     Pacific Railway, the amount would be $227,000,000; the interest 
     
     per annum would be $11,350,000. He for one was not prepared to 
     
     go that length. To do so would injure the present and future 
     
     prospects of the Confederation. He would support the amendment.

     Mr. MAGILL was in favour of bringing all British North 
     
     America into the Union, but on terms equitable and fair to all the 
     
     provinces. The terms proposed by the Government were not of that 
     
     nature, and if the measure were carried, it would have the effect of 
     
     driving immigration from our shores. It was proposed to sap the 
     
     very foundations of the constitution which had been framed with 
     
     such care and at such a cost. It was too much to expect this colony 
     
     with its 13,000 of a population to override our constitution and 
     
     create dissensions in this Dominion with its four millions of people. 
     
     He protested against the position in which the Government had 
     
     placed the House by bringing down this measure, framed by 
     
     themselves, without having had the opinion of this House or of the 
     
     people of this Dominion on the subject, and say that it should not be 
     
     altered in any degree. It was unfair and he, for one, should record 
     
     his vote against it. (<hi rendition="simple:italic">Hear, hear</hi>.)

     Mr. COLBY believed that the hon. member for Lambton 
     
     expressed the opinion of the whole country when he said that it was 
     
     desirable to bring British Columbia into the Union, that it was 
     
     expedient to prosecute the construction of the Pacific Railway and 
     
     to commence and push it through as soon as the financial condition 
     
     of the country would permit it. That was exactly the policy 
     
     announced by the Government. They brought down no cast-iron 
     
     treaty. No one supposed that if they failed to complete the railway 
     
     within the 10 years they would be guilty of a breach of faith. They 
     
     proposed to do their best to complete it within that period. All the 
     
     opposition which had been offered to this measure now before the 
     
     House, had been presented in exactly the same manner as the 
     
     opponents to Confederation had fought against the Union in the 
     
     past. He would not be surprised if the people of British Columbia 
     
     should fail to obtain this union with Canada, if they looked to the 
     
     United States for the introduction of capital to open up their 
     
     country. </p>

     Hon. Mr. ANGLIN said this was a matter of too great 
     
     importance to be made a party question. He hoped every 
     
     member would look upon it in a purely practical light, and 
     
     oppose it as a utopian measure brought in by the visionaries who 
     
     were hurrying the country to ruin. Looking at the measure on its 
     
     merits there was something objectionable in every one of the 
     
     clauses. He disapproved of the unfair Parliamentary 
     
     representation, giving six members to 13,000 people; to 
     
     pensioning officers, and to the payment of $100,000 per annum 
     
     to sustain a corrupt and extravagant Government, given, too, 
     
     under the pretence that it was rent for public lands. Let the 
     
     House know all the meaning of these terms. The Government of 
     
     the Dominion were to undertake the construction and 
     
     completion, under any contingency, of a Pacific railway within 
     
     ten years after the date of the union. Why could not the 
     
     Government come forward honestly and friendly and tell the 
     
     truth, that they knew it would lay a heavy burden on the 
     
     Dominion to carry out this engagement? But no, each member 
     
     of the Government tried to make light of the difficulties to be 
     
     encountered in the construction of this road.

     The Red River expedition, in their march to Fort Garry, had 
     
     given evidence as to the nature of the country between the head 
     
     of Lake Superior and Red River, and they had proved it to be of 
     
     the most sterile character. It was proved to be, for hundreds of 
     
     miles, a wilderness of rock, swamp and lake, quite 
     
     uninhabitable, and presenting the greatest difficulties to the 
     
     construction of a railway. At the Rocky Mountains, fresh 
     
     difficulties were to be met, and the <hi rendition="simple:italic">British Colonist</hi>, a paper 
     
     published at Victoria, V.I., favourable to confederation, spoke 
     
     of the route through which it was proposed to run the railway, as 
     
     a “sea of mountains.” If this account were correct, it would be 
     
     difficult to ﬁnd those vast tracts of fertile country spoken of by 
     
     hon. members opposite, and it could be no easy matter to run a 
     
     railway through it. With this much known, this House should be 
     
     enabled to understand how much of a burden they were 
     
     expected to bear, before they were asked to vote for this 
     
     measure. He spoke of the resources of the United States as very 
     
     superior to those of Canada.

     Hon. Sir GEORGE-É. CARTIER: We have more in

     system; we are opposed to it.

            <p>
     Hon. Mr. ANGLIN said that the proposed debt would take 
     
     away Canada’s only advantage over the States, and the policy of 
     
     the Government was breaking down all barriers and would 
     
     ultimately tend to annexation. He condemned the proposed 
     
     expenditure as enormous, and pointed out how a proposition to 
     
     incur an amount in England equal, in proportion to her wealth, 
     
     would be received, and said it could not be supposed that the 
     
     amount could be paid without a greatly increased taxation. He 
     
     spoke of the present surplus revenue as very exceptional, and 
     
     spoke of the difficulties and deficiencies of former years, and 
     
     said that the Minister of Finance himself understood that in the 
     
     proposals now before the House, a debt of $100,000,000 was

     incurred, under which the Dominion would stagger. In addition 
     
     to this amount for cost of construction there would be the 
     
     working expenses to add to the burden, and the result would be 
     
     as described the previous night by the member for Wentworth. 
     
     Where was the amount to be obtained? It could not be obtained, 
     
     and the obligation was only to be incurred because some few 
     
     thousands of people on the Paciﬁc coast were discontented and 
     
     would otherwise seek annexation to the United States. The 
     
     Statement that the cost incurred would only amount to a million 
     
     and a quarter, could not be believed by a single member of the 
     
     House. They would pledge themselves to construct the line in 
     
     ten years, and who could say that the country would not have to 
     
     pay every dollar. A company had been spoken of, but where was 
     
     the company? How could any company raise seventy-ﬁve 
     
     millions of dollars on ﬁﬁy million acres of barren waste land, 
     
     and the Government only played with the House and imposed on 
     
     the credulity of their supporters in saying the work would be 
     
     done by a railway. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The question should be viewed calmly and dispassionately 
     
     and not as a party question, as the Minister of Militia had tried 
     
     to make it. The Minister of Customs had imagined a teeming 
     
     and prosperous population in British Columbia and the North 
     
     West, but were they to base their vote on baseless imaginings. 
     
     Where was this population to come from when it was well 
     
     known that the population of British Columbia had materially 
     
     decreased of late years! It could only be explained by the fact 
     
     that the country was not inviting to settlers. It was hard to 
     
     persuade settlers to come even to Ontario and the other parts of 
     
     the Dominion, and how could it be supposed that a larger 
     
     immigration could be directed to these new colonies. The House 
     
     had been told that it was bound to construct the railway to the 
     
     Rocky Mountains, but he would like to know how, when and 
     
     where that obligation was incur;—they were bound to do 
     
     nothing of the kind unless the finances of the country fully 
     
     justified it. It had also been stated that although they incurred 
     
     the obligation, they would not be compelled to carry it out 
     
     unless they chose. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. MORRIS said he had stated that the House was not 
     
     to be led away, but was to remember that any scheme for 
     
     carrying out the work would have to be submitted to it, and that 
     
     it would control the whole matter, and those were the facts. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. ANGLIN resumed that if the representative of 
     
     British Columbia honestly considered the interests of his people 
     
     he would repudiate the whole Government scheme. Let not the 
     
     members believe the statement of any Minister, but let them 
     
     read the words of the resolutions themselves, and judge what a 
     
     burden they involved, and he believed that if every duty and tax 
     
     was doubled the expenditure would not be met, but when the 
     
     debt and taxation was then increased, the way to annexation 
     
     would well be opened, and he stood there to do what he could to 
     
     save the country from the fate, and from the irresistable ruin that 
     
     would ensue from this scheme. He implored the House to ignore 
     
     party and think of the country. </p>

    <p> Hon. Sir FRANCIS HINCKS had been anxious before speaking 
     
     to hear the views of others. He had listened with great attention to 
     
     the gentleman who had preceded him, and there could only be one 
     
     opinion that the whole tone of his remarks showed opposition to the 
     
     acquisition to British Columbia, and opposition to the constructions 
     
     of a railway, and the coalition that had taken place on the opposite 
     
     side showed only opposition to the cause of union with the Pacific 
     
     colonies. He would ask members on both sides to consider the 
     
     position of the Government, and he assumed they were all in favour 
     
     of Confederation. He desired to call particular attention to the fact 
     
     that all proceedings were of the character of negotiations between 
     
     two parties, as to the best means of accomplishing an object on 
     
     which both were agreed. The Government entered into the 
     
     negotiations, and with one or two exceptions the whole House 
     
     seemed in favour of the Union with British Columbia and of the 
     
     construction of the railway.

     He was surprised, however, to hear the member for Gloucester 
     
     cheered by the gentleman round him when speaking of ignoring the 
     
     whole population except the whites. The remainder of the 
     
     population contributed most largely to the revenue, and he could 
     
     speak from experience that the Chinese were an exceedingly 
     
     valuable class as a duty paying people. The objections of hon. 
     
     gentlemen had dwindled down entirely to the matter of the railroad. 
     
     The proposition made was that the railway was an absolute 
     
     necessity, and that Canada should use every exertion to construct it 
     
     at as early a date as possible. In the negotiations that took place, it 
     
     was found impossible that Canada could undertake to commence 
     
     this railway and make a stated payment annually, and it had never 
     
     been understood that the Government themselves should undertake 
     
     the work, but that it should be done by means of Companies with a 
     
     land grand and money grant. Every calculation had been based on 
     
     that understanding.

     Hon. Sir FRANCIS HlNCKS said it was necessary to give 
     
     minute details, and he had already given a rough estimate based on 
     
     statements of the most eminent engineers. Hon. gentlemen had 
     
     admitted the necessity of the railway, but that had not been the tone 
     
     of the member for Gloucester. His views were widely different 
     
     from those of the representatives of Ontario. During the course of 
     
     the discussion, he could not help thinking of the important 
     
     proceedings at Washington, and thinking of those and of the 
     
     important negotiations with the delegates from British Columbia, he 
     
     was surprised at the cavilling on small matters which had taken 
     
     place. The member for Gloucester seemed entirely opposed to the 
     
     railway, but that was not the view of the member for Sherbrooke, 
     
     who was well known as a promoter of such a railway, and a 
     
     believer in its practicability. The Government scheme was a 
     
     modification of the propositions of British Columbia, and although 
     
     they would not undertake a stated annual expenditure, they fully 
     
     admitted the necessity of the construction of the railway.

     Hon. Sir FRANCIS HlNCKS said no, he had already stated that 
     
     it was estimated that the Dominion would have to pay about a 
     
     million and a quarter a year, but it was well understood that if 
     
     insurmountable difficulties arose, the Government could not be 
     
     supposed to proceed to anything ruinous. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     But it was necessary to satisfy British Columbia that Canada was 
     
     in earnest in going on with the work, and therefore a time was 
     
     specified. No one had answered the argument that the railway was 
     
     not entirely a bargain with British Columbia, for if that colony had 
     
     not consented to join the Union would not a railway to the Rocky 
     
     Mountains still have been a necessity. The negotiations had 
     
     necessarily to assume the shape of a Treaty, and in all such matters 
     
     concessions had to be made on both sides. The delegates 
     
     themselves had been of different opinions, and the result of the 
     
     conferences that had taken place was embodied in the resolutions 
     
     before the House, and no amendments could be made without 
     
     throwing open the whole question. These were questions on which 
     
     the people of British Columbia dissented from the terms now 
     
     settled, and any amendment would reopen the whole matter. The 
     
     matter must be dealt with and accepted or rejected as a whole. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Very many more forebodings had been expressed as to the 
     
     financial result of the propositions. The debt of Canada was about 
     
     $20 a head and that of America $60 a head, and yet they could 
     
     undertake three different lines of road, and he did not think Canada 
     
     need have any fear on the matter. As to the debt of $100,000,000 
     
     Government had no intention of incurring anything of the sort. Of 
     
     course the Government undertook the work in ten years, but if after 
     
     doing everything to carry out the engagement in good faith, it 
     
     should be found that untoward circumstances should prevent the 
     
     completion of the work, could it be supposed that Canada would be 
     
     required to proceed to her own serious disadvantage, even if the 
     
     work might be delayed for some years? He referred to the strictures 
     
     of the member for Wentworth as to the Municipalities Laws, and 
     
     shewed that the measure he had proposed had been most generally 
     
     supported, and yet he was charged individually with the whole 
     
     matter. All that had been done however, was to enable 
     
     municipalities to borrow money in their own discretion. He spoke 
     
     of what the member for Oxford South had said, as to his departure 
     
     from, and return to Canada, explaining the circumstances that had 
     
     led to his doing so, denying all charge of inconsistency. He then 
     
     continued, they had either to spurn or accept British Columbia, and 
     
     the result of the amendment, if carried, would be to do away with 
     
     all hope of bringing British Columbia into the Union.

     Mr. WORKMAN deprecated any party feelings in the 
     
     discussion, the question being one of the utmost importance to the 
     
     future of the country. He regretted very much that he would have to 
     
     dissent from the Government scheme, which appeared calculated to 
     
     damage the country. He was friendly to the completion to 
     
     Confederation, notwithstanding. It was his opinion that this railroad 
     
     would involve Canada in an expenditure of at least fifty millions. 
     
     The cost of this work, the great difficulties natural and other in its 
     
     way were reasons for our carefully considering this scheme and its 
     
     consequences before rashly embarking in it. He ridiculed the

     spread-eagle anticipations and ﬂourishes indulged in respecting this 
     
     railway, and particularly the notion that the trade of China and 
     
     Japan could be attracted over North America by this trans- 
     
     continental road. Any merchant or intelligent man knew that the 
     
     products of the East would be damaged by railway carriage, and 
     
     that the shipping presented the best means of transportation. It was 
     
     all nonsense to attribute to Confederation the credit for the present 
     
     prosperity of the country. As to the expectations connected with the 
     
     Intercolonial, he believed from reliable information that it would be 
     
     a source of expense, trouble and anxiety to us. But at any rate let us 
     
     see how it worked before entering upon another and longer railway. 
     
     It was bad enough to have one elephant on our shoulders without a 
     
     second. In the name of his constituents and of the trade and 
     
     commerce of the country he protested against this scheme, which 
     
     made him tremble for it; and it was because he thought it would be 
     
     ruinous to the Dominion that he would vote against these 
     
     resolutions.

     Hon. Mr. McDOUGALL (Lanark North) said that although 
     
     the debate had extended over three days there were two or three 
     
     points to which no reference had yet been made, to which he felt it 
     
     his duty to draw attention. He believed that a very large majority of 
     
     the members of this House were desirous of seeing British 
     
     Columbia united to the Dominion. Some twenty years ago, when he 
     
     first entered into public life as a journalist, he had placed on his 
     
     political platform as one of its most prominent planks Union of the 
     
     British North American Provinces. In 1859 he was present at the 
     
     Reform Convention in Toronto when the political condition of the 
     
     country was discussed, and on that occasion he moved a resolution 
     
     which embodied the principle on which this great scheme was 
     
     founded. It received the assent of a majority of that assembly, and 
     
     ever since then he had been endeavouring to the best of his ability 
     
     to promote and advance this great measure. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Along with hon. members opposite, it had been his good fortune 
     
     to help push forward Confederation, and he now accused them of 
     
     having failed in the performance of their duty in the final 
     
     accomplishment of the work. He said so boldly, looking at it from 
     
     no political or party standpoint, and feeling no desire, as might be 
     
     the case with some hon. members of the Opposition, to see the 
     
     Government displaced from their seats at the present moment if 
     
     they would only do their duty. Taking an impartial view of the case, 
     
     he must charge them with having struck a fatal blow at the great 
     
     measure with which for the last few years they had been connected, 
     
     and for the success of which they were pledged to this House and 
     
     responsible to the country. They propose, in order to induce, as they 
     
     alleged, British Columbia to enter the Union, to load the Dominion 
     
     with a debt double that under which the country now suffered, 
     
     under which, at all events, it now labored. For the purpose of 
     
     accomplishing this Union, no such sacrifice, no such burden, no 
     
     such evil consequences were at all necessary. He failed to hear any 
     
     decent reason why this Government should, without the authority of 
     
     Parliament and without submitting the proposition in any form for 
     
     public discussion, spring it on the House as they had done. Under 
     
     the constitution, no such authority was delegated to the

     Government. No authority was given them, of their own motion, to 
     
     enter into, and finally conclude, negotiations which, as the House 
     
     was told, must be accepted without qualification of amendment.

     Hon. Mr. TILLEY: What did you do at the Quebec conference? 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. McDOUGALL (LanarkNorth) had expected to hear 
     
     this question asked, but he would tell the hon. member that this was 
     
     an entirely different case. The Quebec conference was a body of 
     
     gentlemen assembled together to discuss the propriety of passing 
     
     the law which regulated this very matter. The terms of that law 
     
     were publicly discussed in the press and in the various existing 
     
     legislative bodies of the several Provinces. It was agreed by them 
     
     and alterations were made in accordance with expressions of 
     
     opinion at the very last moment in England to meet the difficulties 
     
     developed by these discussions. These circumstances were 
     
     altogether different from those which surround the present case. In 
     
     the Union Act were the <hi rendition="simple:italic">ipsissima verba</hi> which show how the Union 
     
     of the other colonies is to be consummated. The Constitutional Act 
     
     points out the parties who are to negotiate. It declares that the 
     
     members of this House are one body, and the members of the other 
     
     House another body, who are to settle its terms. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir GEORGE-É. CARTIER said the proper way to bring 
     
     in the colony was through the Government of the day. It involved a 
     
     pecuniary expenditure, and could not emanate from any other 
     
     source. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. McDOUGALL (Lanark North) said the proposition 
     
     which had been under debate for the last three days was not subject 
     
     to the ordinary rule. The Government had taken every precaution to 
     
     tell the House that this measure was in the nature of treaty, that not 
     
     one of its details could be altered, and that it must be accepted as it 
     
     was submitted to the House. Now, the meaning of the constitution 
     
     was very different. It was only after full consideration in this 
     
     Parliament that the measure should be accepted. Of what use was 
     
     this debate at all, if the measure must be adopted without 
     
     amendment? He would remind the House, that British Columbia 
     
     was a Crown colony, with a population principally of miners and 
     
     adventurers, and a very small number of permanent settlers. It was 
     
     so at the time of Confederation, possibly the population was larger 
     
     then. There was no popular representation at that time. This position 
     
     did not fail to strike the attention of the Conference. It was the 
     
     policy of the Imperial Government, and the four Provinces to 
     
     complete the Union and all British America as soon as possible. He 
     
     with others at the Conference had contended that it was the duty of 
     
     the Imperial Government to bring pressure to bear on its own 
     
     officers of British Columbia to submit to reasonable terms in order 
     
     to secure Union with Canada. The small number of the inhabitants 
     
     did not justify the admission of a colony on more favourable terms 
     
     than those offered to the older and more populous Atlantic 
     
     Provinces. The circumstances were entirely different and it was 
     
     absurd to say that the future destiny of that country was in the hands 
     
     of a few adventurers who were mining there. Since Confederation 
     
     was agreed upon, the Imperial Government has put it out to their 
     
     power to use that effective inﬂuence they might have used to secure 
     
    <pb n="304" facs="final/images/BC_H_of_C_18710330_Page_304.jpg"/>

               <fw type="num">304</fw>
     proper terms and compel their acceptance by the Government and 
     
     people of that colony. He did not believe there was any desire on 
     
     the part of the majority of the people of British Columbia to make 
     
     demands unreasonable or impracticable. What right had they in 
     
     discussing terms with Canada to stipulate for construction of public 
     
     works not only inside their own territory, but in the North West 
     
     territories or in Ontario? He did not believe the people of that 
     
     Colony ever expected that privilege or would have insisted on this 
     
     railway on the present conditions. The railway would have three 
     
     sections, differing as to character of country, quality of the land and 
     
     other features. We know that no person would settle along the 
     
     Ontario end of the line stretching to a distance of a thousand miles 
     
     between the Ottawa valley and the Lake of the Woods, for it 
     
     presented no agricultural or trading advantages to attract settlers. 
     
     The middle sections consisted of good land, but had too sparse a 
     
     population to afford a business for a railway for many years to 
     
     come. Through and beyond the Rocky Mountains the country was 
     
     of a nature most difficult for a railway and most discouraging as 
     
     regards the prospects of settlement and traffic.

            <p>
     It was absurd and unreasonable then for us to rush into a vast 
     
     expenditure for a work of this kind without accurate knowledge of 
     
     the country, without surveys, without any means of enabling us to 
     
     form a reliable estimate as to its cost. Did the Government, then, in 
     
     the absence of any knowledge, that capitalists would undertake this 
     
     road, contemplate the construction of the line themselves? Or did 
     
     they really intend to delay the completion of the road if serious 
     
     difficulties arose, notwithstanding the pledge and promise now 
     
     offered British Columbia? If that was the intention of the 
     
     Government, why not say so frankly and honestly? All, he thought, 
     
     that should be promised or undertaken at present was the 
     
     construction of a telegraph and coach road, or at the utmost, of a 
     
     railway from Pembina to the Rocky Mountains. In a short time the 
     
     American road from the borders of Ontario to Pembina would be 
     
     completed, and be as accessible and serviceable to our people as to 
     
     themselves. Besides the Government of Canada would shortly 
     
     establish a mixed land and water communication from Lake 
     
     Superior to Fort Garry, which would provide all the facilities we 
     
     needed for the present, perhaps for years. He saw no difficulty, 
     
     whatever, in making use of the American road to reach Fort Garry 
     
     and the Rocky Mountains. By giving liberal land grants to a 
     
     company, and retaining alternate sections of land we might secure a 
     
     railway across the plains and promote the rapid settlement of the 
     
     fertile belt. Beyond that a good serviceable post road could be 
     
     opened to the Pacific coast, realizing all the people of that colony 
     
     some short time ago solicited, and accomplishing all the trade and 
     
     interest of the Dominion, generally, required.

     He was as anxious as any man to see this Confederation 
     
     completed; but denied he was therefore bound to accept every 
     
     absurd, extravagant scheme proposed professedly with that object, 
     
     and not shown to be either necessary or practicable. Was he to be 
     
     blamed for hesitating to agree to every wild proposition of this 
     
     kind? If we assented to this proposition we should weigh down the 
     
     Dominion to a position which would not only excite dissatisfaction

     among her own inhabitants, but destroy all confidence in our future

            <p>
     With respect to the political arrangements he considered that the 
     
     representatives for so small a number of people was a violation of 
     
     the principles laid down in the Union Act, but the evil would be 
     
     cured in a few years if the matter was not of serious consequence. 
     
     The Manitoba measure had been passed under peculiar 
     
     circumstances and was no precedent to sanction the present 
     
     violation of the fundamental principles of the constitution, but, as 
     
     he had said, the evil would be temporary, and might be conceded to 
     
     British Columbia. The same might be said of the money grant, 
     
     which, though based on a larger population than really existed, did 
     
     not form a serious objection, for it had always been understood that 
     
     the small Provinces should be enabled to carry on their Government 
     
     and local works and he would be quite ready to vote directly a 
     
     sufficient sum to enable British Columbia to meet her expense. 
     
     While, however, the matter of the railway stood on its present basis 
     
     he had no hesitation in opposing the Government scheme, although 
     
     he yielded to no one in his desire to complete Confederation. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     He was astonished that Government should have attempted to 
     
     impose the condition that no alteration should be made, for the Act 
     
     of Union gave to the two Houses of Parliament and to no other 
     
     body the right to make any amendment they might deem expedient, 
     
     and while the Legislative Council of British Columbia had 
     
     discussed every detail of the scheme, he contended that the same 
     
     right belonged to the people and Parliament of this Dominion. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BEATY had received no intimation from his constituents to 
     
     oppose the Government scheme, and he believed the general 
     
     impression in Ontario was that Confederation could not be 
     
     completed without British Columbia. He had every confidence in 
     
     the Ministry both in legislation for the present and future, and he 
     
     believed the interests of the country would be well cared for by 
     
     them. In the matter of Manitoba the people of Ontario had been 
     
     warned against the narrow minded Frenchmen, but he maintained 
     
     that for every liberty they possessed, civil and religious, they were 
     
     mainly indebted to the representatives of Lower Canada. If the 
     
     present scheme carried and the railway was constructed 
     
     successfully, as he believed it would be, the honour would belong 
     
     to the Minister of Militia and his noble band of reformers. The 
     
     matter had been fully discussed, and what was the policy—well, his 
     
     idea was that the policy was whether the gentlemen of the 
     
     Opposition should be allowed to sit on the Government benches. 
     
     That was their policy, and they did not care whether the North West 
     
     was developed or not. The Government now proposed, however, a 
     
     scheme of opening up the country and numbers of emigrants would 
     
     come in, instead of leaving for the States as at present, and before 
     
     many years elapsed, thousands of emigrants would be attracted if 
     
     the Government were allowed to carry out their plans of 
     
     development. He looked forward to a great future for Canada on 
     
     these grounds, and having every confidence in the resolutions he 
     
     should support them, and if he did otherwise, he would think he had 
     
     degraded himself. </p>

     Hon. Mr. DORION said the question had two aspects, the 
     
     political and the financial; the latter, however, was much the most 
     
     important and had listened to the Government statements on that 
     
     head in hope of being able to vote for the resolutions, but the 
     
     minister of Finance had been able to give no favourable statement. 
     
     He took great care not to give any details, and beyond the assertion 
     
     that a cost of $100,000,000 would be practicable, they had heard 
     
     nothing. The American lines had been cited as examples, but it had 
     
     not been stated that in addition to the land grants an enormous 
     
     amount of money had also been granted. The Minister of Finance 
     
     ought to be able to state definitely the amount involved so that the 
     
     House might not have to make a blind vote, and he regretted the 
     
     humiliating proposal of the Minister of Inland Revenue, that after 
     
     the pledge had been given it might afterwards be retracted. He 
     
     spoke of the heavy obligations the Dominion already sustained, and 
     
     maintained that the Union Act provided that the canal system ought 
     
     to have been completed before any other responsibilities were 
     
     incurred.

     Hon. Mr. TILLEY read the resolution at Quebec to show that 
     
     the North West question was to be an express object of 
     
     Confederation. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. DORION said that matter had already been attained. 
     
     He had never had, and had not now, any faith in Confederation, but 
     
     he had felt in duty bound not to oppose it, but if he were most 
     
     anxious for the downfall of Confederation, he could desire for 
     
     nothing more than the present scheme to attain that object. 
     
     Reverting to the canal improvement, he considered it unjust that the 
     
     credit of the country should be pledged to this immense extent 
     
     before that canal improvement was completed. He quoted from a 
     
     report of Mr. Fleming, characterising the Pacific Railway as a 
     
     commercial absurdity and that the maintenance of such a line would 
     
     cost eight millions annually, and in fact that it was altogether 
     
     impraticable, and stating that a macadamized road to the Rocky 
     
     Mountains would require seventeen years for construction, and yet 
     
     hon. gentlemen opposite presumed to say that this gigantic work 
     
     could be commenced and completed within ten years. What greater 
     
     absurdity could be uttered in any intelligent Assembly? If 
     
     Confederation must be had in some direction better have it with the 
     
     150,000 of Newfoundland and the 100,000 of Prince Edward’s 
     
     Island than with the 10,000 of British Columbia, while the 
     
     inhabitants in one case were settled, and in the other mere roving 
     
     adventurers. He did not admit the necessity of a Canadian Pacific 
     
     line, but thought the American lines should be used, and expend the 
     
     money rather in opening up the North West by roads. He thought 
     
     the four millions of people inhabiting the basin of the St. Lawrence 
     
     were entitled to greater consideration than the small population of 
     
     British Columbia, and if this large expenditure were to be incurred 
     
     rather let it be used in enlarging the canals and so securing the great 
     
     trade of the West.

     of Mr. Jones, of Halifax, was put with the following result: Yeas, 
     
     63; Nays, 98.

            <p>
     Mr. ROSS (Dundas) had ever been desirous of uniting the 
     
     Provinces into one compact body, but the scheme was not 
     
     perfected, and he thought the amendment he was about to move 
     
     would open the way for a better settlement than that proposed in the 
     
     resolutions before the House. He felt the country did not properly 
     
     understand the question and thought every one should be able to 
     
     communicate with his constituents. He proposed in amendment 
     
     that in the opinion of this House the further consideration of the 
     
     question be postponed for the present session of Parliament in order 
     
     that greater and more careful consideration may be given to a 
     
     question of such magnitude and importance to the people of this 
     
     Dominion. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The vote on this amendment was as follows: Yeas, 75; Nays, 85. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. MACKENZIE’S amendment was put with the following 
     
     result: Yeas, 67; Nays, 94. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     On the main motion being put, 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. DORION moved in amendment that the speaker do 
     
     not now leave the chair, but that it be resolved that, in view of the 
     
     engagements already entered into since the Confederation and the 
     
     large expenditure urgently required for canal and railway purposes 
     
     within the Dominion, this House would not be justified in imposing 
     
     on the people of this Dominion the enormous burden required to 
     
     build within ten years a railway to the Pacific as proposed by the 
     
     resolution submitted to this House. The amendment was lost on the 
     
     following division: Yeas, 70; Nays, 91. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The main motion was again put. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. MACKENZIE gave notice that he would move other 
     
     amendments in Committee. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. ANGLlN said the Government had not had a clear 
     
     majority of the total number of the House. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir GEORGE-É. CARTIER said that had all been 
     
     present, the Government majority would have been greater. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The main motion was carried and the House went into 
     
     Committee on the resolutions. Mr. COLBY in the Chair. The 
     
     resolutions passed through Committee and the Committee rose. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The House adjourned at 2 o’clock a.m.
