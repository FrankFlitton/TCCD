            <p>
     obtainrnent of the opinion of this House in reference to the 
     
     important matters to be dealt with by the approaching International 
     
     Commission. The Hon. Premier was soon to leave for Washington. 
     
     No discussion of the ﬁshery or other questions, to come before the 
     
     Commission, would be of the slightest advantage if it were to 
     
     follow the departure of the leader of the Government. He thought it 
     
     was their bounden duty to strengthen the hands of their 
     
     representative on that Commission by every means in their power. 
     
     He proposed to do so by a resolution. If the Government promised 
     
     him an early opportunity of doing so—say Monday or Tuesday, he 
     
     would not stand in the way of the immediate passage of the address. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD promised the early 
     
     opportunity solicited. He quite recognised the importance of these 
     
     subjects, and the propriety of the discussion before he left for 
     
     Washington. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir A.T. GALT said he was satisfied with that statement, 
     
     as he believed fair play would be given him. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The matter then dropped.

    <head> THE DEBATE ON THE ADDRESS </head>
     
 
   
            <p>
     Mr. LACERTE rose to propose the address in reply to His 
     
     Excellency’s Speech from the Throne. Taking up the various 
     
     paragraphs, he spoke briefly on each, as usual, expressing 
     
     concurrence in the different views therein set forth, and 
     
     complimenting the Government on its administrative policy. He 
     
     referred particularly to the Fenian enterprise of last spring, and the 
     
     wise and vigorous efforts put forth for its overthrow. He hoped the 
     
     House would fully sustain the Administration in this matter by 
     
     voting the additional expenditure it was compelled to incur. He was 
     
     glad at the prospect of the settlement of the fishery dispute, and 
     
     believed everything would be done to protect Canada’s interests. 
     
     Fortunately the Red River trouble was ended, thanks to the 
     
     judicious and conciliatory action of the Government, and to the 
     
     exertions and bravery of the Volunteers. The Dominion was in a 
     
     prosperous condition, largely owing to the wisdom of Ministers, 
     
     who deserved the confidence of Parliament and the people. He had 
     
     much pleasure in moving the Address. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. KIRKPATRICK rose to second the motion. The topics of 
     
     the speech well deserved the compliments paid them. Scarcely had 
     
     the Parliament been prorogued last summer when hordes of 
     
     miscreants from the United States suddenly assembled on our 
     
     frontier to pillage and ravage our land. To add to the infamy and 
     
     offensiveness of this outrage, those marauders chose for the time of 
     
     their unwarranted operations, the day above all, dear to loyal British 
     
     subjects, the Queen’s birthday. The hostile movement was, thanks 
     
     to the bravery and loyalty of our volunteers and the troops of the 
     
     Queen, hurled back in disgrace from our border. He hoped and 
     
     doubted not the House would cheerfully vote the extra expenses 
     
     entailed by this attempted Fenian invasion. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The next subject of the Speech was the Fisheries, and it was but 
     
     truth to say that the action of the Canadian Government in regard to 
     
    <fw type="num">7</fw>
            <!--Milestone merged into previous para.-->
            <!--Para "7..." merged into previous para.-->       
     them had met with the approbation of the whole country. The 
     
     reference of General Grant to the action of Canada exhibited both 
     
     ignorance and prejudice. The Dominion had but acted within its 
     
     right, and it was certain The next subject in the speech was that of 
     
     Manitoba. No better Governor could have been chosen than him 
     
     who is now <hi rendition="simple:italic">de facto</hi>, if not <hi rendition="simple:italic">de jure</hi> in power. The improvements 
     
     already witnessed in Manitoba prove the judiciousness of the efforts 
     
     made to suppress disorder and rebellion, and set up the authority of 
     
     Canada. The brave Volunteers who had been instrumental in 
     
     securing those happy results, deserved the thanks of the country. 
     
     When disbanded he believed they were entitled to grants of land in 
     
     Manitoba. No better settlers could be chosen, and in justice to them, 
     
     and in the interests of the Province, everything should be done to 
     
     retain them in the North West. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The proposed admission of British Columbia and Vancouver 
     
     Island was a subject of satisfaction to us all. The great scheme of 
     
     Confederation was being rapidly consummated. Those great 
     
     territories, so rich in natural resources, would be a great acquisition 
     
     to Canada, and everything possible should be done to unite them to 
     
     her by a Pacific Railway, grants of land, and, if possible, pecuniary 
     
     contributions, should be made in aid of such enterprises. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     There is little doubt that in this way they could be achieved. 
     
     Immigrants were necessary to development of the great resources of 
     
     the Pacific colonies, and good, rapid communications were 
     
     indispensable to the attraction of immigration. The next subject of 
     
     the Speech was the Fisheries, and it was but truth to say that the 
     
     action of the Canadian Government in regard to them had met with 
     
     the approbation of the whole country. The reference of General 
     
     Grant to the action of Canada exhibited both ignorance and 
     
     prejudice. The Dominion had but acted within its right, and it was 
     
     certain that action was justiﬁed by the approval of the Government 
     
     of England also. However, a Joint Commission had been appointed 
     
     to consider the Fishery question and that relating to events 
     
     connected with the last war, and from it he thought Canada had 
     
     nothing to fear. He hoped, however, that the injury done to Canada 
     
     by repeated Fenian raids would form one of the subjects discussed, 
     
     and that indemnity for our losses thereby would be as rigorously 
     
     required as was indemnity for the losses from the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Alabama</hi>. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The improvement of our coinage system and other proposals of 
     
     the speech would be cordially received. The interests of the country 
     
     demanded such ameliorations. The general administration of the 
     
     affairs of the Dominion had been beneficial, as its progress and 
     
     prosperity amply testified. He could but concur in the closing 
     
     aspiration of the Speech from the Throne, upon which the future 
     
     happiness and advancement of Canada would largely depend. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. MACKENZIE said that it was important in opening the 
     
     grant inquest of the nation, that they should review the 
     
     administration of affairs and foreign events, while abstaining from 
     
     unusual criticism. Tremendous events had taken place since the last 
     
     session, including those of a gigantic and disastrous war. It was but 
     
     right he should express his sympathy with the sacrifices and 
     
     sufferings of that great nation, being the friend and ally of England. 
     
     He did hope that France would not suffer much either in feeling or 
            </p>

            <p>
     Hon. Sir FRANCIS HINCKS [excitedly]: No, no. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. MASSON (Terrebonne): Yes, yes. The feeling was 
     
     spreading. He appealed to the Government if they wished to 
     
     continue the connection with England, as he did to enlighten the 
     
     House on the intention of the Imperial Government, for Mr. 
     
     Cardwell, a member of that Government; had recently delivered a 
     
     speech the argument of which was that the colonies should in future 
     
     act for the defence of England, or be feeders and not suckers. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. MILLS said the Federal system made it necessary that each 
     
     Province should have an independent governmental existence. Such 
     
     could not be given to any Province by this Parliament. He had 
     
     called attention to this fact last year, and was glad the Minister of 
     
     Justice had changed his views in this respect. (<hi rendition="simple:italic">Hear, hear</hi>.) As to 
     
     the murder of Scott it was still competent for the Government of 
     
     Canada to authorize the trial and punishment of Riel. The Minister 
     
     of Justice had said that this Government had no power to cause the 
     
     arrest of the murderers of Scott. This was not so. The Hudson’s Bay 
     
     Company were bound by the Imperial Government to transfer to 
     
     Canada, for trial and punishment, persons guilty of higher crimes 
     
     than rnisdemeanour. It was still competent for the Government of 
     
     Canada to authorize the trial and punishment of Riel, and it was 
     
    <fw type="num">11</fw>
      
     
   
            <!--Milestone merged into previous para.-->
            <!--Para "
     11 
     
    ..." merged into previous para.-->
   
           
     also competent for the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba to ask for 
     
     extradition. </p>
     
    
   
            <p>
     The second paragraph of the address was agreed to. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. DORION on the proposal of the adoption of the 
     
     paragraph relating to the admission of British Columbia, protested 
     
     that he knew nothing of the merits of the terms of this admission, 
     
     and declared his unwillingness to express blindfold any concurrence 
     
     in the Govemment’s Paciﬁc Railway scheme. If it was to be one of 
     
     the character of the Intercolonial Railway, he would give it his 
     
     strenuous opposition. He could not approve of the wording of the 
     
     paragraph. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD consented to a verbal 
     
     alteration to meet the objection of the last speaker. The change was 
     
     of a non-committal character, and thus modiﬁed, the clause was 
     
     adopted. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The remaining paragraphs were read and concurred in without 
     
     debate, and the address, being read a second time, was agreed to. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     After the usual formal resolutions in regard to the address and its 
     
     presentation, Hon. Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD gave notice of an 
     
     address of congratulation to Lord Lisgar on the distinguished 
     
     honour recently conferred upon him by Her Majesty. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     The House adjourned at a quarter past nine.
