               could come down to the House with a proposition which would be 
               <br />
               fatal to the existence of confederation. A reference to public 
               <br />
               documents, however, had convinced him that the true object of the 
               <br />
               Administration must have been to destroy all present hope of a 
               <br />
               Union on reasonable and prudent terms. His reason for this 
               <br />
               conclusion was that the Department which was naturally charged 
               <br />
               with the conduct of negotiations on this subject was under the 
               <br />
               control of a gentleman who had, some time ago, in a letter to the 
               <br />
               public of Canada, used expressions, which in him (Mr. Blake) 
               <br />
               would have been called treason, and he could not but think that the 
               <br />
               preposterous proposition of the Government with respect to the 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway, was specially framed to defeat a Union with 
               <br />
               British Columbia.

               These observations were made by Mr. Howe, when he was about 
               <br />
               to assume the position of Secretary of State. These being his 
               <br />
               expounded views, written in a deliberate letter, who could wonder 
               <br />
               that he was a party to bringing down a measure so iniquitous that 
               <br />
               the House could not help rejecting it. No wonder then that Governor 
               <br />
               Musgrave should have stated publicly that he was amazed at the 
               <br />
               concessions granted by the Canadian Government. Were not hon. 
               <br />
               members justiﬁed then, in asking for further information before 
               <br />
               taking this irrevocable step. If this measure should become law, the 
               <br />
               faith of the Dominion would be blighted and without the consent of 
               <br />
               British Columbia could never break one jot or tittle these cast-iron 
               <br />
               obligations. But the hon. Minister of Militia did not propose to 
               <br />
               increase the taxation of the country. Let him then put it in the 
               <br />
               bargain with British Columbia that no future misunderstandings 
               <br />
               might arise in the fulﬁllment of our pledge. Hon. members opposite 
               <br />
               had stated that they were willing to give 60,000,000 acres of land to 
               <br />
               aid the railway, and to pay off the interest on the debt incurred by 
               <br />
               the railway by the sale of lands in the North West. The Ontario 
               <br />
               Government had found it advisable to make free grants of their

               He (Mr. Blake) called upon every member in this House to 
               <br />
               consider whether he was not betraying the interests of the Dominion 
               <br />
               in ratifying this bargain which the administration of the day had 
               <br />
               made. The ﬁxed date of commencement and completion of the 
               <br />
               railway were dead weights on the enterprise under which the 
               <br />
               country was already staggering. They enhanced the difﬁculty of the 
               <br />
               undertaking. Could any country expect more than a promise to 
               <br />
               build this railway as soon as possible? Could British Columbia 
               <br />
               expect more from this Dominion? He was an advocate of Union, 
               <br />
               but under such terms as these, he considered it his duty to oppose it. 
               <br />
               He did not blame British Columbia for these unjust stipulations, but 
               <br />
               he blamed this Government for having stultiﬁed themselves by 
               <br />
               making such proposals. No solid argument could be brought against 
               <br />
               the view that the terms proposed by British Columbia and to which 
               <br />
               the colony was content to submit, should have been accepted by the 
               <br />
               Dominion Government. The amendment of the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Lambton was not in opposition to the union. The Opposition did not 
               <br />
               oppose the scheme but the unjust terms by which it was 
               <br />
               accompanied, and he could not see how any lover of his country 
               <br />
