               the line must necessarily be built within ten years, and that if a

               Now, the Americans had built their line in three and a half years, 
               <br />
               and could it be supposed that the Canadians were so inferior that 
               <br />
               they could not build a line of comparatively easy construction in ten

               Mr. JOLY must, of course, admit his mistake. He could not 
               <br />
               consider the railway a Canadian but an Imperial Policy, and, of 
               <br />
               course, it was natural that England should desire to see British 
               <br />
               North America confederated and independent of the United States, 
               <br />
               and if that was her desire, the best thing she could do would be to 
               <br />
               aid in constructing this line of communication. The great advantage 
               <br />
               Canada possessed over the States was her freedom from debt and 
               <br />
               taxation, but if, to the present debt of $100,000,000 was added 
               <br />
               another $100,000,000 for the construction of the railway, the debt 
               <br />
               of Canada would become in proportion almost as large as that of the 
               <br />
               United States, and Canada would lose her only advantage. He came 
               <br />
               to conclusion that an additional debt of $100,000,000 would be 
               <br />
               mentioned on account of the construction of the railway, from the 
               <br />
               remarks of the member of the St. John. The Americans had paid 
               <br />
               ﬁfty-eight millions of dollars as a subsidy, and had made twice as 
               <br />
               large a land grant; the money grant would have to be larger. For 
               <br />
               years to come, the line could not pay a tenth part of its cost, and no 
               <br />
               Company would undertake it unless they received every assistance, 
               <br />
               for the line would not obtain anything like the trafﬁc that the Union 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc obtained, and he believed the result would not be that the 
               <br />
               Government itself would have to build the line. As to the time that 
               <br />
               would be required to build the line, if the same energy were shown 
               <br />
               as had been exhibited in the construction of the lntercolonial, the 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc would take twenty years. Why not say to British Columbia, 
               <br />
               “we are willing for you to join us, but we cannot pledge ourselves 
               <br />
               to this heavy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expenditureibut</span> if British Columbia only wanted to

               <br />
               terms, he, for one, was not prepared to buy them that way.” The 
               <br />
               present position of Canada and the States to each other could not 
               <br />
               last much longer, and if more friendly relations should be 
               <br />
               established, why should not Canada avail herself of the Northern 
               <br />
