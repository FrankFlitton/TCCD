               Hon. Sir FRANCIS HINCKS had not expected at this early 
               <br />
               period to go into the ﬁnancial aspect of the question. As to the 
               <br />
               railroad, the idea had been that it could be constructed by a 
               <br />
               liberal land grant and liberal money subsidy. It was not expected 
               <br />
               to bring this subject forward this session. But various plans 
               <br />
               would be considered and proposed to capitalists, including land 
               <br />
               grants. The money change was estimated at one million to a 
               <br />
               million and a quarter dollars per annum, which would not 
               <br />
               involve additional Dominion taxation. No capitalists were likely 
               <br />
               to survey the road at their own expense. Government thought it 
               <br />
               necessary that they should assume the responsibility for survey 
               <br />
               and location of line, this expenditure to be afterwards made by 
               <br />
               ﬁrst charge in the road. The charges to the Dominion in 
               <br />
               connection with British Columbia were estimated at $460,000 a 
               <br />
               year, and the revenue from all sources about $360,000 leaving 
               <br />
               an annual charge of about $100,000 upon Canada.

               Hon. Sir A.T. GALT said the admission of British Columbia 
               <br />
               into the Union was desirable to all parties, the only question 
               <br />
               being as to the terms upon which it was to be based. He was 
               <br />
               willing within two restrictions to accept any terms with this 
               <br />
               object. The ﬁrst involved the avoidance of the violation of any 
               <br />
               constitutional rights of the people of that colony, and the second 
               <br />
               the abstaining from the imposition of onerous burdens on the 
               <br />
               people of Canada. In view of the many important public or 
               <br />
               natural works claiming our attention, it behoved us to guard 
               <br />
               carefully against unduly augmenting the demands upon our 
               <br />
               resources. Not only had railways and canals and other works to 
               <br />
               be provided for, but the defence of the country, according to 
               <br />
               past contracts and legislation. Now there was no doubt that the 
               <br />
               union of this colony and the Dominion would be productive of 
               <br />
               little <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">beneﬁtiwould</span> probably, but prove a source of fruitless 
               <br />
               expense unless it could be also united by means of a good 
               <br />
               railway communication. That was why a railway had been made 
               <br />
               one of the terms of the compact. But its conditions necessarily 
               <br />
               required consideration. We should have to take care not to 
               <br />
               cripple the powers and means of the Local Government by those 
               <br />
               conditions, in regard to future enterprises. While it was 
               <br />
               desirable a road to our Western territory and through the colony 
               <br />
               should be made for the settlement of that vast region, the Local 
               <br />

               Columbia lately stated the population at 10,000 whites and 
               <br />
               40,000 Indians. Now these aborigines should not be placed on 
               <br />
               an equal footing with the whites for the purpose of framing the 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial basis of the Union. They could not be regarded as the 
               <br />
               equals of the whites for revenue purposes at least. The imports 
               <br />
               and exports also deserved our notice. The exports were 
               <br />
               principally furs, lumber and some gold and coal. The imports 
               <br />
               included articles dutiable in Canada, besides breadstuffs and 
               <br />
               such like commodities, from which the bulk of the revenue was 
               <br />
               derived. In 1867 the total amount was estimated at $537,000, of 
               <br />
               which the customs yielded $350,000. The Dominion would 
               <br />
               receive this, the remainder arising from excise and amounting to 
               <br />
               over $150,000 falling to the Colony. The present terms of the 
               <br />
               Union were considerably less advantageous to Canada than the 
               <br />
               former both as regards the railway and other matters. Before it 
               <br />
               was leﬁ optional with us when we should commence the work, 
               <br />
               which, however, was to be completed within a reasonable 
               <br />
               period, but the subsequent conditions required the 
               <br />
               commencement of the road within two years and its completion 
               <br />
               within ten. We might have ﬁnished the work within ten years, 
               <br />
               but were not compelled to do it. The cost of the road would be 
               <br />
               very great, one hundred million being the Government estimate, 
               <br />
               and a considerable proportion of this amount must come from 
               <br />
               the Dominion exchequer. The present engagement as to time 
               <br />
               was much beyond what British Columbia asked at ﬁrst, and in 
               <br />
               the second place the road was rendered more burdensome from 
               <br />
               the extension to Nipissing, further than at ﬁrst spoken of The 
               <br />
               present terms were enormously more burdensome to Canada 
               <br />
               than the former. The estimated revenue from Columbia was 
               <br />
               $386,000, and payments by Dominion $536,226 apart from 
               <br />
               indirect engagements. But this revenue from British Columbia 
               <br />
               depended upon maintenance of its tariff. 
               <br />

               The result was that the colony would receive $150,000 to 
               <br />
               $170,000 a year from Canada for Union, including in trade 
               <br />
               guarantee for the works at Esquimault. He would not object to 
               <br />
               that price for a political union, and did not think it too great an 
               <br />
               equivalent for valuable lands extracted from the colony for the 
               <br />
               railway. But there were other conditions of a serious and 
               <br />
               objectionable nature in view ofour circumstances and prospects. 
               <br />
               He objected to the hands of the country being tied as to the

               period within which the Dominion should commence and 
               <br />
               complete the railway. As it was, after the British Columbia 
               <br />
               delegates came to Ottawa, Canada’s obligations became 
               <br />
               enormously enhanced. 1f the colonists did not command this 
               <br />
               condition as compensation for the reduction of the estimate of 
               <br />
               population from 120,000 to 60,000, or to provide means needed 
               <br />
               for local purposes, why should our Government have voluntarily 
               <br />
               assumed this serious obligation not at ﬁrst proposed. He 
               <br />
               deprecated interference with one of the principles of our 
               <br />
               constitution, namely, representation by population, by these 
               <br />
               resolutions. He indicated the evils of admitting colonies or

               territories on the footing ofpresent members of Confederation.
