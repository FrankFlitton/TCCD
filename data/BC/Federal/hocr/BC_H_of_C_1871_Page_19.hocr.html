               Mr. MASSON (Terrebonne) had always been opposed to 
               <br />
               the acquisition of the North West, and to-night he heard from 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Lambton that he had good reason for that 
               <br />
               opposition. It seemed that, after all, there were only some 
               <br />
               50,000,000 acres ofhabitable land in the whole territory which 
               <br />
               was capable of sustaining a population of about two millions 
               <br />
               of people, giving twenty-ﬁve acres to each person. A very

               different state of affairs to what the House had been led to 
               <br />
               believe existed. Now, after having acquired the unsettled four- 
               <br />
               fifths of the territories there, the House was asked to take 
               <br />
               possession of the remaining settled one-ﬁfth. It seemed to him 
               <br />
               that having got the worst part of the land, having pushed our 
               <br />
               boundaries up to the verge of the wilderness, the House need 
               <br />
               hardly hesitate about extending the Dominion to the Paciﬁc. 
               <br />
               Then, with respect to the railway, he believed it would be 
               <br />
               better to construct it with as little delay as possible, and he 
               <br />
               believed the Government policy to be the correct one.

               <br />
               a total debt of $240,000,000, which would place on each 
               <br />

               <br />
               ruin our credit at home and abroad. Then the Government 
               <br />
               proposed to give to this railway a grant of land amounting to 
               <br />

               such a liberal spirit in these negotiations were informed that it

               would be physically impossible for this Dominion to undertake 
               <br />

               <br />
               strongly in favour of the Union and was willing to go as far as 
               <br />
               it could safely be done to consummate Confederation by the 
               <br />
               admission of this colony into the Dominion. But the House 
               <br />
               should be careful before risking the safety of the 
               <br />
               Confederation by incurring a burden of debt under which they 
               <br />
               might sink.

               Mr. YOUNG said that while he was a Unionist, he felt that 
               <br />
               the measure before the House was objectionable. He was of 
               <br />
               opinion that the Dominion should not seek to incur large 
               <br />

               <br />
               Confederation. Under any circumstances there were provisions 
               <br />
               in this Bill which were objectionable. Chief among these was 
               <br />
               the departure from the established principle of representation. 
               <br />
               He referred to the proposed railway, and read from a report of 
               <br />
               Mr. Fleming on the subject an extract to the effect that the 
               <br />
               engineering difﬁculties to be overcome were startling in their 
               <br />
               magnitude, while the cost of keeping the road in running order 
               <br />
               would alone render it a formidable undertaking, being not less 
               <br />
               than $10,000,000, and until the gross annual earnings of the 
               <br />
               line should reach $14,000,000, the railway would not pay the 
               <br />
               expenses connected with maintaining it. Speaking of the 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial aspect of the measure he quoted statements as to the 
               <br />
               charges on the Government. And the revenue to be derived, 
               <br />
               showing that British Columbia would receive $225,000 more 
               <br />
               than she paid in, and even that calculation was contingent on 
               <br />
               the continuance of the tariff now in force, which was very 
               <br />
               uncertain. He maintained that these conditions were not fair to 
               <br />
               the rest of the Dominion, and the result would be that the 
               <br />
               ﬁnances would go back to the chronic state of deﬁciency that 
               <br />
