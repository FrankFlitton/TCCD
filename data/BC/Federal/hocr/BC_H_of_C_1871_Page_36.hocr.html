               Mr. MACKENZIE said that in the speech of the Hon. Minister 
               <br />
               of Militia, the statement had been made that one-third of the land in 
               <br />
               British Columbia was ﬁt for agriculture. But it was admitted that 
               <br />
               this statement embraced the Island of Vancouver. Now, in dealing 
               <br />
               with this question, the Island must not be taken into consideration at 
               <br />
               all. From all the evidence he could obtain respecting the main land, 
               <br />
               not one-ﬁﬁth of it was available for settlement by farmers, and the 
               <br />
               remaining four-ﬁfths through which the road was likely to run, had 
               <br />
               yet to be proved good for mining purposes. It was simply absurd to 
               <br />
               put the price of that land at $1 dollar per acre. The Hon. Minister of 
               <br />
               Customs, in his speech the other evening, had advocated entering 
               <br />
               into an obligation which he could not say the country would be able 
               <br />
               to perform. It had been said the other evening over and over again 
               <br />
               during the debate, that he (Mr. Mackenzie) had stated that he 
               <br />
               regarded the construction of the Paciﬁc Railway as a pressing 
               <br />
               political necessity. He denied having made any such a statement. 
               <br />
               He would admit, however, that he would be willing to subject the 
               <br />
               country to some inconvenience in order to obtain communication 
               <br />
               with the Paciﬁc through Canadian territory. He was in favour of 
               <br />
               opening up communication immediately through the country lying 
               <br />
               between the head of Lake Superior and Red River. From that point 
               <br />
               to the Rocky Mountains the way was comparatively easy and quite 
               <br />
               clear enough for the use of emigrants passing into the North West 
               <br />
               country. On the Paciﬁc slope, there was no doubt that it would be 
               <br />
               necessary to expend large sums of money from time to time as the 
               <br />
               Financial condition of the Dominion permitted in opening up a 
               <br />
               good route to this side of the Rocky Mountains.

               But this country should not be bound to construct, within so short 
               <br />
               a time, such a gigantic work. The Grand Trunk had never yet paid 
               <br />
               one per cent on the capital expended on it, though passing through a 
               <br />

               <br />
               gentlemen opposite wished to lead the House to believe that this 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway which was to run for 2,500 miles through an 
               <br />
               uninhabited wilderness, would be a paying enterprise. We had 
               <br />
               unfortunately 200 mile lying between the head of Lake Superior 
               <br />
               and Winnipeg, which was an uninhabitable desert. Now, he would 
               <br />
               recommend a cheap narrow gauge railway with steamers on the 
               <br />
               smaller lakes, as the proper means of communication with the open 
               <br />
               prairie extending west of Fort Garry and through which it would be 
               <br />
               unnecessary to construct a road for years to come. He considered 
               <br />
               this attempt as one of the most foolish things that could be 
               <br />

               Hon. Sir GEORGE-É. CARTIER said that he had hoped after 
               <br />
               the discussion of the last three days all the arguments against this 
               <br />
               measure would have been exhausted, and that he would not be 
               <br />
               called upon to speak again. But aﬁer the remarks just made by the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Larnbton, he felt called upon to make some reply. 
               <br />
               He was willing to give credit to the hon. members who opposed this 
               <br />
               measure, for sincerity. He (Hon. Sir George-E. Cartier) was much 
               <br />
               surprised, at the line of argument which they had followed. He was 
               <br />
               surprised that the member for Larnbton should try to meet such a 
               <br />
               great question on the mere ground of cost. He admitted that the 
               <br />
               Union was a necessity and that the railway also was a necessity, but 
               <br />
               the honorable gentleman objected to be tied down to a speciﬁed 
               <br />
               time. He objected to being bound to build a line of 2,500 miles in 
               <br />
               ten <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">yearsfbut</span> in past years even when the country was new and 
               <br />
               with comparatively few resources she had built 2,000 miles in eight 
               <br />
               years. Had Canada been ruined by those works, had her agricultural 
               <br />
               interests suffered on this account. And in addition to this, Canada 
               <br />
               had built the Victoria Bridge at Montreal, itself equal to 500 miles 
               <br />
               of railway, and other large bridges in different parts of the country. 
               <br />
               Had she suffered from building those works? No.

               It was true that the G.T.R. proprietors were not receiving so good 
               <br />
               a return as he would like. If the railway was practicable at all, every 
               <br />
               one would admit that it could well be built in ten years. If there had 
               <br />
               been any complaint it should have been that the time allowed was 
               <br />
               too long. When it had been proposed to extend the Customs Laws 
               <br />
               of Canada to Manitoba, it had been objected to as unfair, and that 
               <br />
               the people of that country were beyond the circle of Canada, and 
               <br />
               therefore a delay of three years had been allowed until the countries 
               <br />
               could be more effectively joined and connected. Let the member for 
               <br />

               <br />
               question. Then no expense was too great, no haste too much, no 
               <br />
               trouble too great, if only the North West could be acquired, but now 
               <br />
               they said don’t go so fast. He wanted to get hold of the Red River 
               <br />
               country at any cost, and now from the very same mouth that had 
               <br />
               spoken of the fertility of the North West, they heard the very 
               <br />
               opposite. He had then been willing to send any number of men to 
               <br />
               obtain possession of the country.
