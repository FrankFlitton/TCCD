               it was known that when the Ottawa and St. Lawrence had been 
               <br />
               navigable, that canal had fallen into comparative disuse, and it 
               <br />
               should be considered whether the amount annually expended 
               <br />
               could not be saved. The opening of the Upper Ottawa would

               <br />
               at Montreal certainly deserved consideration. He referred to the

               Lake Ste. Marie Canal, and admitting its importance, he thought 
               <br />
               that, considering the present negotiations at Washington, a plan to 
               <br />
               construct that work would really be a doubtful policy. He read an 
               <br />
               extract from the papers before the House, being a minority report 
               <br />

               <br />
               Commission was that the canal should be built on the same plan as 
               <br />
               the Welland Canal, it would not be large enough for the vessels 
               <br />
               passing through the American Canal, that no tolls would be 
               <br />
               obtained, and would not be of the slightest possible use except in 
               <br />

               everything that could be expected of them. As to the petroleum, the 
               <br />
               absence of shipments arose from the transfer of the article itself, but

               Hon. Mr. GRAY resumed the debate. He said that it mattered 
               <br />
               little how this House might regard the measure unless they were 
               <br />
               backed up by public opinion, and that opinion was greatly affected 
               <br />
               by statements made in this House. The measure should be viewed 
               <br />
               by the light of the ledger, in the practical light of the present day, 
               <br />
               rather than in the light of the past. This House should regard it too, 
               <br />
               in the light of the experience of the neighboring Republic, and see 
               <br />
               how we might proﬁt by it. As had been observed by the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Sherbrooke, there were two precautions to be taken. 
               <br />
               The constitution was in no way to be inﬁinged and the Dominion 
               <br />
               was not to incur a ﬁnancial burden too heavy to be borne. In this 
               <br />
               view, he believed every member in the House concurred. And ﬁrst, 
               <br />
               with regard to the objection urged against the representation of 
               <br />
               British Columbia that it was too large, he would say that the British 
               <br />
               North America Act did not limit representation to the white 
               <br />
               population but even if it were so limited, the number of 
               <br />
               representatives under the circumstances of that Colony was not too 
               <br />
               great. When the Manitoba Act was passed last session exception 
               <br />
               was taken in the debate to the representation given to the new 
               <br />
               Province, but the reply was that the expected increase in the 
               <br />
               population would, within a very short period, be proportionate 
               <br />
