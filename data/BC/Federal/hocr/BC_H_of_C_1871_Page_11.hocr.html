               Columbia was erected into a colony by Lord Lytton that it should 
               <br />
               form in so short a time a portion of Canada. It was due to the 
               <br />
               foresight and statesmanship of that great literary man that he should 
               <br />
               quote from a speech of his, delivered in 1858, in which this great 
               <br />
               union was foretold. He was now quoting from the prorogation 
               <br />
               speech delivered on the 2nd August, 1858. It said: “The Act to

               which Her Majesty’s assent for the establishing of the Colony of 
               <br />
               British Columbia was originally required in consequence of the 
               <br />
               recent discoveries of gold in that district, but Her Majesty hopes 
               <br />
               that this new Colony on the Paciﬁc may be but one of several in a 
               <br />
               greater state of progress, by which Her Majesty’s Dominions in 
               <br />
               British North America may be ultimately peopled in an unbroken

               <br />

               Could the present movement have been more clearly foretold? 
               <br />
               Since 1858 the scheme of Confederation had made great strides 
               <br />
               toward completion. He (Hon. Sir George-E. Cartier) regretted the 
               <br />
               absence of the hon. member for Shefford on this occasion. That 
               <br />
               gentleman had oﬁen complained that this country was advancing 
               <br />
               too slowly, and said that the Dominion would advance more rapidly 
               <br />
               if placed on an independent footing. But, if the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Shefford was present today, he could not charge the Ministry with 
               <br />

               <br />
               British North America since they had assumed ofﬁce. While in 
               <br />
               London with his (Hon. Sir George-E Cartier) colleagues, at a dinner 
               <br />
               where several literary men were present, he mentioned to Lord 
               <br />
               Lytton, who was not then in ofﬁce, that the Confederation scheme 
               <br />
               was one of the principal objects which had brought him to England. 
               <br />
               Lord Lytton replied, “I presume that you have come not merely to 
               <br />
               see that the British North American Atlantic Provinces should be 
               <br />
               united. I hope you look forward to the greater Confederation which 
               <br />
               will reach to the Paciﬁc Ocean.”

               <br />
               themselves. He invited the freest and fullest discussion on each and 
               <br />
               every clause, but he would remind them that the Bill was in the 
               <br />
               nature of a treaty, and consequently the Government would insist 
               <br />

               informing the House of the fact. British Columbia had decided to
