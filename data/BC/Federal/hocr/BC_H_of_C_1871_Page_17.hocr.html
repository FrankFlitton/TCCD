               <br />
               British Columbia is to be admitted into the Union. That section of 
               <br />
               country though remote as to position is an all important one from a 
               <br />
               Dominion point of view. It possesses a most salubrious climate, 
               <br />
               well known agricultural capacity, and as to value is entirely beyond 
               <br />
               present computation both politically and commercially. In looking 
               <br />
               over the statistics of 1868, 1 observed that there had been no 
               <br />
               apparent increase in the population for that year beyond the children 
               <br />
               born in the country, and notwithstanding the great numbers who 
               <br />
               annually emigrate from Great Britain and various parts of Europe to 
               <br />
               the North American continent, it is surprising that with all the 
               <br />
               attractions of the Paciﬁc section of British North America so few 
               <br />
               emigrants should have found their way there up to the present date, 
               <br />
               and more particularly so when we consider its climate, its soil, and 
               <br />
               its resources, such as coal, iron, timber and gold. The vigorous 
               <br />
               measures about to be adopted will doubtless be the means of 
               <br />
               causing a greater tide of immigration than has been observed at any 
               <br />
               time in the history of that country. An examination of the statistics 
               <br />
               of the population of British Columbia shows the somewhat 
               <br />
               remarkable fact that the male exceeds the female population by 
               <br />
               about 277 per cent. Such an anomalous condition does not, that 1

               <br />
               Britain has a warm interest in our prosperity. What better or more 
               <br />
               substantial proof could we have than the expression of the

               <br />
               telegraph, that England would as soon think of having itself 
               <br />

               United States are equally well aware that the time has now arrived

               route between Asia and Europe will hold the commercial 
               <br />
               supremacy of this continent in its grasp. The great trade of the East 
               <br />
               will not alone pass through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea. This is 
               <br />
               the prize which we as a people must look forward to, and certainly 
               <br />
               it is one which is well worth the endeavour to obtain. An able 
               <br />
               English writer remarks that the great beneﬁt to be derived from the 
               <br />
               experience of the past is the application of its teaching to the 
               <br />
               present. Thus, in taking a retrospective view of Confederation, and 
               <br />
               the beneﬁts arising out of it, even although the time is short since its 
               <br />
               inception, we must be congnizant of the fact that day by day we are 
               <br />
               becoming more intimately associated as a people, co-operating in 
               <br />
               every way that is possible to develop our resources. During the 
               <br />
               early discussions on the subject of Confederation, a frequent 
               <br />
               expression was “whither are we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">drilling.”</span> This was reiterated until 
               <br />
               at last it became irksome and unworthy of attention. The only 
               <br />
               sentiment which seemed in any way likely to form with it a twin 
               <br />
               was the theory of independence. Both of these have had their day, 
               <br />
               and now I feel satisﬁed that the impression of everyone who takes a 
               <br />
               warm interest in the welfare of our country is that both these ill-
