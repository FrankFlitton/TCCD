               Fort Garry there was no soil and the railway could not be built but 
               <br />

               gentleman undertook an obligation, could he be obliged to fulﬁl it,

               <br />
               could be compelled to perform an impossibility. The time was too 
               <br />
               long, and the objection could only come from an economical 
               <br />
               Scotchrnan, and he would predict that in a very few years the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman would be one of the most ardent supporters of the 
               <br />
               railway. He had not been sorry to lose his motion yesterday, and he 
               <br />
               was not sincere in his present proposal. That proposal was to entail 
               <br />
               a delay of seven months‘, what object could there be in so doing? 
               <br />
               The matter had already been discussed sufﬁciently, and the time 
               <br />
               was now come for settlement, and he would say that without the 
               <br />
               prospect of British Columbia, they would never have persuaded a 
               <br />
               majority of the House to consent to acquire one inch of the North 
               <br />
               West. For the sake of the member for Lambton himself he trusted 
               <br />
               his speech would not be well reported, and especially that part in 
               <br />
               which he had spoken of the character of the land in most 
               <br />
               disadvantageous terms, and yet he said he was in favour of building 
               <br />
               a railway as soon as possible. If the land was as described by the 
               <br />
               hon. member, why should a railway be built at all? He reiterated 10 
               <br />
               years was too long, and as to the mode of building the railway that 
               <br />
               would all be submitted to Parliament, and within the next few days 
               <br />
               the Government would ask for an appropriation for the preliminary 
               <br />
               survey. He maintained that Canada was better able to-day to 
               <br />
               undertake the Paciﬁc railway than she had been years ago to

               The policy was purposely to retain the lands of the country in 
               <br />
               order to build railways and open ways of communication. Canada 
               <br />
               would not have to bear the expenditure alone. British Columbia 
               <br />
               would be represented in the House, and would be equally interested 
               <br />
               in the work. Speaking of the cost of the railway, he maintained the 
               <br />
               gentlemen on the other side had played the parts of old nurses, but 
               <br />
               the children on his side of the House were not so easily frightened. 
               <br />
               He spoke of the North Paciﬁc, quoting from a statement showing 
               <br />
               the whole length to be 2,000 miles, and the entire estimated cost 
               <br />
               seventy-six million dollars in greenbacks. lt had been objected that 
               <br />
               the estimate for the Canadian Paciﬁc might not be correct. He 
               <br />
               admitted that, but the argument worked both ways. The cost might 
               <br />
               prove very much below the estimate, and an immense amount of 
               <br />
               land was reserved to cover it. He quoted a statement showing the 
               <br />
               average cost of railway communication in the United States, 
               <br />
               showing 2,600 miles of line in operation, the average cost being, in 
               <br />
               the different States, from $25,000 to $33,000 per mile. It was 
               <br />
               admitted that there was a large extent of prairie land to be crossed, 
               <br />
               and the smaller expenditure necessary there would leave means to 
               <br />
               overcome difﬁculties in other portions. The hon. members opposite 
               <br />
               had been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sufﬁciently</span> unpatriotic to represent the country as that it 
               <br />
               would never attract immigration, and he quoted from the 
               <br />
               proceedings of the House of Representatives of the State of 
               <br />
               Minnesota speaking of the Canadian line as practicable, and the

               territories of the North West and British Columbia, as fertile, and 
               <br />

               Hon. Sir GEORGE-E. CARTIER was glad he had given the 
               <br />
               hon. member an opportunity to correct himself. He quoted from an 
               <br />
               article from an American paper, copied into the Globe 
               <br />
               characterising the Saskatchewan country as most valuable in soil 
               <br />
               and minerals, and British Columbia as possessing rich mineral 
               <br />
               resources, magniﬁcent climate and ﬁne soil. It was fortunate that 
               <br />
               the truth could be ascertained even if it came from opponents. The 
               <br />
               Government had stated again and again that they themselves would 
               <br />
               not build the railway, but that it would be constructed by 
               <br />
               Companies assisted by such subsidies as would not oppress the 
               <br />
               people. It was absurd to speak of building a line to the Rocky 
               <br />
               Mountains only, a vote could not be obtained for such a purpose, 
               <br />
               but when it was proposed to extend the line to the ocean, the 
               <br />
               question assumed a very different aspect. Many great works had 
               <br />
               been accomplished in England, but what were any compared with 
               <br />
               the scheme now proposed, and he could say that already there 
               <br />
               was a motion in England to assist the measure, and there would 
               <br />
               doubtless be capitalists to take the matter in hand, and 
               <br />
               everything was in favor of the successful construction of the 
               <br />
               road. The Minister of Justice had telegraphed him to present his
