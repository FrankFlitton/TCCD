               <br />
               the hon. member would hardly object to. The passage of the 
               <br />
               hon. member’s speech referred to, contained the following: 
               <br />
               “The representation was based no doubt, on the expectation of 
               <br />
               an immediate increase of the inhabitants, but he contended that 
               <br />
               it would be better to give representation to the number of 
               <br />
               people, increasing the number if it was thought best, every two 
               <br />
               years, or leaving to the local legislature if they thought it 
               <br />
               better.” Here was the expression of opinion from the hon. 
               <br />
               member, and thus, though the point was raised, there was no 
               <br />
               record on the journals of the House, no action taken, no 
               <br />
               resolution or amendment moved to show that the representation 
               <br />
               of Manitoba was unconstitutional. The objection that was taken 
               <br />
               in debate last session by the hon. gentleman was as to the power 
               <br />
               of the Parliament to give representation at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">allinot</span> as to its 
               <br />
               numerical character.

               Here then was a precedent for this case before the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Houseia</span> 
               <br />
               precedent established by the House itself. He had no fear that 
               <br />
               the smaller Provinces would be overridden through this Act. If 
               <br />
               the representation were to be based strictly upon population 
               <br />
               according to the law as at present interpreted by the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Bothwell, British Columbia would have but one 
               <br />
               representative, if any. Now, in that colony there were two 
               <br />
               separate and distinct interests, the insular and continental. The 
               <br />
               country was divided into two sections, Vancouver Island and the 
               <br />
               main land. 1f the colony were permitted to send but one member 
               <br />
               to this House, which section would he represent? He could not 
               <br />
               represent both very well, and one of them would remain 
               <br />
               unrepresented. It was clear, therefore, that no other course could 
               <br />
               have been adopted with reference to this point, than that 
               <br />
               embodied in the measure before the House. The position he took 
               <br />
               with reference to this question was this, that until the Province 
               <br />
               became a member of the Federal compact, it would not be 
               <br />
               governed by the provisions of the British North America Act. 
               <br />
               That the terms and conditions on which British Columbia came 
               <br />
               in were to be agreed on, and ifit as an independent province she 
               <br />
               chose to say her interests required our representatives in the 
               <br />
               House, she could, and there was nothing in the British North 
               <br />
               America Act to prevent our acceptance of such a proposition, 
               <br />
               but aﬁer she came in, her future representation must be 
               <br />
               governed by the 31st section of the British North America Act, 
               <br />
               and must revolve like that of the other Province, around the 
               <br />
               representation of Quebec as a pivot. ln accepting her therefore,

               as set forth in the resolutions in that respect there was no

               infringement of our Constitutional rights under the British North 
               <br />

               <br />
               Sherbrooke was complied with. For it must be assumed that if 
               <br />
               there were other important constitutional objections they would 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The next point was as to our capability to enter upon the 
               <br />
               contemplated arrangements respecting the Paciﬁc Railway. The 
               <br />
               necessity, of course of communication with the Paciﬁc was 
               <br />
               admitted by every hon. member who had spoken on this subject. 
               <br />
               The Government did not propose to build the railway 
               <br />
               themselves, but it would be done by companies, and if the land 
               <br />
               grants should prove nearly as valuable as it was alleged they 
               <br />
               would, the cry of one hundred millions which was used to create 
               <br />
               so much alarm would prove to be a mere bugbear. With regard 
               <br />
               to the part of the line falling in Ontario he was not prepared to 
               <br />
               speak, but with respect to the other portions he desired to say 
               <br />
               something. The hon. gentleman here described the mode and 
               <br />
               means by which the Paciﬁc Railway from Omaha to Sacramento 
               <br />
               was built, shewing the companies, the land grants, and 
               <br />
               Government Bond subsidies in aid, describing the character of 
               <br />
               the country, and the difﬁculties which met the constructors of 
               <br />
               the road, the unstable nature of the soil about the Missouri 
               <br />
               River, the arid character of the American desert, and the Alkali 
               <br />
               plains, the elevation of the passes of the Rocky Mountains, and 
               <br />
               of the Sierra Nevada Range, and went on to explain how the 
               <br />
               Government Bond subsidies were divided, increasing 
               <br />
               proportionately with the cost of construction of different parts 
               <br />
               thus preventing the Government aid being entirely used on the 
               <br />
               easy gradient, and thereby obviating further calls on the 
               <br />
               Government. The American Government had divided the 
               <br />
               subsidy, giving one amount for the easy part of the line, and a 
               <br />
               larger amount for the difﬁcult sections. The whole bond subsidy 
               <br />
               amounted to ﬁfty-eight millions, and in addition a land grant 
               <br />
               was made of alternate lots of 20 miles along the route. The cost 
               <br />
               of the entire road had also been largely increased to the extent 
               <br />
               of twenty millions by a stipulation that no rails should be used 
               <br />
