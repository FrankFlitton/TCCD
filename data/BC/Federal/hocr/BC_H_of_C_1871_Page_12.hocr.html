               measure in some of its parts. The necessity of accepting this Bill as 
               <br />
               it stood must be apparent to all. The population of British Columbia 
               <br />
               was set down at 60,000, and it was certainly not below that number, 
               <br />
               if the Indians and Chinese were included as well as the white. The 
               <br />
               customs duty collected under the tariff of the colony amounted to 
               <br />
               $350,000, which would give about twice as much per head for the 
               <br />
               population as was collected in the Dominion. Each inhabitant of 
               <br />
               Canada was supposed to contribute $3 to the Revenue per year, 
               <br />
               while each inhabitant of the colony contributed nearly twice that 
               <br />
               amount. It might be said that the tariff was higher than ours, but it 
               <br />
               was not so much so as to make this difference if the population 
               <br />
               were not there. The House would therefore, admit that the 
               <br />
               Government did not err in estimating the population at 60,000.

               The delegates of British Columbia wished to have the subsidy 
               <br />
               placed at 80 cents per head for a population of 120,000, but on 
               <br />

               <br />
               Parliament to such terms they allowed the population to put at 
               <br />
               60,000. This was an opportune time to admit the colony into the 
               <br />
               union, for it was desirable to extend the Confederation to the Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               as soon as possible, and on economical grounds it was advisable to 
               <br />
               admit the colony into the Dominion before the increase of 
               <br />
               population could increase the subsidy to a very large rate. Then 
               <br />
               with respect to the clause providing for provisions it must be 
               <br />
               remembered that British Columbia was a Crown colony. Under it 
               <br />
               several ofﬁcers were appointed for life, and they should be 
               <br />
               provided for. The colony had laterally adopted responsible 
               <br />
               Government which was to commence from the date of the union, so 
               <br />
               that no future charges of this kind need be expended in the future. 
               <br />
               There were very few such pensions to be provided for', the majority 
               <br />
               of them would be employed under the Federal Government. Then, 
               <br />
               with respect to the tariff, it was provided that they should retain 
               <br />
               their own tariff, which was higher than ours, till the completion of 
               <br />
               the Paciﬁc Railway. No inconvenience need be anticipated from it, 
               <br />
               and under the peculiar circumstances of the case it was necessary to 
               <br />
               allow them to retain it.

               Item eleven, relating to the construction of the Paciﬁc Railway, 
               <br />
               would no doubt provoke discussion. There were various unfounded 
               <br />
               rumours with respect to this. It was not the intention of the 
               <br />
               Government to construct the road, but it would be undertaken by 
               <br />
               companies to be assisted mainly by land grants. It was not the 
               <br />
               intention of the Government to burden the exchequer much to 
               <br />
               obtain this railway. While this clause was under discussion between 
               <br />
               the delegates and the Government it was proposed by the Dominion 
               <br />
               that the colony should hand over a forty mile strip of land towards 
               <br />
               the construction of the railway. That would be 24,000 square miles 
               <br />
               of land, or 50,360,000 acres of land, not merely agricultural land, 
               <br />
               but mineral land. Placing that land at $1 per acre, it would be equal 
               <br />
               to a grant of$50,360,000 towards the construction ofthe railway. It 
               <br />
               was proposed to give the colony $100,000 per annurn, which, 
               <br />
               placing the interest at 5 per cent, would be the annual interest on the 
               <br />
               value of 2,000,000 acres of land, leaving the remainder to be used 
               <br />
               by this Government. The railway, starting from Nipissing, would be 
               <br />
               about 2,500 miles, 700 of which would pass through Ontario. They 
               <br />
               did not expect to get entirely the 20 mile grant on each side of the

               <br />
               the Ottawa Valley. They were prepared to give it to any company 
               <br />
               which would undertake the construction of the line, with a capital of 
               <br />
               twenty-ﬁve millions of dollars, which with interest at 5 per cent, 
               <br />
               would represent $1,500,000 per annurn. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               Sherbrooke had recently remarked that the certain increase of 
               <br />
               receipts from customs and excise was at the rate of 5 per cent per 
               <br />
               year. At that rate, taking the customs at $10,000,000, the increase 
               <br />
               would be $500,000, and on excise, taking the receipts at 
               <br />
               $5,000,000, $250,000. That would give a total from these two 
               <br />
               sources alone to meet $1,500,000 per annurn, a sum of $750,000. 
               <br />
               He knew it would be argued that this railway would cost between 
               <br />
               one and two hundred millions of dollars, if not more.

               Hon. Sir GEORGE-É. CARTIER would compare it with the 
               <br />
               American Paciﬁc Railway, which from Omaha to the Paciﬁc was 
               <br />
               1,775 miles in length. That railway was aided by land and money 
               <br />
               grants, and cost $50,000,000. The Canadian Paciﬁc Railway would 
               <br />
               be about 700 miles longer. Yet he would place the cost at double 
               <br />
               the rate of the American Paciﬁc Railway, and the utmost cost that 
               <br />
               could be incurred would be $100,000,000. But whatever it would 
               <br />
               cost, he would assure the House that there would be no taxation on 
               <br />
               the country more than existed at present. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Cheers)</span> A certain portion 
               <br />
               of the public lands had been reserved for the Indians, and the only 
               <br />
               guarantee that was necessary for the future good treatment of the 
               <br />
               Aborigines was the manner in which they had been treated in the 
               <br />
               past. Now, having glanced at the provisions of the Bill he would 
               <br />
               call the attention of the House to the fact that while our neighbours 
               <br />
               had taken sixty years to extend their borders to the Paciﬁc, the 
               <br />
               young Dominion would have accomplished it inside of ten years. 
               <br />
               And look at the importance of the extension. We need a seaboard 
               <br />
               on the Paciﬁc if ever this Dominion was to be a powerful nation in 
               <br />
               the future, and what more convenient time could there be for this 
               <br />
               union than at the present time? He concluded by an allusion to the 
               <br />
               splendid position which England had attained by the development 
               <br />
               of her marine power, and that even Prussia, notwithstanding the 
               <br />
               triumphs she had lately won, must be content to take a second place 
               <br />
               beside the great maritime power of England. The hon. Baronet
