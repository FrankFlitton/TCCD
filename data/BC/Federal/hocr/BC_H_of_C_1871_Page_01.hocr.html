               The hope 1 was sanguine enough to express at the close of the 
               <br />
               last session that no further attempt would be made to disturb our 
               <br />
               frontier, was doomed to early disappointment. The Session had 
               <br />
               scarcely closed when lawless bands assembled within the United 
               <br />
               States in great numbers, and renewed the menace of invasion. They 
               <br />
               ventured to cross the border at two points, but were promptly met 
               <br />
               and repelled. So complete and humiliating was the repulse, that the 
               <br />
               invaders lost heart and hope, threw away quantities of arms, and fell 
               <br />
               back to encumber the villages in their rear, with their starving and 
               <br />
               demoralized masses. Our Militia rallied at the ﬁrst call to arms with 
               <br />
               praiseworthy a1acrity, and the spirit which pervades the country, 
               <br />
               swelled their numbers with volunteers from all quarters. The 
               <br />
               gallantry displayed and the success achieved, have been duly 
               <br />
               recognized by the highest Military authority, and honored in 
               <br />
               gratifying terms of appreciation, by Her Most Gracious Majesty. In 
               <br />
               maintaining the Militia on active duty, the Government incurred an 
               <br />
               outlay to a considerable amount beyond what was provided by the 
               <br />
               votes of last Session. The accounts of the entire expenditure for the 
               <br />
               defence of the frontier will be laid before you, and I feel conﬁdent 
               <br />
