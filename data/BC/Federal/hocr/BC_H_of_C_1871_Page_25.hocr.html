               nothing in the objection. As to the objection of the railway 
               <br />
               having to be constructed in ten years, British Columbia was to 
               <br />
               be taken into the Union, and the understanding was that the 
               <br />
               whole Dominion should be connected. The responsibility 
               <br />
               might be great, but in all agreements certain conditions were 
               <br />
               implied, which might operate to change the agreement. If the 
               <br />
               present prosperity continued, there was no reason to doubt the 
               <br />
               ability of the Government to construct the railway within ten 
               <br />
               years, but if circumstances should prevent that, what danger 
               <br />
               could ensue? He should certainly support the resolutions of the 
               <br />
               Government on the grounds he had stated.

               Some years ago he had entertained doubts of the success of 
               <br />
               Confederation, but he was very glad to see how satisfactory 
               <br />
               the results had been. He thought the deﬁnitiveness of the 
               <br />
               proposition for the construction of the line, would obtain for it 
               <br />
               greater consideration and greater conﬁdence on the part of 
               <br />
               English capitalists. He would not try to foreshadow the future, 
               <br />
               but there was every reason for hope. The member for 
               <br />
               Lotbiniere had said that the increased responsibility would 
               <br />
               make Canada’s debt equal to that of the United States, but the 
               <br />
               view was most erroneous, for while the Canadian line would 
               <br />
               open up a splendid country and consolidate the country, the 
               <br />
               Americans had only destroyed property and desolated homes

               Mr. MILLS would not have spoken but for the remarks of 
               <br />
               the member for St. John. That hon. gentleman entirely 
               <br />
               misapprehended the system of Government provided by the 
               <br />
               British North American Act. He disputed his reading of the 
               <br />
               constitution as affecting powers and duties of Canada in 
               <br />
               relation to the colonies to be admitted into the Union. He had 
               <br />
               contended the Indians should be embraced in framing the basis 
               <br />
               for representation. That had not, however, been done as 
               <br />
               regards the other Provinces. The Indians did not enter into the 
               <br />
               social bond, and could not stand on the same footing as the 
               <br />
               white population. The member for St. John argued that 
               <br />
               because the principle of representation by population had been 
               <br />
               violated in the treatment of Manitoba, it should be in the case 
               <br />
               of British Columbia, and he had stated representation by 
               <br />
               population was not the principle established by the 
               <br />
               constitution, but the Union Act plainly showed it was and the 
               <br />
               representation was to be altered every ten years in harmony 
               <br />
               with the growth of the country and population, and in a 
               <br />
               prescribed relation to the sixty-ﬁve members always to be 
               <br />

               In answer to the member for St. John, he contended that the 
               <br />
               phraseology of the Union Act proved that the terms applicable 
               <br />
               to the four Provinces of the Confederation as to representation, 
               <br />
               applied also to the Provinces after-admitted. The Union could 
               <br />
               be extended only on the federal principle, and the principle he 
               <br />
               now contended for governed his objections to the Manitoba 
               <br />
               Bill last year. He held now as before that the very principle of 
               <br />

               As to the remark that we ought to be able to construct a 
               <br />
               railroad in less than ten years, and that the Americans 
               <br />
               constructed theirs in three years and a half, it was apparently 
               <br />
               forgotten that their railroads previously extended a thousand 
               <br />
               miles further west than ours, that they had thirty millions this 
               <br />
               side of the Rocky Mountains against our four, and had a large 
               <br />
               population on the Paciﬁc coast and inﬁnitely greater resources 
               <br />
               on both sides of the Rocky Mountains than ours. He would 
               <br />
               like to know how we could build it in ten years when at the 
               <br />
               present rate of progress, and with our adequate means and 
               <br />
               other advantages that Intercolonial would require seven years. 
               <br />
               At its rate of construction, it would take 37 years to build the

               there no other objections to the resolutions, he would be 
               <br />
               disposed to oppose them. The geological survey of the country 
               <br />
               was an incident of the local possession and management ofthe 
               <br />

               <br />
               reminded the House that these terms had been accepted by the 
               <br />
               Legislative Assembly of British Columbia on the 
               <br />
               understanding that they would not be altered by the Parliament 
               <br />
               of Canada. In reply to the hon. member for Sherbrooke and

               other gentlemen, he contended that the present terms were not 
               <br />
               less favourable to Canada than the former, because in the ﬁrst 
               <br />

               <br />
               eight Commoners, while now she was allowed but three of the 
               <br />
               former and six of the latter. With regard to the railway, he 
               <br />
               urged that there was no comparison between the Intercolonial 
               <br />
               and the Paciﬁc road, because it would not be undertaken by 
               <br />
               the Government but by a company upon the basis of a liberal 
               <br />
               land grant and an annual payment of money within the means 
               <br />
               of Canada, and without augmenting its debt.
