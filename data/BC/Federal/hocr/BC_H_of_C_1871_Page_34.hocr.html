               people of that colony. He did not believe there was any desire on 
               <br />
               the part of the majority of the people of British Columbia to make 
               <br />
               demands unreasonable or impracticable. What right had they in 
               <br />
               discussing terms with Canada to stipulate for construction of public 
               <br />

               <br />
               territories or in Ontario? He did not believe the people of that 
               <br />
               Colony ever expected that privilege or would have insisted on this 
               <br />
               railway on the present conditions. The railway would have three 
               <br />
               sections, differing as to character of country, quality of the land and 
               <br />
               other features. We know that no person would settle along the 
               <br />
               Ontario end of the line stretching to a distance of a thousand miles 
               <br />
               between the Ottawa valley and the Lake of the Woods, for it 
               <br />
               presented no agricultural or trading advantages to attract settlers. 
               <br />
               The middle sections consisted of good land, but had too sparse a 
               <br />
               population to afford a business for a railway for many years to 
               <br />
               come. Through and beyond the Rocky Mountains the country was 
               <br />
               of a nature most difﬁcult for a railway and most discouraging as 
               <br />
               regards the prospects of settlement and trafﬁc.

               It was absurd and unreasonable then for us to rush into a vast 
               <br />
               expenditure for a work of this kind without accurate knowledge of 
               <br />
               the country, without surveys, without any means of enabling us to 
               <br />
               form a reliable estimate as to its cost. Did the Government, then, in 
               <br />
               the absence of any knowledge, that capitalists would undertake this 
               <br />
               road, contemplate the construction of the line themselves? Or did 
               <br />
               they really intend to delay the completion of the road if serious 
               <br />
               difﬁculties arose, notwithstanding the pledge and promise now 
               <br />
               offered British Columbia? If that was the intention of the 
               <br />
               Government, why not say so frankly and honestly? All, he thought, 
               <br />
               that should be promised or undertaken at present was the 
               <br />
               construction of a telegraph and coach road, or at the utmost, of a 
               <br />
               railway from Pembina to the Rocky Mountains. In a short time the 
               <br />
               American road from the borders of Ontario to Pembina would be 
               <br />
               completed, and be as accessible and serviceable to our people as to 
               <br />
               themselves. Besides the Government of Canada would shortly 
               <br />
               establish a mixed land and water communication from Lake 
               <br />
               Superior to Fort Garry, which would provide all the facilities we 
               <br />
               needed for the present, perhaps for years. He saw no difﬁculty, 
               <br />
               whatever, in making use of the American road to reach Fort Garry 
               <br />
               and the Rocky Mountains. By giving liberal land grants to a 
               <br />
               company, and retaining alternate sections of land we might secure a 
               <br />
               railway across the plains and promote the rapid settlement of the 
               <br />
               fertile belt. Beyond that a good serviceable post road could be 
               <br />
               opened to the Paciﬁc coast, realizing all the people of that colony 
               <br />
               some short time ago solicited, and accomplishing all the trade and 
               <br />
               interest of the Dominion, generally, required.

               <br />
               representatives for so small a number of people was a violation of 
               <br />

               cured in a few years if the matter was not of serious consequence. 
               <br />
               The Manitoba measure had been passed under peculiar 
               <br />
               circumstances and was no precedent to sanction the present

               he had said, the evil would be temporary, and might be conceded to 
               <br />
               British Columbia. The same might be said of the money grant, 
               <br />
               which, though based on a larger population than really existed, did 
               <br />
               not form a serious objection, for it had always been understood that 
               <br />
               the small Provinces should be enabled to carry on their Government 
               <br />

               he had no hesitation in opposing the Government scheme, although

               he yielded to no one in his desire to complete Confederation.

               Mr. BEATY had received no intimation from his constituents to 
               <br />
               oppose the Government scheme, and he believed the general 
               <br />
               impression in Ontario was that Confederation could not be 
               <br />
               completed without British Columbia. He had every conﬁdence in 
               <br />
               the Ministry both in legislation for the present and future, and he 
               <br />
               believed the interests of the country would be well cared for by 
               <br />
               them. In the matter of Manitoba the people of Ontario had been

               warned against the narrow minded Frenchmen, but he maintained

               <br />
               mainly indebted to the representatives of Lower Canada. If the 
               <br />
               present scheme carried and the railway was constructed 
               <br />
               successfully, as he believed it would be, the honour would belong 
               <br />
               to the Minister of Militia and his noble band of reformers. The 
               <br />
               matter had been fully discussed, and what was the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">policyiwell,</span> his 
               <br />
               idea was that the policy was whether the gentlemen of the 
               <br />
               Opposition should be allowed to sit on the Government benches. 
               <br />
               That was their policy, and they did not care whether the North West 
               <br />
               was developed or not. The Government now proposed, however, a 
               <br />
               scheme of opening up the country and numbers of emigrants would 
               <br />
               come in, instead of leaving for the States as at present, and before 
               <br />
               many years elapsed, thousands of emigrants would be attracted if 
               <br />
               the Government were allowed to carry out their plans of 
               <br />
               development. He looked forward to a great future for Canada on 
               <br />
               these grounds, and having every conﬁdence in the resolutions he 
               <br />
               should support them, and if he did otherwise, he would think he had
