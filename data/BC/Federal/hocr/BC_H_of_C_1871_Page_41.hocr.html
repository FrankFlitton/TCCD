               people were so wanting in intelligence that they would silently

               submit to terms which did not meet their approval without

               before this Parliament, the people who disapproved of them

               petitioned against them, and the Press generally discussed the

               The hon. member for Sherbrooke had raised a question as to how 
               <br />
               far this enterprise lay within our means. The hon. member had done 
               <br />
               better justice to the position of the Dominion in a former speech in 
               <br />
               which he had depicted the prosperity which Confederation had 
               <br />
               brought upon the country. It showed that the hon. member who ﬁrst 
               <br />
               presented Confederation in a tangible shape, in the year 1858, had 
               <br />
               spoken with prophetic zeal when he referred to it as the great means 
               <br />
               of elevating them, not only in the political, but in the ﬁnancial and 
               <br />
               commercial scale. The friends of Union might proudly point to the 
               <br />
               present position of the Dominion as irrefragable proof of the 
               <br />
               correctness of that statement for the prophecy had been more than 
               <br />
               realized. The Confederation was but a movement of yesterday, and 
               <br />
               the result already was a large surplus in the treasury aﬁer meeting 
               <br />
               all the Dominion engagements that the necessities of the Local 
               <br />
               Governments required, but the Government of this Dominion could 
               <br />
               come down, and not only point to the prosperity of every one of its 
               <br />
               component parts, but at the same time, show that this Dominion 
               <br />
               had entered on a career of ﬁnancial prosperity hitherto unknown to 
               <br />
               Canada. If this had been the result in the past, what might we not 
               <br />
               expect in the future? Two years ago the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Sherbrooke, in his criticism on the budget speech, had complained 
               <br />
               of what was not in it, rather than of what it did contain, and had said 
               <br />
               that some provision should have been made for opening up the 
               <br />
               North West. He (Hon. Mr. Tupper) thought the Government 
               <br />
               deserved credit rather than censure for having adopted the 
               <br />
               suggestion.

               In reply to the objections of the hon. member for Lambton about 
               <br />
               the cost of the proposed railway, he referred to the fact that its 
               <br />
               construction would be undertaken by a private company. No one 
               <br />
               had disputed the necessity of providing means of communication 
               <br />
               with the North West in order to settle it, yet hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               opposite complained that large grants of land should be made to any 
               <br />
               company undertaking the construction of a railway. Yet it was only 
               <br />

               <br />
               Dominion could give inﬁnitely better land for the purpose than the

               United States had offered or could now offer to American 
               <br />
               companies. The reservation of large blocks of lands, which would

               be greatly enhanced in value through the construction of this 
               <br />

               Mr. SCATCHERD was surprised to ﬁnd that in the debate on 
               <br />
               the present question there was less enthusiasm than was shown on 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst scheme of Confederation. He complained that only one 
               <br />
               party to this compact, the people of British Columbia had had an 
               <br />
               opportunity of pronouncing on this subject, while the greater party 
               <br />
               of the people of Canada had received no such opportunity. Already 
               <br />
               we had the lntercolonial Railway on our hands, for which we had 
               <br />
               had to submit to increased expenditure and taxation. Yet we were 
               <br />
               told that a larger and more difﬁcult work would not add to our 
               <br />
               burdens. A more monstrous and unreasonable proposition was 
               <br />
               never urged than this vast road could be built without increasing the 
               <br />
               burdens of the people. He held that Confederation so far had not 
               <br />
               proved the success predicted. In various sections there were 
               <br />
               jealousy, ill-feeling and discontent in relation to this Union and 
               <br />
               three sections, Nova Scotia, Quebec and Manitoba might be cited in 
               <br />
               support of his theory that Confederation had not been very 
               <br />
               satisfactory. He saw no difference between the position of the 
               <br />
               minority in 1865, and that of the minority now. The conduct of the 
               <br />
               Government was as unreasonable and arbitrary now as then. He 
               <br />
               believed this scheme would but add to difﬁculties and taxation on 
               <br />
               the country, and that its ill effects would be felt for 50 years. 
               <br />
               Holding these opinions he would vote for the amendment.
