               under these circumstances cannot be suffering! Our merchants are

               When we review the commercial history of the British American 
               <br />
               Provinces for the past thirty years, we notice that the progress of old 
               <br />
               Canada dates from the Union of the Eastern with the Western 
               <br />
               section and has followed the construction of Canals and Railways. 
               <br />
               The present Canal system of Canada was brought to its present 
               <br />
               condition, with all its imperfections the ﬁnest in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">worldiduring</span>

               that period. Twenty years ago, there were only some ﬁﬁy miles of 
               <br />
               railway in operation in the Province. At present, the total number of 
               <br />
               miles of rail is nearly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3,00070ne</span> of the lines is the second longest

               <br />
               than $13,000,000 annually. In 1841 when we commenced our canal 
               <br />
               improvements the revenue of Old Canada was $1,283,000 or $1 per 
               <br />
               head for every man, woman and child within its limits. In 1854, the 
               <br />
               commencement of railway enterprise, it was $5,694,000, or $2 per 
               <br />
               head', in 1866 it was above $12,000,000 or $4 per head. In 1850 the 
               <br />
               population of united Canada was only 1,842,265, and the exports 
               <br />
               some $30,000,000 or about $15.50 for every person. At present the 
               <br />
               total population is over 3,500,000 and exports $120,000,000 or 
               <br />
               nearly $35 per head. Or let us illustrate the subject by reference to 
               <br />
               the Dominion. In 1843 the revenue was about $2,000,000, whilst at 
               <br />
               the present time it is about $15,000,000, or about $3.50 per head of 
               <br />
               the population. In 1806 the value of exports from all British North 
               <br />
               America was only $9,287,940; in 1831 $16,523,579', in 1870 it was 
               <br />
               $73,573,490. In 1851 the tonnage entered inwards by sea in all 
               <br />
               British North American ports was 1,590,663. In 1870 the tonnage 
               <br />
               entered inwards by sea in the Dominion was 5,796,663. In 1851 the 
               <br />
               tonnage cleared outwards in all British North America was 
               <br />
               1,583,104. In 1870 the tonnage cleared outwards in Canada was 
               <br />
               5,619,745. In 1806, the aggregate tonnage of British America was 
               <br />
               71,943', in 1850, 446,935', at the present time, it is upwards of 
               <br />
               950,000.

               <br />
               section as far as the fur trade is concerned. The Hudson’s Bay 
               <br />
               Company is an association formed, as it is well known, of two 
               <br />
               distinct elements, the stockholders who, as a company have other 
               <br />
               interests apart from those of fur trading; and the chief factors and 
               <br />
               chief traders known as the working partners of the fur trade portion 
               <br />
               of the concern. The stockholders are the representatives of those to 
               <br />
               whom, under the name of “The Company of Adventurers of 
               <br />
               England trading in the Hudson’s Bay” was granted the charter by 
               <br />
               King Charles II to trade furs, etc. in the Hudson’s Bay and adjacent 
               <br />
               country. This company established a few posts near the shores of 
               <br />
               the Bay, and for years conﬁned their operations within 
               <br />
               comparatively a short distance from the coast. In course of time 
               <br />
               they advanced into the interior, where they came in contact with 
               <br />
               other traders, of whom the most active were sent out by a company 
               <br />
               having its headquarters in Canada and known as “The North West 
               <br />

               For a number of years these two rival companies competed for 
               <br />
               trade with such determination that not unfrequently when opposing 
               <br />
               parties met a conﬂict took place, resulting in loss of life. Under 
               <br />
               these circumstances it is not a matter of surprise that the business 
               <br />
               was found to be carried on at a considerable loss to both parties in 
               <br />
               consequence of which a Union took place. Since that time, business 
               <br />
               has been carried on to the mutual beneﬁt and satisfaction of all 
               <br />
               parties concerned. The Factors, Traders and Ofﬁcers in the service 
               <br />
               of the Company, generally may be considered Canadians as hitherto 
               <br />
               with but few exceptions, they have all either settled on the Red 
               <br />
               River or come down to Ontario and Quebec. In dealing, therefore, 
               <br />
               with this question of the Hudson’s Bay Company, it is to be hoped 
               <br />
               that the interests of these people will not be overlooked. The Fur 
               <br />
               Trade is a subject of no ordinary importance at the present time. 
               <br />
               Instead of leaving the Indians at the mercy of whoever may come in 
               <br />
               contact with them, there are but two alternatives, either of which, 
               <br />
               according to the opinion of experienced men, if adopted, might be 
               <br />
               made a source of large revenue to the Dominion. Of course it 
               <br />
               cannot be expected that the company will continue the fostering 
               <br />
               care with which it has hitherto treated the Indians in the trade 
               <br />
               operations with them. The fur country may become ﬂooded with 
               <br />
               unscrupulous adventurers in consequence of which the company 
               <br />
               will be obliged in a great measure to abandon the practice of giving 
               <br />
               supplies to them. Without the usual advances in the autumn a great 
               <br />
               number of the unfortunate people will be obliged to abandon 
               <br />
               systematic fur hunting in order to devote their chief attention to pot- 
               <br />
               hunting to support their families and prolong their own lives. It is 
               <br />
               only in case of competition that there is danger of the Indians 
               <br />
               suffering.
