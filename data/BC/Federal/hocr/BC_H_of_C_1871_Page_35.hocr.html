               Hon. Mr. DORION said the question had two aspects, the 
               <br />
               political and the ﬁnancial; the latter, however, was much the most 
               <br />
               important and had listened to the Government statements on that 
               <br />
               head in hope of being able to vote for the resolutions, but the 
               <br />
               minister of Finance had been able to give no favourable statement. 
               <br />
               He took great care not to give any details, and beyond the assertion 
               <br />
               that a cost of $100,000,000 would be practicable, they had heard 
               <br />
               nothing. The American lines had been cited as examples, but it had 
               <br />
               not been stated that in addition to the land grants an enormous 
               <br />
               amount of money had also been granted. The Minister of Finance 
               <br />
               ought to be able to state deﬁnitely the amount involved so that the 
               <br />
               House might not have to make a blind vote, and he regretted the 
               <br />
               humiliating proposal of the Minister of Inland Revenue, that after 
               <br />
               the pledge had been given it might afterwards be retracted. He 
               <br />
               spoke of the heavy obligations the Dominion already sustained, and 
               <br />
               maintained that the Union Act provided that the canal system ought 
               <br />
               to have been completed before any other responsibilities were 
               <br />
               incurred.

               Hon. Mr. TILLEY read the resolution at Quebec to show that 
               <br />
               the North West question was to be an express object of 
               <br />
               Confederation.

               Hon. Mr. DORION said that matter had already been attained. 
               <br />
               He had never had, and had not now, any faith in Confederation, but 
               <br />
               he had felt in duty bound not to oppose it, but if he were most 
               <br />
               anxious for the downfall of Confederation, he could desire for 
               <br />
               nothing more than the present scheme to attain that object. 
               <br />
               Reverting to the canal improvement, he considered it unjust that the 
               <br />
               credit of the country should be pledged to this immense extent 
               <br />
               before that canal improvement was completed. He quoted from a 
               <br />
               report of Mr. Fleming, characterising the Paciﬁc Railway as a 
               <br />
               commercial absurdity and that the maintenance of such a line would 
               <br />
               cost eight millions annually, and in fact that it was altogether 
               <br />
               impraticable, and stating that a macadamized road to the Rocky 
               <br />
               Mountains would require seventeen years for construction, and yet 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen opposite presumed to say that this gigantic work 
               <br />
               could be commenced and completed within ten years. What greater 
               <br />
               absurdity could be uttered in any intelligent Assembly? If 
               <br />
               Confederation must be had in some direction better have it with the 
               <br />
               150,000 of Newfoundland and the 100,000 of Prince Edward’s 
               <br />
               Island than with the 10,000 of British Columbia, while the 
               <br />
               inhabitants in one case were settled, and in the other mere roving 
               <br />
               adventurers. He did not admit the necessity of a Canadian Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               line, but thought the American lines should be used, and expend the 
               <br />
               money rather in opening up the North West by roads. He thought 
               <br />
               the four millions of people inhabiting the basin of the St. Lawrence 
               <br />
               were entitled to greater consideration than the small population of 
               <br />
               British Columbia, and if this large expenditure were to be incurred 
               <br />
               rather let it be used in enlarging the canals and so securing the great 
               <br />
               trade of the West.
