               As to the ﬁnancial aspect the responsibilities about being 
               <br />
               incurred, added to the cost of lntercolonial and the enlargement of 
               <br />
               the canals, a debt of$300,000,000, would be incurred, which at ﬁve 
               <br />
               per cent would involve an annual expenditure of $15,000,000. 
               <br />
               Added to this there would be the yearly and ever increasing burden 
               <br />
               of maintaining the railway, all of which would fall on the poor tax

               <br />

               Finance. Language failed him to express his detestation of the 
               <br />
               Government that thus prejudiced the good interest of the country, 
               <br />

               objects being to bring in the British North West Territory, and 
               <br />

               British Columbia and the North West could not be retained without 
               <br />

               <br />
               expenditure, independent of British Columbia, and they must 
               <br />
               advance', they could not recede. Without executing the policy these

               <br />
               the whole distance. He argued that the road could be built to the 
               <br />
