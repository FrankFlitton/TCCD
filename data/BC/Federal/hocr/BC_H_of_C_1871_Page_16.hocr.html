               <br />
               miners were obliged to pay enormous prices for the necessaries 
               <br />
               of life and they were looking to their country for the means of 
               <br />
               communication by which they were to be supplied at reasonable 
               <br />
               rates. If Canada would not undertake it, they might look to the 
               <br />
               Republic for help. (Hear, hear.) But this Union could beneﬁt 
               <br />
               Canada commercially, for the opening up of the North West and 
               <br />
               the consequent increase of trade must bring an immense volume 
               <br />
               of trade to Montreal and Quebec and the Maritime cities. 
               <br />
               Everything conspired to make this Union a prosperous one and

               he did not doubt that the House would sustain the measure

               Mr. MACKENZIE regretted that the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               opposite could not discuss this question for three quarters of an 
               <br />
               hour without threatening the annexation of that colony to the 
               <br />
               United States if this House rejected the present propositions. 
               <br />
               Such a line of argument could only be indulged in by the hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen in order to create a feeling that the papers brought 
               <br />
               down as agreed between the Dominion Government, and that of 
               <br />
               Columbia is in the nature of a treaty that is not to be altered by 
               <br />
               any proposition to be made in this House', if such were the case 
               <br />
               it would be useless to discuss the question. In 1865 the 
               <br />
               Parliaments of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick were 
               <br />
               told the same story with reference to the resolutions which 
               <br />
               formed the basis of Confederation, but those resolutions were 
               <br />
               afterwards altered by the delegation at London, and he was not 
               <br />
               prepared to accept these resolutions in the nature of a treaty 
               <br />
               which this House could not alter. He believed on the other hand 
               <br />
               that it was essential for the future prosperity of the Dominion, 
               <br />
               that this colony should be admitted into the Union and that there 
               <br />
               should be the best possible understanding as to the terms of 
               <br />
               admission to prevent future complications, and he should not be 
               <br />
               prepared to acquiesce quietly in the resolutions which had been 
               <br />
               prepared by the hon. gentlemen opposite. By these resolutions, 
               <br />
               the basis of our political system would be violated as was done 
               <br />
               in the case of Manitoba last session, and after the struggle which 
               <br />
               had to be gone through to secure that basis, he should certainly 
               <br />
               oppose any further attempt to alter it, that is representation by 
               <br />
               population as regards the House of Commons. Some deviation 
               <br />
               he acknowledged might be made in the Senate. The Hon. 
               <br />
               Minister of Customs tells us that the population of Whites, 
               <br />
               Chinese, and Indians is 60,000 in that country, but we have 
               <br />
               never given representation under our system to Indians. If such 
               <br />
               were allowed we could claim several more members for 
               <br />
               Ontario. He would consent to a considerable grant of money to 
               <br />
               carry on the Government of a new colony, and particularly of 
               <br />
               such a difﬁcult country as Columbia, and he would not show

               <br />

               <br />
               public hands, as while the revenue was $3,000 per annum, the 
               <br />
               cost of management was $6,000, and he took the same view 
               <br />
               with regard to the land grant for the construction of the railway

               From all he knew of the country after descending from the 
               <br />
               Rocky Mountains the country was valueless for agricultural 
               <br />
               purposes. The gold mines have certainly proved very 
               <br />
               remunerative, but they are carried on by large companies, and 
               <br />
               the large importations of breadstuffs into the colony 
               <br />
               corroborated the barrenness of the land. He thought the 
               <br />
               Government should be prepared to give every information as to 
               <br />
               the mode they propose of constructing the Railway, and whether 
               <br />
               any propositions had been received for its construction. He 
               <br />
               denounced the Government for desiring to undertake the 
               <br />
               completion of the work in ten years, and should certainly record 
               <br />
               his protest against such an arrangement, and he considered that 
               <br />
               to give such an immense grant as was proposed to any Company 
               <br />
               would be to retard the settlement of the country, as was found to 
               <br />
               be the case in the western States. He doubted very much if the 
               <br />
               Province of Ontario would grant the land as anticipated by the 
               <br />
               Minister of Customs, and if they did the greater part of it was 
               <br />
               valueless for cultivation, and certainly would not realize $1 per 
               <br />
               acre as estimated. The Northern Paciﬁc road was largely built 
               <br />
               by English capital before the land and money grant of the 
               <br />
               United States was obtained, and the difﬁculties were not to be 
               <br />
               compared to those which would be met on the Canadian 
               <br />
