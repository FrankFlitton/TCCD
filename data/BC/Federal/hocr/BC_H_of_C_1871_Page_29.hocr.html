               <br />

               <br />
               that preference would not be shared by the House or the country. 
               <br />
               The original terms had provided the building of a coach road within 
               <br />
               three years of union, and that the railway also should be built as 
               <br />
               early as possible, with a speciﬁed expenditure of a million a year.

               The member for Lambton stated that he had never contemplated

               anything more than a road from Lake Superior, but of what beneﬁt

               He also told the House that he was opposed to locking up the 
               <br />
               lands of the country by handing them over to a company, but he 
               <br />
               (Hon. Mr. Morris) maintained that the course being pursued by that 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman would lock up the lands for ever. How could the 
               <br />
               lands be available for settlement and cultivation unless facility of 
               <br />
               access was provided? The Illinois road, which had been used by the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman as an illustration of the danger of locking up lands 
               <br />
               by handing them over to a company, was a proof that the very 
               <br />
               reverse was the case, for the results of that road were that Illinois 
               <br />
               was peopled rapidly, and the lands, instead of being locked up, were 
               <br />
               almost entirely disposed of, for out of a grant of two and a half 
               <br />
               millions of acres, only half a million remained in the hands of the 
               <br />
               company. He asked the House seriously the nature and character of 
               <br />
               the land proposed to be acquired. That land consisted of the United 
               <br />
               Province of British Columbia and Vancouver’s Island, and no one, 
               <br />
               who understood the matter, could deny that the addition of that 
               <br />
               province would increase enormously the wealth, the resources, and 
               <br />
               the prosperity of the Dominion. He had several extracts from works 
               <br />
               on the country, showing its valuable nature and character, and 
               <br />
               thought the member for Lambton was not justiﬁed in the remarks 
               <br />
               he had used to the effect of there being scarcely any arable land in 
               <br />
               the whole of British Columbia.

               Mr. MACKENZIE stated that what he had said was that aﬁer

               Hon. Mr. MORRIS thought the construction he had put on the 
               <br />
               hon. member’s remarks was not very far wrong, but he could state 
               <br />
               on the undisputable authority of Mr. Trutch, the Surveyor General 
               <br />
               of British Columbia, that taking the whole of British Columbia and 
               <br />
               Vancouver Island fully one-third, or about 50,000,000 of acres was 
               <br />
               good farming land, while the whole acreage of Ontario was 
               <br />
               77,000,000 acres. It appeared to him that throughout the whole 
               <br />
               debate a strange fallacy had existed. The Railway had been spoken 
               <br />
               of as a mere bargain to induce British Columbia to enter the Union, 
               <br />
               whereas that work was of more importance to Canada than it was to 
               <br />
               British Columbia, for, having already acquired the great North West 
               <br />
               they were compelled by force of circumstances to go forward and 
               <br />
               render it a valuable acquisition, and he was convinced that if the 
               <br />
               House turned its back on British Columbia by adopting the 
               <br />
               amendment of the member for Lambton, it would do a grievous 
               <br />
               injury to the cause of Confederation which might prove irreparable. 
               <br />
               The present position of Canada was analogous to that of the States

               The House in the course of the debate had rung with cries that a 
               <br />
               debt of a $100 million was being incurred, but the speakers knew 
               <br />
               well that by means of the land, the line could be constructed 
               <br />
               without any approach to a burden that the people could not bear, 
               <br />
               and no Ministry would ever dare to propose to incur such a debt as 
               <br />
               had been spoken of in this case. The Northern Paciﬁc was being 
               <br />
               constructed on a land grand only, and could it be doubted therefore, 
               <br />
               that Canada, with better lands and fewer difﬁculties, would be able 
               <br />
               to devise such a scheme as would attract foreign capital, as the 
               <br />
               Americans had done. The House must be aware that before a dollar 
               <br />
               could be expended or an acre of land granted, a scheme would have 
               <br />
               to be submitted to and endorsed by the House, and therefore the 
               <br />
               whole matter would be within the control of Parliament. The 
               <br />
               question was whether or not British Columbia should be invited to 
               <br />
               join the Union, and whether or not the railway should be 
               <br />
               constructed, and he believed that when the Union should be 
               <br />
               accomplished and representatives from British Columbia should sit 
               <br />
               in that House, there would be no doubt of the railway being 
               <br />
               proceeded with as rapidly as the resources of the country would 
               <br />
               admit. He had every conﬁdence not only that the House would 
               <br />
               endorse the proposition of the Government, but that it would be 
               <br />
               approved by the people of the country also, and it would be a bright 
               <br />
               day for the Dominion when the ﬁrst sod was cut on the Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway, and in time to come many of his friends opposite, 
               <br />
               who were really desirous of consummating Confederation, though 
               <br />
               they might now oppose this scheme, would rejoice that the 
               <br />
               Government had not been deterred from following out the work, but 
               <br />
               had persevered in their determination to carry forward the work of 
               <br />
               union with the Paciﬁc colonies.

               <br />
               (Hon. Sir A.T. Galt) considered that the course he was pursuing

               <br />
               than that pursued by the government, and that a policy of prudence 
               <br />
               and foresight was more necessary for the future progress of the 
               <br />

               desire to follow it ultimately, if too hastily followed would defeat

               the very object desired to be obtained.
