               Columbia we had to depart from this principle of representation

               <br />
               as regards the communication, it being decided that there should 
               <br />

               allow ample time for the construction of the Railway, and the 
               <br />
               Government had thought it better to limit the matter to ten years

               The member for Sherbrooke had stated that all British 
               <br />
               Columbia asked for was a coach road connecting Fort Garry 
               <br />
               with the Government roads of British Columbia and an 
               <br />
               expenditure of a million dollars a year on a railway, and that the 
               <br />
               proposition submitted by the Government was less favourable to 
               <br />
               Canada. He entirely dissented from the hon. member on that 
               <br />
               matter, on these grounds. When the road had been proposed it 
               <br />
               had been found from enquiry and investigation that from the 
               <br />
               high cost of labour and other charges that would have to be met 
               <br />
               in constructing such a road within the stated time of three years, 
               <br />
               that the cost would be very heavy, very heavy indeed, and in 
               <br />
               addition to this it was coupled with a proposition that a railway 
               <br />
               should be built as soon as practicable, and that there should be 
               <br />
               an annual expenditure from the commencement of a million of 
               <br />
               dollars.

               Under these circumstances the Government had held that any 
               <br />
               expenditure on a coach road was useless, and one that was not 
               <br />
               required, inasmuch as all the trafﬁc would be taken by the 
               <br />
               railway as soon as completed. Taking this view therefore the 
               <br />
               Government had at once dissented from the proposition of 
               <br />
               British Columbia, and would not agree to it. The Government 
               <br />
               had also considered it unwise to consent to an annual 
               <br />
               expenditure of a million of dollars from the commencement 
               <br />

               <br />

               completed as speedily as possible. Then again the propositions 
               <br />
               of British Columbia had been changed in respect of

               to the matter of the railway, he said the House had heard that it 
               <br />
               was estimated that the money grant necessary to construct the 
               <br />
               railway, in addition to the land grant, would amount to l and a 
               <br />
               quarter millions per annum, but it must not be understood that 
               <br />
               the expenditure of that sum of money was involved in the 
               <br />
               proposition before the House. That proposition was simply to 
               <br />
               admit British Columbia into the Dominion and connect her with 
               <br />
               the Dominion system of railways, and it must be remembered 
               <br />
               that the agreement entered into by the delegates at the 
               <br />
               conferences at Quebec and London, was that the six Provinces 
               <br />
               should be brought together, and also that the Red River country 
               <br />
               and British Columbia should also be included in the 
               <br />
               Confederation.

               Such was the agreement, and happily, part had been 
               <br />
               accomplished, for notwithstanding all the trouble, all the 
               <br />
               anxiety, and all the difﬁculties that had arisen in connection 
               <br />
               with the North West, he believed the conviction from one end of 
               <br />
               the country to the other was that that country had been acquired 
               <br />
               on very favourable terms. Well the next thing after getting 
               <br />
               possession, was how to utilize it, and how could it be utilized? 
               <br />
               Surely not by building coach roads, not by simply improving the 
               <br />
               communication by water, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">noithe</span> North West could only be 
               <br />
               used to advantage by means of a railway running to the foot of 
               <br />
               the Rocky Mountains, and the Government would not be doing 
               <br />
               its duty to the Dominion unless it projected that work. It was 
               <br />
               well known on the most reliable information, that in the valley 
               <br />
               of the Saskatchewan and the Red River there was a tract of 
               <br />
               Prairie Land, immense in extent, and magniﬁcent in character, 
               <br />
               and how could immigration be conducted to that country, how 
               <br />
               could supplies be carried to settlers, how could the produce of 
               <br />
               that country be brought to a market unless there was a railway, 
               <br />
               and he did not hesitate to say that it had been the deliberately 
               <br />
               expressed opinion of the House and the country, that as soon as 
               <br />
               the country was acquired, a railway must be built to the foot of 
               <br />
               the Rocky Mountains. Believing this to be the determination of 
               <br />
               the Government and the country, the delegates from British 
               <br />
               Columbia came and submitted a proposition that that Railway 
               <br />
               should be extended from the foot of the Rocky Mountains to the 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc, and he put it to the House and the Paciﬁc, whether a 
               <br />
               line could not be built to the Paciﬁc, much cheaper, in 
               <br />
               proportion, than one ending at the Rocky Mountains. The one 
               <br />
               would be available for local trafﬁc only, and very much larger 
               <br />
               subsidies, therefore, would have to be paid, whereas a line 
               <br />
               running from the Atlantic to the Paciﬁc would receive a very 
               <br />
               large amount of through trafﬁc, and in addition to this, it had 
               <br />
               always been contemplated and determined that there should be 
               <br />
               such a line through Canadian Territory.
