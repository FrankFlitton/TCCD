               Hon. Mr. LANGEVIN: Who could doubt their ﬁnding a 
               <br />
               company with the double inducement of land and money, 
               <br />
               when in the States and other countries railways were begun 
               <br />
               and completed on the basis of land grants only? We were 
               <br />
               bound, irrespective of British Columbia, to construct a railway 
               <br />
               to the Rocky Mountains, certainly through a magniﬁcent 
               <br />
               country for hundred of miles‘, but what would be the use of 
               <br />
               stopping there? Would it not be to a certain extent money ill- 
               <br />
               spent, when the road stopped short of the natural boundary of 
               <br />
               the Dominion, of the natural ocean outlet on the Paciﬁc? Our 
               <br />
               interests undoubtedly dictated that prolongation. He 
               <br />
               maintained that in a revenue point of view Canada would not 
               <br />
               lose by this measure, for, as he had pointed out, the 
               <br />
               consumption of dutiable goods per head of the population was 
               <br />
               much greater that in Canada. There was already a population 
               <br />
               of 60,000, including Chinese and Indians, many of whom were 
               <br />
               civilized and useful inhabitants. He denied the statement ofthe 
               <br />
               member for Lotbiniere that we already owed $100,000,000, 
               <br />
               our debt being but $80,000,000, and as the Government 
               <br />
               intended having the railway built by a private company they 
               <br />
               would incur nothing like another hundred millions of debt.

               As to the pension list, several of the recipients could be 
               <br />
               made useful to the Dominion as public ofﬁcers. It was absurd 
               <br />
               to suppose Canada could depend on the American Northern 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               possess a railroad through our own territory, instead of 
               <br />
               travelling westward by one 100 or 200 miles from our frontier.

               It was necessary to satisfy the Columbians, as well as to give 
               <br />
               conﬁdence to British capitalists, that a period should be ﬁxed 
               <br />

               <br />
               should appear with representatives from that Province sitting 
               <br />
               among us, that despite our good faith and utmost efforts it was

               impossible to complete the work within the time named they 
               <br />
               could not and would not ﬁnd fault with us. He did not 
               <br />
               anticipate any failure, but looked at the worst contingency. He 
               <br />
               believed it was our duty and our interest took to complete 
               <br />
               Confederation and establish a British empire in North 
               <br />
               America, with the freest institutions in the world, under the 
               <br />
               British Flag now protecting us, and which would continue to 
               <br />
               protect us so long as we desired. He believed his countrymen 
               <br />
               of all origins and classes desired this result, and that triﬂing 
               <br />
               difﬁculties would not induce them to abandon reasonable 
               <br />
               effort for its attainment. British Columbia did not merit the 
               <br />
               treatment proposed by the amendment and he hoped the House 
               <br />
               would not refuse to adopt cheerfully the resolutions of the

               and would be glad to see the whole of British North America 
               <br />
               united. There were two very important <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">considerationsfone</span> 
               <br />
               was that there was a great departure from the principles of the 
               <br />
               constitution in the matter of the representation. With regard to 
               <br />
               the ﬁnancial aspect, however, he could not but believe that 
               <br />
               lasting injury would be done to the country by the expenditure 
               <br />
               to be incurred. The cost of the railway could not be less than 
               <br />
               $100,000,000, and it was equivalent to the Imperial 
               <br />
               Government asking England to embark in an enterprise 
               <br />
               involving a thousand millions. Was not the matter, therefore, 
               <br />
               sufﬁciently grave to merit the most serious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">considerationfand</span> 
               <br />
               he entreated the Government to pause. The faith of the country 
               <br />
               was pledged by the resolution to complete the railway within 
               <br />
               ten years, no matter if the result should be ruin. No verbal 
               <br />
               reservations could have effect, the written record alone could 
               <br />
               hold, and the words of the resolution were clear, and ifin two 
               <br />
               years the railway was not commenced, British Columbia could 
               <br />
               appeal to the Imperial Government. They had been told that 
               <br />
               the expenditure would not burden the people, but could that be 
               <br />
               believed, and no one would undertake to say that a Company 
               <br />
               would undertake the work as a remunerative scheme, and 
               <br />
               therefore sooner or later, the Government would have to pay 
               <br />
               every dollar of the expense, and the contractors would want 
               <br />
               the land as a proﬁt. No one could suppose that even after the 
               <br />
               road was built, it would pay one tenth of its working expenses, 
               <br />
               and how, therefore, could British capitalists be expected to 
               <br />
               undertake the work.

               The Minister of Customs had intimated that if they did not 
               <br />
               strike quickly, they would alienate British Columbia from the 
               <br />
               enterprise, but was that an element for discussion', no, if such 
               <br />
               were the case, the matter belonged to the Imperial Government 
               <br />
               only. Was the House ready to involve the country in so large 
               <br />
               an increase of debt? That debt was already $100,000,000 and 
               <br />
               there were many burdens that would arise from the 
               <br />
               Intercolonial and other works. The Union Act had provided for 
               <br />
               the extension of the Canal system and that had only been 
               <br />
               delayed because of the deﬁcient state of the ﬁnances of the 
               <br />
               Dominion. The cost of the railway could not be named, it 
               <br />
               might be much greater than the amount named and yet coûte 
               <br />
               que coûte the country would stand pledged to complete it. He 
               <br />
               should oppose the measure because it would impose burdens 
               <br />
               on the people that they were not able to bear and would 
               <br />
               involve the country in ruin and disaster.

               measure, because he believed it violated their constitutional rights.

               In the Confederation scheme the principle of representation by

               <br />
               being violated. The Minister of Militia himself represented many

               times the whole number of white men in British Columbia, and 
               <br />
               there were many similar cases in the House, and the thing was so

               absurd and unjust that if it were the only objection, he would
