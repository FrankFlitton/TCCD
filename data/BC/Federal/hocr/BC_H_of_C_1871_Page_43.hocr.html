               <br />

               <br />

               Hon. Mr. HOLTON called the attention of the Government to 
               <br />
               the manner in which a certain parcel of land belonging to the 
               <br />
               Dominion was leased to the Montreal Warehousing Company. The 
               <br />
               history of the land was this: In 1865 Government purchased from 
               <br />
               private parties in Montreal a lot of land adjoining the canal basin, 
               <br />
               on the recommendation of Mr. Allan, for the purpose of increasing 
               <br />
               the wharfage and shed accommodation there. For this lot the 
               <br />
               Government paid the sum of $25,000. The Warehousing Co., 
               <br />
               through Mr. Brydges, made application to Government for the 
               <br />
               purchase of the lot subsequent to confederation of the Provinces, 
               <br />
               but on the advice of the ofﬁcers of the Public Works Department, 
               <br />
               the Government refused to sell it. On the 19th July, 1870, the hon. 
               <br />
               the Minister of Militia, in the absence of the Minister of Public 
               <br />
               Works, and acting for that minister, reported to the Council in favor 
               <br />
               of granting the lease of this lot to the Warehousing Company for a 
               <br />
               term of 21 years with an annual rental of $700, that being 
               <br />
               considered less than simple interest on one half the cost. This report 
               <br />
               was made to the Privy Council without being supported by any of 
               <br />
               the professional gentlemen connected with the Department. One of 
               <br />
               the conditions, however, was that the Government might resume 
               <br />
               possession of the property on giving three months’ notice, on 
               <br />
               condition of paying for any building that might be erected thereon, 
               <br />
               subsequent to the lease of the property. He, therefore, moved an 
               <br />
               amendment to the motion to go into Committee of Supply, reciting 
               <br />
