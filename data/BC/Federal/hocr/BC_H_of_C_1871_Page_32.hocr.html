               Hon. Sir FRANCIS HlNCKS had been anxious before speaking 
               <br />
               to hear the views of others. He had listened with great attention to 
               <br />
               the gentleman who had preceded him, and there could only be one 
               <br />
               opinion that the whole tone of his remarks showed opposition to the 
               <br />
               acquisition to British Columbia, and opposition to the constructions 
               <br />
               of a railway, and the coalition that had taken place on the opposite 
               <br />
               side showed only opposition to the cause of union with the Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               colonies. He would ask members on both sides to consider the 
               <br />
               position of the Government, and he assumed they were all in favour 
               <br />
               of Confederation. He desired to call particular attention to the fact 
               <br />
               that all proceedings were of the character of negotiations between 
               <br />
               two parties, as to the best means of accomplishing an object on 
               <br />
               which both were agreed. The Government entered into the 
               <br />
               negotiations, and with one or two exceptions the whole House 
               <br />
               seemed in favour of the Union with British Columbia and of the 
               <br />
               construction of the railway.

               He was surprised, however, to hear the member for Gloucester 
               <br />
               cheered by the gentleman round him when speaking of ignoring the 
               <br />
               whole population except the whites. The remainder of the 
               <br />
               population contributed most largely to the revenue, and he could 
               <br />
               speak from experience that the Chinese were an exceedingly 
               <br />
               valuable class as a duty paying people. The objections of hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen had dwindled down entirely to the matter of the railroad. 
               <br />
               The proposition made was that the railway was an absolute 
               <br />
               necessity, and that Canada should use every exertion to construct it 
               <br />
               at as early a date as possible. In the negotiations that took place, it 
               <br />
               was found impossible that Canada could undertake to commence 
               <br />
               this railway and make a stated payment annually, and it had never 
               <br />
               been understood that the Government themselves should undertake 
               <br />
               the work, but that it should be done by means of Companies with a 
               <br />
               land grand and money grant. Every calculation had been based on 
               <br />
               that understanding.

               Hon. Sir FRANCIS HlNCKS said it was necessary to give 
               <br />
               minute details, and he had already given a rough estimate based on 
               <br />
               statements of the most eminent engineers. Hon. gentlemen had 
               <br />
               admitted the necessity of the railway, but that had not been the tone 
               <br />
               of the member for Gloucester. His views were widely different 
               <br />
               from those of the representatives of Ontario. During the course of 
               <br />
               the discussion, he could not help thinking of the important 
               <br />
               proceedings at Washington, and thinking of those and of the 
               <br />
               important negotiations with the delegates from British Columbia, he 
               <br />
               was surprised at the cavilling on small matters which had taken 
               <br />
               place. The member for Gloucester seemed entirely opposed to the 
               <br />
               railway, but that was not the view of the member for Sherbrooke, 
               <br />
               who was well known as a promoter of such a railway, and a 
               <br />
               believer in its practicability. The Government scheme was a 
               <br />
               modiﬁcation of the propositions of British Columbia, and although 
               <br />
               they would not undertake a stated annual expenditure, they fully 
               <br />
               admitted the necessity of the construction of the railway.

               Hon. Sir FRANCIS HlNCKS said no, he had already stated that 
               <br />
               it was estimated that the Dominion would have to pay about a 
               <br />
               million and a quarter a year, but it was well understood that if 
               <br />
               insurmountable difﬁculties arose, the Government could not be

               But it was necessary to satisfy British Columbia that Canada was 
               <br />
               in earnest in going on with the work, and therefore a time was 
               <br />
               speciﬁed. No one had answered the argument that the railway was 
               <br />
               not entirely a bargain with British Columbia, for if that colony had 
               <br />
               not consented to join the Union would not a railway to the Rocky 
               <br />
               Mountains still have been a necessity. The negotiations had 
               <br />
               necessarily to assume the shape of a Treaty, and in all such matters 
               <br />
               concessions had to be made on both sides. The delegates 
               <br />
               themselves had been of different opinions, and the result of the 
               <br />
               conferences that had taken place was embodied in the resolutions 
               <br />
               before the House, and no amendments could be made without 
               <br />
               throwing open the whole question. These were questions on which 
               <br />
               the people of British Columbia dissented from the terms now 
               <br />
               settled, and any amendment would reopen the whole matter. The 
               <br />
               matter must be dealt with and accepted or rejected as a whole.

               Very many more forebodings had been expressed as to the 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial result of the propositions. The debt of Canada was about 
               <br />
               $20 a head and that of America $60 a head, and yet they could 
               <br />
               undertake three different lines of road, and he did not think Canada 
               <br />
               need have any fear on the matter. As to the debt of $100,000,000 
               <br />
               Government had no intention of incurring anything of the sort. Of 
               <br />
               course the Government undertook the work in ten years, but if aﬁer 
               <br />
               doing everything to carry out the engagement in good faith, it 
               <br />
               should be found that untoward circumstances should prevent the 
               <br />
               completion of the work, could it be supposed that Canada would be 
               <br />
               required to proceed to her own serious disadvantage, even if the 
               <br />
               work might be delayed for some years? He referred to the strictures 
               <br />
               of the member for Wentworth as to the Municipalities Laws, and 
               <br />
               shewed that the measure he had proposed had been most generally 
               <br />
               supported, and yet he was charged individually with the whole 
               <br />
               matter. All that had been done however, was to enable 
               <br />
               municipalities to borrow money in their own discretion. He spoke 
               <br />
               of what the member for Oxford South had said, as to his departure 
               <br />
               from, and return to Canada, explaining the circumstances that had 
               <br />
               led to his doing so, denying all charge of inconsistency. He then 
               <br />
               continued, they had either to spurn or accept British Columbia, and 
               <br />
               the result of the amendment, if carried, would be to do away with 
               <br />
               all hope of bringing British Columbia into the Union.
