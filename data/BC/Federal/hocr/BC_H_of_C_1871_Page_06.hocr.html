               Hon. Mr. CONNELL (whose remarks were very indistinctly 
               <br />
               heard in the reporter’s gallery) referred to a mistake which had been 
               <br />
               made in the report of his speech yesterday with regard to the 
               <br />
               settlement of accounts between New Brunswick and the Dominion. 
               <br />
               He had been represented as saying that “it would be necessary to 
               <br />
               get an alteration of the Union Act.” He would not like to have it go 
               <br />
               abroad to his constituents that he had made such an absurd 
               <br />
               statement. He had no wish to have the Union Act disturbed for a 
               <br />
               settlement of the accounts between New Brunswick and the 
               <br />

               hon. ﬁiends opposite would say “hear, hear” at the very mention 
               <br />
               of the measure. He would explain that since we were about to have 
               <br />
               another province comprised in this Dominion, it was obvious that 
               <br />
               the government could not yet enact a law to affect all the provinces 
               <br />
               of the Dominion, as far as the representation of this House was 
               <br />
               concerned. The circumstances of Manitoba having been recently 
               <br />
               admitted into the Union and British Columbia being on the eve of 
               <br />
               joining the Confederation, had led the Government to the 
               <br />
               conclusion that it would be better to carry on the next election for 
               <br />
               the Dominion under the laws as they now prevail in the several 
               <br />
               provinces. (Hear, hear from the Opposition.) He might state that the 
               <br />
               bill too, contained a provision with regard to the number of days on 
               <br />
               which elections were to take place. This Bill provided that the 
               <br />
               elections should take place on one day. (Hear, hear.)

               <br />

               <br />
               passed one, and now they were asked to deal with another one. The 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               of the new Provinces into Confederation. At what period since the 
               <br />

               <br />
               Provinces were to be added? Every day they were told they were

               Mr. BLAKE: And yet the Hon. Minister of Militia had asserted 
               <br />
               that it was in view of these additions to the Dominion that this 
               <br />
               temporary Act was provided. Last session the Opposition had 
               <br />
               pointed out the effect that the new measure then submitted would 
               <br />
               have in the East and in the West. They had shown that it would be 
               <br />
               impossible to work it in Manitoba, and that difﬁculties would arise 
               <br />
               in other Provinces too. But they were told that their arguments were 
               <br />
               fallacious, and that the Union would overcome all the difﬁculties 
               <br />
               which were then deprecated. He was glad to hear that, taught by 
               <br />
               experience, they had admitted the truth of the arguments then 
               <br />
               advanced by the Opposition, that it was necessary to respect the 
               <br />
               views of the different Provinces on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subject</span> and by degrees as 
               <br />
               they became more acquainted with the franchise laws of other 
               <br />
               countries, the Government had made some approach towards 
               <br />
