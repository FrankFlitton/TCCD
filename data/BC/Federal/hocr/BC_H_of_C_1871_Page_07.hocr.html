               Hon. Sir GEORGE-E. CARTIER said he did not intend to

               <br />
               answer some of the observations made by the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               opposite. The Manitoba measure was submitted to the House as the 
               <br />
               result of the negotiations carried on between the Dominion of 
               <br />
               Canada and the gentlemen sent as delegates from Manitoba. No one 
               <br />
               knew at the close of last session that Manitoba would certainly be a 
               <br />
               member of the Confederation. There was no necessity or intention 
               <br />
               at the outset that Manitoba should form a province and be 
               <br />
               comprised in the Confederation. It was intended that it should be a 
               <br />
               Crown colony, and that very reason induced the Government at the 
               <br />
               time to withdraw the Bill.

               remarks of the hon. member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lambton,</span> he would say that the Bill 
               <br />
               was proposed last year as there was no hope that we should have 
               <br />
               British Columbia so soon. Every one expected of course, that 
               <br />
               sooner or later that colony would be comprised as one of the sister 
               <br />
               colonies in the Dominion. It would be useless at the close of this 
               <br />
               Parliament, with one Province just admitted and another shortly to 
               <br />
               be admitted into the Confederation, to endeavour to assimilate the 
               <br />
               laws. They could not make a law now which would apply to British 
               <br />
               Columbia. He hoped his hon. friend would take with a better feeling
