               <br />
               British Columbia had only asked for an expenditure of a million 
               <br />

               <br />

               if the Government’s resolutions were carried, Parliament would still 
               <br />
               retain the control of the matter. The details of the measure might 
               <br />
               come before them, but the obligation would remain that the work 
               <br />
               must be carried through coûte que coûte. Five years ago, it had been

               <br />

               <br />
               Canada had to take a portion of the circulation of the country to 
               <br />
               meet her ﬂoating debt, two years ago, the Government had to 
               <br />
               borrow $2,500,000 from the Bank of Montreal, to enable them to 
               <br />
               say that the money borrowed for the lntercolonial was still within 
               <br />
               their control, and only one year ago, the Finance Minister had to ask 
               <br />
               an increase of 5% on all duties to provide against a possible 
               <br />
               deﬁciency of revenue, but yet, when it now fortunately happened 
               <br />
               that we had a surplus, it seemed to be believed that this state of 
               <br />
               things must continue, and that it was safe to incur any amount of 
               <br />
               obligation. He thought the people of British Columbia, if they really 
               <br />
               desired union, would be quite satisﬁed that the Dominion would 
               <br />
               construct a railway as rapidly as her resources would admit, and 
               <br />
               would not ask for any more. He hoped and believed the House

               Mr. OLIVER resumed the debate arguing that the paciﬁc colony 
               <br />
               should be admitted into the Union on the same terms as the other 
               <br />
               provinces. He denied that those who favoured the amendment were 
               <br />
               opposed to the admission of British Columbia, or even to the 
               <br />
               building of the Paciﬁc railway. He favoured these schemes, but 
               <br />
               thought we should consider the effect of such a very large 
               <br />
               expenditure at the present time. He considered that to allow six 
               <br />
               gentlemen from British Columbia to take their seats as representing 
               <br />
               only 100,000 people, was unfair to the other parts of the Dominion. 
               <br />
               Another feature in the scheme was unfair. The debt of British 
               <br />
               Columbia was taken at $1,666,620, which was assumed by the 
               <br />
               Dominion. This amounted to $20 odd per head of the population, 
               <br />
               whereas in Quebec and Ontario the amount per head of debt 
               <br />
               assumed by the Dominion and subsidies was only $2.07. lt had 
               <br />
               been proposed that thirteen million of acres of lands running

               would be a constant cause of expenditure for management and 
               <br />
               surveying. (Hear, hear.) lt would be better that these lands should 
               <br />
               remain in the lands of the Local Government of British Columbia', 
               <br />
               otherwise they might pass into the hands of land speculators, a state 
               <br />
               of things which would prove ruinous to the settlement of the 
               <br />
               country. If these lands were not locked up, they would be sufﬁcient 
               <br />
               to support a population of two millions, and it would be better that a 
               <br />
               money bonus should be given and these lands opened up to the 
               <br />
               people for settlement. (Hear, hear.) He believed that the railway 
               <br />
               should be prosecuted with energy, and all the money that could be 
               <br />
               spared spent upon it. That was the proposition contained in the 
               <br />
               amendment before the House. It was the duty of the Finance 
               <br />
               Minister in introducing this scheme, which pledged the country to 
               <br />
               complete the road in ten years, to tell the House where the money to 
               <br />
               build it was to come from. He calculated that our present debt, and 
               <br />
               obligations already or soon to be incurred, would amount to 
               <br />
               $127,000,000, and if to this were added $100,000,000 for the 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway, the amount would be $227,000,000', the interest 
               <br />
               per annurn would be $11,350,000. He for one was not prepared to 
               <br />
               go that length. To do so would injure the present and future 
               <br />
               prospects of the Confederation. He would support the amendment.

               Mr. MAGILL was in favour of bringing all British North 
               <br />
               America into the Union, but on terms equitable and fair to all the 
               <br />
               provinces. The terms proposed by the Government were not of that 
               <br />
               nature, and if the measure were carried, it would have the effect of 
               <br />
               driving immigration from our shores. It was proposed to sap the 
               <br />
               very foundations of the constitution which had been ﬁarned with 
               <br />
               such care and at such a cost. It was too much to expect this colony

               people of this Dominion on the subject, and say that it should not be 
               <br />
               altered in any degree. It was unfair and he, for one, should record

               Mr. COLBY believed that the hon. member for Lambton

               expressed the opinion of the whole country when he said that it was 
               <br />
               desirable to bring British Columbia into the Union, that it was 
               <br />
               expedient to prosecute the construction of the Paciﬁc Railway and 
               <br />
               to commence and push it through as soon as the ﬁnancial condition 
               <br />
               of the country would permit it. That was exactly the policy 
               <br />
               announced by the Government. They brought down no cast-iron 
               <br />

               <br />
               within the 10 years they would be guilty of a breach of faith. They 
               <br />
               proposed to do their best to complete it within that period. All the 
               <br />
               opposition which had been offered to this measure now before the

               <br />
               opponents to Confederation had fought against the Union in the 
               <br />
               past. He would not be surprised if the people of British Columbia 
               <br />
               should fail to obtain this union with Canada, if they looked to the 
               <br />
