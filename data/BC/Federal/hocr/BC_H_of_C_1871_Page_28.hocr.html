               Mr. JONES (Halifax) resumed the debate on the Bill to admit 
               <br />
               British Columbia into the Dominion. He moved that the following 
               <br />
               words be inserted aﬁer the word “purpose” in the amendment: 
               <br />
               “The proposed engagements respecting the said Paciﬁc Railway 
               <br />
               would, in the opinion of this House, press too heavily on the 
               <br />
               resources of the Dominion.” He argued that the Government might 
               <br />
               well hesitate to enter into such engagements aﬁer the fears and 
               <br />
               doubts expressed by the hon. member for Sherbrooke and other 
               <br />
               fathers of the Confederation. But, the Government would do well to 
               <br />
               hesitate if they desired to consummate the Union. There were other 
               <br />
               colonies to be added to the Dominion. Newfoundland and Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island had yet to be brought in and it was not likely that 
               <br />
               they could be induced to join the Confederation under less 
               <br />
               advantageous terms than were now offered to the Paciﬁc Colony. 
               <br />
               Hon. members opposite argued that if the Dominion was not 
               <br />
               immediately extended to the Paciﬁc, the Western colony would be 
               <br />
               absorbed into the American Union, but the hon. members were 
               <br />
               adopting the very measures which would promote that movement.

               The strongest argument against annexation had always been that 
               <br />
               our taxes were light, that while the Americans had a debt amounting 
               <br />
               to $60 per head, ours was not quite $27 per head of our population. 
               <br />
               Let these engagements be entered into by the Dominion, which 
               <br />
               were now before the House, and the result would be to leave us 
               <br />
               with a heavier debt in proportion to our resources than at present 
               <br />

               <br />
               between the United States and the Dominion, but the Government 
               <br />
               proposed to reverse the present position of the two countries. While 
               <br />
               the Americans were paying off their debt and reducing their taxes, 
               <br />
               Canada was about to incur liabilities too great for her to bear. He 
               <br />
               referred to the immense charge which the construction of the 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway would bring on the country. He asked the House to 
               <br />
               take a business view of this engagement, and ask themselves should 
               <br />
               the Dominion undertake it. (Hear, hear.) This extravagant proposal 
               <br />
               was the natural sequence of the Finance Minister’s budget speech in 
               <br />
               which that hon. member had spoken of the advantages of a great 
               <br />
               national debt, and quoted from Macaulay in support of this view.

               <br />

               <br />
               member for Halifax, spoke at considerable length against incurring 
               <br />
               the heavy liabilities which the construction of a Paciﬁc railway 
               <br />
               would cause. He denied that there was any danger that British 
               <br />
               Columbia would be annexed to the United States if it were not 
               <br />
               brought into the Confederation. Did hon. members opposite 
               <br />
               suppose that Great Britain would allow the republic to absorb any 
               <br />
               portion of Her Majesty’s possessions without a struggle? If the

               <br />

               from the speech of the hon. member for Brome in the report of the

               Confederation debate to show how some of the advocates of this

               Hon. Mr. MORRIS said it was most surprising, in looking back 
               <br />
               on the past history of Canada, to see what great tasks had been 
               <br />
               accomplished. The government had been taunted time after time 
               <br />
               with not being sincere in the great work of building up a British 
               <br />
               power on the Continent, but they could turn to their record, and 
               <br />
               challenge their opponents on the other side of the House, by what 
               <br />
               they had really done. Was it nothing that the Dominion already 
               <br />
               stretched from the Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains! And now the 
               <br />
               question was whether they should or whether they should not make 
               <br />
               what had once been considered a dream a living reality, by doing 
               <br />
               their utmost to weld the provinces from one ocean to the other into 
               <br />
               one solid Dominion. He was surprised at the course taken by some 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen in the present debate, and especially at that taken by 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Sherbrooke, who had formerly taken the 
               <br />
               deepest interest in the question, and had spoken most earnestly in 
               <br />
               favour of the union now proposed', and he was more than surprised 
               <br />
               at the course of the hon. member for Larnbton, who, though a later 
               <br />
               convert to the beneﬁts of Confederation, had, with his party, stated 
               <br />
               that he should set himself to assist to establish and consummate the
