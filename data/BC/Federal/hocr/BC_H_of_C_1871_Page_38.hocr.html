               Mr. BLAKE said the member for Lambton (Mr. Mackenzie) 
               <br />
               in his amendment had pointed out the importance of the matter 
               <br />
               the grave nature of the burden proposed to be incurred, and 
               <br />
               therefore suggested the postponement of the consideration of 
               <br />
               the matter, and it was impossible to answer those statements. 
               <br />
               Much had been heard that the railway would not cost the 
               <br />
               Dominion in cash $100,000,000, but no one attempted to deny 
               <br />
               that the railway would cost that amount and where could the 
               <br />
               money come from but from the resources of the country. It 
               <br />
               might be in lands and it might be in money, but the result was 
               <br />
               the same, and the only argument the Minister of Militia had 
               <br />
               used was to speak of the American lines and contrast 
               <br />
               greenbacks with gold. He complained of the system of alternate 
               <br />
               sections not being followed in land grants. The argument 
               <br />
               seemed to be that they would not be compelled to perform 
               <br />
               impossibilities, but an honest man would fulﬁl an obligation, 
               <br />
               though the result might be bankruptcy. 1f rashly the national 
               <br />
               credit and faith were pledged to build that road in ten years, he 
               <br />
               said that any one who voted for that obligation with the mental 
               <br />
               reservation that they would not be compelled to fulﬁl the 
               <br />
               obligation unless such should be desirable was a base man. The 
               <br />
               spirit and the letter of the bond were alike binding, and the 
               <br />
               question was most serious.

               The Bill was not one that could be repealed but was an 
               <br />
               irrevocable determination to build the road in ten years 
               <br />
               whatever the hazard, whatever the results, and should they not 
               <br />
               seek to communicate with their people before arriving at this 
               <br />
               irrevocable determination. It had been urged in order to secure 
               <br />
               votes that there was a reserve power of repudiation, but if the 
               <br />
               obligation was undertaken, the people would hold themselves 
               <br />
               bound by it, and could gentlemen be prepared to meet an 
               <br />
               indignant people if they incurred this responsibility without 
               <br />
               consulting those they represented, and if the gentlemen did so 
               <br />
               act, though they might go back to their people, they would not 
               <br />
               come back to that House. The question was whether the debt of 
               <br />
               the country should, at a stroke, be doubled, or whether they 
               <br />
               should have an opportunity of consulting their people before 
               <br />
               taking such a step. They had been urged to haste, but he 
               <br />
               maintained that there had been too much haste in bringing 
               <br />
               about Confederation already, and he was not anxious to ruin 
               <br />
               entirely that portion of the scheme which had been too hastily 
               <br />
               consummated. He had not heard what harm could result from 
               <br />
               postponement and as to the argument that British Columbia was 
               <br />
               hanging in the balance, he would say that while England was 
               <br />
               true to herself, the result did not lie with British Columbia, and 
               <br />
               therefore time for consideration should not be refused.

               Hon. Mr. TILLEY said it was a great advantage to be able to

               difference in the proposition of the Government and the 
               <br />

               ask for this delay now, but the scheme had been before the 
               <br />
               people and had been discussed in the papers for months. The 
               <br />
               terms were published in Toronto papers three months ago, and, 
               <br />
               in fact, the Union had been talked of ever since the 
               <br />
               commencement of the Confederation. In reply to the arguments 
               <br />
               of the hon. members opposite, he said that a grant of $10,000 
               <br />
               per mile in addition to the land grant would place the 
               <br />
               construction of the railway beyond the possibility of a doubt. 
               <br />
               There could be no difﬁculty in disposing of the lands at a fair 
               <br />
               price. The fertile belt was spoken of by the American writers 
               <br />
               who had visited it, as being of immense extent and of great 
               <br />
               fertility. The Northern Paciﬁc railway looked to it for a portion 
               <br />
               of their future trade. It was, therefore, in the interest of this 
               <br />
               Dominion to construct a road through our own territory to the 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc.

               Hon. Mr. McDOUGALL (Lanark North) said the House 
               <br />
               should not be led away by claptrap speeches from the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman opposite. Let them look at the facts. Here was a 
               <br />
               statement of Mr. Hind, an ofﬁcer appointed by this Government, 
               <br />
               who explored the North West, and submitted his report thereon. 
               <br />
               This gentleman stated that in the whole of the fertile belt there 
               <br />
               were not 40,000,000 acres of available land. Taking a fertile belt 
               <br />
               in the Rocky Mountains which was not mentioned in that report, 
               <br />
               to contain 10,000,000 acres more, there were but 50,000,000 
               <br />
               acres of any commercial or exchangeable value, in the North 
               <br />
               West. Where then were the Government lands to come from 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">after</span> granting large sections to the railway? The experience of 
               <br />
               the United States had shown that it was not in the interest of a 
               <br />
               country to grant its unsettled lands in large blocks to private 
               <br />
               companies. The proposition before the House was to give all the 
               <br />
               valuable lands of the North West to a company which was not 
               <br />
               yet formed. After the experience of English capitalists on 
               <br />
               Canadian railways, it was not likely that capital could be got to 
               <br />
               construct this railway. The money must be had in some way 
               <br />
               even at the risk of involving the Dominion in ruin. In reply to 
               <br />
               the statement of the Hon. Minister of Customs that this question 
               <br />
               had been before the public for some time, he would refer the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman to the ﬁles of papers in the reading room. If he 
               <br />
               would look at them he would see that the country was startled at 
               <br />
               the gigantic proportions of this scheme. On the 27th of that 
               <br />
               month, the ipsissima verba of the scheme were presented to this 
               <br />
               House, and that was the ﬁrst time the public had an opportunity 
               <br />
               of passing judgment on it. It was only after it was taken up and 
               <br />
               discussed in this House the other day, that it might be said to 
               <br />
               have been placed before the people. Could the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               then deny that delay should be granted before passing this 
               <br />
               measure. It had not been presented to the House in the 
               <br />
               constitutional manner and it was only right to give the people an 
               <br />
               opportunity to express their approval or disapproval of it.
