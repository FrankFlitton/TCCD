               impossible to take large Provinces into the Dominion with a small

               expected that the people of this large Province, twice the size of 
               <br />
               Ontario, would be in a position to develop the resources of their

               <br />
               Government proposed to render in the proposition before the 
               <br />
               House? The member for Sherbrooke had said that he would have 
               <br />
               preferred that the Government should have come down and have 
               <br />
               asked a direct vote for that purpose, but he would remind the hon.

               member that he had not been in favour of that mode, when it was 
               <br />
               proposed with reference to Newfoundland. The delegates from 
               <br />
               British Columbia estimated the population of their country, at 
               <br />
               13,000 whites, 5,000 Chinese, and 45,000 Indians.

               Then what was there to be got out of this country. At the 
               <br />
               present time it cost from 12¢ to 14¢ a pound for all supplies sent 
               <br />
               into that country, and no one could live there unless he earned $5 
               <br />
               a day. If, however, the country were opened up, they would be 
               <br />
               able to get supplies there as cheap as at Ottawa, and those who 
               <br />
               now live on $5 a day would be able to live on $2.50 a day, and 
               <br />
               there would very soon be a population which would yield a 
               <br />
               revenue that would speedily compensate for the cost of the 
               <br />
               railway. According to his judgment, seeing they had the North 
               <br />
               West, and must develop it, there was no question but that the 
               <br />

               <br />
               although he did not assume to have anything like the knowledge 
               <br />
               or experience of ﬁnancial matters as was possessed by the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Sherbrooke, he could not see that there would be any 
               <br />
               difﬁculty. The line of railway would pass through magniﬁcent 
               <br />
               lands, and the proposed grant would give 50 million acres, leaving 
               <br />
               every alternate lot which could be converted into a sinking fund 
               <br />
               or some other mode for securing the amount of money granted, 
               <br />
               and taking into consideration the probable increase of population, 
               <br />
               the speedy settlement of the North West on its being opened up, 
               <br />
               and the increased paying ability, he had no fear, and the 
               <br />
               Government had no fear, that the people would be subjected to 
               <br />
               any increase of taxation.

               Hon. Mr. TILLEY resumed the debate. He had been pointing 
               <br />
               out the difference between the proposition of British Columbia, and 
               <br />
               that adopted ultimately, which he regarded as the more favourable 
               <br />
               to the Dominion. In connection with the railway scheme he would 
               <br />
               take issue with his hon. friend from Sherbrooke. By the 
               <br />
               construction of the road the population of the Paciﬁc coast would 
               <br />
               soon be so increased as to pay for the cost of the road in a very 
               <br />
               short time. A gentleman who had worked in the mines of 
               <br />
               California, lecturing on this subject a few years ago, argued that 
               <br />
               such a result would soon be attained by building the railway. The 
               <br />
               hon. member for Sherbrooke was willing to give a subsidy to 
               <br />
               British Columbia without admitting it as a Province for some time 
               <br />
               to come. In making this admission, the hon. member gave up the 
               <br />
               whole case, for, if he could not object to giving a subsidy under 
               <br />
               such circumstances and without deriving every advantage from the 
               <br />
               expenditure, he surely ought not to object when British Columbia 
               <br />
               was ready to surrender her revenues to the Dominion. The increase 
               <br />
               of the debt would not fall on the present population of the 
               <br />
               Dominion alone. The evidence which the increase of the Western 
               <br />
               States since the construction of railways through them, was that the 
               <br />
               North West would soon be ﬁlled up with a population brought there 
               <br />
               by the new railway which would soon pay for its construction. With 
               <br />
               reference to the question of fortiﬁcations, he would say that he 
               <br />
               hoped the result of the present negotiations at Washington would be 
               <br />
               such as to prevent all necessity for the constructing such works. The 
               <br />
               expense for local works would hardly amount to as much as the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Sherbrooke estimated they would. Excluding the 
               <br />
               annual sum of $100,000 for the land grant and the expenses of 
               <br />
               Government, these charges would amount to a total of $361,300. 
               <br />
               The revenue amounted to $363,400, which, of course, would 
               <br />
               largely increase in the future. The difference, therefore, was not so 
               <br />
               great aﬁer all. Even supposing that the local Government should 
               <br />
               accept our lower tariff, the revenue would reach $308,000. The 
               <br />
               $100,000 was, therefore, the amount of expenditure in excess of 
               <br />
               receipts, and for this the Dominion received a large grant of 
               <br />
               valuable land. Now, the question was, was the union of the colony 
               <br />
               worth the cost? The Paciﬁc Railway, already in course of 
               <br />
               construction through the North Western States of the United States, 
               <br />
               was being built without the expenditure of a single dollar. It was 
               <br />
               being built by the land grants which had been made to the company. 
               <br />
               But, the hon. member for Larnbton said there were only 50,000,000 
               <br />
               acres of good land to be settled in the North West. Admitting it to 
               <br />
               be the fact, what difference did it make so long as it was settled. 
               <br />
               That was the main point. Persons who had travelled through the 
               <br />
               Fertile Belt had informed him that there was no engineering 
               <br />
               difﬁculties to be met with this side of the Rocky Mountains, and 
               <br />
               there could be no difﬁculty in getting a company to undertake the 
               <br />
               construction of the railway. Having said this much, the case was 
               <br />
               clear. The question was now, whether it was better to embrace 
               <br />
               the opportunity to complete the Confederation scheme, or to let 
               <br />
               this best chance of all pass by unimproved for consurnmating 
               <br />
               the union. He could understand why Annexationists should be 
               <br />
               opposed to this extension of the Union, but he could not 
               <br />
               understand how the Independence advocates like the hon.
