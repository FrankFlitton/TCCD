               <br />
               Excellency’s Speech from the Throne. Taking up the various 
               <br />
               paragraphs, he spoke brieﬂy on each, as usual, expressing 
               <br />
               concurrence in the different views therein set forth, and 
               <br />
               complimenting the Government on its administrative policy. He 
               <br />
               referred particularly to the Fenian enterprise of last spring, and the 
               <br />
               wise and vigorous efforts put forth for its overthrow. He hoped the 
               <br />
               House would fully sustain the Administration in this matter by 
               <br />

               believed everything would be done to protect Canada’s interests.

               <br />
               judicious and conciliatory action of the Government, and to the 
               <br />
               exertions and bravery of the Volunteers. The Dominion was in a 
               <br />
               prosperous condition, largely owing to the wisdom of Ministers,
