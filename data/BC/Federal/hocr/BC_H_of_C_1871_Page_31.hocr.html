               Hon. Mr. ANGLIN said this was a matter of too great 
               <br />
               importance to be made a party question. He hoped every 
               <br />
               member would look upon it in a purely practical light, and 
               <br />
               oppose it as a utopian measure brought in by the visionaries who 
               <br />
               were hurrying the country to ruin. Looking at the measure on its 
               <br />
               merits there was something objectionable in every one of the 
               <br />
               clauses. He disapproved of the unfair Parliamentary 
               <br />
               representation, giving six members to 13,000 people', to 
               <br />
               pensioning ofﬁcers, and to the payment of $100,000 per annum 
               <br />
               to sustain a corrupt and extravagant Government, given, too, 
               <br />
               under the pretence that it was rent for public lands. Let the 
               <br />
               House know all the meaning of these terms. The Government of 
               <br />
               the Dominion were to undertake the construction and 
               <br />
               completion, under any contingency, of a Paciﬁc railway within 
               <br />
               ten years after the date of the union. Why could not the 
               <br />
               Government come forward honestly and friendly and tell the 
               <br />
               truth, that they knew it would lay a heavy burden on the 
               <br />
               Dominion to carry out this engagement? But no, each member 
               <br />
               of the Government tried to make light of the difﬁculties to be 
               <br />
               encountered in the construction ofthis road.

               The Red River expedition, in their march to Fort Garry, had 
               <br />
               given evidence as to the nature of the country between the head 
               <br />
               of Lake Superior and Red River, and they had proved it to be of 
               <br />
               the most sterile character. It was proved to be, for hundreds of 
               <br />
               miles, a wilderness of rock, swamp and lake, quite 
               <br />
               uninhabitable, and presenting the greatest difﬁculties to the 
               <br />
               construction of a railway. At the Rocky Mountains, fresh 
               <br />
               difﬁculties were to be met, and the British Colonist, a paper 
               <br />
               published at Victoria, V.1., favourable to confederation, spoke 
               <br />
               of the route through which it was proposed to run the railway, as 
               <br />
               a “sea of mountains.” If this account were correct, it would be 
               <br />
               difﬁcult to ﬁnd those vast tracts of fertile country spoken of by 
               <br />
               hon. members opposite, and it could be no easy matter to run a 
               <br />
               railway through it. With this much known, this House should be 
               <br />
               enabled to understand how much of a burden they were 
               <br />
               expected to bear, before they were asked to vote for this 
               <br />
               measure. He spoke of the resources of the United States as very 
               <br />
               superior to those of Canada.

               <br />
               the Government was breaking down all barriers and would 
               <br />
               ultimately tend to annexation. He condemned the proposed 
               <br />
               expenditure as enormous, and pointed out how a proposition to 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               spoke of the present surplus revenue as very exceptional, and 
               <br />

               said that the Minister of Finance himself understood that in the

               <br />
               to this amount for cost of construction there would be the 
               <br />
               working expenses to add to the burden, and the result would be 
               <br />
               as described the previous night by the member for Wentworth. 
               <br />
               Where was the amount to be obtained? It could not be obtained, 
               <br />
               and the obligation was only to be incurred because some few 
               <br />
               thousands of people on the Paciﬁc coast were discontented and 
               <br />
               would otherwise seek annexation to the United States. The 
               <br />
               Statement that the cost incurred would only amount to a million 
               <br />

               <br />
               House. They would pledge themselves to construct the line in 
               <br />
               ten years, and who could say that the country would not have to 
               <br />
               pay every dollar. A company had been spoken of, but where was 
               <br />
               the company? How could any company raise seventy-ﬁve 
               <br />
               millions of dollars on ﬁﬁy million acres of barren waste land, 
               <br />
               and the Government only played with the House and imposed on 
               <br />
               the credulity of their supporters in saying the work would be 
               <br />
               done by a railway.

               The question should be viewed calmly and dispassionately 
               <br />
               and not as a party question, as the Minister of Militia had tried 
               <br />
               to make it. The Minister of Customs had imagined a teeming 
               <br />
               and prosperous population in British Columbia and the North 
               <br />
               West, but were they to base their vote on baseless imaginings. 
               <br />
               Where was this population to come from when it was well 
               <br />
               known that the population of British Columbia had materially 
               <br />
               decreased of late years! It could only be explained by the fact 
               <br />
               that the country was not inviting to settlers. It was hard to 
               <br />
               persuade settlers to come even to Ontario and the other parts of 
               <br />
               the Dominion, and how could it be supposed that a larger 
               <br />
               immigration could be directed to these new colonies. The House 
               <br />
               had been told that it was bound to construct the railway to the 
               <br />
               Rocky Mountains, but he would like to know how, when and

               nothing of the kind unless the ﬁnances of the country fully 
               <br />
               justiﬁed it. It had also been stated that although they incurred 
               <br />
               the obligation, they would not be compelled to carry it out 
               <br />

               <br />

               was doubled the expenditure would not be met, but when the 
               <br />
               debt and taxation was then increased, the way to annexation 
               <br />
