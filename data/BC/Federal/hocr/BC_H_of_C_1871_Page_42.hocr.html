               assembled, the obligations of the country had been largely 
               <br />
               increased, and now all at once the whole debt of the country was to 
               <br />
               be doubled. Surely this was a serious matter, and even the Hon. 
               <br />
               Minister of Militia had termed it a “big job” though he had 
               <br />
               afterwards tried to make it a very little job. It was useless to say that 
               <br />
               the country would not be expected to accomplish impossibilities, 
               <br />
               and that no burden would be added to the people, for when they had 
               <br />
               entered into a compact, they must carry out their promise, and when 
               <br />
               they went to England to raise money they would ﬁnd this obligation 
               <br />
               considered a charge on the credit of the country. Notwithstanding 
               <br />
               the glowing terms in which the grandeur of Confederation had been 
               <br />
               depicted, the fact still remained that the debt had ﬁrst been 
               <br />
               increased ﬁfty per cent and now it was sought to be doubled.

               He maintained, however, that the measure of Confederation had 
               <br />
               been carried, not by the Government but in consequence of the 
               <br />
               loyal respect of the people for the policy of the Imperial 
               <br />
               Government which was known to favor the scheme, and now the 
               <br />
               Government was breaking away if not from Imperial policy at least 
               <br />
               from Imperial aid, in proposing to carry out the work of 
               <br />
               communication alone and unassisted. If it had been the duty and the 
               <br />
               policy of the Imperial Government to aid the construction of the 
               <br />
               Intercolonial Railway it was a hundred fold their duty and policy to 
               <br />
               aid the construction of the Paciﬁc, and he would ask the 
               <br />
               Government for what reasons they had absolved the Imperial 
               <br />
               Government from all duties in the work of consolidating British 
               <br />
               power on this continent. He referred to rumours which he said had 
               <br />
               been greatly inﬂuenced by the presence of Capitalists and 
               <br />
               Contractors who were opposed to the Northern Paciﬁc Railway, and 
               <br />
               who thought that if the Canadian Government would decide 
               <br />
               deﬁnitely to construct the Canadian line, it would operate strongly 
               <br />
               against the Northern Paciﬁc, and said he could not but think that 
               <br />
               those rumours had gained weight by the utterance of the President 
               <br />
               of the Council that if the Canadian line was constructed the 
               <br />
               Northern Paciﬁc would never get beyond Red River. That hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman had also urged as a reason for hurry in this matter, that if 
               <br />
               they did not hasten to accept the terms proposed, British Columbia 
               <br />
               might exact conditions still more difﬁcult, but such an argument 
               <br />
               was absurd.

               British Columbia was a Crown colony, and if it were really, the 
               <br />
               policy of the Imperial Government, to consolidate British power on 
               <br />
               this continent, though every man in that colony might be in favor of 
               <br />
               annexation, their power to bring about such a result would be as 
               <br />
               light as a feather, it would be as nothing. If ever the British 
               <br />
               possessions on this Continent should become part of the United 
               <br />

               <br />
               this continent. The same reason for hurry had been urged in the 
               <br />
               discussion on Confederation, and he very much deprecated it as 
               <br />

               <br />
               the address was understood to be adopted. The Government had 
               <br />

               through the intervention of companies to whom they would be
