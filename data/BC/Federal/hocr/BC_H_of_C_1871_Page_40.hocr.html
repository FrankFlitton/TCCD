               Hon. Mr. TUPPER said he had not taken any part in the debates 
               <br />
               on this subject so far. He had listened with mingled pain and 
               <br />
               pleasure to the speeches of hon. members. He had heard with pain 
               <br />
               old ﬁiends of Confederation opposing this union movement. He 
               <br />
               defended the policy of the Government at considerable length, 
               <br />
               arguing that everything conspired to favor the construction of the 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway. While the United States had to contend against 
               <br />
               great natural difﬁculties in pushing their railways to the Paciﬁc, the 
               <br />
               territory through which the Canadian route would lie, was of great 
               <br />
               natural fertility, and presented comparatively few engineering 
               <br />
               difﬁculties to the construction of a railway. It gave us a pass 
               <br />
               through the Rocky Mountains 2,000 feet lower than the best pass 
               <br />
               through that chain on American territory. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               Lambton had endeavored to show that the route from Nipissing to 
               <br />
               Fort Garry was an almost impassable wilderness. Only last session 
               <br />
               the hon. member had taken a very different view of the question 
               <br />
               and had stated that the very best route to the west lay through 
               <br />
               Canadian territory North of Lakes Huron and Superior. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman could not say that he had heard anything to present the 
               <br />
               matter in a different light. There were then, all these favourable 
               <br />
               circumstances to aid this great enterprise, but in addition to all that, 
               <br />
               the route once opened would place Canton and Liverpool 1,000 
               <br />
               miles nearer than by any other line of communication that could be 
               <br />
               found. The hon. member had pleaded for delay in order to submit 
               <br />
               this question to the people, but the hon. gentleman had taken the 
               <br />
               ground on a former occasion that Parliament, representing the 
               <br />
               people, could act for them in a case like this.
