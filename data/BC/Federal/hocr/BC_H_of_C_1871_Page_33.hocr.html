               spread-eagle anticipations and ﬂourishes indulged in respecting this 
               <br />
               railway, and particularly the notion that the trade of China and 
               <br />
               Japan could be attracted over North America by this trans- 
               <br />
               continental road. Any merchant or intelligent man knew that the 
               <br />
               products of the East would be damaged by railway carriage, and 
               <br />
               that the shipping presented the best means of transportation. It was 
               <br />
               all nonsense to attribute to Confederation the credit for the present 
               <br />
               prosperity of the country. As to the expectations connected with the 
               <br />
               Intercolonial, he believed from reliable information that it would be 
               <br />
               a source of expense, trouble and anxiety to us. But at any rate let us 
               <br />
               see how it worked before entering upon another and longer railway. 
               <br />
               It was bad enough to have one elephant on our shoulders without a 
               <br />
               second. In the name of his constituents and of the trade and 
               <br />
               commerce of the country he protested against this scheme, which 
               <br />
               made him tremble for it', and it was because he thought it would be 
               <br />
               ruinous to the Dominion that he would vote against these 
               <br />

               Hon. Mr. McDOUGALL (Lanark North) said that although 
               <br />
               the debate had extended over three days there were two or three 
               <br />
               points to which no reference had yet been made, to which he felt it 
               <br />
               his duty to draw attention. He believed that a very large majority of 
               <br />
               the members of this House were desirous of seeing British 
               <br />
               Columbia united to the Dominion. Some twenty years ago, when he 
               <br />
               ﬁrst entered into public life as a journalist, he had placed on his 
               <br />
               political platform as one of its most prominent planks Union of the 
               <br />
               British North American Provinces. In 1859 he was present at the 
               <br />
               Reform Convention in Toronto when the political condition of the 
               <br />
               country was discussed, and on that occasion he moved a resolution 
               <br />
               which embodied the principle on which this great scheme was 
               <br />
               founded. It received the assent of a majority of that assembly, and 
               <br />
               ever since then he had been endeavouring to the best of his ability 
               <br />
               to promote and advance this great measure.

               Along with hon. members opposite, it had been his good fortune 
               <br />
               to help push forward Confederation, and he now accused them of 
               <br />
               having failed in the performance of their duty in the ﬁnal 
               <br />
               accomplishment of the work. He said so boldly, looking at it from 
               <br />
               no political or party standpoint, and feeling no desire, as might be 
               <br />
               the case with some hon. members of the Opposition, to see the 
               <br />
               Government displaced from their seats at the present moment if 
               <br />
               they would only do their duty. Taking an impartial view of the case, 
               <br />
               he must charge them with having struck a fatal blow at the great 
               <br />
               measure with which for the last few years they had been connected, 
               <br />
               and for the success of which they were pledged to this House and 
               <br />
               responsible to the country. They propose, in order to induce, as they 
               <br />
               alleged, British Columbia to enter the Union, to load the Dominion 
               <br />
               with a debt double that under which the country now suffered, 
               <br />
               under which, at all events, it now labored. For the purpose of 
               <br />
               accomplishing this Union, no such sacriﬁce, no such burden, no 
               <br />
               such evil consequences were at all necessary. He failed to hear any 
               <br />
               decent reason why this Government should, without the authority of

               <br />

               this question asked, but he would tell the hon. member that this was 
               <br />
               an entirely different case. The Quebec conference was a body of 
               <br />
               gentlemen assembled together to discuss the propriety of passing 
               <br />
               the law which regulated this very matter. The terms of that law 
               <br />
               were publicly discussed in the press and in the various existing 
               <br />
               legislative bodies of the several Provinces. It was agreed by them 
               <br />
               and alterations were made in accordance with expressions of 
               <br />
               opinion at the very last moment in England to meet the difﬁculties 
               <br />
               developed by these discussions. These circumstances were 
               <br />
               altogether different from those which surround the present case. In 
               <br />
               the Union Act were the ipsissima verba which show how the Union 
               <br />
               of the other colonies is to be consummated. The Constitutional Act 
               <br />
               points out the parties who are to negotiate. It declares that the 
               <br />
               members of this House are one body, and the members of the other 
               <br />

               <br />
               which had been under debate for the last three days was not subject 
               <br />
               to the ordinary rule. The Government had taken every precaution to 
               <br />
               tell the House that this measure was in the nature of treaty, that not 
               <br />
               one of its details could be altered, and that it must be accepted as it 
               <br />
               was submitted to the House. Now, the meaning of the constitution 
               <br />
               was very different. It was only aﬁer full consideration in this 
               <br />
               Parliament that the measure should be accepted. Of what use was 
               <br />
               this debate at all, if the measure must be adopted without 
               <br />
               amendment? He would remind the House, that British Columbia 
               <br />
               was a Crown colony, with a population principally of miners and 
               <br />
               adventurers, and a very small number of permanent settlers. It was 
               <br />
               so at the time of Confederation, possibly the population was larger 
               <br />
               then. There was no popular representation at that time. This position 
               <br />
               did not fail to strike the attention of the Conference. It was the 
               <br />
               policy of the Imperial Government, and the four Provinces to 
               <br />
               complete the Union and all British America as soon as possible. He 
               <br />
               with others at the Conference had contended that it was the duty of 
               <br />
               the Imperial Government to bring pressure to bear on its own 
               <br />
               ofﬁcers of British Columbia to submit to reasonable terms in order 
               <br />
               to secure Union with Canada. The small number of the inhabitants 
               <br />
               did not justify the admission of a colony on more favourable terms 
               <br />
               than those offered to the older and more populous Atlantic 
               <br />
               Provinces. The circumstances were entirely different and it was 
               <br />
               absurd to say that the future destiny of that country was in the hands 
               <br />
               of a few adventurers who were mining there. Since Confederation 
               <br />
               was agreed upon, the Imperial Government has put it out to their 
               <br />
               power to use that effective inﬂuence they might have used to secure
