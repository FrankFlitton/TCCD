     Hon. Mr. DORION said the hon. gentleman did not seem to 
     
     propose any amendment of the Act of last session except to allow 
     
     the Banks to come under this general law. One part of the 
     
     resolutions had given rise to some difficulty. What was meant by 
     
     the words “cash reserves?” In Montreal there had been a good deal 
     
     of discussion as to the exact meaning or requirement of the “cash 
     
     reserves” on which was to be based the amount of Dominion notes 
     
     or funds to be kept by the bank. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir FRANCIS HlNCKS said he did not see any difﬁculty 
     
     of the kind mentioned; nor had he heard of any, though he had had 
     
     a great deal of conversation with bankers since the Act of last 
     
     session was passed. The course he proposed was the reference of 
     
     the Bill to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, 
     
     where all those matters could be fully considered. He was sure the 
     
     Bill would come from that Committee in a satisfactory shape. He 
     
     then moved the adoption of the first resolution, which was carried 
     
     as were all the others. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir FRANCIS HlNCKS then introduced a Bill relating to 
     
     Banks and banking.

            <p>
     Hon. Sir GEORGE-E. CARTIER moved that the House go 
     
     into committee on Friday next to consider the resolutions respecting 
     
     the admission of British Columbia. He explained that as this was a 
     
     most important measure it would not be discussed till Friday next. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. DORION suggested that the debate be deferred till a 
     
     week from Friday next. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Sir GEORGE-E. CARTIER said it was not likely that the 
     
     subject would be exhausted in one day. On next Tuesday, Mr. 
     
     Trutch, who was at present in Washington, would be here, and as 
     
     that gentleman wished to go to England as soon as possible, the 
     
     debate would commence on Tuesday. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. DORION said it was a very large measure, and it 
     
     would be well to have the Ontario Opposition and the members of 
     
     the Ontario Cabinet who were absent, in the House while it was 
     
     under discussion. The debate would be protracted rather than 
     
     advanced by the course which the Government proposed. 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. HARRISON said it was pleasant to observe that the hon. 
     
     gentlemen opposite were alive to the fact that several Ontario 
     
     members were absent from the House. Yesterday, when the 
     
     arbitration question was brought up, they seemed to be quite 
     
     oblivious to the fact. (Hear, hear.) 
     
    </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. MILLS thought the House should be put in possession of a 
     
     statement of the imports of British Columbia before the question 
     
     should be brought before the House.

     After some further discussion the motion was carried.

     Hon. Mr. MORRIS moved that the House go into Committee at 
     
     some future day to consider certain resolutions for the establishing 
     
     of a uniform system of weights and measures for all Canada. The 
     
     resolutions also permitted the use of the metric system where two 
     
     parties to a contract were agreeable. -Carried.

     Hon. Sir FRANCIS HINCKS moved the reception ofthe report 
     
     of the Committee of the Whole on certain resolutions afﬁrming the 
     
     expediency of indemnifying the Government for having authorized 
     
     the issue of a special warrant for $200,000, to provide for the 
     
     defence of the Dominion, in repelling the Fenian invasion in the

     now before the Committee. He suggested that the amendments 
     
     should be proposed aﬁer the Committee should rise.
