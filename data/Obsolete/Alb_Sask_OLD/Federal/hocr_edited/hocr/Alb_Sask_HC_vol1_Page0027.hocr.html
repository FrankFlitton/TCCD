               Minister of the Interior has been for the

               past number of weeks, of the educational

               clauses of this Bill until after he had re-

               turned to this city and to this House when 
               <br />
               he obtained a copy of the clause. One 
               <br />
               would have thought that on the general 
               <br />
               theory of responsible government, of a

               wisely. consulting with every unit of the 
               <br />
               cabinet, as, I think it is in duty bound to 
               <br />
               do, in order to secure the united wisdom 
               <br />
               of the whole of the cabinet, that the hon. 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior would have been 
               <br />
               consulted with, not even by telegraph or 
               <br />
               letter does it seem that the hon. Minster of 
               <br />
               the Interior was apprised of the one pro- 
               <br />
               minent clause in the Bill in which it would 
               <br />
               be supposed naturally that he would be very 
               <br />
               much interested. 
               <br />

               The excuse, the reason, is given to-day— 
               <br />
               and we are bound to take the reason in a 
               <br />
               parliamentary sense—that the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man is retiring because he could not ﬁnd it 
               <br />
               consistent with his principles to accede to 
               <br />
               that particular clause in the Autonomy Bill,

               we have seen, it would be easily inferred, I

               think, by any member of this House that 
               <br />
               there is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reasonable</span> doubt as to whether or 
               <br />
               not that was the cause of the resignation, as 
               <br />
               to whether the deliberate actions of the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister and the rest of the Cabinet 
               <br />
               heretofore have not made it quite abundant- 
               <br />
               ly apparent that it was the intention to get 
               <br />
               rid of the hon. gentleman whether he got 
               <br />
               out on this particular clause of the Bill or 
               <br />
               on some other. The Prime Minister has not 
               <br />
               quite satisﬁed the curiosity of the House. 
               <br />
               Outside of the information which was con- 
               <br />
               veyed to us by the bulletin boards there are 
               <br />
               other rumours which are abroad in the cor- 
               <br />
               ridors of this House, abroad on the streets 
               <br />
               of the city and, I dare say, are tingling 
               <br />
               the wires, which stretch from Ottawa to dif- 
               <br />
               ferent parts of this country even now while 
               <br />
               we are speaking. And why? It is stated 
               <br />
               that another important minister, another 
               <br />
               important member of the cabinet of the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman, is deliberating as to whether 
               <br />
               he shall not follow in the tracks—no, I would 
               <br />
               not put it that way—but follow, at least, the 
               <br />
               example of the hon. the Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior who has retired, in also expressing his 
               <br />
               formal and unqualiﬁed dissent from this 
               <br />
               Bill. There might be some reasons which 
               <br />
               would impose on us the idea that there is 
               <br />
               truth in that. I could hardly reconcile to 
               <br />
               my own mind the idea of a Prime Minister 
               <br />
               and a cabinet undertaking to frame and to 
               <br />
               put before the country so important a Bill 
               <br />
               as this, involving no trivial and unimportant 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial burdens, but involving very oner- 
               <br />
               ous and continuous and growing ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               burdens upon this country, I cannot, I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say,</span> 
               <br />
               understand how a Bill of that kind could 
               <br />
               be conceived, put into form and introduced 
               <br />
               into this House in the absence of the, Min-

               some will say he has fought the ﬁght and 
               <br />
               ﬁnished the course—I am not going to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span> 
               <br />
               how good a course it was—and he has en- 
               <br />
               tered into his reward. Probably he has had 
               <br />
               his reward before; possibly, like the late 
               <br />
               Minister of Railways and Canals, there is 
               <br />
               some glorious future awaiting him in some 
               <br />
               of the large official charges of this country. 
               <br />
               Anyway, if he leaves us as Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior, he has not stated that he is going to 
               <br />
               leave us as member and we will still have 
               <br />
               him with us to remonstrate with and to 
               <br />
               counsel and as far as we can abiding in 
               <br />
               good will and friendship. 
               <br />

               Mr. W. F. MACLEAN (South York). Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, partly as a question of privilege I 
               <br />
               desire to refer now to the question before 
               <br />
               the House, and I would ask the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman, who lives in the ramshackle 
               <br />
               house now, and who is the Samson who has 
               <br />
               pushed down the pillars and has the roof 
               <br />
               upon him and his co-ministers in the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment? The other day the right hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman said I was quixotic. Well, there is 
               <br />
               this at least to be said about Don Quixote, 
               <br />
               that he was a country gentleman, a man of 
               <br />
               high honour and that he died with good 
               <br />
               Christian burial. If I must search for a his- 
               <br />
               torical reference to the hon. gentleman after 
               <br />
               what has happened here to-day, I could think 
               <br />
               of no one else than one of these autocratic 
               <br />
               Russian grand dukes of whom we hear at the 
               <br />
               present time. He has confessed here and the 
               <br />
               late Minister of the Interior has confessed 
               <br />
               here that in this House on Monday of this 
               <br />
               week when I asked where was the Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior and the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               said it was for me to have him here, that he
