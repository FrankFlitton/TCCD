               lands and minerals in their territory, and 
               <br />
               without that they will not be satisﬁed. The 
               <br />
               only argument which I have heard present- 
               <br />
               ed in support of the overturning of the 
               <br />
               principles of the union. is that there might 
               <br />
               be a conﬂict between the local and federal 
               <br />
               authorities, and that the federal government 
               <br />
               might not be able to carry on its immi- 
               <br />
               gration policy. That argument was used 
               <br />
               by the hon. member for Brandon (Mr. Sif- 
               <br />
               ton), but he has not always thought that 
               <br />
               way because in the province of Manitoba in 
               <br />
               days gone by he contended for full provin- 
               <br />
               cial rights and he advocated handing over 
               <br />
               the lands to his province ; later <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on</span> he advi- 
               <br />
               cated handing over the school lan Is as well.
