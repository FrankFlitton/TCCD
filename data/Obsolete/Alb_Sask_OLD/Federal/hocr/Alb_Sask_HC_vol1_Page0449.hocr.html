               Speaker, that I do not think my learned 
               <br />
               friend has any too well answered the point 
               <br />
               that we have equal rights in dealing with 
               <br />
               the conditions under the Act as we would 
               <br />
               have in making an Order in Council and 
               <br />
               stipulating how a particular province is to 
               <br />
               come in. I ‘was going to say, Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               that if we wished to ascertain what powers 
               <br />
               the fathers of confederation thought they 
               <br />
               possessed, under the conditions of the con- 
               <br />
               federation, the best time for us to search 
               <br />
               for information on that point would be in 
               <br />
               1870, when the conditions of the compact 
               <br />
               were fresh in their minds. 
               <br />

               We hear a great deal about this section 
               <br />
               93 giving exclusive power to the province. 
               <br />
               Would it not be well to look at this Act 
               <br />
               in the light cast upon it by some of the de- 
               <br />
               cisions of the Privy Council, and those are 
               <br />
               decisions which. we _should not lightly cast 
               <br />
               aside even if they do run contrary to our 
               <br />
               own opinion. A great many contend that 
               <br />
               this section 93 gives the province unlimited 
               <br />
               powers to deal with matters of education. 
               <br />
               It seems to me that our hon. friends who 
               <br />
               read the Act in such a light simply stop at 
               <br />
               the end of the ﬁrst two lines: 
               <br />

               In and for each province the legislature may

               these hon. gentlemen do not read at all. 
               <br />
               There is also a decision of the Privy Council 
               <br />
               right in point upon that section; and it 
               <br />
               seems to me that in order not to be misled

               any longer as to its full force, effect and 
               <br />
               meaning, it would be well to quote that de- 
               <br />
               cision. This is What the Privy Council said 
               <br />
               in dealing exactly with that proviso:

               Before leaving this part of the case it may 
               <br />
               be well to notice the argument urged by the 
               <br />
               respondent that the construction which their 
               <br />
               lordships have put upon the second and third 
               <br />
               subsections of the section of the Manitoba Act 
               <br />
               is inconsistent with the powers conferred upon 
               <br />
               the legislatures of the provinces to exclusively 
               <br />
               make laws in respect to education. The argu— 
               <br />
               ment is fallacious. The power conferred is not 
               <br />
               absolute but limited. It is exercisable only 
               <br />
               subject and according to the following provision. 
               <br />
               The subsections which follow, whatever be 
               <br />
               their true construction deﬁning the conditions 
               <br />
               under which alone provincial legislatures may 
               <br />
               legislate With reference to education and indi— 
               <br />
               cate the limitations imposed on and the excep— 
               <br />
               tions from their power to legislate exclusively, 
               <br />
               their right to legislate is not enjoyed properly 
               <br />
               speaking exclusively, for in the case speciﬁed 
               <br />
               in subsection 3 the parliament of Canada is 
               <br />
               authorized to legislate on the same subject. 
               <br />
               There is. therefore, no such inconsistency as 15 
               <br />
               suggested.

               matter, how these questions were understood 
               <br />
               from the beginning. Some day in February, 
               <br />
               1867, these clauses 9'2 and 93 were under con- 
               <br />
               sideration in the House of Lords. Now,

               whatever feeling there may be in this House 
               <br />
               and country over the question, I think we 
               <br />
               will all admit that the House of Lords 
               <br />
               would approach it with a great deal of calm- 
               <br />
               ness and give it due consideration, and that

               cupy seats in that House would be in the

               slightest degree nervous about explaining

               Lastly, in the 93rd clause which contains the

               This clause has been framed after long and

               anxious controversy in which all parties have

               the clause is to secure to the religious minority
