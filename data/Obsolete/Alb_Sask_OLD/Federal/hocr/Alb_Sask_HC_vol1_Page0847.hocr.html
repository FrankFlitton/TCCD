               how short a period of life of a child, that

               <br />
               That is not a very long time and am I ask— 
               <br />
               ing too much when I say that there is the

               short time they are in the school for ﬁve 
               <br />
               or six days of the week should devote their

               time absolutely to secular education? Is

               that not a fair proposition to put to the

               <br />
               read you a quotation from the words of an

               <br />
               ago he said :

               I presume that Mr. Tarte was correctly 
               <br />
               reported in this. I have said that while 
               <br />
               I respect my Catholic friends I cannot 
               <br />
               sympathize with them when they say that 
               <br />
               they must have religion taught in the 
               <br />
               schools. In the province of Manitoba in 
               <br />
               my own town we have six schools, but we 
               <br />
               have no religion, there is no dogma taught 
               <br />
               in them, we do not even read the bible 
               <br />
               but I believe we have moral teachers. As 
               <br />
               a trustee I think that is one of the things 
               <br />
               we ask. We do not ask Whether a teacher 
               <br />
               is a Catholic or Protestant. The Minister 
               <br />
               of Finance (Mr. Fielding) laid stress on the 
               <br />
               fact of the teachers of Nova Scotia 
               <br />
               being allowed to wear a certain garb. We 
               <br />
               do not ask what kind of garb they wear, 
               <br />
               we do not ask whether they are Catholic 
               <br />
               or Protestant, we simply ask that they pass 
               <br />
               a proper examination, that they shall be Of 
               <br />
               good moral character, and that is all we

               ent school system from the one they have 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">40</span> per cent of the people of this country

               <br />
               that nothing like 40 per cent of the people 
               <br />
               of this country want two systems of schools. 
               <br />
               and I know what I am saying. I know that 
               <br />
               is the case with the Roman Catholics of 
               <br />
               Manitoba. The cities of Wlmiipeg and 
               <br />
               Brandon are the only places in which there 
               <br />
               are two systems of schools—there is not one 
               <br />
               in my constituency. In the large towns 
               <br />
               most of the Catholics go to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">national</span> 
               <br />
               schools. Since I came to Ottawa I have 
               <br />
               made it a point to inquire, I have spoken 
               <br />
               to a great many Catholics, and I have not 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">found</span> one man or one woman to'tell me 
               <br />
               that they did not prefer the national <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schools.</span> 
               <br />
               because they believed that their children 
               <br />
               got a better education to ﬁt them for the 
               <br />
               work of life. Of course, in Quebec the cir-
