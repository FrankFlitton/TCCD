               Mr. ARMSTRONG. If I am not out of 
               <br />
               order, I would ask the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               (Mr. Fitzpatrick) if it is possible to have 
               <br />
               a reprint of- these Bills with the amend- 
               <br />
               ments as proposed by the government so 
               <br />
               arranged that we could readily turn to 
               <br />
               them and deal with them.

               Mr. FITZRA’DRICK. The practice is 
               <br />
               when the Bill is in committee, to prepare 
               <br />
               the amendments and have them read here 
               <br />
               so that they may go on ‘Hansard’ that 
               <br />
               hon. members may have an opportunity 
               <br />
               of reading them; and then have the Bill 
               <br />
               reprinted before the third reading. If it 
               <br />
               would suit the convenience of the commit-

               tee, I should be glad to have a reprint 
               <br />
               made. I think, however, there are only 
               <br />
               three clauses left over. And it might take 
               <br />
               a little time, as just now work cannot be
