               notice that the hon. gentleman (Mr. L. G.

               MaCarthy) said, perhaps without suﬂicient 
               <br />
               thought, that the leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               proposed that the Bill should not have 
               <br />
               a second reading. That is not correct. The

               amendment is the enunciation of a sound 
               <br />
               principle, it will not defeat the Bill, and it

               will be followed up by proposals in com- 
               <br />
               mittee which, if adopted, will make the 
               <br />
               Bill what it should be. In a word, this 
               <br />
               is a question of provincial autonomy in the 
               <br />
               proper sense; it is a question whether we 
               <br />
               will carry out the well recognized prin- 
               <br />
               ciple that the various provinces should- 
               <br />

               <br />
               ity to regulate their own school laws. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman (Mr. L. G. McCarthy) de- 
               <br />
               plored that the leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               had not laid down a policy, and had not 
               <br />
               discussed the question Whether ~separate 
               <br />
               schools were good or bad per se. Since 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition introduced this 
               <br />
               amendment the debate has unfortunately 
               <br />
               drifted'into a channel which justiﬁes, if 
               <br />
               it does not necessitate, a discussion on the 
               <br />
               abstract question of separate schools. But, 
               <br />
               Sir, the statesmanship of the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition and his wisdom in not dealing 
               <br />
               with the abstract question at that time, is 
               <br />
               evident to every man in this House, 
               <br />
               and in the country, who feels the

               responsibility of discussing the issue

               not follow this example. The question as to 
               <br />
               whether separate schools are good or bad 
               <br />
               is a relative question; if in Quebec and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">One</span> 
               <br />
               tario they are good, it is because they are

               guaranteed by the constitution of the

               loyal men to stand by the constitu—

               <br />
               where there is a sparse population, where 
               <br />
               there is a difﬁculty in maintaining any 
               <br />
               schools at all, I have no hesitation in say- 
               <br />
               ing that personally I am opposed to sep-

               <br />
               the ground that the matter should be 
               <br />
               left entirely to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“people</span> of the west. 
               <br />
               There should be no interference from the

               people of Quebec or from the people of

               We are now face to face with the question

               provinces the management of their own 
               <br />

               has told us that the people of the west are

               as capable of managing their own alfairs 
               <br />
               as are any people in the world, and we
