               Now, an argument has been used, that 
               <br />
               the fact of the other provinces of the Do- 
               <br />
               minion being in the enjoyment of their 
               <br />
               public domain is not a parallel case; that 
               <br />
               while the lands of the other provinces were 
               <br />
               owned by those provinces prior to their 
               <br />
               entry into confederation, the lands of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories were purchased—- 
               <br />
               ‘purchased’ being the word used—by the 
               <br />
               Dominion government for the beneﬁt 
               <br />
               of the Dominion at large. Now, Sir, I, as 
               <br />
               a westerner, object to that word ‘ purchased.’ 
               <br />
               These lands were not ‘purchased.’ It is 
               <br />
               true that the sum of £300,000 was paid to 
               <br />
               the Hudson Bay Company, not for these 
               <br />
               lands, but for certain privileges they enjoyed 
               <br />
               and for the relinquishment of what was, at 
               <br />
               best, a doubtful title, on their part. But 
               <br />
               this money was borrowed on the credit of 
               <br />
               the Dominion, and interest is being paid 
               <br />
               upon it to—day just as much by the people 
               <br />
               of the Northwest, man for man, as by the 
               <br />
               residents in eastern Canada. But, if the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories are to be denied the 
               <br />
               beneﬁcial ownership of these lands by 
               <br />
               reason of this argument, how is it that a 
               <br />
               certain portion of this territory has been 
               <br />
               handed over to one province ? How is it that 
               <br />
               150,000 miles of territory in Ungava, a part 
               <br />
               of this ‘purchased’ land, paid for with 
               <br />
               money raised on the credit of the Dominion, 
               <br />
               was handed over, without a cent of compen- 
               <br />
               sation, to the province of Quebec ?

               Some more powerful logic, some better 
               <br />
               reasoning will have to be adduced in order 
               <br />
               to convince the residents of western Canada 
               <br />

               <br />
               in this Bill for compensation for the same. 
               <br />
               If they purchased those lands and paid $300- 
               <br />
               000, why purchase them the second time, 
               <br />

               Now, the Prime Minister appeared to be

               ward against the wishes of the people

               who reside in the territories. But he 
               <br />
               was not so careful of public opinion

               when he denied to them the ownership of 
               <br />
               their lands, nor did he consult their wishes

               <br />
               school system which may in years to come 
               <br />
               prove entirely unsatisfactory to them. He 
               <br />
               does not even allow them the option of say— 
               <br />
               ing how those schools shall be maintained; 
               <br />
               but under the provisions of this Bill he 
               <br />
               decides that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(two</span> systems shall receive 
               <br />
               an equitable share of public money in such

               a manner as not to discriminate between 
               <br />
               them. Now, as a layman, I can see practi- 
               <br />
               cally no difference between the amended 
               <br />

               much different meaning to that which he
