               Mr. J. BUREAU (Three Rivers and St. 
               <br />
               Maurice). Mr. Speaker, I shall not take up 
               <br />
               much of your <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">time.</span> for this question has 
               <br />
               been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pretty.</span> thoroughly threshed out, and 
               <br />
               hon. members have made up their minds 
               <br />
               whether they are to support the amendment 
               <br />
               or the Bill. But, before I enter upon the 
               <br />
               discussion of the Bill itself, there are a few 
               <br />
               statements made by my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Dundas (Mr. Broder) on which I wish to 
               <br />
               take issue with him. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               has given it as a mark of the great tolerance 
               <br />
               of the people of Ontario that French is 
               <br />
               taught in the schools. . Let me tell my hon. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">friend</span> that we do not make English a part 
               <br />
               only of the curriculum in our schools, but we 
               <br />
               teach it in a practical way. And the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman has had in this House some fair 
               <br />
               samples of what common schools can do to 
               <br />
               teach English to the French Canadians of 
               <br />
               Quebec. If the teaching of a language dif— 
               <br />
               ferent from that of the majority is so great 
               <br />
               an evidence of toleration. I think that we in 
               <br />
               Quebec can fairly claim to be considered 
               <br />
               tolerant. The hon. gentleman would not 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hare</span> been regarded by his friends as making 
               <br />
               a speech if he had not tried to discredit the 
               <br />
               school system of Quebec. He had to read 
               <br />
               from the Montreal ‘ Herald ’ an extract 
               <br />
               which, at the very least, was very much ex- 
               <br />
               aggerated. It may be from the mouth of the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) ; it may 
               <br />
               be from the newspaper owned and controlled 
               <br />
               by the Minister of Agriculture (Mr. Fisher). 
               <br />
               But I say that the schools of Quebec are not 
               <br />
               as inefficient as the hon. gentleman would 
               <br />
               have us believe. If you wish to form an 
               <br />
               opinion of our system of schools. judge it as 
               <br />
               you would judge anything else. You judge a 
               <br />
               tree by its fruit ; judge the schools of the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec by the fruits of them that you 
               <br />
               see about you. The hon. gentleman (Mr. 
               <br />
               Broder) said that the French majority votes 
               <br />
               for Laurier, though he did not know their 
               <br />
               wants or recognize their claims in 1896. Let 
               <br />
               me tell my hon. friend that the French ma- 
               <br />
               jority in Quebec listen, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">read‘and</span> think before 
               <br />
               they vote. Let me mention just one case. 
               <br />
               There never was in Quebec a more popular 
               <br />
               man than the late Honoré Mercier. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Yet,</span> 
               <br />
               when the friends of hon. gentlemen opposite 
               <br />
               Were able to bring that great leader even 
               <br />
               under the shadow of suspicion of corruption 
               <br />
               and dishonesty, the French Canadians voted

               <br />

               the friendship and respect I have for my

               am compelled to say that he was the man 
               <br />
               who started this agitation. When I read

               put on record that a circular was issued 
               <br />
               throughout the country by my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from East Grey, that circular being dated 
               <br />
               16th February, 1905. Now, the Bill we are 
               <br />
               now discussing was brought down on the 
               <br />
               21st of February, 1905. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               (Mr. Sproule) has stated in this House that 
               <br />
               he only used his right to petition parliament. 
               <br />
               I would be the last to deny that right to any 
               <br />
               man. But, the question is, did the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman, as a representative of the people 
               <br />
               and as an elector of this country act in such 
               <br />
               a way as to bring peace and harmony, or did 
               <br />
               he not ? He begins this circular to which I 
               <br />
               have referred, ‘Dear Sir and Brother.’ I 
               <br />
               suppose the hon. gentleman felt a sudden 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gush‘of</span> brotherly love for his electors, or he

               thought that to call them brothers might 
               <br />
               create a little more sympathy. Let me read- 
               <br />
               further on in the circular, and I ﬁnd some- 
               <br />
               thing else. Then he says, on the 16th of

               Mr. BUREAU. Well, Sir, we can ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that out by reading the balance of the cir- 
               <br />

               <br />
