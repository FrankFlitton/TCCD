               In 1886 another ordinance was passed.

               having simply a dual system of schools, Ca-

               sectarian, that were to be under the control 
               <br />

               composed of Protestants and Catholics 
               <br />
               alike. Then they had a system of 
               <br />
               public schools to be called Catholic 
               <br />
               public schools where the Catholics were

               schools, where the Protestants were in the

               I come now to the question touched by 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister this afternoon with re- 
               <br />
               spect to districts. Under the ordinance of 
               <br />
               1885 you could organize a Catholic public 
               <br />
               school district or a Protestant public school 
               <br />
               district and the minority could secede there- 
               <br />
               from and organize a separate school—the 
               <br />
               Protestants in a Catholic section or the 
               <br />
               Catholics in a Protestant section. Under the 
               <br />
               ordinance of 1886 they restricted the rights 
               <br />
               of the minority to this extent that the mi- 
               <br />
               nority could only organize a separate school 
               <br />
               when the majority had organized a public 
               <br />
               school. This was reproduced in the legis- 
               <br />
               lation of 1888, and was pointed out by Sir 
               <br />
               John Thompson as an invasion of the rights 
               <br />
               of the minority because it prevented the mi- 
               <br />
               nority from organizing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«before</span> the majority 
               <br />
               had organized. The right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               pointed that out this afternoon as the essen- 
               <br />
               tial feature in existence then but he will al- 
               <br />
               low me again to tell him he has left aside an ‘ 
               <br />
               important fact. Theoretically Sir John 
               <br />
               Thompson was right but in practice this did 
               <br />
               not work much to the disadvantage of the 
               <br />
               minority because it was not probable that a 
               <br />
               local minority would be ready to have a 
               <br />
               school before the majority had established 
               <br />
               its schools. But under the legislation of 
               <br />
               1886 as wellas under the ordinances of 1888, 
               <br />
               1892 and 1896, the right of the majority to or- 
               <br />
               ganize a Catholic public school district still 
               <br />
               existed. and it was continued till the 
               <br />
               adoption of the ordinances _of 1901. It 
               <br />
               is only in the ordinances which we 
               <br />
               are now asked to adopt as a basis 
               <br />
               for the future rights of the minority, that 
               <br />
               the right to establish Catholic public schools 
               <br />
               where the Catholics are in the majority is 
               <br />
               taken from them; and therefore it is only 
               <br />
               in the last four years that they have been 
               <br />
               deprived of this right. I ﬁnd the evidence 
               <br />
               of that in what was quoted in this House 
               <br />
               the other day by the Minister of Inland
