               <br />
               sideration of parliament to-day? There are 
               <br />
               two. One relates to the establishment of 
               <br />
               new provinces in the west. The other is 
               <br />
               the question 0f whether the boundaries of 
               <br />
               Manitoba shall be extended, These are 
               <br />
               two important questions which the state is 
               <br />
               dealing with to-day. We are erecting two 
               <br />
               new provinces and giving them provincial 
               <br />
               rights and provincial powers. Then, appli- 
               <br />
               cation is being made on behalf of the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Manitoba for the extension of its 
               <br />
               boundaries, so that it may be of a size pro- 
               <br />
               portionate to the other provinces around it. 
               <br />
               It is much smaller to-day. Let me deal 
               <br />
               ﬁrst with the question of erecting these new 
               <br />
               provinces. One of the duties of the state 
               <br />
               is to assign certain rights to these provinces, 
               <br />
               among them the right to legislate with re- 
               <br />
               gard to education. The state is exercising 
               <br />
               its undoubted right to pass this legislation 
               <br />
               in this House. It is claimed, and not de- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">niedvno</span> hon. gentleman in this House has 
               <br />
               dared to deny it up to the present—that the 
               <br />
               proposal in the Bill was submitted to the 
               <br />
               Papal ablegate; that several conferences 
               <br />
               over it took place between him and the pre-' 
               <br />
               mier, if not between him and the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice and the Secretary of State as 
               <br />
               well ; and that it was made satisfactory to 
               <br />
               His Eminence before it was submitted to 
               <br />
               parliament or the country. Is that inter- 
               <br />
               ference by the church with the state ? Cer- 
               <br />
               tainly it is. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               It is as plain as anything can be, and it 
               <br />
               has not been denied. Attention has been 
               <br />
               drawn to it several <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«times,</span> but neither the

               have dared to get up in this House and deny 
               <br />
               it. Therefore we assume that it is an ad— 
               <br />
               mitted fact because there is no denial, and 
               <br />
               it‘ there was any ground for denial there is 
               <br />
               no doubt the denial would be given. It is 
               <br />
               afterwards asserted and not denied, either, 
               <br />
               that the minister in the cabinet represent- 
               <br />
               ing Manitoba and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northwest</span> objected 
               <br />
               to a certain provision in the Bill—the clauses 
               <br />
               relating to education—and he struck, he 
               <br />
               left the cabinet, and carried his followers 
               <br />
               from the west with him. It was shown that 
               <br />
               there was trouble ahead, and there was a 
               <br />
               proposal to amend one or two clauses in that 
               <br />
               Bill. Several conferences took place with 
               <br />
               the western members on the one side and 
               <br />
               the premier, and with whom on the 
               <br />
               other ? With the Papal ab'legate, to 
               <br />
               see if they could make some arrange- 
               <br />
               ment that would suit the Papal able- 
               <br />
               gate, and at the same time suit the member 
               <br />
               for Brandon and his followers in the west. 
               <br />
               Several times we were told that they had 
               <br />
               reached a conclusion satisfactory to both 
               <br />
               parties, but the next day the negotiations 
               <br />
               were off again. So we were kept in sus- 
               <br />
               pense day after day for nearly two weeks, 
               <br />

               conclusion was not announced to the House 
               <br />
               until after it was ﬁnally submitted to the 
               <br />
               Papal ablegatc and was found to be satis- 
               <br />
               factory to him. Therefore, I again ask the 
               <br />
               question: Is the church through its repre- 
               <br />
               sentative interfering with the state, is it or 
               <br />
               is it not ? Is the church interfering with 
               <br />
               the duties of the state, with the policy 
               <br />
               of the state, with the functions of the state ? 
               <br />
               I say it is, and this is the question that is 
               <br />
               interesting the Canadian people to-day, and 
               <br />
               this is the question which will be fought out 
               <br />
               in the future. The Prime Minister says: 
               <br />
               We are prepared to accept the challenge 
               <br />
               and we will ﬁght it out. I tell him that it 
               <br />
               will be fought out. Well, when the Bill 
               <br />
               was ﬁrst presented, some of the western 
               <br />
               members objected to some of the provisions, 
               <br />
               but when amendments were made that

               till then. Now, who is responsible more 
               <br />
               than anybody else for these educational 
               <br />
               clauses? The Papal ablegate. I do not 
               <br />
               blame him, not at all; he is trying to do 
               <br />
               what he believes to be a good work. But 
               <br />
               the government of this country have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">axbne-</span> 
               <br />
               gated their functions, and have given them 
               <br />
               over to the church, they have given them 
               <br />
               over to the representative of the church, and 
               <br />
               they have got him to do what they could 
               <br />
               not. do themselves. They saw that the Papal 
               <br />
               delegate possessed the element of states- 
               <br />
               manship and desired to avail themselves of 
               <br />
               his diplomatic powers and his great foresight 
               <br />
               and statesmanship to help them out of what 
               <br />
               would otherwise have been a very diﬂjcult 
               <br />
               position, and he has succeeded in helping 
               <br />
               them out of it so far. But these were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mat:</span> 
               <br />
               ters of state policy about which the church 
               <br />
               should have no concern, and over which it 
               <br />
               should have no control. The church had no 
               <br />
               right to be consulted with regard to it. 
               <br />
               Now then we come to the question of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extension</span> of Manitoba’s boundaries. A con-

               ference was held with the government, they

               hear representatives, and say that an answer 
               <br />
               will be given in a few days. The First

               Minister, in dealing yesterday with the state-

               <br />
               up of its parts. First he denies it in its 
               <br />
               parts, and then he denies it in toto. Well, 
               <br />
               after all this is done does the denial hold 
               <br />
               good ? He admits a conference took place 
               <br />
               afterwards, therefore that part of the cate-
