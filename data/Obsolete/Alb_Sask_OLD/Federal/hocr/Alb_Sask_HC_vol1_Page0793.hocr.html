               spectfully asking me to specify the advantages

               <br />
               most of our constiuencies far better off than

               <br />
               one set of schools. . . . . . The Pro- 
               <br />
               testant population of Quebec is 219,639 out of 
               <br />
               1,648.898. One third of these are in the city of

               <br />

               <br />

               panies in the city of Montreal is in the 
               <br />
               hands of Protestants and consequently a

               certain share of Protestant money passes 
               <br />
               over to be spent on the education of R0- 
               <br />
               man Catholic children. A statement was 
               <br />
               recently prepared which set forth the fact 
               <br />
               that in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the:</span> city of Montreal $112,000 an- 
               <br />
               nually paid by joint stock companies for 
               <br />
               educational purposes, went into the neutral 
               <br />
               panel. Out of this the Protestants got 
               <br />
               $27,162 and the Catholics <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$84,838,</span> the money 
               <br />
               being divided, according to school attend- 
               <br />
               ance, among the various schools. I do not

               propose to express an opinion for or against
