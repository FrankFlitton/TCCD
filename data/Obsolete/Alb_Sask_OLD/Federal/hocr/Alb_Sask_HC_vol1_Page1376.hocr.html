               The hon. member for Saskatchewan (Mr. 
               <br />
               Lamont) spoke as if he knew all about it

               and was perfectly satisﬁed with it. He 
               <br />
               says, that it means public schools. And 
               <br />
               he says that every man in his county 
               <br />

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">S'PROULE.</span> That is when he went 
               <br />
               out of the cabinet as a protest against the 
               <br />
               Bill and that is why the association in 
               <br />
               Regina passed a strong resolution commend— 
               <br />
               ing him for what he had done, but many of 
               <br />
               them have written him since saying that 
               <br />
               they regret to ﬁnd that the cat came back, 
               <br />
               and now they cannot pass those eulogiums 
               <br />
               on him which they did before. When the 
               <br />
               hon. member says that the people are satis- 
               <br />
               ﬁed he is saying what I have information 
               <br />
               that convinces me he either does not know 
               <br />
               the sentiment of the people or he is misre- 
               <br />
               presenting it, one or the other. It is the 
               <br />
               very reverse of what he says. There is 
               <br />
               not a constituency in that country that has 
               <br />
               not expressed an Opinion strongly against 
               <br />
               this by resolutions, petitions or otherwise, 
               <br />
               and in the face of that the contention is 
               <br />
               made that every one is satisﬁed. Why ? Be—
