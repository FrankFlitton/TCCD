               Mr. BOURASSA. I am not going to enter 
               <br />
               into a discussion of these small points. I 
               <br />
               have made the point that, so far as the 
               <br />
               Northwest is concerned, this parliament was 
               <br />
               the only body that could legislate for it up 
               <br />
               to the present time. And this body estab— 
               <br />
               lished, in the very words of the legislators 
               <br />
               of 1875, for ever, a system based on that in 
               <br />
               Ontario and Quebec. And, by adopting the 
               <br />
               amendment proposed by the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               we are breaking that engagement. That is 
               <br />
               my position, The law of 1875 was not a law 
               <br />
               of narrow scope which would have pre— 
               <br />
               vented the government of the Northwest. 
               <br />
               any more than the original proposition of 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice. if adhered to. would 
               <br />
               have prevented the legislatures ot‘ the new 
               <br />
               provinces, from dealing with educational 
               <br />
               matters just as we may deal with them in 
               <br />
               Ontario and Quebec. I would ask any hon. 
               <br />
               member on either side of the House, why 
               <br />
               should the people of the Northwest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Terri’</span> 
               <br />
               tories be in a different, position from those 
               <br />
               of Ontario and Quebec ? Are we in Ontario 
               <br />
               and Quebec interfered with, is our liberty 
               <br />
               curtailed, because there is in our constitu— 
               <br />
               tion some restriction as to our power of en- 
               <br />
               croaching upon the rights of the minority ? 
               <br />
               And, if it was found best to prevent the 
               <br />
               majority in Ontario and in Quebec from 
               <br />
               dealing improperly with the minority. why 
               <br />
               should not the majority in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories be checked in the same way, 
               <br />
               should they feel inclined to deal less fairly 
               <br />
               With the minority than the minorities in 
               <br />
               Ontario and Quebec are dealt with ?
