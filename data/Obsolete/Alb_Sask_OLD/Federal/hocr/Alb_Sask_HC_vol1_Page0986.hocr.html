               Now, in this connection I may say that 
               <br />
               I believe that is a wise provision. I think 
               <br />
               that in every school all over this vast Do- 
               <br />
               million it would be a wise provision that 
               <br />
               religious instruction should be given. I am 
               <br />
               not one of those who believe in Godless 
               <br />

               <br />
               book of all books, the book that teaches a 
               <br />
               man, not only how to live, but also how to 
               <br />
               die, is almost a sealed book. They may 
               <br />
               read it at home on Sundays, but I am sorry 
               <br />
               to say that in our towns one hour a week 
               <br />
               in Sunday school is all the instruction they 
               <br />
               get; and if you leave out the opening and 
               <br />
               closing exercises of the school, in all there 
               <br />
               is not half an hour a week given to the re- 
               <br />
               ligious teaching of these children. I say 
               <br />
               that it is a lamentable thing that in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span>

               ing fault with that provision, I say it is one
