               This is contained in pages 3185 and 3186 
               <br />
               of ‘Hansard.’ Let me say, Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               that the Minister of Customs throughout his 
               <br />
               speech took for granted and directly as— 
               <br />
               sumed that the Act of 1875 was absolutely 
               <br />
               binding upon the people of the Northwest. 
               <br />
               As has been pointed out that Act might 
               <br />
               during any 'session of this parliament since 
               <br />
               its passage have been repealed. He dwelt 
               <br />
               at great length upon the ordinances butas 
               <br />
               I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,have</span> pointed out—and I think it is undeni— 
               <br />
               able—the ordinances simply are the creature 
               <br />
               of the statute which was a Dominion statute 
               <br />
               and which was not the legislative Act of 
               <br />
               the Territories even as Territories, although 
               <br />
               section 93 would require it to be the Act 
               <br />
               of a province to make it binding on the peo- 
               <br />
               people. of the now proposed provinces. 
               <br />
               He was assuming further that the 
               <br />
               system of separate schools introduced 
               <br />
               by that Act of 1875 was regarded 
               <br />
               by the people of the Northwest as a 
               <br />
               very precious heritage, as something which 
               <br />
               they would by no means allow themselves 
               <br />
               to -be deprived of, as something which they 
               <br />
               regarded as of extreme value. Might

               refer that hon. minister and the House to 
               <br />

               present member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) in

               Minister of Customs was ascribing the 
               <br />
               utmost anxiety to retain separate schools, 
               <br />
               these very people at the very time of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               that time, have fought against the principle 
               <br />
               and have, as the hon. member for Brandon 
               <br />
               (Mr. Sifton) has pointed out, reduced the
