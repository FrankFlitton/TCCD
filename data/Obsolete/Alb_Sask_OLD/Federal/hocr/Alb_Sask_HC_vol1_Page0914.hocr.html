               (Mr. Turriﬁ) and the hon. member for Sas— 
               <br />
               katchewan (Mr. Lamont), and I wish to 
               <br />
               emphasize what has already been said on 
               <br />
               this subject. Certainly if there is any ad- 
               <br />
               vantage in having a seaport on Hudson bay, 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan is the province which has the 
               <br />
               greatest interest in this port, as it will be 
               <br />
               the natural highway for the export of her 
               <br />
               grain and cattle, and I do not think that 
               <br />
               there can be any doubt but that in the near 
               <br />
               future the province of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Saskatchewan</span> will 
               <br />
               be the greatest exporting province for grain 
               <br />
               in all Canada ; and if the Hudson bay route 
               <br />
               ever becomes an actual route for export 
               <br />
               trade, the province of Saskatchewan will be 
               <br />
               the one most interested in its success and 
               <br />
               in the development of the port on the 
               <br />
               Churchill. Therefore, I say that the claim 
               <br />
               of Saskatchewan for a port on the Hudson 
               <br />
               bay should be well and fairly considered, 
               <br />
               and while we sympathize with the desire of 
               <br />
               Manitoba to increase her area, I do not 
               <br />
               think this sympathy should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.be</span> allowed to 
               <br />
               override every other consideration.

               Now, Mr. Speaker, as to the terms of the 
               <br />
               Bill before us—and in considering this ques- 
               <br />
               tion, it seems to me that we should approach 
               <br />
               it in a calm and deliberative spirit, that 
               <br />
               we should not allow prejudice or feeling to 
               <br />
               warp our judgment as to the merits of the 
               <br />
               provisions contained therein—I may say that 
               <br />
               I approve of the division of the Territories 
               <br />
               into two provinces. The greatest disad- 
               <br />
               vantage, it seems to me, of having one pro- 
               <br />
               vince for those western territories, would be 
               <br />
               that it would be unwieldy, and that a 
               <br />
               parliament of one hundred and ﬁfty repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives would not properly represent the 
               <br />
               territory embraced in its boundaries, and 
               <br />
               one of the principal objects of having pro- 
               <br />
               vincial governments would, as far as some 
               <br />
               parts of the Territories are concerned, be 
               <br />
               made null and void by the fact that it would 
               <br />
               practically be as far from exercising a super— 
               <br />
               vision over those distant and almost in- 
               <br />
               accessible places as this government would. 
               <br />
               But another and a more powerful reason 
               <br />
               was the fear that if we had only one pro- 
               <br />
               vince the eastern part of Assiniboia and 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan would be thrown into Mani- 
               <br />
               toba.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               So, Mr. Speaker, the idea of two provinces 
               <br />
               best suits the people of the Northwest, and 
               <br />
               1 have not as yet heard any reasonable 
               <br />
               argument advanced why the fourth meri- 
               <br />
               dian, which is to divide this territory into 
               <br />
               two provinces, is not the best and fairest 
               <br />
               that could be made; for while Alberta 
               <br />
               spreads out at the north and has in this 
               <br />
               section a large amount of very valuable 
               <br />
               land, Saskatchewan on the contrary, has 
               <br />
               comparatively little good land north of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">53rd</span> parallel; so that we have practically 
               <br />
               the same amount of arable land in each 
               <br />
               province. The only argument that has been 
               <br />
               advanced against it was that made by the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Calgary, who referred to 
               <br />
               the interests of the ranchers being affected 
               <br />
               prejudicially. Now, Mr. 'Speaker, ranching

               Now, in regard to our public lands. When 
               <br />
               I say our lands, I speak advisedly, as I 
               <br />
               think there are very few who will be un- 
               <br />
               willing to admit that We have at least a 
               <br />
               beneﬁciary right to these lands. To speak 
               <br />
               of the Dominion having bought them is 
               <br />
               not admissible. All that they bought were 
               <br />
               certain claims and mythical rights of the 
               <br />
               Hudson Bay Company, and Great Britain 
               <br />
               ceded her rights in this property to the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion to govern and enact laws for its well- 
               <br />
               l-eing, and to hold in trust for the beneﬁt 
               <br />
               of those who might in the future occupy and 
               <br />
               develop them. I do not agree with the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) when he 
               <br />
               says that the Dominion bought and owns 
               <br />
               these lands. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> claim that these lands, when 
               <br />
               viewed from any reasonable standpoint, are 
               <br />
               the property of the people residing in the 
               <br />
               Territories. But while I claim all this, I 
               <br />
               am a consistent supporter of this Bill ; for 
               <br />
               in lieu of our land, it provides for us an 
               <br />
               ample revenue for our present needs and a 
               <br />
               reasonable increase up to and until our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">popu—</span> 
               <br />
               lation reaches 1,200,000 when it amounts to 
               <br />
               $2,207,875 and then becomes stationary, but 
               <br />
               is guaranteed to us for all time to come: 
               <br />
               and we have a guarantee that the lands will 
               <br />
               be administered as well as we could ad- 
               <br />
               minister them, and for the beneﬁt of the 
               <br />
               provinces and the Whole of the Dominion. 
               <br />
               I think, however, there should be another 
               <br />
               clause added to this part of the Bill, limit- 
               <br />
               ing the time for which the lands should 
               <br />
               remain in the hands of the Dominion, and 
               <br />
               providing that at the expiration of a rea-
