               Well, we have a statute which says that 
               <br />
               the Minister of the Interior shall have the 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Northwest Territories, and we have the 
               <br />
               words of the Prime Minister himself who 
               <br />
               tells us that the Minister of the Interior, 
               <br />
               apart from any statute, has a special re— 
               <br />
               sponsibility with regard to the affairs of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories with which he is more 
               <br />
               closely connected than his colleagues. But 
               <br />
               what are we proposing to do at present? 
               <br />
               We are proposing to take a step which 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman and his colleagues 
               <br />
               declare to be one of the most momentous 
               <br />
               ever taken by a parliament of Canada. 
               <br />
               Yet the right hon. gentleman has not 
               <br />
               ﬁlled the post of Minister of the Interior. 
               <br />
               That position is still vacant. We are now in 
               <br />
               the heat of debate upon the Bills he has in— 
               <br />
               troduced. Before long we shall be in com- 
               <br />
               mittee on those Bills, and we shall not have 
               <br />
               the advantage of the presence and counsel 
               <br />
               of a minister specially responsible for the 
               <br />
               administration of those Territories. We do 
               <br />
               not ﬁnd at present in the cabinet any minis— 
               <br />

               <br />
               department. I have been informed by men, 
               <br />
               whom I have no reason to disbelieve, on 
               <br />
               various occasions during the last two or 
               <br />
               three weeks, that the work of that depart— 
               <br />
               ment is practically at a standstill for the 
               <br />
               lack of a responsible minister, familiar with 
               <br />
               its affairs and able to give his undivided 
               <br />
               attention to them. Why is this the case ? 
               <br />
               Is there any reason for it ? Let me show 
               <br />

               presented in the cabinet. For what purpose 
               <br />
               was that statute passed creating the portfolio 
               <br />
               of Minister of the Interior? Why, if not

               that there shall be in the cabinet a minister 
               <br />

               <br />
               thoroughly competent to safeguard its inter-

               <br />
               ance as the one now before us? Why, in 
               <br />
               those days my right hon. friend was so 
               <br />
               anxious in this regard, that upon the mere 
               <br />
               rumour of the resignation of ministers from 
               <br />
               Quebec, he moved the adjournment of the 
               <br />
               House and discussed the question at length. 
               <br />
               Later on, upon full explanation being given, 
               <br />
               when he had been assured that those gentle- 
               <br />
               men had not resigned and were at one with 
               <br />
               their colleagues, he was so much interested 
               <br />
               in the constiutional aspect of the case that 
               <br />
               he again moved the adjournment. But to- 
               <br />
               day when we inquire whether or not the 
               <br />
               vacant portfolio of the interior will be ﬁlled, 
               <br />
               my right hon. friend seems to emerge tem- 
               <br />
               porarily from a condition of forgetfulness. 
               <br />
               He is as one who would say: ‘ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Why,</span> bless

               my soul, then there is a Department of the

               Interior; I must look after it one of these 
               <br />
               days. There are Northwest Territories, but 
               <br />
               I had almost forgotten their existence. One 
               <br />
               of these days we will take the question up 
               <br />
               when there is nothing else to do ; but in the 
               <br />
               meantime we will go on and deal with most

               important questions affecting these Terri-

               In view of the cynical disregard of the 
               <br />
               constitution which we see every day in this 
               <br />
               House, is not the reminiscence, brought up 
               <br />
               by the utterances I have just quoted, per- 
               <br />
               fectly delicious ? Here are two—thirds of the 
               <br />
               cabinet not in harmony with the other one- 
               <br />
               third, if we apply the test which the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman himself applied ten years 
               <br />
               ago. How many of the colleagues of my 
               <br />
               right hon. friend are present in the House 
               <br />
               to-day ? There is a vacant seat next to him.
