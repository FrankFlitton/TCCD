               of the Northwest Territories was entirely

               -ment, should be the constitution for the 
               <br />
               new provinces ; and in his letter forwarding 
               <br />
               that copy, he expressly stated that it was 
               <br />
               for the parliament of Canada to decide what 
               <br />

               should be granted the new provinces when

               they received their full autonomy. I find in

               section 2 of the draft Bill which was pre-

               the English language express more clearly

               the intention of Mr. Haultain? Could any

               one err in his construction of What the law 
               <br />
               might be? The territories of Alberta and 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan only come into the union as 
               <br />
               provinces when they are so created. Neither 
               <br />
               of them came into the union in 1870 as a 
               <br />
               province, and consequently did not come in 
               <br />
               subject to ‘the provisions of section 146 of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act of 1867. 
               <br />
               That section only provided for their admis- 
               <br />
               sion as territories, and that Act was amend- 
               <br />
               ed, so far as these Territories are concerned, 
               <br />
               by the Act of 1871. Therefore, I claim that 
               <br />
               they onlycome in as provinces when the 
               <br />
               Bills before the House become law; and 
               <br />
               the minority, under the strict terms of the 
               <br />
               constitution, will be entitled to any denomi— 
               <br />
               national schools then in existence. I can 
               <br />
               quite understand that it would be difﬁcult 
               <br />
               to determine whether it would be section 11 
               <br />
               of the Act of 1875 or the Northwest ordin- 
               <br />
               ances, as they stand to—day, which would be 
               <br />
               the law, if this House were to pass the 
               <br />
               Bill submitted by Mr. Haultain. I can 
               <br />
               readily understand that there would be a 
               <br />
               great chance of a lawsuit arising to deter- 
               <br />
               mine whether the Northwest Territories Act 
               <br />
               of 1875, passed by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> House, or the North- 
               <br />
               west ordinances, as they exist to-day, would 
               <br />
               be the law. I can well understand that that 
               <br />
               would be a vexed and troublesome question 
               <br />
               which would bother the people of the Terri— 
               <br />
               tories for years; and, therefore, it is im- 
               <br />
               portant that we should express clearly and 
               <br />
               unequivocally exactly What we mean. I 
               <br />
               would not like to vote for the passage of a 
               <br />
               law which was bound to be productive of a 
               <br />
               lawsuit and to stir up strife and broil. _We 
               <br />
               are here to express our views and intentions 
               <br />
               in clear and unequivocal language so that 
               <br />
               only one meaning can be taken out of it. 
               <br />
               I should be very diﬂident about giving my

               tain’s Bill did I not ﬁnd it supported by 
               <br />
               much higher constitutional authority. I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that the right hon. the First Minister, 
               <br />
               who has, during the past thirty years, taken 
               <br />
               a great part in the legislation of this coun- 
               <br />
               try, gives it as his view that the Northwest 
               <br />
               ordinances would, under Mr. ,Haultain’s Bill, 
               <br />
               become part of the law governing the new 
               <br />
               provinces to be created. I find that the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice expresses the same view. 
               <br />
               I ﬁnd also that the Postmaster General (Sir 
               <br />
               William <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Muwlock),</span> who, long before he be- 
               <br />
               came a member of this government, held a 
               <br />
               distinguished place at the bar of Ontario, 
               <br />
               is also of the same view. That “also is the 
               <br />
               opinion held by the Solicitor General (Mr. 
               <br />
               Lemieux), whose business it is to construe 
               <br />
               the different measures submitted to this 
               <br />
               House. I might go further and refer to the 
               <br />
               opinion which has been expressed by the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Beauharnois (Mr. Ber- 
               <br />
               geron), who is also a distinguished member 
               <br />
               of the bar of the province of Quebec. 
               <br />
               It is his view that Mr. Haultain’s draft Bill
