               <br />
               union from 1840 to 1867. His great and 
               <br />
               noble ancestor, Mr. Louis Joseph Papineau, 
               <br />
               after his return from exile, accused Lafon- 
               <br />
               taine of being too timid. of being a tool in 
               <br />
               the hands of the English majority because 
               <br />
               he had formed an alliance with Baldwin. 
               <br />
               What did Lafontaine answer? He said: 
               <br />
               ‘ The days are gone by when the ﬁght is to 
               <br />
               be made with bayonets or guns. We are 
               <br />
               working now under the constitution which 
               <br />
               has been freely granted to the inhabitants 
               <br />
               of this country. True it is, I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have'</span> not 
               <br />
               obtained for the French Canadians every- 
               <br />
               thing they have claimed, but notice since 
               <br />
               I have formed this alliance with my Eng- 
               <br />
               lish friend Baldwin, what has happeened: 
               <br />
               The French language, which has been ex- 
               <br />
               punged from the records of the House, has 
               <br />
               been restored ; the French language is now 
               <br />
               the ofﬁcial language. Political exiles had 
               <br />
               been sent to Australia and the Bermudas. 
               <br />
               but through concessions, because I have 
               <br />
               learned the policy of conciliation, I have 
               <br />
               been able to obtain the return of the ex- 
               <br />
               iles to their country.‘ And what other re- 
               <br />
               forms did not Lafontaine mention? My 
               <br />
               hon. friend is not playing the right game 
               <br />
               in saying to the public, to his fellow- 
               <br />
               countrymen, that in this confederation, in 
               <br />
               this wide Dominion, with two great races 
               <br />
               facing each other, the French Canadians are 
               <br />
               ill—treated and are trodden upon. No, for 
               <br />
               my part, I have a better opinion of the 
               <br />
               majority. It is true we have not obtained 
               <br />
               in the present instance all that our bishops 
               <br />
               wanted to obtain, but in conclusion I would 
               <br />
               say: Let us follow the advice which has 
               <br />
               been given us by a great writer, Sydney

               a minority in the west, when every one re-

               cognized that we had a moral obligation and

               of 1901, by which the state has absolute con- 
               <br />
               trol over' the secular part of education, and the 
               <br />
               people have control simply of the religious part 
               <br />
               of education from half—past three in the after- 
               <br />
               noon. 1 have for my part agreed to the new 
               <br />
               clause 16, and in so doing I know that I have 
               <br />
               restricted my {ellow—religionists in regard to 
               <br />
               some of the rights which they think they have 
               <br />
               at this moment. I shall explain in due time 
               <br />
               why I agreed to do so.
