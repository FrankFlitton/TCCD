               the other day by the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Labelle (Mr. Bourassa). He tried to show 
               <br />
               what a kind and statesmanlike thing it 
               <br />
               would be to relieve the people of the North- 
               <br />
               west of the burden of managing these lands. 
               <br />
               That seemed to be the general trend of his 
               <br />
               remarks. He suggested that the members 
               <br />
               of the provincial legislatures might be pres- 
               <br />
               sed to use the lands improperly. If he ﬁnds 
               <br />
               that difﬁculty in the province of Quebec he 
               <br />
               has the remedy of inducing his province to 
               <br />
               hand over all their lands to the administra; 
               <br />
               tion of the Dominion. But, we have never 
               <br />
               found any difﬁculty of that kind whatever in 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories in the matters 
               <br />
               with which we have had to deal up to the 
               <br />
               present day, and I believe we shall ﬁnd no 
               <br />
               difﬁculty in that connection in the future. 
               <br />
               At any rate, who is the more likely to have 
               <br />
               improper pressure put upon them to ad- 
               <br />
               minister these lands wrongly ? Is it the 
               <br />
               members of the legislatures of the new prov- 
               <br />
               inces who are directly under the eye of the 
               <br />
               people most intimately concerned. or is it 
               <br />
               not likely to be the Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               who is acting by himself down here at 
               <br />
               Ottawa ?

               <br />
               clauses in this Bill. These clauses have been 
               <br />
               introduced, I assert once again in spite of 
               <br />
               what the hon. member for Ottawa said, 
               <br />
               in such a form as to invite opposition : and 
               <br />
               the disparaging references made constantly 
               <br />
               to the people of the Northwest by member 
               <br />
               after member on the other side of the House 
               <br />
               have not been such as to soothe the feelings 
               <br />
               of the people under these difﬁcult circum- 
               <br />
               stances. I would like to say, in reference 
               <br />
               to the statement made by the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Ottawa that he had been told that no 
               <br />
               school question existed in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories up to the present time, that 
               <br />
               that is practically the case. The school 
               <br />
               question has been raised in this parliament 
               <br />
               and raised on the other side of the House. 
               <br />
               But, I consider that the same hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man misrepresents the position of this party 
               <br />
               when he suggests that our attitude is to 
               <br />
               iavour the repeal of the present system of 
               <br />
               education which obtains in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories. The position of this party is 
               <br />
               that this is a local and provincial question 
               <br />
               which should be dealt with entirely by the 
               <br />
               provinces, that this is a matter in reference 
               <br />
               to which this parliament has no right or 
               <br />
               power to place restrictions or limitations on 
               <br />
               the provinces. We contend for provincial 
               <br />
               rights in this matter. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) accus-es us of mis- 
               <br />
               using what he refers to as that sacred term. 
               <br />
               With one breath he denounces us for appeal- 
               <br />
               ing for provincial rights and then with the 
               <br />
               next breath he approves of the federal 
               <br />
               authorities retaining possession of the public 
               <br />

               <br />
               in their possession. He went on to treat 
               <br />
               the people of the Northwest Territories as

               <br />
               into the religious discussion which he raised. 
               <br />
               This evening we again had a violent racial

               and religious appeal from the hon. member 
               <br />

               up my mind that I at any rate will not 
               <br />
               follow the bad example which has been set

               us by hon. gentlemen on the other side 
               <br />
               of the House. I respect the religious con- 
               <br />
               victions of others and I think they should 
               <br />
               show the same respect for my religious 
               <br />
               convictions. I feel they have not done it. 
               <br />
               Nor, Sir, is it a question of the value of 
               <br />
               separate schools as an abstract proposition. 
               <br />
               We are not discussing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thatjuestion</span> at all. 
               <br />
               lt is a question of equal rights to the new 
               <br />
               provinces with those which have been given 
               <br />
               to other provinces in the Dominion to deal 
               <br />
               with matters of education. It has been sug- 
               <br />
               gested that this question has been raised on 
               <br />
               this side of the House as a party question. 
               <br />
               that this side of the House is responsible for 
               <br />
