               <br />
               majority. Mr. Speaker, during this debate I 
               <br />
               confess that I have been amazed at the i-ntem- 
               <br />
               perance of some of the remarks that have 
               <br />
               been made on both sides of this House. I 
               <br />
               confess that possibly I know more about the 
               <br />
               inﬂammable materials that there are in this 
               <br />
               country than some of the hon. members 
               <br />
               who have made these utterances. In most 
               <br />
               mining communities there are laws which 
               <br />
               prohibit, under the severest penalty, a man 
               <br />
               from carrying a naked lamp into a coal mine 
               <br />
               where there are noxious gases liable to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex;</span> 
               <br />
               plode ; and a special lamp has been invented 
               <br />
               with a wire screen about it that will give 
               <br />
               light but will not cause .ignition. So it is 
               <br />
               possible for a miner to pass through the 
               <br />
               noxious and explosive gases with his safety 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lamp</span> and to come out unharmed. I think 
               <br />
               that, in a debate of this kind, where <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vmen’s</span> 
               <br />
               minds are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">likely</span> to be embittered and where 
               <br />
               their sentiments are liable to become over- 
               <br />
               wrought, we should travel with a safety 
               <br />
               lamp. All. the light that is required on the 
               <br />
               subject can be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thrown</span> by a safety lamp, 
               <br />
               but the ﬁre which would cause combustion 
               <br />
               is not necessary to a discussion of this 
               <br />
               character. So, I feel that we should, in 
               <br />
               dealing with this question, deal with it ab— 
               <br />
               solutely upon the merits of the case, each 
               <br />
               man following what he believes to be right 
               <br />
               from his own point of view. I have not 
               <br />
               been very long a member of this House. I 
               <br />
               do not know how long I may be a member 
               <br />
               of this House, but whatever record I leave 
               <br />
               behind me I want to be chieﬂy remembered 
               <br />
               for this, that, while I was here, my in- 
               <br />
               ﬂuence was for peace and not for war, that 
               <br />
               my inﬂuence was to build up and not to 
               <br />
               tear down, to heal and not to hurt. We 
               <br />
               have in this Dominion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">elements</span> derived from 
               <br />
               different origins. We have come from dif— 
               <br />
               ferent countries. There is one race here 
               <br />
               by right by discovery, there is another race 
               <br />
               here by right of conquest, but the country 
               <br />
               belongs to us both alike. To this mixed 
               <br />
               people there has been given a great task 
               <br />
               to work out. No nation in the world has 
               <br />
               been more beneﬁciently endowed by the 
               <br />
               Creator than have we Canadians and there 
               <br />
               is a call—an insistent call—for us to be up 
               <br />
               and doing and to work out the develop- 
               <br />
               ment of this great inheritance. To pro- 
               <br />
               perly accomplish this task, I believe it is 
               <br />
               absolutely necessary that we should beable 
               <br />
               to work together in unison and harmony, 
               <br />
               and anything that seems to have the ap- 
               <br />
               pearance of a breach of faith, anything 
               <br />
               that appears to a large sect-ion of the com- 
               <br />
               munity to be a violation of an agreement, 
               <br />
               is something that the people of this coun-

               <br />
               We can only have unity if we have mutual

               <br />
               Speaker, this question has already been so 
               <br />
               exhaustively discussed that it is very diﬂi- 
               <br />
               cult for one at this stage of the debate to 
               <br />
               address himself to the subject Without re- 
               <br />
               treading to a very large extent ground 
               <br />
               which has already been gone over by others. 
               <br />
               But the matter is one of such deep interest 
               <br />
               in the constituency which I have the honour 
               <br />
               to represent in this House, as I believe it 
               <br />
               is of deep interest in every constituency 
               <br />
               throughout Canada, that I feel that I would 
               <br />
               be recreant to my duty if I did not at least 
               <br />
               state the views which I hold in respect to 
               <br />
               it. Let me say then at once, Sir, that I am 
               <br />
               in full sympathy with the establishment of 
               <br />
               self—government in the Northwest. I think 
               <br />
               that the time has come when <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> great 
               <br />
               and rapidly developing portion of our coun- 
               <br />
               try, comprising as it does that great fertile 
               <br />
               belt which is the hope of our future, is 
               <br />
               entitled to provincial autonomy, not the 
               <br />
               mock autonomy which is provided by this 
               <br />
               Bill, but a real, genuine autonomy which 
               <br />
               will enable the new provinces to govern 
               <br />
               themselves independently in matters of pro- 
               <br />
               vincial concern and place them upon a foot- 
               <br />
               ing of equality with the other settled por— 
               <br />
               tions of this confederation. It is because 
               <br />
               this Bill which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is,now</span> before the House, 
               <br />
               while purporting to grant such autonomy, 
               <br />
               so restricts and circumscribes the legisla- 
               <br />
               tive powers which are granted as practi- 
               <br />
               cally to destroy their value and to make 
               <br />
               the whole scheme of the government a 
               <br />
               delusion and a sham that I am opposed 
               <br />
               to the measure as it stands and intend to 
               <br />
               vote for the amendment which has been 
               <br />
               moved by my hon. friend the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden). I think, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, that this House has never had 
               <br />
               a more striking illustration of a misnomer 
               <br />
               than is exhibited by the application to this 
               <br />
               Bill of the name ‘autonomy.’ I think the 
               <br />
               Bill would be more accurately described if 
               <br />
               it were to be called a restriction rather than 
               <br />
               an Autonomy Bill. The autonomy which 
               <br />
               it embodies is, to my mind, very much of 
               <br />
