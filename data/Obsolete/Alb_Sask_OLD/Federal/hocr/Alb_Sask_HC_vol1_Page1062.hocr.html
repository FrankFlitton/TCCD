               away from the exclusiveness, but rather

               giving privileges to minorities, and that is

               beyond its powers and then only does

               think in a subordinate degree to these others, 
               <br />
               If I were to ask myself what particular

               interpretation upon section 93, I think that 
               <br />
               on careful examination I would very likely 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that the campaign of 1896 with the

               <br />

               <br />
               certainly ‘ Let the provinces attend to their

               own educational affairs, would have a 
               <br />
               large bearing on it. I may be right or

               I may be wrong, but with all due

               <br />
               that in my present attitude I am nearer to 
               <br />
               the position of the Liberal party who swept 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               129 of course how very subtle is the dividing

               line that will at a certain point separate 
               <br />
               minds that have been examining various 
               <br />
               arguments and that have been up to that 
               <br />
               time in agreement. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">It</span> you take section 93 
               <br />
               which gives exclusive rights of legislation

               in regard to education to provinces and at 
               <br />

               of minorities, it is easy to ask what is the 
               <br />
               dominant idea. Reading it with the whole 
               <br />
               case in view and remembering the struggles 
               <br />
               that led up to confederation, one mind is 
               <br />
               struck with the thought that the preserv- 
               <br />
               ation to minorities of any privileges they 
               <br />
               enjoyed was the most prominent feature, 
               <br />
               the principle to be most conserved and 
               <br />
               safeguarded even to the extent of providing 
               <br />
               for remedial legislation if infringed upon, 
               <br />
               To another mind the setting apart to

               provinces of the exclusive right to make 
               <br />
               laws on education is the prominent one— 
               <br />
               and that mind is impressed with the thought 
               <br />
               that exclusiveness is the real essence— 
               <br />
               the exceptions being only limitations to the

               course appears to be clear. I think that 
               <br />
               the proper course in a case of this kind 
               <br />
               would have been when it was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">known</span> before— 
               <br />
               hand that these questions would be debated 
               <br />
               as we had fought them out on previous 
               <br />
               occasions, to have ascertained exactly what 
               <br />
               the constitution was in the case and to 
               <br />
               have adhered to it, and then we would not 
               <br />
               have had a Bill brought in that would 
               <br />
               cause almost a mutiny in a party, that 
               <br />
               would make it necessary to have reconsider- 
               <br />
               ation and a change. A decision on an ap- 
               <br />
               peal to the Privy Council would have 
               <br />
               obivated all or a great portion of the oppo- 
               <br />
               sition that has arisen. Our constitution be- 
               <br />
               ing a written one can be interpreted and it 
               <br />
               has not the elasticity of an unwritten con- 
               <br />
               stitution. The only elasticity that I think 
               <br />
               our constitution has is found in such amend- 
               <br />
               ments as may be made by a vote of the 
               <br />
               people on certain actions of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment and it has been claimed that the re- 
               <br />
               medial portion of our Act of 1867 has been 
               <br />
               abrogated by the elections following 1896 
               <br />
               which may be true. There are other ques— 
               <br />
               tions in regard to which we may well con- 
               <br />
               sider. 'If these new provinces are not 
               <br />

               <br />
               they obey ? If they do not obey what will 
               <br />
               follow? The west is impatient of restraint; 
               <br />
               it is unwise, I think, to try to bind them too 
               <br />
               closely. It may be that they will accept, I 
               <br />
               hope they will. It may be these Bils will 
               <br />
               work out well, I hope they will, but I have 
               <br />
               a fear that possibly we are not at the end 
               <br />
               of the trouble, but only at the beginning. 
               <br />
               It has been urged over and over again by 
               <br />
               members of the opposition in this House 
               <br />
               that it would be well even yet for the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment to take the step of appealing to the 
               <br />
               Privy Council before they put this Bill in 
               <br />
               force. .I notice in the ‘Sunday World’ 
               <br />
               which is not a very good authority to 
               <br />
               quote to the government, a statement that 
               <br />
               there were rumours in the corridors that 
               <br />
               such a course would be taken, that the gov-' 
               <br />
               ernment would yet before putting the Act 
               <br />
               in force submit certain questions to the 
               <br />
               Privy Council in regard to these educational 
               <br />
               clauses. I may say that while my vote is 
               <br />
               of no importance to the government on the 
               <br />
               present occasion, if such a step was taken 
               <br />
               it would enable me with very great pleas- 
               <br />
               ure to vote for the government on both of 
               <br />
               these Bills. As I said the vote of a single 
               <br />
               member in such a case is not of very much 
               <br />
               value and importance to them, and it of 
               <br />
               itself would not be suﬂ‘icient reason for the 
               <br />
               government taking such action but it might 
               <br />
               easily happen that such a course would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 
               <br />
               value to them in the future, throughout the

               country at large and it might happen that
