               tory. I also wanted to make sure that if 
               <br />
               it had to be diverted—and there could be no 
               <br />

               <br />
               that diversion should be limited and tem-

               interests, but that the road should come into

               Canadian territory again after that engin-

               the opposition of others with me in this re-

               spect was due not so much to good and

               patriotic reasons as to a desire to burk the

               which I give and on the policy which I

               only reason is that there are engineering 
               <br />

               <br />
               line between certain limits, not very long 
               <br />
               as it is theoretically stated, in extent, ex- 
               <br />
               tending some thirty of thirty-ﬁve miles, 
               <br />
               which will make it, if not next to impos- 
               <br />
               sible, very expensive to build the road, and 
               <br />
               which will make it a road less easily oper- 
               <br />
               ated commercially, because of the height 
               <br />
               it has to ascend and descend again. I do 
               <br />
               not think it is anything too much to say 
               <br />
               that in the committee we were not treated 
               <br />
               to any information regarding these engineer- 
               <br />
               ing diﬂiculties which would be considered 
               <br />
               as adequate and satisfactory. The state- 
               <br />
               ment was made that there were engineer- 
               <br />
               ing difﬁculties, that there would be heights 
               <br />
               running up to thousands of feet, and that 
               <br />
               the grades would have to be, if not“ very 
               <br />
               largely distanced out, pretty steep. But 
               <br />
               as regards engineering reports or engineer- 
               <br />
               ing evidence, there was nothing satisfac-

               tory submitted to the committee. There 
               <br />
               were statements of lay men which may 
               <br />
               have been well enough so far as they went, 
               <br />
               but there was no testimony of engineers 
               <br />
               given. What objection then can be taken 
               <br />
               to the course that we suggest? If it be 
               <br />
               not considered well to make it a provision 
               <br />
               in the Act, at least make somebody res- 
               <br />
               ponsible that these engineering difﬁculties 
               <br />
               shall be shown to exist before the line shall 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> allowed to diverge to the south of the 
               <br />
               international boundary. For customs and 
               <br />
               other reasons, it would be better to run north 
               <br />
               of the international boundary line. But if 
               <br />
               it is shown impossible to get <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&amp;</span> commercial 
               <br />
               line north of that, I would not take it upon 
               <br />
               myself personally to object to the diver- 
               <br />
               gence, provided that that diversion were 
               <br />
               limited in extent, and that as soon as the 
               <br />
               engineering difﬁculties were overcome, the 
               <br />
               line should go back to Canadian territory 
               <br />
