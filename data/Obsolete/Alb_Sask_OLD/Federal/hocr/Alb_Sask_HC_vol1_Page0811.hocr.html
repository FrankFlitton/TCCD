               Such facts go to show that, at times, the

               I shall be content to follow the practice of 
               <br />
               courts of justice—and this parliament is, 
               <br />
               indeed, the highest tribunal in the country— 
               <br />
               and quote, in support of my views, those of 
               <br />
               statesmen, jurists, &amp;c., who have been al-

               ways considered in this House, and rightly

               The Bill was int-ended to remove doubts
