               <br />

               <br />
               as these hon. gentlemen have done. While 
               <br />
               I am on my feet I would like to say a word 
               <br />
               with regard to the number <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘of</span> copies of 
               <br />
               the Bill distributed so far. Eight days ago 
               <br />
               the Bill was introduced. Up to to-day each 
               <br />
               of us could only get one copy of the Bill. 
               <br />
               Yesterday, the Prime Minister said that 
               <br />
               there was no objection to having a large 
               <br />
               number struck off. It would only take two 
               <br />
               or three hours to strike off a couple of 
               <br />
               thousand copies of the Bill. It seems 
               <br />
               strange to us, therefore, that up to the 
               <br />
               present, we have been able to get only four 
               <br />
               or ﬁve copies each. I made inquiry of the 
               <br />
               Printing Bureau and they told me: We 
               <br />
               were instructed to give no information as 
               <br />
               to the number of copies of the Bill to be 
               <br />
               printed. It seems strange that there Should 
               <br />
               be such secrecy. I would ask the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister if he knows any good reason why 
               <br />
               we should not get more copies of the Bill, 
               <br />
               and whether he will give instructions that 
               <br />
               &amp; much larger number be printed, because 
               <br />
               there is an urgent demand for them from 
               <br />
               many parts of the country. I myself have 
               <br />
               applications for at least a hundred copies 
               <br />
               of the Bill. Yet, though it is eight days 
               <br />
               since the Bill was introduced, I am able 
               <br />
               to supply only ﬁve.

               desire that the Manitoba school question

               <br />

               the wishes of those gentlemen and of the

               late Minister of the Interior were not gra-

               ourable course open to the late Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior, than that which he has taken, 
               <br />
               and I had the most perfect conﬁdence in his 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strength</span> of purpose and knew that he 
               <br />
               would not tolerate the inﬂiction upon the 
               <br />
               Northwest of the clause in this Bill relat- 
               <br />
               ing to education. I ask the Prime Minister; 
               <br />
               I appeal to his patriotism—and he pretends 
               <br />
               to be patriotic—in view of the fact that 
               <br />
               the Minister of the Interior has retired and 
               <br />
               that other ministers hang their heads when 
               <br />
               this Bill is mentioned; in view of the fact 
               <br />
               that many hon. members behind him will 
               <br />
               not and dare not support him; in the in-
