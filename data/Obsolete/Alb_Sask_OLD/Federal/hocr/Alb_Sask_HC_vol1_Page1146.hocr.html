               On the 23rd of June, 1870, an imperial 
               <br />
               Order in Council was passed, and as was 
               <br />
               pointed out by the leader of the opposition, 
               <br />
               that Order in Council has all the effect ot 
               <br />
               an imperial Act ot“ parliament, by virtue of 
               <br />
               the British North <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">America</span> Act. Now that 
               <br />

               <br />
               vided for the admission of Rupert’s Land 
               <br />
               and the Northwest Territories into the 
               <br />
               union on terms and conditions expressed in 
               <br />
               the address, subject to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Queens</span> approval 
               <br />
               and to the prowsions Of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. The order enacts that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> 
               <br />
               and after the 15th day of July, 1870, the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territoiries snall be admitted into 
               <br />
               and become part of the Dominion "of Can- 
               <br />
               ada upon the terms and conditions set 
               <br />
               forth in the address. Now what could be 
               <br />
               more distinct than that Order in Council, 
               <br />
               which is virtually an Act of the imperial 
               <br />
               parliament ? Un the 15th day of July, 1870, 
               <br />
               the Northwest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territories</span> became part of 
               <br />
               the union; and yet we are told that that 
               <br />
               union has not yet taken place. In order to

               <br />
               they were all in the one statute. Well, put 
               <br />
               the clauses of the Act of 1871 into the Act

               Now, Mr. Speaker, if any interpretation 
               <br />
               can be put upon that section short 
               <br />
               of one which empowers the upsetting 
               <br />
               of the Whole fabric of the constitution of 
               <br />
               the Dominion, surely that limited interpre— 
               <br />
               tation should be given to it. What is the 
               <br />
               meaning of making ‘provision for the con- 
               <br />
               stitution and administration’ of the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. I suppose the hon. gentleman knows 
               <br />
               that in the Bill now before the House there 
               <br />
               are some eight clauses making provision 
               <br />
               for the constitution of this province, clauses 
               <br />
               7 to 14. The legislature of the province 
               <br />
               cannot be elected or convened <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">until</span> a con— 
               <br />
               stitution is provided. First of all it is es— 
               <br />
               sential that some authority should decide 
               <br />
               whether there is to be one house or two 
               <br />
               houses, an assembly only, or an assembly 
               <br />
               and a senate. Somebody must settle how 
               <br />
               many members there shall be in the local 
               <br />
               legislature and must provide those various 
               <br />
               details which are found in clauses 7 to 14 
               <br />
               of Bill 69 with which we are dealing. That 
               <br />
               is what is intended by providing for the 
               <br />
               constitution of a new province. Without 
               <br />
               such provision the provincial legislature 
               <br />
               could never get to work, there would be no 
               <br />
