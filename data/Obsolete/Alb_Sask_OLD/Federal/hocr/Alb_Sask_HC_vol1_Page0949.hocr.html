               that when my hon. friend the Minister of Jus-

               That is the opinion of one of his late col-

               rior had read the amended clause critically, 
               <br />
               he would ﬁnd a great deal covered up in

               that also, and he would ﬁnd that it contained

               wondered at that under those circumstances

               the Liberal party carried the country and

               promise that he would settle the Manitoba

               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway authorities and 
               <br />
               said to them : We want to get Joe Martin 
               <br />
               removed out of the province of Manitoba, 
               <br />
               and I want you to hire him for ﬁve years 
               <br />
               at a salary of $10,000 a year. Appoint him 
               <br />
               your solicitor and send him out to British 
               <br />
               Columbia. The Canadian Paciﬁc Railway 
               <br />
               asked: How are we to be recouped? To 
               <br />
               this question Mr. Tarte replied: You are 
               <br />
               asking for a bonus to build the Crow’s Nest 
               <br />
               Pass railway. The late government offered 
               <br />
               you a bonus. Appoint Martin your solicitor 
               <br />
               for five years at $10,000 a year, and we will 
               <br />
               double that bonus. The Canadian Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               engaged Martin and sent him away, and 
               <br />
               legislation was brought down to this House 
               <br />
               increasing the subsidy to the Crow’s Nest 
               <br />
               Railway to an extent sufﬁcient to double 
               <br />
               the payment which the Canadian Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               Railway were giving Martin for acting as 
               <br />
               their solicitor. Then Mr. Tarte approched 
               <br />
               Mr. Prendcrgast and said to him : Prender- 
               <br />
               gast, you are a poor man fighting the inter- 
               <br />
               ests of the minority in Manitoba, Give up 
               <br />
               your position, and we will appoint you to 
               <br />
               the bench as chief justice of that province. 
               <br />
               Mr. Prendergast looked at the salary of 
               <br />
               chief justice, compared it with the little pay 
               <br />
