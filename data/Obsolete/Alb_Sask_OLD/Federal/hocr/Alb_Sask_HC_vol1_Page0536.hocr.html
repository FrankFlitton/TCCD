               we do not have any separate schools. We

               had a separate school a good many years 
               <br />
               ago, but the people got tired of it, and away‘ 
               <br />
               back in 1875, before the law compelled us 
               <br />
               to put a Roman Catholic on the high school 
               <br />
               board, by common consent the town coun- 
               <br />
               cil, of which I had the honour of being a 
               <br />
               member, asked the Roman Catholics to name 
               <br />
               a man to represent them on the high school 
               <br />
               board. He was put on, and I think he has 
               <br />
               been a member of the school board ever 
               <br />
               since. We employ a certain number of 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic teachers in our schools, 
               <br />
               and we have had no trouble whatever, we

               Lave lived in peace and harmony, which 
               <br />
               is the kind of thing I would like to see all 
               <br />
               over this country. I think when our boys 
               <br />
               and girls grow up and attend school to- 
               <br />

               and they forget for the time being what 
               <br />
               particular sect each one may belong to. 
               <br />
