               people if they are willing to accept it. Im- 
               <br />
               position means an unwillingness on the

               the part of the one who imposes. Now

               what did this Bill impose? It merely con-

               ﬁrmed a principle that these people in the

               Northwest Territories had imposed upon 
               <br />
               themselves. The imposition, if any, was 
               <br />
               made by the local legislature of the North- 
               <br />

               Therefore if there are any shackles being 
               <br />
               put on the people, they put them on of
