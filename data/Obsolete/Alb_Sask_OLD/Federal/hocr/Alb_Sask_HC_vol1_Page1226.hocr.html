               A Liberal government in Ontario gave

               away three great franchises in connection

               with the development of power, and two

               <br />
               by the local authorities than by the central 
               <br />
               authority at Ottawa. The new Minister of

               the Interior has come into the House fresh 
               <br />
               from the west, and I would like him to tell 
               <br />
               us whether the opinion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the west is, as it 
               <br />
               was formerly, that the public domain shall 
               <br />

               <br />
               are told here by one or two members from 
               <br />
               the west that their views have changed, 
               <br />
               but I am quite certain that the views of the 
               <br />
               people of the west in this respect have not 
               <br />

               Mr. OLIVER. All of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lus</span> who come from 
               <br />
               the west are anxious to have this Bill pass— 
               <br />
               ed, and if we do not reply to every asser- 
               <br />
               tion that is made from the other side, it is- 
               <br />
               rather because we wish to forward business 
               <br />
               than that we'are particular about how gen-

               tlemen on the other side care to represent 
               <br />
               or misrepresent the position. By this ﬁme 
               <br />
               we have fairly well arrived at a conclusion 
               <br />
               as to what is the position of the opposition 
               <br />
               in regard to this question. They appear to 
               <br />
               be unanimous in the view that the lands- of 
               <br />
               the west shall be treated as a source of 
               <br />
               revenue, and that the west should depend 
               <br />
               upon its lands for its revenue. That is the 
               <br />
               view that prevailed when the Conservatives 
               <br />
               were in power, and every member on the 
               <br />
               other side has reiterated that principle to- 
               <br />
               day. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘I</span> need not remind the House or the 
               <br />
               country that under that policy, not only was 
               <br />
               the land not a source of revenue, but it was 
               <br />
               a source of direct loss; it did not pay the 
               <br />
               cost of administration. It was not until the 
               <br />
               principle of the land for the people, the 
               <br />
               principle of free land to the settler, was 
               <br />
               adopted that the price of land in the North— 
               <br />
               west increased. It is because of the policy 
               <br />
               of the land for the settler that land in the 
               <br />
               west has attained its present value. Just so 
               <br />
               sure as the policy of the land for revenue is 
               <br />
               adopted again, just so sure the result will 
               <br />
               be as before. With the experience we have 
               <br />
               had, it is late in the day <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> us to make the 
               <br />
               mistake of killing the goose that lays the 
               <br />
               golden egg. It is the free settlement of land 
               <br />
               that makes the balance of it valuable, and 
               <br />
               just so soon as you place the burden of sup- 
               <br />
               port of provincial government upon the 
               <br />
               revenue derived from the sale of the land, 
               <br />
               just so soon you will depreciate the value 
               <br />
               of the land and injure the province and in- 
               <br />
               jure the country. I am fresh from the west, 
               <br />
               and I can tell my hon. friend (Mr. W. F.
