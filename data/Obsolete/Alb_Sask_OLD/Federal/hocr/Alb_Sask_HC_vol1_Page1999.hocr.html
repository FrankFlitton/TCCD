               <br />
               My amendment tends toward both these 
               <br />
               ends. It throws upon the government a 
               <br />
               responsibility which they ought to be will— 
               <br />

               only when engineering diﬂiculties cannot 
               <br />
               reasonably be overcome; I say ‘reasonably ’ 
               <br />
               because that is only fair. and, second, that 
               <br />
               they shall make certain that the road shall 
               <br />
               be built from Cloverdale to Princeton as 
               <br />
               quickly as can be reasonably done. The 
               <br />
               government has the power, and it is res- 
               <br />
               ponsible to parliament; and it can take 
               <br />
               such guarantees and make such provisions 
               <br />
               as may be necessary. Now, who would 
               <br />
               be hurt if this amendment is carried ? Cer—

               <br />
               as quickly as it can possibly be done. Let 
               <br />
               us get out of the notion that any or us 
               <br />
               are opposed to Mr. Hill building the road. 
               <br />
               Let us have the proper provisions and the 
               <br />
               proper guarantees, such as, I contend, my 
               <br />
               amendment will provide, and we will be 
               <br />
               glad to see this work undertaken. There 
               <br />
               is nothing dogmatic about this amendment. 
               <br />
               It simply says that the government must 
               <br />
               be sure that there is valid reason for divert— 
               <br />
               ng the road south of the boundary even 
               <br />
               for thirty-ﬁve miles. And, in the second 
               <br />
               place, the government must make as sure 
               <br />
               as they reasonably can that this road from 
               <br />
               Cloveradale to Princeton shall be built in 
               <br />
               a reasonable time. There is a part Where 
               <br />
               it will come in from south of the boundary 
               <br />
               into Canadian territory where there will 
               <br />
               be pretty heavy building. That is the least 
               <br />
               proﬁtable part of the country for the work 
               <br />
               of development, as I understand. It is 
               <br />
               more important that the part from Clover- 
               <br />
               dale to Princeton and the part connecting 
               <br />

               the road is to cross the international boun- 
               <br />
               dary. That means that the boundary must 
               <br />
               be crossed somewhere. It seems to me 
               <br />
               merely reﬁning a little more to put the pro-

               I do not know exactly what guarantees

               we could have in this matter. _ I cannot
