               <br />
               in order for those who know all about it 
               <br />
               to deny that assumption; but as it is not 
               <br />
               denied, it goes to strengthen the analysis 
               <br />
               I am making, and the conclusion that ‘par

               ernment out of difﬁculties into which they 
               <br />
               had involved themselves, and to help them 
               <br />
               out of that confusion and trouble by the in-

               This House and this country will know in 
               <br />
               a moment whether that inference is a viol- 
               <br />
               ent one or a fair one. Why, in the whole 
               <br />
               tenor of those letters, the right hon. gen-

               <br />
               is no assumption that he has come here 
               <br />
               for spiritual or church purposes. It is all 
               <br />
               put on the basis of political or state rea- 
               <br />
               sons. What were the diﬂiculties he was 
               <br />
               to settle '? If they had put it honestly in 
               <br />
               black and white, they would have said: the 
               <br />
               difﬁculties amongst Reformers and between 
               <br />
               Reformers, and Conservatives, and we want 
               <br />
               a high dignity of the church to come here 
               <br />
               and help us to smooth out those political 
               <br />
               diﬂiculties.

               But there is another very singular thing 
               <br />
               which Mr. Russell put into that statement 
               <br />
               of his to His Eminence, that is, that his 
               <br />

               <br />
               who leads the government, writing in 1897, 
               <br />
               after the right hon. gentleman had declared 
               <br />
               that he had settled satisfactorily the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mania</span> 
               <br />
               toba school question, had instructed Mr. 
               <br />
               Russell to remind His Holiness through His 
               <br />
               Eminence that they did not pretend to be- 
               <br />
               lieve that ‘ the concessions were perfect, but 
               <br />
               they begged His Holiness to take them as 
               <br />
               the beginning of justire.’ Now, Sir, is that

               straightforward conduct? The right hon.

               <br />
               tuous policy. So he is. In 1896 he saw a 
               <br />
               bridge by which he could get into power; 
               <br />
               he was anxious to cross the bridge; he 
               <br />
               threw his principles, the constitutional prin-

               ciples on which he had prided himself so

               much, to the Winds; he also threw to the

               winds his solicitude for the Catholic minor- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the bridge by a promise to more than one-
