               Now, ISÎI', II feel that these words apply,

               not only to the hon. members of the House, 
               <br />

               <br />
               people. I hope that these words will apply 
               <br />
               to those people who are residents or who 
               <br />

               cult for me to explain really the meaning 
               <br />
               of those words. And yet, happiness is 
               <br />
               something that we are all seeking after, 
               <br />
               that we are all trying to grasp, something 
               <br />
               we are endeavouring to obtain as much of 
               <br />
               as we can before we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shuifle</span> 01f this mortal

               Coil. And how can we expect to obtain this 
               <br />
               boon ? Will it come to us of itself ? Will 
               <br />
               lt. come to us spontaneously? Will it ﬂow 
               <br />
               upon us like a river and envelop us ? No, 
               <br />
               Sir, it will not come that way. It will 
               <br />
               not come except by preparation on our part, 
               <br />
               _ by elÏort on our part, to cultivate a soeial, 
               <br />
               friendly feeling between ourselves and those 
               <br />
               persons with whom we are brought in con- 
               <br />
               tact. And when ought we to begin to culti- 
               <br />
               vate this friendly feeling ? Is it when we 
               <br />
               reach the middle years of life ? Is it when 
               <br />
               we are on the downward incline ? No, I

               hold that that is not the time—though per- 
               <br />
               haps better late than never. 1 hold that 
               <br />
               the right time for us to cultivate, that 
               <br />
               friendly, social feeling which ought to exist 
               <br />
               between the people of our country is when

               <br />
               no place in my opinion better than the public

               school for boys to become acquainted with 
               <br />

               friendliness and sociability that it is so 
               <br />

               I am sure, Mr. Speaker, you will pardon

               that that same pleasant feeling continued 
               <br />
               between myself and the friends I made at 
               <br />
               school. When we reached the years of man- 
               <br />
               hood and dealt together in various <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ways,</span> 
               <br />
               it was always with a degree of conﬁdence 
               <br />
               in one another and in a friendly, social 
               <br />
               spirit. And that feeling lasts with us up to 
               <br />
               the present time, and .I am satisﬁed that it 
               <br />
               will continue so long as we live. Now, 
               <br />
               suppose there had been a separate school in 
               <br />
               that particular school section to which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">il</span> 
               <br />
               belonged, and in which 1 attended school. 
               <br />
               Had that been the case, no doubt these 
               <br />
               friends of mine would have attended the 
               <br />
               separate school and I would have attend- 
               <br />
               ed the public school. Possibly we might 
               <br />
               never have become acquainted at all. Or, 
               <br />
               we might have known one another simply 
               <br />
               as living in the same school section two or 
               <br />
               three miles apart—for I speak of rural 
               <br />
               schools altogether—and perhaps we might 
               <br />
               be a little acquainted. When we met each 
               <br />
               other on the country road it would be a 
               <br />
               cool nod of the head on the part of one 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> a formal ‘ good morning ; ’ and a cold 
               <br />
               nod of the head on the other side and an 
               <br />
               equally formal ‘ How do you do ’-—and that 
               <br />
               would be all the friendliness between us. 
               <br />
               There would not be the s0cial feeling and 
               <br />
               pleasantness that ought to exist between 
               <br />
               people of the same neighbourhood. And 
               <br />
               possibly this breaking up of interests might 
               <br />
               have led to mutual distrust and to a feel- 
               <br />
               ing on the part of each'that the other 
               <br />
               was only waiting an opportunity to do him 
               <br />
               an injury. But feelings like this should not 
               <br />
               exist ; and therefore, I hold that the public 
               <br />
               school is the place in which to bring the peo- 
               <br />
               ple of the rising generation together. I be- 
               <br />
               lieve that when boys are brought up in the 
               <br />
               public school together they become acquaint- 
               <br />
               ed with one another and there is a warm 
               <br />
               friendliness and sociability such -as ought to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exist</span> between them. And so, when they 
               <br />
               meet each other lon the country road there 
               <br />
               is a warm grasp of the hand and a ‘John 
               <br />
               how do you do ‘E’ And an answering hand 
               <br />
               (lasp with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the'warln</span> greeting, ‘ Charley. I 
               <br />
               i am glad to meet you.’ I hold that the 
               <br />
               separate school creates discord and irritation 
               <br />
               and unfriendliness, and that it strikes a 
               <br />
               blow at the very foundation of the public 
               <br />
