               When a petition of the legislature of a

               by a member of this House, I would think 
               <br />
               that was a very distinct calling of the

               tion. The right hon. gentleman is leader 
               <br />
               of the government, but he is also leader of 
               <br />
               this House. We always refer to him in

               is laid upon the table of the House of Com- 
               <br />
               mons, I would very respectfully submit that 
               <br />
               it is called to the attention of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment just as effectively as if a copy were 
               <br />
               sent to the government direct. I do not 
               <br />
               know of What use i-t would otherwise be to 
               <br />
               present such a petition to parliament. All 
               <br />
               of us know that legislation of that kind 
               <br />
               could only be initiated by the government, 
               <br />
               and it is idle to present any such peti- 
               <br />
               tion to parliament unless it is intended by 
               <br />
               so doing to bring it to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attention«of</span> 
               <br />
               the government in order that they may

               initiate the legislation necessary to carry 
               <br />
               out the request. I think my right hon. 
               <br />
               friend, on looking carefully over that por- 
               <br />
               tion of his remarks to which attention has 
               <br />
               been called, will see that the impression it 
               <br />
               left upon our minds, certainly the impression 
               <br />
               left upon my own mind, was that he had 
               <br />
               no knowledge whatever of the resOlutions of 
               <br />
               the Manitoba legislature except what he had 
               <br />
               derived from the public press of the coun- 
               <br />
               try. I have no doubt that the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman made that statement in the most 
               <br />
               perfect good faith, but at the same time 
               <br />
               it' was hardly accurate under the circum-

               stances.

               Sir WI‘L-FRID LAURIER. If I may be 
               <br />
               permitted, Mr. Speaker, to reply to my 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bon.</span> friend, I must say that when I spoke 
               <br />
               I had no knowledge of those resolutions 
               <br />
               except what I had derived from the press 
               <br />
               of the country. It turns out now that a 
               <br />
               petition was laid on the table of this 
               <br />
               House. I have no recollection of that and 
               <br />
               I doubt if any one else has any recollection 
               <br />
               of it or took much interest in it; because 
               <br />
               dozens ot petitions are presented to ‘the 
               <br />
               House to which very little attention is paid, 
               <br />
               and unless my attention were specially 
               <br />
               called to it, I would probably know nothing 
               <br />
               about it. But the executive government 
               <br />
               of Manitoba never took any action on this 
               <br />
               matter until the month of January, 1905.

               wish to say that the tenor of my remarks
