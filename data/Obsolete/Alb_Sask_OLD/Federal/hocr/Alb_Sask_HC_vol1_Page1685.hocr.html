               congratulated on the change of tone which

               the moderate presentatiou of the amend-

               very immoderate presentation and support 
               <br />
               of the amendment placed before the House 
               <br />
               on Tuesday last. It will be observed that 
               <br />
               our friends who are opposing the distribu- 
               <br />
               tion are climbing down at the rate of about 
               <br />
               one a day. When they proposed their amend- 
               <br />
               ment on Tuesday last they claimed an in- 
               <br />
               equality of distribution as between 15 and 
               <br />
               10, and now the inequality claimed by the

               amendment placed before the committee isl 
               <br />
               an inequality of one. A climb down of fourl

               <br />
               friend, the leader of the opposition, in re- 
               <br />
               ply to myself last night, rejected the in- 
               <br />
               stance that I had given 0f differences in 
               <br />
               the populations of different constituencies in 
               <br />
               the east on the ground that these differences 
               <br />
               arose or were occasioned by reason of limit- 
               <br />
               ations, not connected with population, such 
               <br />
               as county boundaries and other matters. I 
               <br />
               certainly agree that that is the case and 
               <br />
               I ﬁnd no fault with it. It is a condition 
               <br />
               which prevails all over the Dominion, which 
               <br />
               has always prevailed and, I presume. must 
               <br />
               always prevail if the community of inter- 
               <br />
               ests and the well being of the people are to 
               <br />
               be considered as well as their mere numbers 
               <br />
               in the distribution of constituencies. If 
               <br />
               there ever was a case in which the original 
               <br />
               delimitation equal to county boundaries 
               <br />
               should be considered it is this case in which 
               <br />
               we are including the western part of the 
               <br />
               district of Athabaska in the new province of 
               <br />

               <br />
               new province has been under territorial or- 
               <br />
               ganization for some twenty or twenty-ﬁve 
               <br />
               or possibly thirty years. It has been repre- 
               <br />
               sented in this House for some 18 years. It 
               <br />

               ization as far as local conditions are con— 
               <br />
               cerned. As has been said by my hon. 
               <br />
               friend, the leader of the opposition, the 
               <br />
               country north of that line has had no repre- 
               <br />
               sentative in either House. It has been an 
               <br />
               entirely unorganized territory. Judging by

               comparison with conditions in these eastern

               <br />
               entirely. if ever there was a condition which

               should be observed in setting apart constitu— 
               <br />
               encies it is that condition when we are bring-

               organized district of greater area than the 
               <br />
               rest of the new province. Surely, that is a 
               <br />
               condition which is worthy of special consid- 
               <br />
               eration. Surely it relieves us from the nec— 
               <br />
               cessity of making our distribution by form— 
               <br />
               ing a checkerboard and dropping it down 
               <br />
               upon the country. If ever there was a time 
               <br />
               when special conditions demanded special 
               <br />
               consideration it is at the time of the intro- 
               <br />
               duction of the district of Athabaska into the 
               <br />
               new province of Alberta. Is there a dispar- 
               <br />
               ity of population ? My hon friend, the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition, does not accept <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>

               statement which I have placed before the

               at the time.

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I said that I did not

               think there was sufﬁcient information to 
               <br />
               justify the hon. minister in coming to that

               come to that conclusion. I went on to say 
               <br />
