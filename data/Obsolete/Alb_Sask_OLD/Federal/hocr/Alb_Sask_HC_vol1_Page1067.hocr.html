               was very much impressed with their ad-

               the best addresses I have heard; and after

               the rock of the constitution in 1896 when 
               <br />
               he would not allow Manitoba to be coerced,

               I do so because I believe that the bounda-

               ries of the new provnces are wisely marked

               <br />

               <br />

               good it has done in the country. In fact it 
               <br />
               has done much harm. The bad feeling
