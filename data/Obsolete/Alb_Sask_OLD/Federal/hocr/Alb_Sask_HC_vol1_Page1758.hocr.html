               Mr. R. L. BURDEN. I would like to have

               my right hon. friend quote any portion of 
               <br />

               claims that position I accept it at once. If

               my hon. friend says we are bound consti-

               is clear upon that point. I understand we

               are bound constitutionally to adopt that 
               <br />

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I have stated over 
               <br />
               and over again in this House, at least 
               <br />
               twenty times, I would think, that in my 
               <br />
               opinion we are obliged to apply to the new 
               <br />
               province the provisions of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act regarding the distribution of 
               <br />
               legislative powers.

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. That is not a 
               <br />
               very, very categorical answer, I think. That 
               <br />
               is rather equivocating upon this subject. 
               <br />
               We are bound to have a distribution of le- 
               <br />
               gislative powers, certainly. But, what is 
               <br />
               the legislative power of these new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces in regard to education ? Is it abso— 
               <br />
               lute or is it not absolute ? Is it absolute or 
               <br />
               is it limited ? In my estimation it is limited. 
               <br />
               Does my hon. friend say the contrary ?
