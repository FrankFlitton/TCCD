               the government which refused to give the

               minority their rights, is the one who should

               <br />
               16, No. 1 and clause 16, No. 2. Clause 16, 
               <br />
               No. 1 was crystallizing into the constitution 
               <br />

               day in the Northwest Territories. There 
               <br />
               was some doubt as to the interpretation of 
               <br />
               that clause. Some people thought we were 
               <br />
               going to restore in that way <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">what'</span> existed 
               <br />
               before 1892. That was not the intention. 
               <br />
               The intention was simply to crystallize into 
               <br />
               the constitution what was in existence to- 
               <br />
               day, and in order to make it clear, in order 
               <br />
               that we should not force that minority to go 
               <br />
               before the courts, we declared in the most 
               <br />
               unequivocal way what was the law and 
               <br />
               what was the protection that the minority 
               <br />
               was going to receive. That is our position. 
               <br />
               _My hon. friend from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) 
               <br />
               moved a resolution. It is very easy to blame 
               <br />
               those who are at the helm of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁairs.</span> It is 
               <br />
               very easy to throw on them all sorts of sus- 
               <br />
               picion, but if my hon. friend reads his own 
               <br />
               motion and if that motion was going before 
               <br />
               the courts perhaps he would ﬁnd out before 
               <br />
               the courts that that motion was not at all 
               <br />
               in this way protecting the minority. We 
               <br />
               heard the argument of my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Jacques Cartier <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Monk), and I am in- 
               <br />
               clined to believe that that hon. member was 
               <br />
               right to a very large extent in that respect. 
               <br />
               The motion of my hon. friend is alleged to 
               <br />
               be for the purpose of protecting the rights 
               <br />
               of the minority with respect to denomina— 
               <br />
               tional schools. But where are there deno- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">minational</span> schools in the law now existing ? 
               <br />
               Are there any schools of that kind in the 
               <br />
               Territories to-day? There are not, and my 
               <br />
               hon. friend, instead of throwing suspicion 
               <br />
               upon men who have got just as much <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pa—</span> 
               <br />
               triotism as he has—because I am not ready 
               <br />
               to admit that he has the monopoly of 
               <br />
               virtue in that respect—should give credit 
               <br />
               to others for sincerity in their views. I am 
               <br />
               not going to east any suspicion upon his mo— 
               <br />
               tives. I will be more charitable than he. 
               <br />
               I am not going to make all sorts of asser- 
               <br />
               tions with regard to those who differ from 
               <br />
               me, but shall al'ways discuss the question

               Mr. BERGERON. To those who do not

               just had an example of it in this harangue

               member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton), and my 
               <br />
               hon. friend the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Minister</span> of Inland Revenue. 
               <br />
               who ﬁnds himself in the same humiliating 
               <br />
               plight. Not being able to controvert this 
               <br />
               amendment, the Minister of Justice played 
               <br />
               upon words and tried to cast ridicule on it. 
               <br />
               Then my hon. friend the Minister of Inland 
               <br />
               Revenue is very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anxious</span> to have some in— 
               <br />
               formation. He does not quite understand 
               <br />
               where I want to go, but he himself is pre- 
               <br />
               pared, in company with the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice, to vote with both hands for the 
               <br />
               amendment dictated to them by the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Brandon (Mr. S-ifton). The 
               <br />
               Minister of Inland Revenue is accustomed 
               <br />
               to go on the hustings of the province of Que- 
               <br />
               bec, and he has his plan of campaign cut 
               <br />
               and dried. When this question comes to be 
               <br />
               discussed before the people he will say to 
               <br />
               them: The Prime Minister was devoured 
               <br />
               with a desire to give the Catholic minority 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territories all the rights 
               <br />
               and privileges to which they were entitled. 
               <br />
               But Mr. Borden and Dr. Sproule—those bad 
               <br />
