               sent lies immediately west and to the north 
               <br />
               of the province of Manitoba. It includes 
               <br />
               that portion of the district of Saskatchewan 
               <br />
               which has not been included in the new 
               <br />
               province of Saskatchewan, and which has 
               <br />
               been strongly contended .by hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               opposite should be included within the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Manitoba. Now, Mr. Speaker, a 
               <br />
               great deal has been said during this debate 
               <br />
               about extending the boundaries of Manitoba, 
               <br />
               and as any extension of these boundary 
               <br />
               lines, either westward or northward, would 
               <br />
               take in a portion of the district I represent 
               <br />
               in this parliament, I think I can fairly 
               <br />
               claim the right to say a few words on that 
               <br />
               subject, although it is a matter which has 
               <br />
               nothing to do with the Bill now before the 
               <br />
               House.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               It has already been stated that the peo- 
               <br />
               ple of Assiniboia and Saskatchewan object 
               <br />
               to any extension westward of Manitoba’s 
               <br />
               boundary. I can speak on this matter for 
               <br />
               the people I represent immediately to the 
               <br />
               west of Manitoba, and I am certain they 
               <br />
               strongly object to being taken into the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Manitoba. Several reasons are 
               <br />
               given for this objection, among which are 
               <br />
               that by joining Manitoba they would have 
               <br />
               no advantage which they would not have by 
               <br />
               forming part of the province of Saskatche- 
               <br />
               wan. and they would be subject to heavy 
               <br />
               taxation. By starting in as a new province 
               <br />
               they start free of debt, by joining Manitoba 
               <br />
               they would become liable to a present actual 
               <br />
               debt and a possible future liability of some 
               <br />
               $20,000,000 or $25,000,000, and they can see 
               <br />
               no good reason for assuming their share of 
               <br />
               this liability when they would not be getting 
               <br />
               any corresponding advantage. Another rea- 
               <br />
               son is that in Manitoba, as a rule, taxes are 
               <br />
               higher than in the Territories, and I think 
               <br />
               there is a pretty general feeling <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thatgthe</span> 
               <br />
               government of Manitoba has adopted a 
               <br />
               policy which tends towards extravagance 
               <br />
               and recklessness, which in the near future 
               <br />
               may lead to direct taxation. Whether or 
               <br />
               not the people are justiﬁed in entertaining 
               <br />
               these views, I do not say; but I do say 
               <br />
               that from contact with the people of my dis- 
               <br />
               trict I know that the feeling does exist, and 
               <br />
               I can only add to what other hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men have already said on this subject, that 
               <br />
               it is too late in the day to think of increasing 
               <br />
               the size of Manitoba by taking in that part

               of the Liberal party, but of the Conservative

               John Macdonald and his government that it 
               <br />

               <br />
               want to enter my protest right here and now 
               <br />
               against that being done. The people in my

               district to the north of Manitoba do not 
               <br />
               want to go in with Manitoba. Of that I 
               <br />
               have proof. for since the publication of this 
               <br />
               Bill now before the House I have received 
               <br />
               petitions from these very people, asking 
               <br />
               that they be not put into Manitoba, but be 
               <br />
               included in the new province of Saskatche-

               to force these people into a political union

               be allowed to cast in their lot with the 
               <br />

               <br />

               that they are entitled to be heard on this
