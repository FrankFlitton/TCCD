               So, Mr. Speaker, you can exactly see the 
               <br />
               game. It is the old game of 1896—in the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec the cry will be that Sir 
               <br />

               <br />
               compatriots, has protected their rights; he 
               <br />
               has not given way at all; the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) successfully con- 
               <br />
               cealed the intended meaning of the law 
               <br />
               even from the expert eyes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior. On the other hand, Mr. 
               <br />
               Sifton and his colleagues from the west 
               <br />
               will go to the people there and point out 
               <br />
               that the ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. 
               <br />
               Sifton). brave man that he was, clapped a 
               <br />
               pistol to the head of his leader and com- 
               <br />
               pelled him to yield on clause 16, though 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice had successfully 
               <br />
               deluded all the western members, yet, when 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tax-Minister</span> of the Interior appeared on 
               <br />
               the scene, his shrewd eyes detected what 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice desired to incorpor— 
               <br />
               ate in the clause, and made them remedy 
               <br />
               it, making amendments in accordance with 
               <br />
               his views. I say it is the old game of 1896 
               <br />
               played over again—one cry in one province 
               <br />
               and an entirely different cry in another pro- 
               <br />

               Now, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l</span> was somewhat surprised to hear 
               <br />
               the hon. gentlemen on the other side from

               sure, considering that they were the great 
               <br />
               sticklers for provincial rights in days gone 
               <br />
               by. Only a few years ago a Bill was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intro»</span> 
               <br />
               duced in this House to create a Dominion 
               <br />
               medical council. The object was to allow 
               <br />
               our medical practitioners to appear before 
               <br />
               the council and boards of examiners that 
               <br />
               would allow them the privilege of practising 
               <br />
               in any province of the Dominion without 
               <br />
               being compelled to submit to an examina- 
               <br />
               tion in the respective provinces. One result 
               <br />
               of this would have been that we should have 
               <br />
               had the privilege of practising without re 
               <br />
               gistration in the motherland, a privilege 
               <br />
               that is now denied us, because we have no 
               <br />
               degree for the Dominion of Canada. It was 
               <br />
               provided in this Bill that whenever ﬁve or 
               <br />
               more provinces passed legislation concurring 
               <br />
               with this Bill the measure should become 
               <br />
               law. And whence arose the opposition that 
               <br />
               prevented the passing of the Bill in that 
               <br />
               form? Why, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> these hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               from the province of Quebec, who took 
               <br />
               strong grounds against the measure, be- 
               <br />
               cause, as they contended, it was an invasion 
               <br />
               of provincial rights. They were so jealous 
               <br />
               of their provincial rights, they were so de- 
               <br />
               sirous that no one should practise in their 
               <br />
               province without passing their provincial 
               <br />

               determined; it was the class of speech which 
               <br />
               the true friend of the Northwest felt it proper 
               <br />
