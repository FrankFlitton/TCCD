               Mr. SPROULE. I can give the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman some information in connection with 
               <br />
               this. I can refer him to the fact that I 
               <br />
               think in the second or third year I was in 
               <br />
               this parliament the people of Quebec came 
               <br />
               up here and petitioned the then government 
               <br />
               to give them sufﬁcient money to take them 
               <br />
               to the maritime provinces or to the far west 
               <br />
               and what was the reason? That where 
               <br />
               there was a community of Protestants years 
               <br />
               ago, there was then only an odd one, and 
               <br />
               they had become so few and scattered that 
               <br />
               they were neither able to support separate 
               <br />
               schools nor churches, and their families 
               <br />
               must go—

               there were Protestant communities years 
               <br />
               ago there were scarcely a dozen families 
               <br />
               then, and where 50 or 100 could keep up a 
               <br />
               church years ago there were then only 10 
               <br />
               or 12 families. They said that their farms 
               <br />
               were bought out by Roman Catholics. When- 
               <br />
               ever a Protestant was willing .to sell his
