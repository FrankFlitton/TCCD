               <br />
               friend has understood exactly. It is pro- 
               <br />
               bably my fault; it is probably my mistake; 
               <br />
               I speak so badly that perhaps I have been 
               <br />
               misunderstood by my hon. friend. The 
               <br />
               point which I wanted to make is this, that 
               <br />
               it has been asserted time and again in the 
               <br />
               papers, for instance in the Toronto ‘ News’ 
               <br />
               of the 1st April, that the compact had're— 
               <br />
               ference purely and simply to both Canadas. 
               <br />
               That has been asserted almost every day. 
               <br />
               I wanted to prove by the book which I 
               <br />
               have just quoted and by the motion which 
               <br />
               was made by Sir Alexander Gait and 
               <br />
               which was assented to by the delegates 
               <br />
               from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick that 
               <br />
               a system of separate schools should not 
               <br />
               only be maintained in the provinces which 
               <br />
               were then entering the union, but that a 
               <br />
               system of separate schools should be main- 
               <br />
               tained that was later on, even after con- 
               <br />
               federation, embodied in the laws and that 
               <br />
               future provinces in consequence should be 
               <br />
               bound also to maintain a system of sep- 
               <br />
               arate schools whether they should estab- 
               <br />
               lish these separate schools at the union or 
               <br />
               whether they should establish them later 
               <br />
               on. That has been embodied in the British 
               <br />
               North America Act and that is the reason 
               <br />

               Act? Does it mean that the provincial 
               <br />
               legislature shall have the right to exclu- 
               <br />
               sively make laws in regard to education, 
               <br />
               and that at the same time these laws should 
               <br />
               be submitted to the federal parliament con- 
               <br />
               trol under section 93 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act? That is the point which I have 
               <br />
               not been able to understand. It is true, as I 
               <br />
               have said, that my hon. friend is very clear 
               <br />
               in the latter part of his amendment, but 
               <br />
               he does not seem to be so clear in the quali- 
               <br />
               ﬁcation which he gives to these powers. 
               <br />
               What does he mean by ‘subject to and in 
               <br />
               accordance with the provisions of the Bri- 
               <br />
               tish North America Act’? Does he mean 
               <br />
               that section 93 will apply or does he mean 
               <br />
               that section 93 shall not apply as far as 
               <br />
               education is concerned? I would like to 
               <br />
               put to him a question to know exactly whe- 
               <br />
               ther I understand the exact meaning of 
               <br />
               his amendment. Suppose that his amend- 
               <br />
               ment should carry, suppose the legislature 
               <br />
               of the province of Saskatchewan should 
               <br />
               pass a law creating separate schools—could 
               <br />
               this legislature vary, or decrease, or abolish 
               <br />
               these separate schools? I do not know 
               <br />
