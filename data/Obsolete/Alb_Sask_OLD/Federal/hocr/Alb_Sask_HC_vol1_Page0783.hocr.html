               ment and say that the time had fully come 
               <br />
               for the granting of autonomy to the new 
               <br />
               provinces in the Northwest? Thus, for the 
               <br />
               last ﬁve years this question has again and 
               <br />
               again been brought to the attention of this 
               <br />
               government and this government has known 
               <br />
               that at some very early date it would be 
               <br />
               necessary to legislate for the purpose of 
               <br />
               giving to these two new provinces the char- 
               <br />
               ter under which they would subsequently 
               <br />
               be governed. Has the government made 
               <br />
               the preparation that was necessary for such 
               <br />
               an important step? Has the government 
               <br />
               made any attempt to ascertain what we in 
               <br />
               this parliament may legally do ? Now we 
               <br />
               are face to face with -a constitutional dif- 
               <br />
               ﬁculty and the government have apparently 
               <br />
               said: We shall pass the Bill and test its 
               <br />
               constitutionality afterwards. Is that a dig- 
               <br />
               niﬁed position for parliament to take ? 
               <br />
               I should judge not. I think that the govern— 
               <br />
               ment is certainly blamable for the rais- 
               <br />
               ing of this constitutional difﬁculty. Seeing 
               <br />
               that constitutional authorities 0f the highest 
               <br />

               <br />
               ment in respect to this legislation, this gov- 
               <br />
               ernment should have submitted a series of 
               <br />
               questions to the highest judicial tribunal 
               <br />
               and should have obtained from them a ﬁnd— 
               <br />
               ing so that we would be relieved from the 
               <br />
               necessary anxiety of passing legislation, the 
               <br />
               legality of which is at present greatly in 
               <br />
               doubt. If I may offer a suggestion to the 
               <br />
               members of the government, a suggestion 
               <br />
               which has been made before, it would be 
               <br />
               that it is not too late for them to draw up a 
               <br />
               series of questions as to just what this par- 
               <br />
               liament may or may not legally under im-

               <br />
               this House. It is not too late for the gov— 
               <br />
               ernment now to submit such a series of 
               <br />
               questions to the highest judicial tribunal. 
               <br />
               Having obtained a ﬁnding they could come 
               <br />
               before this House and say : This we can do 
               <br />
               and this we cannot do. Let this be done 
               <br />
               and we will then make good law. And so, 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, 'I feel that the ﬁrst words that 
               <br />

               <br />
               placed this House in a very delicate and a
