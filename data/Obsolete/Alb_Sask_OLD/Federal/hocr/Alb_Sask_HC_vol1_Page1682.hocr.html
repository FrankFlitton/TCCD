               the population shown by the census of 1901,

               he has placed before the House show that 
               <br />
               there are more people in the south than in

               to the ﬁgures of the census of 1901 there 
               <br />
               are more people in the north than in the

               <br />
               The ﬁgures show that in 23 constituencies 
               <br />
               in the old district of Athabaska there were, 
               <br />
               in 1901, 69,441 people. Now, take off the 
               <br />
               constituency of Red Deer which, for the pur— 
               <br />

               2.009 being eliminated, would leave 67,432. 
               <br />
               Dividing that population by 22 constituen- 
               <br />
               cies, and it gives you a little more than 3,000 
               <br />

               <br />
               Deer you have about 10 members, and if you 
               <br />
               apply the same process to the 11 constitu— 
               <br />
               encies south you would have something like 
               <br />
               12 members. The population of the 11 con- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stituencies</span> north of Red Deer was 36,398, 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cies</span> south was 31,000. Therefore, if you 
               <br />
               divide by the unit of 3.000 the 11 constituen— 
               <br />
               cies south of Red Deer that will give you 
               <br />
               about 10, and if you apply the same cal—

               we have not been going on the basis of
