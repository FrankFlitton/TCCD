               Mr. W. F. MACLEAN. I want to tell 
               <br />
               the Minister of Finance that he will soon 
               <br />
               have to give his attention to some kind of 
               <br />
               legislation regulating the trust funds of. 
               <br />
               insurance companies, and especially life in— 
               <br />
               surance companies. He will need to legis- 
               <br />
               late wi-th the view of getting a higher grade 
               <br />
               of securities for these funds and insisting 
               <br />
               on more frequent publicationof the in- 
               <br />
               vestments. We need a law that any in— 
               <br />
               surairce company making an investment 
               <br />
               of any special fund to the amount of, say 
               <br />
               $100,000, ought to make it public within a 
               <br />
               month after the transaction. It is a ques- 
               <br />
               tion in which a good deal of interest is at 
               <br />
               present being taken. Only to-day I was 
               <br />
               talking with a gentleman who is rather 
               <br />
               well posted on the subject and he said that 
               <br />
               that was one question which would have 
               <br />
               to be taken up at a very early date. I re- 
               <br />
               ferred to it incidentally the other day and 
               <br />
               I am again bringing it up now for it is a 
               <br />
               matter which is well worthy the attention 
               <br />
               of the minister, namely the revision of the 
               <br />
               law in regard to trust funds of insurance 
               <br />
               companies and some method of raising the 
               <br />
               standard of these investments. There should 
               <br />
               be a reform also in the direction of the pub- 
               <br />
               lication. at frequent dates, of any large in- 
               <br />
               vestment made by any insurance company 
               <br />
               so that the policy-holders who are really 
               <br />
               the ones interested in these great trust 
               <br />
               funds, should know the way that money is 
               <br />
               invested.

               Mr. FIELDING. While it is rather broad— 
               <br />
               ening the question, I may say that my 
               <br />
               difﬁculty so far has been in keeping the 
               <br />
               standard up to the point at which we now 
               <br />
               have it placed, because insurance compa- 
               <br />
               nies have frequently made representations 
               <br />
               to me that our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rest—ﬁctions</span> in regard to 
               <br />
               investments are so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">s«‘~:ere</span> that they cannot

               <br />
               them. and in consequence they are not able 
               <br />
               to oiÏer as good terms in some cases as are 
               <br />
               offered by other companies with wider lib- 
               <br />
               erty of investment. I have so far resisted 
               <br />
               the movement to make the standard any 
               <br />
               lower than it is at present. When we re- 
               <br />
               strict the investing power it follows that 
               <br />
               they get a low rate of interest.

               that these outside companies are able to
