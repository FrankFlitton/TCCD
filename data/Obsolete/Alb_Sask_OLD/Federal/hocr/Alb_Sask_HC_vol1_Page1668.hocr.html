               gentleman opposite are prepared to legislate 
               <br />
               fairly, this House should not be held in

               encies and give the honest, intelligent voter

               the same right and political power in one

               That is all we on this side are contending 
               <br />
               for, but I think in all fairness we should 
               <br />
               protest against this distribution as made 
               <br />
               here. I understand that the voting white 
               <br />
               population of the .Athabaska district is only 
               <br />
               about 200. I am not sure that this is the 
               <br />
               correct ﬁgure but it is about that. They 
               <br />
               have only one post ofﬁce with a revenue of 
               <br />
               less than $100 per annum, and still they are 
               <br />
               going to outweigh some of those districts 
               <br />
               with a large population, many of them from 
               <br />
               the older provinces, taking an intelligent 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> view and knowing all about our political 
               <br />
               institutions, having the same aspirations as 
               <br />
               the people of the older provinces. I under- 
               <br />
               stand that the settlers from the older pro- 
               <br />
               vinces are largely in the southern districts, 
               <br />
               whereas the Europeon elements are largely 
               <br />
               in the north. Without drawing any ‘Red 
               <br />
               Deer’ line I wish to point out that in all 
               <br />
               fairness this should be decided upon the 
               <br />
               principle of representation by population, 
               <br />
               and that if there is to be one man one vote 
               <br />
               that vote should have one value, and having 
               <br />
               decided on that I think we could very easily 
               <br />
               draw a plan that would be suitable and 
               <br />
               agreeable to both sides of the House. I 
               <br />
               trust that hon. gentlemen will not persist in 
               <br />
               pushing this matter through in its present 
               <br />
               form. Let them get both sides together 
               <br />
               and draw up a schedule that would be fair- 
               <br />
               ly satisfactory to all the people concerned.

               The Minister of the Interior ﬁnally stated 
               <br />
               that he was ready to listen to the views of 
               <br />
               the west if Mr. Haultain woulddohis duty, 
               <br />

               <br />
               Mr. Haultain would call it together. _That 
               <br />
               seems to me a very vain boast. We have 
               <br />

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. Probably they 
               <br />
               are around the missions. Since the com- 
               <br />
               mencement of the session the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Strathcona (Mr. Peter Talbot) has exer- 
               <br />
               cised special diligence in order to collect 
               <br />
               information and he has given information as- 
               <br />
               to the character of the development of that 
               <br />
               country since 1901. The member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Strath-r</span> 
               <br />
               cona stated yesterday evening that in Atha- ' 
               <br />
               baska there were found to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">24</span> stores, 13 
               <br />
               churches, 7 steamboats, 4 sawmills, 2 or 3 
               <br />
               planing mill-s, 1 ﬂour mill. On the Peace 
               <br />
               River he stated there was 18 stores, I think, 
               <br />
               20 churches, 2 ﬂour mills, 3 or 4 saw-mills, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> 
               <br />
               and I think 2 planing mills; I forget the 
               <br />
               number of steamboats plying on the river. 
               <br />
               This goes to show that there is now a 
               <br />
               nucleus of population. You have there all 
               <br />
               the primary elements of civilization, 
               <br />
               churches, schools, stores, mills, and when
