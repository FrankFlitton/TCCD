               <br />

               <br />
               accustomed to think of it, the word ‘Pro- 
               <br />

               Well, I am not talking for those who are 
               <br />
               in favour of public schools when I call the 
               <br />
               attention of the House to these views. I 
               <br />
               want this speech to be translated and to go 
               <br />
               through the province of Quebec because my 
               <br />
               hon. friends who are from that province will 
               <br />
               go back to the people and say: We voted 
               <br />
               against the amendment of the hon. leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition, we were opposed to the 
               <br />
               amendment the object of which was to keep 
               <br />
               the minority out of their schools ; we voted 
               <br />
               for the party that has at its head the men 
               <br />
               who want to render justice to the minority ; 
               <br />
               we voted for the motion of the right hon. 
               <br />
               leader of the government. That is why the 
               <br />
               hon. Minister of Finance has'said that these 
               <br />
               schools to all intents and purposes are 
               <br />
               national, non-sectarian schools. The Min-
