               wise consulted in respect to these four

               planks ? I for one refuse to take that view, 
               <br />
               because I do not think the ex—Minister of

               ferred to—day to the fact that the opposition

               are making a great deal of capital out of 
               <br />

               <br />
               Minister of the Interior. Let me point out 
               <br />
               to my hon. friend that the Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior has not been in this House during 
               <br />
               this session. He came in after the intro- 
               <br />
               duction of this Bill. Let me remind the 
               <br />
               premier that since 1896 we have had minis- 
               <br />
               ter after minister absent from their duties 
               <br />
               during the session, and no one has been a 
               <br />
               greater sinner in that respect than the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of the Interior. To—day he is seen 
               <br />
               passing by this chamber, paying attention 
               <br />
               for a moment or two to the proceedings 
               <br />
               here, but then, in his high and lofty way, 
               <br />
               he retires from the chamber and allows the 
               <br />
               members to discuss these important matters 
               <br />
               in his absence. It is high time that these hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen fully understood that it is their 
               <br />
               duty to attend in this chamber and give us 
               <br />
               the beneﬁt of their advice on these import- 
               <br />
               ant matters. If the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               and his friends were correct in 1895, when 
               <br />
               they said that it was important for ministers 
               <br />
               to be in their places, they should take a 
               <br />
               little of their own medicine to-day, and see 
               <br />
               that their ministers are in their places in 
               <br />
               this House.
