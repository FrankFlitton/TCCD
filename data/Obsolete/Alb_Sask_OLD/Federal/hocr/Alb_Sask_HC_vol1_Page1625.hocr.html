               he suggested that Mr. Hanl-tain should try 
               <br />
               to get amicable arrangements as to the

               Mr. LAKE. Before I came to Ottawa 
               <br />
               in December, I received a letter from Mr. 
               <br />
               Ila-ultaiu similar to a letter which, I un- 
               <br />
               derstood, had been sent to every member 
               <br />
               from the Northwest, inviting us to meet in 
               <br />
               conference in Ottawa during the discus- 
               <br />
               sion of the Autonomy Bill. I understood 
               <br />
               that it was in pursuance of that policy 
               <br />
               that we were invited on two or three oc- 
               <br />
               casions to meet together. I was present 
               <br />
               at two meetings in room 48. The only 
               <br />
               questions seriously discussed were the 
               <br />
               possession of our lands and mines, and the 
               <br />
               boundary between the two provinces. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cer-I</span> 
               <br />
               tainly nothing whatever was said in my 
               <br />
               presence in regard to the constituencies.

               <br />
               and over again that the Prime Minister 
               <br />

               I was not present at the last meeting. But
