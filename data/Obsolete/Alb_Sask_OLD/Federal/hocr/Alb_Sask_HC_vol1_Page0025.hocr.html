               Dear Sir Wilfrid,—After giving my best con- 
               <br />
               sideration to the matters which we discussed 
               <br />
               last evening, I have arrived at the conclusion 
               <br />
               that it is impossible for me to continue in 
               <br />
               ofﬁce under present circumstances, and that it 
               <br />
               is better for all concerned that I should act at 
               <br />
               once. I therefore beg to tender my resignation 
               <br />
               as a member of the government. I trust that 
               <br />
               the unhappy necessity which has arisen will not 
               <br />
               in the least impair the friendship with which 
               <br />
               you have been kind enough to honour me.

               <br />
               It was necessary that conferences should 
               <br />
               take place with members of parliament 
               <br />

               <br />
               These conferences were unavoidably post-

               poned until after the beginning of the new

               year, by reason of the absence of the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister, who, after the general election, 
               <br />
               was compelled to take a short rest, and was 
               <br />
               therefore absent from the country. Shortly 
               <br />
               before the time ﬁxed for holding these con-

               ferences 1 was compelled by my own state 
               <br />
               of health to leave Ottawa, and was-there— 
               <br />
               fore unablc to be present at the discussions 
               <br />
               which took place. Before leaving I dis- 
               <br />
               cussed with the Prime Minister most of the 
               <br />
               subjects that necessarily required to be 
               <br />
               dealt with in the Bill which was to be in- 
               <br />
               troduced, and so far as I was able to do so 
               <br />
               at that time, I communicated my views to 
               <br />
               him upon the various subjects. I may say 
               <br />
               that when I went away I did not anticipate 
               <br />
               that it would be considered necessary to 
               <br />
               introduce the Bill for creating the new <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro.</span> 
               <br />
               vinces. before I returned. As members of 
               <br />
               the House are aware, I returned to the 
               <br />
               capital on Thursday afternoon. I immedi- 
               <br />
               ately took occasion to read carefully the 
               <br />
               speech which the right hon. the Prime Min— 
               <br />
               ister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) had delivered in 
               <br />
               introducing the Bill. I regretted that in the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman’s address I found some 
               <br />
               principles enunciated with which I am un— 
               <br />
               able to agree. On Friday, the next day

               after I returned, at the earliest possible 
               <br />
               moment, I procured a copy of the education-
