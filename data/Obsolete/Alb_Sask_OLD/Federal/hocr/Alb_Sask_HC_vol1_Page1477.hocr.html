               must say to my hon. friend that there are 
               <br />
               two classes of exemptions in this Bill. 
               <br />
               There is exemption in respect to the pro- 
               <br />
               perty of the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway and 
               <br />
               there is also’ exemption of their lands. The 
               <br />
               exemption .on their lands is in process of 
               <br />
               extinguishment; that exemption is to last 
               <br />
               only twenty years, and it is in process of 
               <br />
               extinguishment now. We have had a judi- 
               <br />
               cial decision on that and in the course of 
               <br />
               twenty years that exemption will become 
               <br />
               extinct. 
               <br />

               But the exemptions of the stations and the 
               <br />
               station grounds, the workshops, buildings, 
               <br />
               rolling stock, capital stock, road-bed, &amp;c., 
               <br />
               are there, and there for ever. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend says this is a grievance which ought 
               <br />
               to be remedied. There is only .one of two 
               <br />
               ways in which it can be remedied ; that is, 
               <br />
               by the government negotiating and agreeing 
               <br />
               to pay a certain sum to the Canadian Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               Railway Company, or by this parliament 
               <br />
               passing a law to expropriate the exemption. 
               <br />
               I do not say that we may not have to come 
               <br />
               to that. I dare say that it is possible 
               <br />
               and more than possible that we may have to 
               <br />
               come to that eventually. But that question 
               <br />
               has nothing at all to do with the present 
               <br />
               legislation; it stands quite apart from this 
               <br />
               legislation. We have been petitioned by 
               <br />
               the legislature of the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               to grant them provincial autonomy ; we are 
               <br />
               in process of doing so ; but they must take 
               <br />
               it such as it is, with all the exemptions 
               <br />
               created by law. So long as we comply with 
               <br />
               their request, we can only give them what 
               <br />
               it is in our power to give them.

               <br />
               the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway Company will 
               <br />
               answer us at once <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:,</span> We have a double ex- 
               <br />
               emption, the exemption from taxation by 
               <br />
               the Dominion and we value that at so much, 
               <br />
               say $1,000,000 or $2,000,000; we also have 
               <br />
               exemption from taxation by the province, 
               <br />
               and we value that at say $2,000,000 more. 
               <br />
               But my hon. friend from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">South</span> Lanark says 
               <br />
               the company have no exemption from taxa- 
               <br />
               tion so far as the province is concerned, 
               <br />
               and therefore if we negotiate with the com- 
               <br />
               pany, we would pay them for what they 
               <br />
               have not. We had better wait, then, until 
               <br />
               it is decided judicially whether the conten- 
               <br />
               tion of the hon. member for Lanark is right 
               <br />
               or not. Until such time as the courts de- 
               <br />
               cide, if they so decide, that the provisions 
               <br />
               so far as the province is concerned are null 
               <br />
               and void, we shall have so much less to pay 
               <br />
               to the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway Company 
               <br />
               than we would to-day if we entered into 
               <br />
