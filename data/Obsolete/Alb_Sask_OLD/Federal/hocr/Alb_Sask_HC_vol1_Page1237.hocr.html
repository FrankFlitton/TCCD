               <br />
               I did not know but that the right hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman had a preference for a summer ses- 
               <br />
               sion. The Prime Minister has already 
               <br />
               practically admitted that_a statement made 
               <br />
               by a member of this House in the constitu- 
               <br />
               ency of Mountain, in the province of Mani- 
               <br />
               toba, embodied a decision which would be 
               <br />
               accepted by the government. And that 
               <br />
               statement, speaking from recollect-ion, was 
               <br />
               that a portion of the territory not yet ap- 
               <br />
               propriated would be divided in this way; 
               <br />
               the line would run, I think from the north- 
               <br />
               east boundary of Manitoba, or some point 
               <br />
               near there, up Churchill river <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> Fort 
               <br />
               Churchill, then down the coast of Hudson 
               <br />
               bay to Weenisk river to Weenisk lake, then 
               <br />
               to Fishing lake at the boundary of the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Ontario and thence south to the 
               <br />
               49th parallel. This was to be the new 
               <br />
               boundary of the province of Manitoba. The 
               <br />
               portion of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> land to the north and west 
               <br />
               would go to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Saskatchewan</span> and the portion 
               <br />
               to the east would go to Ontario. That 
               <br />
               division, as not only one but two hon. 
               <br />
               members of the House stated, and as 
               <br />
               practically the Prime Minister has said 
               <br />
               would be adopted. The question that the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Qu’A-ppelle asks is this: 
               <br />
               Having decided upon that course, you must 
               <br />
               have come to some conclusion whether you 
               <br />
               will or will not, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> that portion of the ter- 
               <br />
               ritory to be handed over to Ontario, carry 
               <br />
               out exactly the same policy which you 
               <br />
               are carrying out with respect to these 
               <br />
               new provinces. In other words: You 
               <br />
               will add to the province of Ontario 
               <br />
               30,000 or 40,000 square miles of terri- 
               <br />
               tory. Will you reserve the public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">domain,</span> 
               <br />
               in these lands to this government, or 
               <br />
               will that domain pass over to be admi- 
               <br />
               nistered by the province of Ontario as other 
               <br />
               provincial lands of Ontario are administer- 
               <br />
               ed ? If you do hand this public domain over 
               <br />
               to Ontario, will or will you not adopt the 
               <br />
               same principle with regard to Manitoba? 
               <br />
               And, if you carry out the policy of trans- 
               <br />
               ferring the public domain to these two pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, how shall you make any exception 
               <br />
               in the case of the province of Saskatche- 
               <br />
               wan ? And, if you carry out that policy in 
               <br />
               the province of Saskatchewan in regard to 
               <br />
               the added territory, what reason can pos- 
               <br />
               sibly be given for withholding the lands in 
               <br />
               the remainder of the province ? It seems a 
               <br />
               very logical sequence, and I should think 
               <br />

               <br />
               the government. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:I</span> assume that practically 
               <br />
               the government will get out of it by not 
               <br />

               to the attention of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">member</span> for West 
               <br />
               Assiniboia (Mr. Scott). It relates to the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman’s attitude toward <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provincial</span> 
               <br />
               autonomy. I have a little reference to some 
               <br />
               remarks of his. He referred to a certain 
               <br />
               proposal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:1</span> made which was mentioned this 
               <br />
               afternoon. I said, in the ﬁrst place, that I 
               <br />
               thought the lands ought to be handed over 
               <br />
               to the control and administration of the 
               <br />
               provinces, I adverted to the arguments of 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister that that would be dan- 
               <br />
               gerous to the immigration policy of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:I</span> thought there should be no 
               <br />
               such danger, but I suggested that if the 
               <br />
               government were of opinion that there was 
               <br />
               such a danger, they might hand over the 
               <br />
               land of the province on certain stipula- 
               <br />
               tions with regard to free'homesteads, to 
               <br />
               which the consent of the people of the

               Mr. SCOTT. I may be permitted to say 
               <br />
               that when I made that reference to the sug- 
               <br />
               gestion of my hon. friend I was taking for 
               <br />
               the moment his point of view with regard 
               <br />
               to autonomy. He was taking the view 
               <br />
               that we must lay out the new provinces 
               <br />
               upon exactly the same basis as that on 
               <br />
               which the four <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">original</span> provinces entered 
               <br />
               confederation. For instance, they must be 
               <br />
               dealt with in a certain way with regard to 
               <br />
               education. He had a particular view 
               <br />
               in that matter. They must be dealt with 
               <br />
               so and so with regard to the lands, and in 
               <br />
               every particular, if I understood my hon. 
               <br />
               friend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might,</span> it was his view that this par- 
               <br />
               liament was not free to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deal</span> as it chose, 
               <br />
               but it must follow strictly certain lines 
               <br />
               Which are laid down in the British North
