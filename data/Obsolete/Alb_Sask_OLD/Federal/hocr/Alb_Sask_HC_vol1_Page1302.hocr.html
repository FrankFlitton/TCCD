               <br />

               <br />
               than it has been in the past, I certainly 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feel</span> that parliament should do so, be— 
               <br />
               cause I think it would be only reasonable 
               <br />
               that that part of Canada which lies west 
               <br />
               of the great lakes should have more than 
               <br />
               twenty-four members in the Senate, which 
               <br />
               would be the case if this scheme 'is carried 
               <br />
               into eﬂ‘ect. They will have under this ar- 
               <br />
               rangement twenty-four senators out ot‘ a 
               <br />
               total of ninety—six.

               Minister that the west will ultimately be

               <br />
               senators, like the three eastern groups at 
               <br />
               present. I think that the country lying

               west of the great lakes should ultimately 
               <br />

               <br />
