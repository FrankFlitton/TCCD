               of these important Acts. When a most im-

               unit in desiring that their province should 
               <br />
               be extended to the west, when it was an 
               <br />
               undeniable fact that a little province 73,000 
               <br />
               square miles in size, of which 10,000 miles 
               <br />
               were under water, was to be placed side by.

               the legislature of Manitoba and the people 
               <br />

               <br />
               might be placed on an equal footing with 
               <br />
               these new provinces, the one sufﬁcient an— 
               <br />
               swer that the right hon. gentleman gave 
               <br />
               was Why the people of the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories through their legislature have op- 
               <br />
               posed such a claim. And inasmuch as the 
               <br />
               people of the west have opposed it the re- 
               <br />
               quest of Manitoba was promptly denied. 
               <br />
               Why is it that the people of the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories and the premier of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories have so extraordinary an 
               <br />
               inﬂuence on the right hon. gentleman and 
               <br />
               his government in regard to some matters, 
               <br />
               and that their opinions have so little value 
               <br />
               in regard to the educational clauses which 
               <br />
               if passed must bind these provinces for all 
               <br />
               time to come, through all eternity. The 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman thought the matter 
               <br />
               was of so little importance that to-day, after 
               <br />
               the country has been convulsed for more 
               <br />
               than a month he congratulates himself and 
               <br />
               gravely tells us that Mr. Haultain had ample 
               <br />
               opportunity to discuss these clauses which 
               <br />
               he never saw. I am sorry, Sir, that a case 
               <br />
               such as this, without precedent one might 
               <br />
               say, leads to peculiar complications, and so I 
               <br />
               am not perfectly certain that I agree with 
               <br />
               my leader in one statement that he made. 
               <br />
               That hon. gentleman seems to be under the 
               <br />
               impression that the seven members from the 
               <br />
               west were those who enlightened, instruct- 
               <br />
               ed and controlled the premier in this legis- 
               <br />
               ‘ation. Possibly they did, Sir, on the prin- 
               <br />
               ciple of the doctrine of exclusion. We know 
               <br />
               that the Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding) 
               <br />
               did not; we know that the ex-Minlster of 
               <br />
               the Interior (Mr. Sifton) did not, and we 
               <br />
               know that the premier, representing the 
               <br />
               people of the Northwest Territories did 
               <br />
               not, and I suppose that the hon. gentleman

               as made before the House when the Bill

               <br />
               cline to think that any native-born Cana-

               dian could have given the right hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman such advice as he evidently received. 
               <br />

               <br />
               which he made when the Bill was intro- 
               <br />
               duced, and I say it with all respect to the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman, because I quite un- 
               <br />
               derstand that the onerous duties of the 
               <br />
               leader of a government, especially when the 
               <br />
               session is in progress—can doubt that the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman has no time to devote 
               <br />
               to the acquisition of facts of law and other- 
               <br />
               wise, and therefore he is dependent on 
               <br />
               some one for these facts. It would seem 
               <br />
               that the gentleman who instructed him re- 
               <br />
               lied on imagination for his history and his 
               <br />
               invention for his law, and I think we are 
               <br />
               justiﬁed in considering that even these seven 
               <br />
               were not consulted. The question as to the 
               <br />
               propriety or impropriety of the clauses is 
               <br />
               of course not a question which we can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis</span>

               some for and some against this measure, 
               <br />
               must be enough to impress the members of 
               <br />
               this House with the gravity of the position

               this House, has placed these provinces, has 
               <br />

               that it is the unexpected that happens, we

               venience and interest of the hon. member 
               <br />

               <br />
               complaints made by the hon. member for 
               <br />
               East Grey and other gentlemen on this side 
               <br />
               of the House, they are not that the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman has held back the second 
               <br />
               reading of the Bill so much as that we cannot 
               <br />
               ﬁnd out what the Bill is. I think the hon. 
               <br />
               member for East Grey was right in asking 
               <br />
               that ample time should be given to the coun-

               try to consider and digest the provisions 
               <br />
               of the Bill. But how is the country to con-

               sider and digest these most important mat- 
               <br />

               <br />
               not tell us, though appealed to again and 
               <br />
               again, what the provisions of the Bill are to 
               <br />
               be. It is all very well for the right hon.
