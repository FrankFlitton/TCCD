               ity of the directors of that railway should be 
               <br />
               British subjects. My recollection is that I 
               <br />
               desired to go a little further than that; 
               <br />
               but after discussion it was decided that 
               <br />
               we should put in the General Railway Act 
               <br />
               the clause which is now there. If we are 
               <br />
               to abandon that principle with regard to 
               <br />
               this particular railway company, I should 
               <br />
               say wipe it out altogether. There can be 
               <br />
               no principle upon which it can be justiﬁed 
               <br />
               in regard to any company if it does not ap- 
               <br />
               ply to this. One object I had in view was 
               <br />
               to bring within the control of this parlia- 
               <br />
               ment every Canadian railway, if possible. I 
               <br />
               was prepared to concede what was urged 
               <br />
               upon the opposite side, that it was desir- 
               <br />
               able to facilitate. the expenditure 0f foreign 
               <br />
               capital in this country; but it was as a 
               <br />
               compromise thought that wherever the pub- 
               <br />
               lic money of Canada Was expended in assist- 
               <br />
               ing in the construction of a railway, those 
               <br />
               who owned <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> railway should accept that 
               <br />
               assistance with the obligation that a majority 
               <br />
               of their directors should be British subjects. 
               <br />
               Now, I see nothing in what has been 
               <br />
               stated in regard to this particular railway 
               <br />
               company to interfere with that principle. I 
               <br />
               think it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of‘</span> far more consequence at the 
               <br />
               present time, when we have the Board of 
               <br />
               Railway Commissioners, than it was before. 
               <br />
               It is almost impossible in the practical oper- 
               <br />
               ation of railways to control them when the 
               <br />

               <br />
               have any effective control over such an ad- 
               <br />
               ministration. The only possible one that 
               <br />
               presents itself is to provide at least that 
               <br />

               <br />
               rate, British subjects. When the Bill was 
               <br />
               before the House, my own View was that 
               <br />
               they should be Canadians, but I yielded to 
               <br />
               the opinion of other gentlemen who were 
               <br />
               willing that they simply should be British 
               <br />
               subjects; but I do not believe in abandon- 
               <br />
               ing that one sheet anchor and in giving 
               <br />
               away the last shred of control that is 
               <br />
               "possible to us. If the Board of Railway 
               <br />

               superior to a station freight agent who can 
               <br />
               give us any information unless they can 
               <br />
               examine some British director whom we can 
               <br />
               get at ? The administration may be in

               the state of New York and never appear 
               <br />
               here at all, but we can perhaps get hold of 
               <br />
               a director who will probably be a Canadian ;

               Mr. MONK. Even admitting the truth of 
               <br />
               all that has been said, I would submit to the 
               <br />
               Minister of Railways that my hon. friend 
               <br />
               who is promoting this Bill has shown that 
               <br />
               this company is placed in an exceptional 
               <br />
               position which would authorize the House 
               <br />
               in dealing with it in an exceptional way. 
               <br />
               Under section 109 of the Railway Act of 
               <br />
               1903, that provision about the directors be- 
               <br />
               ing British subjects was only to become ap— 
               <br />
               plicable after the 1st January, 1905. I take 
               <br />
               it that my hon. friend is correct when he 
               <br />
               states that While this Bill was going through 
               <br />
               the House those who were going to take in 
               <br />
               hand this railway had decided on the in— 
               <br />
               vestment, and they had come to that de- 
               <br />
               cision under a law which did not make it 
               <br />
               obligatory for railway <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">companies</span> to have a 
               <br />
               majority of their directors British subjects. 
               <br />
               They are thus placed in an exceptional posi- 
               <br />
               tion, and I think that, under the circum- 
               <br />
               stances, we ought to be lenient. Even if 
               <br />
               we had made the date of coming into effect 
               <br />
               of the law the 1st of July, 1903, probably 
               <br />
               this Bill would not have been necessary, 
               <br />
               as all the arrangements were made and the 
               <br />
               investments decided upon at the time when 
               <br />
               it would not have been possible for this 
               <br />
               enactment to apply. However good a gen— 
               <br />
               eral rule may be, it ought not to be so rigid 
               <br />
               as to admit of no exception, My hon. friend 
               <br />
               who has just spoken (Mr. Barker) talks of 
               <br />
               the necessity of having the control of rail- 
               <br />
               ways in Canada, as if the only control we 
               <br />
               could have was to have the railway directors. 
               <br />
               or a majority of them, British subjects. 
               <br />
               We have that control as it is by other 
               <br />
               means; and besides it is always easy to 
               <br />
               evade the law by creating directors who are 
               <br />
               British subjects and mere mandatories of 
               <br />
               those who actually control the railway. 
               <br />
               The ease with which that provision of the 
               <br />
               law is evaded is evident. If we had no 
               <br />
               other control upon railway companies which 
               <br />
               have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">foreign</span> capital invested in them, we 
               <br />
               would be in a very bad position indeed; 
               <br />
               but we have absolute control over those 
               <br />
               companies by the fact that their works are 
               <br />
               here. The provision merely requires that 
               <br />
               the directors should be British subjects; 
               <br />
               and if they should reside in England, what 
               <br />
               control have we over them ? W'e have none 
               <br />
               whatever. Our courts and Railway Com- 
               <br />
               mission have no jurisdiction whatever over 
               <br />
               their person. There are railways no doubt 
               <br />
               in Canada the majority of whose directors 
               <br />
               are British subjects, but no more under the 
               <br />
               control of our Railway Commission and 
               <br />
               other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tribunals</span> than would be directors re- 
               <br />
               siding in the United States. I do not think 
               <br />
               that the law in the United States is as ex- 
               <br />
