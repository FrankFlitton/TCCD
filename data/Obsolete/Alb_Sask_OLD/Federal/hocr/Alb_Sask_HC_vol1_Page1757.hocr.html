               are not to be read as if they were in the 
               <br />
               Act although they are in the Act? It 
               <br />
               seems sufﬁcient only to state such a ques- 
               <br />
               tion to have an answer. If those who do 
               <br />
               me the honour of listening to me at this 
               <br />
               moment will go back to the year 1866, to 
               <br />
               the month of November and to old Lon- 
               <br />
               don, they will ﬁnd a number of men en- 
               <br />
               gaged in a very important work. Who are 
               <br />
               these men ? They are the delegates from 
               <br />
               the provinces of old Canada, Nova Scotia 
               <br />
               and New Brunswick and they are engaged 
               <br />
               in the task of preparing the Act which is 
               <br />
               to be submitted to the Imperial parliament 
               <br />
               which is to become the charter of the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada and which is to give 
               <br />
               it new life and existence. We know that 
               <br />
               one of the delegates on that important mis- 
               <br />
               sion was Mr. Gait and we know by the 
               <br />
               debates which have already taken place in 
               <br />
               this House that Mr. Gait was there as the 
               <br />
               special representative of the Protestant min- 
               <br />
               ority of Quebec. We know by the debates 
               <br />
               which have already taken place and by the 
               <br />
               language of Mr. Gait which has been quoted 
               <br />
               in this House that he was not satisﬁed with 
               <br />
               the Quebec resolution, that he was not satis- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the compact, that he thought the Quebec

               resolution did not convey to his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">co—religion‘</span>

               <br />
               they were entitled. We know that Ît was
