               ments that he made this afternoon. He 
               <br />
               made the statement that the Liberal party 
               <br />
               had always been in favour of building the 
               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway through the 
               <br />
               Northwest. Does he know the history of 
               <br />
               the Liberal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">party,</span> in regard to the building 
               <br />
               of that railway that created that country 
               <br />
               and made something of it? A contract was 
               <br />
               made by the Conservative government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pre—</span> 
               <br />
               vious to 1873 to build that railway, but by 
               <br />
               the opposition then offered in the House, the 
               <br />
               government of the late lamented Sir John

               account of having entered into that con- 
               <br />
               tract. The Liberals came into ofﬁce. Did 
               <br />
               they make a contract to build that railway 
               <br />
               or did they attempt to build that railway? 
               <br />
               They attempted to use the water stretches 
               <br />
               and to connect Port Arthur with Winnipeg 
               <br />
               by a part water and part rail route. They

               lot of money, but did not do anything to— 
               <br />
               wards the building of the railway. Then 
               <br />
               the Conservative party came in again; they 
               <br />
               entered into negotiations, and in 1881 this

               <br />

               <br />
               for Western Assiniboia to—day quoted the 
               <br />
               words of Mr. Blake, Mr. Ross and Sir Richard 
               <br />
               Cartwright. What did these gentlemen say? 
               <br />
               They said that if this railway were ever 
               <br />
               built it would not earn enough to pay for 
               <br />

               them left, as there are only a few on this

               side of the House who supported that mea— 
               <br />
               sure—opposed the granting of this assist- 
               <br />
               ance. The supporters of the government of 
               <br />
               that day stood up and voted in favour of 
               <br />
               loaning the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway $30.- 
               <br />
               000,000. because, notwithstanding the fact 
               <br />
               that under the contract they had the lands 
               <br />
               and they had the exemption from taxation

               that my hon. friend is now complaining 
               <br />
               about, they could not raise a dollar to go 
               <br />
               on and complete the road. Yet, the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">geu«</span> 
               <br />
               tleman makes the reckless statement that 
               <br />
               the Liberal party were always in favour of 
               <br />
               building this road. A few <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conservatives</span> 
               <br />
               who are here now were in the House then 
               <br />

               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway $30.000,000. The 
               <br />
               measure was carried notwithstanding the

               opposition of every Liberal in the House at

               that time, and there are only a few of them

               <br />
               was completed; the company paid back the 
               <br />
               $30,000,000, and yet the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"hon.</span> member for 
               <br />
               West Assiniboia will say that the Liberal

               party were always in favour of building the

               Mr. TAYLOR. He 'did say it this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">after-</span> 
               <br />
               noon. He had the assumption to make a 
               <br />
               statement of that kind. There are many of 
               <br />
               us in the House to—day who know that the 
               <br />
               Hon. G. W. Ross, when the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man quoted against the Canadian Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway,</span> was man enough to get up and 
               <br />
               say in recent years that he had opposed 
               <br />
               the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway at every 
               <br />
               stage, but he regretted he had ever done so, 
               <br />
               and he withdrew every statement he ever 
               <br />
               made against it. It is not so with the 
               <br />
               other Liberals who opposed the construction 
               <br />
               of the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway and who 
               <br />
               now try to get credit for building it and 
               <br />
               making that western country what it is.
