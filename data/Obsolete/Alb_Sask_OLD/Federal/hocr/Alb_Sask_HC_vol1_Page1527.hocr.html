               <br />
               when it enacted the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ordinances</span> under this

               issue such as he himself created when he 
               <br />
               made that remark. There was nothing in 
               <br />
               the Act of 1875 to prevent the Territories 
               <br />
               from establishing separate schools of that 
               <br />
               character if they saw ﬁt, nor was there 
               <br />
               anything in that Act to impose upon the 
               <br />
               territorial legislature the necessity of estab- 
               <br />
               lishing such schools. In other words, such 
               <br />
               wide powers were given by the Act of 1875 
               <br />
               to the Territories that they could establish 
               <br />
               denominational schools <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iii—they</span> saw ﬁt. There 
               <br />
               was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nothing</span> to restrict them, but neither 
               <br />
               was there anything in the Act of 1875 to 
               <br />
               impose the obligation of establishing deno- 
               <br />
               minational schools. The term used is not 
               <br />
               'uenominational schools,’ but the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman has thus interpreted it. The 
               <br />
               term used is ‘ separate schools’ and separate 
               <br />
               schools only. I see that my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Montmagny (Mr. Lavergne) is impa- 
               <br />
               tient. There is evidently something on his 
               <br />
               mind which troubling him.

               Mr. A. LAVERGNE. In our legislation, 
               <br />
               is not ‘separate schools’ synonymous with 
               <br />
               denominational schools ? In section 93 of 
               <br />
