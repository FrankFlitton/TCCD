               <br />
               their possession. The hon. gentleman (Mr. 
               <br />
               Foster) has shown further, that there is a

               way by which ample means would be placed 
               <br />

               without entrenching on their capital in the

               way of public lands. The Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior in his reply did not attempt to 
               <br />
               criticise the ﬁgures given by the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman (Mr. Foster). In fact he admitted 
               <br />
               there was a great deal in them when he 
               <br />
               stated that the effect of that speech would 
               <br />
               be to create dissatisfaction with the ﬁnali- 
               <br />
               cial terms among the people of the west. 
               <br />
               That statement clearly proves to this House 
               <br />
               that the Minister of the Interior thinks that 
               <br />
               the people of the west will be satisﬁed that 
               <br />
               the suggestions made by the member for 
               <br />
               North Toronto are well within the bounds 
               <br />
               of probability.

               The minister says the object of the sale 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">glands</span> in the west should be to develop 
               <br />
               the country rather than to derive a revenue, 
               <br />
               and he has deprecated the policy which he 
               <br />
               says the members of the opposition would 
               <br />

               claims has been done in the disposal of the

               <br />
               Toronto (Mr. Foster) very well called his 
               <br />
               attention to the sale of homestead lands to 
               <br />
               the Saskatchewan Valley Land Company a 
               <br />
               short time ago at $1 an acre. Surely the 
               <br />
               fact remains that in that particular case 
               <br />
               every cent is being squeezed out of the 
               <br />
               people who want to buy these lands. There 
               <br />
               is this bad feature about it also, that the pro— 
               <br />
               ceeds of this squeezing goes into the hands 
               <br />
               of a private company, and not into the 
               <br />
               hands of the Dominion or provincial author- 
               <br />
               ities ; and yet it seems to me that the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of the Interior approves of the policy 
               <br />
               which was initiated at that time, of selling 
               <br />
               a vast tract of land to a private company, 
               <br />
               with the intention of making that company 
               <br />
               an immigration agent on a large scale. I 
               <br />
               hold that if this policy is continued, as we 
               <br />
               may anticipate will be the case if the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of the Interior so highly approves of 
               <br />
               it, it will have a most pernicious effect 
               <br />
               upon the immigration into the Northwest. 
               <br />
               I have already seen, in the part of the coun- 
               <br />
               try with which I am familiar, the result 
               <br />
               which the possession of these lands held for 
               <br />
               speculation by the land companies is having 
               <br />
               upon immigration. There are a number of 
               <br />
               homesteads in that part of the country, but 
               <br />
               it is impossible for the ordinary settler to 
               <br />
               get a homestead from the government. 'As 
               <br />
               a general rule, however, one of the land 
               <br />

               <br />
               sale one of its pieces of land, and in some

               <br />
               of homesteading a piece of government land 
               <br />

               two with reference to the arguments put 
               <br />
               forward by the Minister of the Interior in

               <br />
               ments alone, I think that is perfectly true ; 
               <br />
               but I think the deduction he draws from 
               <br />
               that statement is altogether wrong. It ap-

               <br />
               present very elaborate basis ; but if you had 
               <br />
               in addition the province directly interested 
               <br />
               in the lands, you would have it also work- 
               <br />
               ing for immigration. We have already had 
               <br />
               an explanation of the way the provincial 
               <br />
               government of Ontario is working for im- 
               <br />
               migration on its own account. Reading the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">xeport</span> of the Minister of the Interior the 
               <br />
               other day, I noticed that the Dominion 
               <br />
               Department of Immigration was claiming 
               <br />
               credit for putting a large number of farm 
               <br />
               hands into the province of Ontario during 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">year.</span> I was told that the provincial 
               <br />
               authorities rather objected to that claim 
               <br />
               on the part of the Dominion authorities, 
               <br />
               considering that they had had a very large 
               <br />
               share in obtaining those immigrants. At 
               <br />
               any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rate,</span> the efforts of the Ontario govern- 
               <br />
               ment must have been successful to a very 
               <br />
               large extent; and I hold that it is better 
               <br />
               to have both the Dominion and the provin- 
               <br />
               cial governments interested in procuring 
               <br />
               immigration, for the more immigration 
               <br />
               agents we have the better for the country. 
               <br />
               I wish to put on record an argument which 
               <br />
               was used by the NorthWest government 
               <br />
               when it Was requesting the grant of pro- 
               <br />
               vincial autonomy from the Dominion gov- 
               <br />

               <br />
               main should be vested in the province. AS 
               <br />
               this deals to a certain extent with the legal 
               <br />
