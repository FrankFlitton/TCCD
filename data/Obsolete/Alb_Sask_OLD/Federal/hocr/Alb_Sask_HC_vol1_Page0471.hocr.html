               question of dogma, as one who does not want 
               <br />

               <br />
               divided on creed lines, I maintain that when

               we coerce the provinces to accept these

               of the national life within these provinces. 
               <br />
               I do not think the union of church and state 
               <br />
               is for the best interests of humanity. The 
               <br />
               nations of the old land have given it up, 
               <br />
               and why this young country should adopt 
               <br />
               the fads and practices that have been dis- 
               <br />
               carded in Europe is beyond my comprehen- 
               <br />
               sion. I am opposed to this parliament forc— 
               <br />
               ing on any province, against its will, a union 
               <br />
               of church and state. By the enactment of 
               <br />
               this law, this parliament is placing a blanket 
               <br />
               mortgage on the two provinces of the North- 
               <br />

               of time and which can never be paid olÏ. 
               <br />
               I object in general terms to this legislation. 
               <br />
               It is contrary to the spirit of a free parlia— 
               <br />
               ment; it is contrary to the spirit of a free 
               <br />
               people. I am afraid that I shall not be able 
               <br />
