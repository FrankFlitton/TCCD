               <br />
               We have and we will have in all probability 
               <br />
               two constituencies in which public opinion 
               <br />
               may be tested. We have North Oxford and 
               <br />
               no doubt we will have the city of London. 
               <br />
               Both <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of.</span> these constituencies are intelligent 
               <br />
               constituencies. Both of these constituencies 
               <br />
               are looked upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> as Liberal constitu- 
               <br />
               encies. In view of the prestige that a min- 
               <br />
               ister of the Crown must naturally have in a 
               <br />
               by-election and during the ﬁrst session of 
               <br />
               a new parliament is it not fair to assume 
               <br />
               that if the constituency of the city of Lon- 
               <br />
               don is opened, and if the acting Minister of 
               <br />
               Public Works (Mr. Hyman) is called upon 
               <br />
               to submithimself in a by-election there in 
               <br />
               order that he may become the Minister of 
               <br />
               Public Works, then, if you want to test 
               <br />
               public opinion on this issue, there is an 
               <br />
               opportunity for this government to test pub- 
               <br />
               lic opinion. If the government do test it in

               the city of London on this issue and this 
               <br />
               issue alone then, I think, the opposition in 
               <br />
               this parliament and the Conservative party 
               <br />

               to say that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">public~opini0n</span> has not been 
               <br />
               tested in London, an intelligent and suit— 
               <br />
               able constituency in which to test pub- 
               <br />
               lic opinion. The government have taken an 
               <br />
               undue and unfair advantage of the Conser- 
               <br />
               vative party and the people of this country, 
               <br />
               because, outside of one thing alone, there 
               <br />

               <br />
               have been introduced would be brought 
               <br />
               down. I say outside of oue allusion and 
               <br />
               that was when the right hon. Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister, previous to the 3rd November, stated 
               <br />
               that in all probability legislation would he 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fair</span> part of the whole matter came 
               <br />
