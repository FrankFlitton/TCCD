               <br />
               tended that the province should have exclu-

               <br />

               to the provinces ; or, why not have eliminat—

               ed all reference to the subject of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">education,</span> 
               <br />
               which, in that case might have been included 
               <br />
               under the heading ‘ property and civil rights 
               <br />
               ' in the province’ under section 92; again 
               <br />
               under ‘ matters of a merely local or private 
               <br />
               nature in the province.’ Either of these two 
               <br />
               enumerations would include education. The 
               <br />
               answer is, that parliament intended to deal 
               <br />
               with this difﬁcult question so as to make. 
               <br />
               exceptional provisions differing accordingto 
               <br />
               each province ; and my argument is that by 
               <br />
               section 93 of the British North America Act, 
               <br />
               1867, the power of each province to make 
               <br />
               laws in respect to education is expressly 
               <br />
               limited: First, the right to denominational 
               <br />
               schools which any class of persons has by 
               <br />
               law in each province at the union must be 
               <br />
               preserved. That is quite clear. Second: 
               <br />
               where in any province a system of separate

               <br />
               provinces, but also in effect, so far as there

               <br />
               there are different provisions, and the limi— 
               <br />
               tations so far as denominational schools are 
               <br />
               concerned is expressed in even broader terms 
               <br />
               than in section 93 of the British North Am- ' 
               <br />
               erica Act. Nobody doubts that Ontario, that 
               <br />
               Quebec, that Nova Scotia and New Bruns- 
               <br />
               Wick are provinces, notwithstanding this di- 
               <br />
               versity in matters of education. It has 
               <br />
               never been suggested that Manitoba is not 
               <br />
               a province, although further exceptions as 
               <br />
               to education have been introduced in her 
               <br />
               case. It cannot reasonably be argued that 
               <br />
               in creating a new province the Dominion is 
               <br />
               bound to make its powers with regard to 
               <br />
               education corresponding to those of any 
               <br />
               particular one of the older provinces. And, 
               <br />
               if we are obliged to make them correspond 
               <br />
               to any particular one of the older provinces, 
               <br />
               to which shall we make them correspond ? 
               <br />
               All the provinces are treated alike, mark 
               <br />
               you, Mr. Speaker, with the single exception 
               <br />
               of Quebec, with respect to which province 
               <br />
               there is an express limitation placed upon 
               <br />
               its powers in the interest of the Protestant 
               <br />
               minority.

               It is a complete error to imagine that the 
               <br />
               right to separate schools in Ontario is 
               <br />
               created by the British North America Act; 
               <br />
               that right is merely preserved by that Act, 
               <br />
               and there is no exceptional provision for 
               <br />
               Ontario. The conditions applicable to On— 
               <br />
               tario are those applicable to New Brunswick, 
               <br />
               to Nova Scotia, to Prince Edward Island and 
               <br />
               to British Columbia; the difference being 
               <br />
               that at the time of confederation the Catho- 
               <br />
               lics of Ontario had rights and privileges with 
               <br />
               respect to their schools by law in the pro- 
               <br />
               vince, and they did not have these rights in 
               <br />
               some of the other provinces. Again I repeat: 
               <br />
               there is not in the whole Dominion of Can- 
               <br />
               ada <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to’day</span> a single province that enjoys an 
               <br />
               exclusive right to legislate with respect to 
               <br />
               education. Then, why in the name of pro- 
               <br />
               vincial rights can we justly be called upon 
               <br />
               to give to these new provinces a power 
               <br />
               which no other province possesses ? Let me 
               <br />
               quote on this point the opinion of their 
               <br />
               Lordships of the Privy Council in the se- 
               <br />
