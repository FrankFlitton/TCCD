               <br />
               lutely impossible. Even this House has not 
               <br />
               been able to do anything in connection with 
               <br />

               tleman says he is trying to administer the 
               <br />
               department. He may be trying to do it, 
               <br />
               but he will not think I am saying anything 
               <br />
               out of the way when I say that he is not 
               <br />
               doing it, and it is practically impossible for 
               <br />
               him to do it. It is a very large department, 
               <br />
               with great ramiﬁcations. The right hon. 
               <br />

               <br />
               to master the details of that department. It 
               <br />
               ls impossible for him to do it; he cannot 
               <br />
               undertake it and he cannot overtake it. Why 
               <br />
               should not my right hon. friend appoint 
               <br />
               his Minister of the Interior and let him go 
               <br />
               to his constituency and come back here as
