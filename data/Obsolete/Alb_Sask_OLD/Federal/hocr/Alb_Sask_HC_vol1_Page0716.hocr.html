               <br />
               duction of freight rates on those roads, 
               <br />
               which is a great beneﬁt to the peu-

               <br />
               also to the people of the west. 
               <br />
               I believe they have lower passenger 
               <br />
               rates as well. As I say, the people of the 
               <br />
               west have beneﬁted by this as well as the 
               <br />
               people of Manitoba. So, if they have con- 
               <br />
               tracted liabilities they have also beneﬁted 
               <br />
               by those liabilities, and I do not think the 
               <br />
               people of the west adjacent to Manitoba 
               <br />
               would object to coming into Manitoba on 
               <br />
               that consideration. Looking at it from 
               <br />
               either standpoint, therefore, we ﬁnd no sulﬁ- 
               <br />
               cient reason why the boundaries of Maui- 
               <br />
               toba have not been extended. We have been 
               <br />
               told that, some years ago, Manitoba was 
               <br />
               much larger than it is to-day, or was con- 
               <br />
               sidered to be much larger. When Mani- 
               <br />
               toba was ﬁrst made up, the eastern bound- 
               <br />
               ary was deﬁned as the western boundary 
               <br />
               of Ontario, and that was thought to be 
               <br />
               many miles eastward of where it was later 
               <br />
               determined to be. So, Manitoba lost what 
               <br />
               she thought was her territory and became 
               <br />
               a very small province. It is well known 
               <br />
               to every public man in Canada that Mani- 
               <br />
               tobans feel sore over this matter, and I 
               <br />
               have no doubt this was well known to the 
               <br />
               premier of this Dominion and those who 
               <br />
               sat at the council table with him when they 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lframed</span> this Bill. Manitoba expected. when 
               <br />
               the question of autonomy of the Northwest 
               <br />
               came up. that they would be dealt with as 
               <br />
               they thought they deserved. I ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               there is little hope that this will be the 
               <br />
               outcome. They are told that their bound- 
               <br />
               ary cannot be extended westward. They 
               <br />
               have been told, I think, by the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Saskatchewan (Mr. Lamont) that 
               <br />
               there is small hope of their boundary being 
               <br />
               extended northward. As the people ot‘ the 
               <br />
               Territories will not allow any part of the 
               <br />
               territory north of Manitoba to go to that 
               <br />
               province, it would be interesting to know 
               <br />
               just what effort was made by the ex-Min- 
               <br />
               ister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) to uphold 
               <br />
               the interest of Manitoba on this question. 
               <br />
               I think he had admitted in this House 
               <br />
               that he had been consulted with regard to 
               <br />
               this measure except the educational clauses. 
               <br />
               I think. that occupying the position he held, 
               <br />
               that he ought to have taken this House 
               <br />
               into his conﬁdence and told them why he 
               <br />
               intended to leave Manitoba with her small 
               <br />
               boundaries. 111 the years to come, when

               about that little spot. Will they be told

               forth and produce such an agitation as we 
               <br />
               have at this time. We should look at the

               cause: we should try to understand the

               Now, I ﬁnd that I am out of accord 
               <br />
               with the government on the matter of the 
               <br />
               question of lands. I think that the proper 
               <br />
               people to handle the lands, both in Maui- 
               <br />
               toba and the Northwest, are the people who 
               <br />
               live right there, the people who are most 
               <br />
               interested, the people who would look after 
               <br />
               those lands and see that they were properly 
               <br />
               administered, as they are not to-day, in 
               <br />
               either Manitoba or the Northwest Territo- 
               <br />
               ries. Now, what is the reason given for 
               <br />
               withholding the land ? We are told that 
               <br />
               the territorial government would likely 
               <br />
               squander the lands, or that they would have 
               <br />
               to sell those lands and thus retard settle- 
               <br />
               ment, in order that they might have a rev- 
               <br />
               enue. Now I want to point out one fact 
               <br />
               with regard to that. In a speech delivered 
               <br />
               in this House by the hon. member for West 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Assiniboia</span> (Mr. Scott) the other day, he 
               <br />
               pointed out that we have been administering 
               <br />
               those lands in the Northwest at an annual 
               <br />
               loss to this Dominion during all these years, 
               <br />
               which losses amount to over a million doi- 
               <br />
               lars. Now, if we have lost that much money 
               <br />
               in handling those lands, could we not well 
               <br />
               afford to give the people of the Northwest 
               <br />
               all we are giving them to-day in the way of 
               <br />
               bounty. and hand over the lands to them, 
               <br />
               and still save money to the Dominion by do- 
               <br />
               ing so? It would not be necessary for the 
               <br />
               Northwest people to sell their lands in order 
               <br />
