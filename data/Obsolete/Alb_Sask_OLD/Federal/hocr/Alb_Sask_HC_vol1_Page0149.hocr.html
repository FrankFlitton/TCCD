               important Bills. From what has transpired 
               <br />
               in this House and the country, there is evid- 
               <br />
               ently a good deal of diversity of opinion 
               <br />
               on at least some of the points in those mea- 
               <br />
               sures. My hon. friend (Mr. Sproule) who 
               <br />
               has just taken his seat has emphasized his 
               <br />
               objections strongly, those objections being 
               <br />
               mainly to one portion of the Bill. If I 
               <br />
               understood him aright, he objects also to 
               <br />
               another section which deals with the pub—

               Mr. SPROULE. I have always been of

               Mr. PATERSON. I understood that to be 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman’s position. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman, like others who preceded him, 
               <br />
               seems to have been inﬂuenced by the in- 
               <br />
               terest aroused in the country by what are 
               <br />
               known as the educational clauses. The 
               <br />
               House has been petitioned in reference to 
               <br />
               those clauses; there have been petitions 
               <br />
               for and petitions against. It is for parlia- 
               <br />
               ment to come to the consideration of this 
               <br />
               question, as I believe parliament has done 
               <br />
               and will do, in a calm and dispassionate 
               <br />
               spirit, and to endeavour to give due weight 
               <br />
               to any argument that may be advanced 
               <br />
               from any point of View. That is what this 
               <br />
               discussion is for; that is how we may be 
               <br />
               beneﬁted. In committee, of course, the 
               <br />
               educational clauses will be discussed at 
               <br />
               length. Still .I may follow the example of 
               <br />
               the hon. member for East Grey (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">S‘proule),</span> 
               <br />
               and deal largely with that subject. The 
               <br />
               government have proposed in this Bill cer- 
               <br />
               tain provisions with reference to the mat- 
               <br />
               ter. The leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. 
               <br />
               Borden). in his able speech, olfered a legal 
               <br />
               argument against that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[portion</span> of the Bill 
               <br />
               and submitted an amendment. Not only 
               <br />
               was a legal argument presented by the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition, but the Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister (Sir Vlefrid Laurier) also directed part 
               <br />
               of his argument in the same line. And I 
               <br />
               have no doubt that other gentlemen in the 
               <br />
               House who are competent to do so will fol- 
               <br />
               low that line. But upon that portion of the 
               <br />
               case I shall not trespass. Like the hon. 
               <br />
               member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule), I do 
               <br />
               not feel that I should be regarded as an 
               <br />
               authority upon the subject, and I know it 
               <br />
               would be hazardous for me—and even pre— 
               <br />
               sumptious for me to express an opinion; 
               <br />
               not that I abandon my judgment in this 
               <br />
               matter, but simply that I do not argue the 
               <br />
               matter before the House. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               (Mr. Sproule) read an opinion from a very 
               <br />
               able legal gentleman, Mr. Christopher Rob- 
               <br />
               inson, K.C. I believe that gentleman stands 
               <br />
               almost. if not quite, at the head of his pro— 
               <br />
               fession. The leader of the opposition is 
               <br />
               also admitted, I think, to be a gentleman of 
               <br />
               legal attainments of no ordinary character. 
               <br />
               And I think I am not saying more than I 
               <br />
               am perfectly justiﬁed in saying when I 
               <br />
               state that the Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitz- 
               <br />
               patrick) is also one of the brightest legal 
               <br />
               minds we have in the country. But these 
               <br />
               gentlemen do not agree. If I followed 
               <br />
               aright the argument of the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition, he takes the ground that this 
               <br />
               parliament has no power to pass the legis- 
               <br />
               lation now proposed. If I followed him 
               <br />
               aright and was able to apprehend his argu- 
               <br />
               ment. that is his position. But if I appre- 
               <br />
               hend aright the opinion expressed in the 
               <br />
               telegram of Mr. Christopher Robinson. that 
               <br />
               gentleman does not at all take the view 
               <br />
               expressed by the leader of the opposition.
