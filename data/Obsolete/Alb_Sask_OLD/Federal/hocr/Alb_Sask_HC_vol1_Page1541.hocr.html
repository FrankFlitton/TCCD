               ferable that we should have them presented

               that they cannot be reconciled in this very

               see, taking the geographical condition and

               Mr. FOSTER. I do not think it would be 
               <br />
               better to take them up one by one. The 
               <br />
               House would like to know the basis upon 
               <br />
               which the schedules were arranged. It is 
               <br />
               very important probably one of the most im- 
               <br />
               portant matters presented by the Bill. It 
               <br />
               provides for the distribution of constituencies 
               <br />
               which shall elect the ﬁrst house of represen- 
               <br />
               tatives for each of these provinces. Every 
               <br />
               one knows that the ﬁrst house will have most 
               <br />
               important functions conﬁded to it ; so that it 
               <br />
               is of the utmost importance that the basis 
               <br />
               of representation shall be fair and reason- 
               <br />
               able, and it would be very desirable to have it 
               <br />
               so arranged by the government that it would 
               <br />
               appeal to the fair mindedness and reason- 
               <br />
               able appreciation of both sides of the House. 
               <br />
               Now, the government must have come to this 
               <br />
               through a certain medium. They have made 
               <br />
               up their representative districts from data 
               <br />
               which I imaginehave been very carefully com- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.piled,</span> and I would like to have a most thor- 
               <br />
               ough explanation of the basis upon which 
               <br />
               they have presumed to recommend the elec- 
               <br />
               toral districts which they have deﬁned in this 
               <br />
               Bill. and representations of which they have 
               <br />
               drawn upon the map. This side of the 
               <br />
               House is willing to accept a fair <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arrange‘</span> 
               <br />
               ment, but it is not, even at this late period 
               <br />
               of the session, willing to accept any other 
               <br />

               ation of the schedule for the distribution of 
               <br />
               seats. First of all, we had to consider the 
               <br />
               existing conditions. There is a legislature 
               <br />

               thirty-ﬁve constituencies in the two pro- 
               <br />
               vinces—twenty in Saskatchewan and ﬁfteen

               in Alberta.

               Sir WILFRID <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">LAURIER’.</span> Yes. We give

               twenty—ﬁve constituencies to each of the two 
               <br />
               provinces. Therefore it was obvious from 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst that we had to provide for ten more 
               <br />
               constituencies in Alberta. The next guiding 
               <br />
               principle was the population, the object being 
               <br />
               to equalize as much as possible the existing 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(population</span> among these twenty-ﬁve consti- 
               <br />
               tuencies. However, it is not possible, in a 
               <br />
               new country like this, to consider the ques- 
               <br />
               tion of population alone. Geographical con- 
               <br />
               ditions also have to be considered. To illus- 
               <br />
               trate, population is more thickly settled 
               <br />
               along the lines of railway than it is in the 
               <br />
               outlying districts to the north and perhaps 
               <br />
               also to the south. Therefore it was not pos— 
               <br />
               sible to apply the same degree of geographi- 
               <br />
               cal extension in all the constituencies. Some 
               <br />
               had to be large and some small. But the 
               <br />
               prime object was as far as possible to give 
               <br />
               equality of numbers in the diiïerent electoral

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. Taking the 
               <br />
               unit of population. My hon. friend who will 
               <br />
               speak after me will give more particulars 
               <br />
               than I can give on this point. I conﬁne my- 
               <br />
               self at present only to the more salient 
               <br />
               points. Then there are some far outlying 
               <br />
               districts which are new and in which the 
               <br />
               population may be below the unit of repre- 
               <br />
               sentation, but which must be represented. 
               <br />
               In these cases we have to chose between two 
               <br />
               things—either annexing them to other dis- 
               <br />
               tricts, or giving them separate representa- 
               <br />
               tion. I admit at once that the suggestion 
               <br />
               that would at once occur to one’s mind under 
               <br />
               some circumstances would be to join such 
               <br />
               districts to existing districts, but you have 
               <br />
               this difﬁculty to contend with, that the dis- 
               <br />
               tances are so great in that country that you 
               <br />
               might make a district of such magnitude 
               <br />
               that it would be impossible for any human 
               <br />
               being to cover it within any reasonable time. 
               <br />
               It is to be expected, when an election takes 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«place,</span> that candidates should visit the dif- 
               <br />
               ferent sections of their constituencies and 
               <br />
               put themselves into communication with 
               <br />
               their electors; but if these sparsely settled
