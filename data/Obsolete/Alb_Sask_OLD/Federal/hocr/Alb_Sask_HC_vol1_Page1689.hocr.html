               <br />

               <br />
               There is the greatest community of inter-

               giving a case that existed some years ago. 
               <br />
               A large part of the trade of Edmonton is 
               <br />
               done with Athabaska Landing, over a road 
               <br />
               100 miles in length. The local district of 
               <br />
               St. Albert intervened between Edmonton 
               <br />
               and Athabaska Landing. Every interest of 
               <br />
               Edmonton and every interest of Athabaska 
               <br />
               Landing was in the up-kee-p of that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">road.</span> 
               <br />
               the St. Albert electoral district being en- 
               <br />
               tirely agricultural, the different settlements 
               <br />
               in that district had no interest in keeping 
               <br />
               up that great road from Edmonton to Atha- 
               <br />
               baska Landing. Now this became so great 
               <br />
               a hardship that at the redistribution made 
               <br />
               in 1892 the local government took cogni- 
               <br />
               zance of the fact, and cut and carved the 
               <br />
               different constituencies in a way that looked 
               <br />
               like a gerrymander on the map, but it was 
               <br />
               in reality conserving the interests of the 
               <br />
               respective peoples and trading points. Now 
               <br />
               what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> the case there is the case all 
               <br />
               over the Northwest Territories, and it is 
               <br />
               for that reason we desire to be careful. in
