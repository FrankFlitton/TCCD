               the hierarchy of his own church. That was 
               <br />
               the opinion generally expressed throughout 
               <br />
               Ontario and the result was that many 
               <br />
               strong Protestants who formerly had been 
               <br />
               Conservatives, many Orangemen who form- 
               <br />
               erly have been Conservatives voted for him 
               <br />
               and with a pretty solid Catholic vote,the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman was carried into power. 
               <br />
               What did the Prime Minister say to the 
               <br />
               people of Quebec during the elections of 
               <br />
               1896 ? Did he tell them there would be no 
               <br />
               separate schools ? No, he said that if elected 
               <br />
               he would send a commission headed by 
               <br />
               Sir Oliver Mowat, to Manitoba, to ascertain 
               <br />
               the facts and settle the question, and if 
               <br />
               that failed then he would pass stronger 
               <br />
               remedial legislation than that proposed by 
               <br />
               Sir Charles Tupper. He said to his French 
               <br />
               co-religionists in the province of Quebec: 
               <br />
               You can surely trust me rather than a 
               <br />
               Protestant like Sir Charles Tupper.

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">B‘ELCOURT.</span> He never said that;

               Mr. TAYLOR. He did say it, and I quote
