               grants and the question of classes there are

               In the course of this controversy, I observe a

               great number of people appeal to the time- 
               <br />
               honored principle of religious equality, well, I 
               <br />
               entirely approve of that. I consider my— 
               <br />
               self to be adevoted advocate of religious 
               <br />
               sentiment of that kind. What do you mean 
               <br />
               by religious equality ? How far are you pre- 
               <br />
               pared to go in order to secure? For instance, 
               <br />
               do you think it consistent that churchmen, 
               <br />
               Roman Catholics, Jews, Unitarians and a num- 
               <br />
               ber of other minor sects should be forced to 
               <br />
               pay rates which provide religious instruction 
               <br />
               which in their opinion either leaves out the 
               <br />
               essentials which make it valuable, or in other 
               <br />
               cases teaches doctrines in which they do not 
               <br />
               believe. Do you think, I say, that it is religious 
               <br />
               equality to insist upon that and at the same 
               <br />
               time refuse to those denominations the right

               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">state</span> of things the government has 
               <br />
               established a system of neutral schools. 
               <br />
               True it is, Sir, that in France the govern- 
               <br />
               ment is seeking to suppress denominational 
               <br />
               schools. But What has been the result ? 
               <br />
               Does not my hon. friend read the papers ? 
               <br />
               The government which suppressed the 
               <br />
               schools, Which exiled the religious orders, 
               <br />
               denounced the Concordat—that government 
               <br />
               has been also suppressed, yes suppressed 
               <br />
               after many a tumult, many an uprising of 
               <br />
               all liberty-lovers in France. The movement 
               <br />
               against that-act of the French government 
               <br />
               was not started by the illiterates; it was 
               <br />
               organized by whom ? By members of the 
               <br />
               Academic Française, by men like Francois 
               <br />
               Coppee, Jules Lemaitre; Brunetiere—by men 
               <br />
               of all parties, of all creeds; aye, by free 
               <br />
               thinkers, by French Protestants like Mons. 
               <br />
               de Pressensé, one of the most eminent 
               <br />
               French writers of the day. These men are 
               <br />
               all united, and they have published <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&amp;</span> mani- 
               <br />
               festo protesting against the policy of the 
               <br />
               government. Let me quote a few lines of 
               <br />
               that manifesto :
