               friend from West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott)

               suggested that this matter was up for con- 
               <br />
               sideration incidentally in the Supreme Court 
               <br />
               in connection with a number of cases of 
               <br />
               municipalities. two in the Northwest Terri— 
               <br />
               tories and one in Manitoba. These cases 
               <br />
               were to test the validity of by—laws taxing 
               <br />

               <br />
               the argument was put forward that if 
               <br />
               Manitoba chose to commit a breach of this 
               <br />
               agreement by taxing these lands, there was 
               <br />
               no power to prevent this. Thus there was

               a direct test of the validity of this enact-

               <br />
               there would be any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">special</span> distinction be- 
               <br />

               <br />
               tinguish absolutely between the question 
               <br />
               of legislative power and the duty of 
               <br />
               observing a contract made between the 
               <br />
               Crown and a company—they are two ab- 
               <br />
               solutely distinct things. Let me illustrate 
               <br />
               that in this way. The Crown made a con- 
               <br />
               tract with the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway 
               <br />
               Company, which has been ratiﬁed by Act 
               <br />
               of this parliament. The making of that 
               <br />
               contract does not take away from this par- 
               <br />
               liament its legislative power; parliament 
               <br />
               may to-morrow destroy the effect_of that 
               <br />
               contract by means of a statute, but it would 
               <br />
               be ablolutely wrong, imIJI'OD‘el' and even 
               <br />
               immoral to do so. So far as the legisla- 
               <br />
               tures of the new provinces are concerned, 
               <br />
               the matter is pretty much in the same posi- 
               <br />
               tion. I do not know whether the section 
               <br />
               which has beeen inserted in this Bill is in— 
               <br />
               tended as a constitutional limitation which 
               <br />
               deprives the new province of a certain power 
               <br />
               which it would otherwise <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have,</span> or whether 
               <br />
               it is intended, as my hon. friend from La-
