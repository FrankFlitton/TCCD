               <br />
               be the wiser for that argument. I would 
               <br />
               say that the Northwest Territories by their 
               <br />
               ordinances have practically set up a system 
               <br />
               of schools satisfactory to themselves, be— 
               <br />
               cause in my judgment—and I give it for 
               <br />
               what it is worth—they have very much res- 
               <br />
               tricted the rights of the minority as express- 
               <br />
               ed and given by the law of 1875, and I think 
               <br />
               Sir John Thompson was of that opinion and 
               <br />
               practically expressed it in a minute of coun- 
               <br />
               cil in reference to the petition for disallow- 
               <br />
               ance in 1894, so that I say. by taking the ac- 
               <br />
               tion which they did take, they to some extent 
               <br />
               at least have formulated a school policy 
               <br />
               that is satisfactory to themselves. It is also 
               <br />
               to be remembered that this Dominion parlia- 
               <br />
               ment in 1875 held out the assurance of cer- 
               <br />
               tain educational privileges to the minority 
               <br />
               and it is to this parliament that that min- 
               <br />
               lority must look for the protection of its 
               <br />
               rights. The legislation of 1875 in regard 
               <br />
               to education may have been ill-advised; I 
               <br />
               do not say whether it was or not, it may 
               <br />
               have been ill—advised or it may have been 
               <br />
               very wise legislation. However, it has re— 
               <br />
               mained ever since on our statute-book and 
               <br />
               therefore I say that the somewhat specious 
               <br />
               phrase ‘trust the new provinces’ has no 
               <br />
               particular force. The promise was made, 
               <br />
               the undertaking was entered into by this 
               <br />
               Dominion parliament and this sovereign par- 
               <br />
               liament having enacted the law, having held 
               <br />
               _ out the inducement to the incoming settler, 
               <br />
               having continued the law in force, gave 
               <br />
               every sign that the law was to remain in 
               <br />
               force. It is, therefore, incumbent on this 
               <br />
               parliament to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">follow</span> the course set forth 
               <br />
               in the Bill. I have wondered since this 
               <br />
               agitation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">began…</span> whether if the original pro- 
               <br />
               portion of Catholics and Protestants had 
               <br />
               remained in those Territories we would 
               <br />
               have had all the trouble and commotion that 
               <br />
               we have to-day. As I understand it, at 
               <br />
               the very beginning of the settlement of 
               <br />

               think, Mr. Speaker, we would have had a 
               <br />
               demand for the Protestant separate schools 
               <br />
               that they have in the province of Quebec 
               <br />
               today, and as a Protestant, if it were the 
               <br />
               very last vote I gave in the House of Com- 
               <br />
               mons, I would give that vote with the feel- 
               <br />
               ing that I was only doing equity and dealing 
               <br />
               fairly with this minority in casting my vote 
               <br />
               for the perpetuation of their privileges. 
               <br />
               Now, Sir, I have said that the hon. leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition made it a point that the 
               <br />
               merits and demerits of separate schools did 
               <br />
               not enter into this discussion. Hon. gen- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tlemen</span> opposite apparently did not think <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">so</span> 
               <br />
               and I have wondered too how some of them 
               <br />
               could bring themselves to support in its 
               <br />
               entirety the amendment offered by the hon. 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition to this Bill because 
               <br />
               quite possibly the logical effect of the 
               <br />
               amendment of the hon. leader of the opposi- 
               <br />
               tion might be to bring into force a full dual 
               <br />
               system of sectarian schools in the new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. I do not say whether that would 
               <br />
               be a blessing or whether that would be a 
               <br />
               great detriment to those new provinces, but 
               <br />
               I do say that hon. gentlemen opposite who 
               <br />
               have gone out of their way to attack <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sep-</span> 
               <br />
               arate schools should think twice and that 
               <br />
               they should think long before they vote for 
               <br />
               an amendment which may have the effect 
               <br />
               that I have just pointed out. I come from 
               <br />
               the province of Ontario. I do not know 
               <br />
               that separate schools have worked very 
               <br />
               badly in Ontario. I am like the hon. leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition; I argue not for them. 
               <br />
               I argue not against them, but I have been 
               <br />
               observing in the pr0vince of Ontario and I 
               <br />
               am bound to say, whether I like the system 
               <br />
               or whether I dislike the system, that I have 
               <br />
               seen no evils arising from separate schools 
               <br />
               in Ontario. I do not think the system 
               <br />
               tends to disunite. I do not think it tends 
               <br />
               to any vital separation of the people. I 
               <br />
               know that in my own riding We have a 
               <br />
               number of separate schools. I know of no 
               <br />
               spot in the whole Dominion where people 
               <br />
               of different creed-s live together in greater 
               <br />
               amity and concord than in my own riding 
               <br />
               of North Ontario and particularly in two 
               <br />
               townships where the population is very 
               <br />
               evenly divided between Roman Catholics 
               <br />
