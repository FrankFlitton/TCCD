               It is entitled ‘The Powers of Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Par—</span> 
               <br />
               liaments,’ by S. J. Watson, of Toronto, who 
               <br />
               has evidently given a good deal of atten- 
               <br />
               tion to the s-ubject. He ﬁrst states the re- 
               <br />
               served rights that were given to the federal 
               <br />
               parliament: regulation of trade and com- 
               <br />
               merce, postal service, military and naval 
               <br />
               service and defence, navigation and ship- 
               <br />
               ping, currency and coinage, banking and the 
               <br />
               issue of paper money, insolvency. Then he 
               <br />
               deals with those rights reserved exclusively 
               <br />
               to the provincial legislatures: amendments 
               <br />
               from time to time in their constitutions, 
               <br />
               municipal institutions in the province, local 
               <br />
               works and undertakings other than such as 
               <br />
               are excepted in subsection 10, the incorpora-

               property and civil rights, education. Educa- 
               <br />
               tion is, therefore, one of the exclusive rights 
               <br />
               of the provinces; it is only the province 
               <br />
               which has the right to legislate with regard 
               <br />
               to education. I hold that to be the correct 
               <br />
               principle, and whenever this parliament is 
               <br />
               legislating in regard to education it is in— 
               <br />
               fringing on the rights of the provinces.

               But I am told there is a provision in sec- 
               <br />
               tion 93 of the British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North</span> America Act 
               <br />
               that gives as power to legislate. In what 
               <br />
               regard? In one regard and one regard only, 
               <br />
               that is, by remedial legislation. The Gov— 
               <br />
               ernor in Council, acting as a court, has ap- 
               <br />
               pellate jurisdiction in cases of the infringe- 
               <br />
               ment of the rights that belong to minorities. 
               <br />
               It may be appealed to by the minority for 
               <br />
               the restoration of those rights. Then the 
               <br />
               Privy Council becomes a court of appeal, 
               <br />
               not a legislative body, and if they think 
               <br />
               those rights have been taken away, and 
               <br />
               they fail to persuade the provincial author— 
               <br />
               ity to restore those rights, then, and not 
               <br />
               till then, their power as a court ceases, and 
               <br />
               the federal parliament steps in with its 
               <br />
               legislative right. That is the only time 
               <br />
               we can interfere as a federal parlia- 
               <br />
               ment. We can then pass a Remedial 
               <br />
               Bill, but we can only do that, as the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               minister said, it‘ in our judgment it is good 
               <br />
               public policy to do it, or we can leave it 
               <br />
               alone. That is the only provision in 'the 
               <br />
               British North America Act, in my judgment, 
               <br />
               giving us any rights to legislate with regard 
               <br />
               to education.

               With regard to this measure. I want to

               say that the government have at last under— 
               <br />
               taken to do what they should have done 
               <br />
               long ago, and they are confronted with a 
               <br />
               great many difﬁculties which they have 
               <br />
               brought upon themselves. These difﬁculties 
               <br />
               might have been very much minimized had 
               <br />
               they taken the advice of this side of the 
               <br />
               House, and erected the Territories into a 
               <br />
               province or provinces long ago; Had they

               given provincial autonomy to the Northwest

               Their difﬁculties have multiplied in pro-

               portion to the delay that has occurred. The 
               <br />
               disproportion in size between the province

               of Manitoba and the two provinces which 
               <br />
               they contemplate creating now is very great. 
               <br />
               The one is very small and the others are 
               <br />
               very large. What excuse can they give for 
               <br />
               being unable to extend the boundaries of 
               <br />

               in the Northwest Territories, the growth of 
               <br />
               settlement, and certain other things which 
               <br />
               did not exist years ago. There would have 
               <br />
               been very little difﬁculty in extending the 
               <br />
               boundaries of Manitoba if the government 
               <br />
               had undertaken this question at an earlier 
               <br />
               date.

               Because settlement has gone on there since, 
               <br />
               and owing to that settlement, and owing to 
               <br />
               those vested rights, they ﬁnd it difﬁcult to 
               <br />
               act to-day. The principle upon which the 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial arrangements are based is almost 
               <br />
               sure, in my judgment, to create dissatis— 
               <br />
               faction in the other provinces. I feel quite 
               <br />
               satisﬁed that that will be the case. When 
               <br />
               the other provinces come to know and ana-

               tains for ﬁnancial assistance to these two 
               <br />
               provinces, they will recognize at once that 
               <br />
               it is much more liberal than the terms which 
               <br />
               they enjoy to—day, or which they have had 
               <br />
               in the past, and this Will create discontent, 
               <br />
               and will bring them knocking at the doors 
               <br />
               of parliament for a rearrangement of pro— 
               <br />
               vincial subsidies. It is very liberal, I ad- 
               <br />
               mit ; I am not complaining of that, so much 
               <br />
               as of the fact that it will give us trouble in 
               <br />
               the future, perhaps in the very near future. 
               <br />
               In undertaking to do our duty as a federal 
               <br />
               parliament and to create provinces in the 
               <br />
               Territories already in the union, we are 
               <br />
               told that we must treat those Territories as 
               <br />
               though they were provinces in existence, 
               <br />
               having provincial autonomy, having a legis— 
               <br />
               laﬁve assembly of their own ; to treat them 
               <br />
               as though they were provinces which are 
               <br />
               entering the union to—day. I need not refer 
               <br />
               to that again fully, because I have already 
               <br />
               done so. We may properly erect provinces, 
               <br />
               and in giving them provincial autonomy, 
               <br />
               we are bound to give them all the rights 
               <br />
               which the British North America Act says 
               <br />
               they should have, and one of these is the 
               <br />
               right to legislate upon education. Now, I 
               <br />
               say that, as a matter of policy, as a matter 
               <br />
               of duty, according to my understanding of 
               <br />
               the constitution, when we erect these Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories into provinces, we are bound to 
               <br />
               give them all the rights of legislation, all 
               <br />
               the provincial rights. that our constitution 
               <br />
               provides they should have and enjoy; and 
               <br />
               if we give less. we are likely to cause fric- 
               <br />
               tion and trouble. If we go beyond that, we 
               <br />
               are encroaching upon provincial rights. I 
               <br />
               say we. are now going beyond that, and 
               <br />
               therefore I object to that encroachment on 
               <br />
               provincial rights. Have we. as a federal 
               <br />
               parliament. the right to go beyond that?
