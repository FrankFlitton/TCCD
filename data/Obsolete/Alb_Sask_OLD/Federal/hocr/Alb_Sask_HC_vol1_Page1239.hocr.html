               opposite, and I have not been able to gather 
               <br />
               any good reason for changing my views 
               <br />
               on this question. In the ﬁrst place, the 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial grant is a large one, it has to 
               <br />
               be paid by the Dominion, therefore every 
               <br />
               province becomes a party to the arrange— 
               <br />
               ment, and it is for every province to de- 
               <br />
               cide whether this grant is too large or 
               <br />
               not. We have been told by the new Minis- 
               <br />
               ter of the Interior that we have lots of 
               <br />
               money. That is a very pleasant thing, but 
               <br />
               that may not always be the case, and the 
               <br />
               time will come when taxation will bear 
               <br />
               heavily on this country. Therefore, I think 
               <br />
               these ﬁnancial terms should be watched very 
               <br />
               closely. I have not heard the Finance Min- 
               <br />
               ister deal with that part of the subject. 
               <br />
               Perhaps he has ways and means of raising 
               <br />
               money that will not embarrass us much in 
               <br />
               the near future. But this is a large question. 
               <br />
               The other provinces, I think, are getting 80 
               <br />
               cents per head as a subsidy from the Do- 
               <br />
               minion treasury. That is perhaps suﬂicient 
               <br />
               in Ontario, it may be sufﬁcient for the North- 
               <br />
               west, providing they get their land. To 
               <br />
               my mind, this course would be the better 
               <br />
               one to give them a smaller ﬁnancial grant, 
               <br />
               but to give them possession of the lands, or 
               <br />
               a large portion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the lands. It appears to 
               <br />
               me that in so doing you would place where 
               <br />
               it properly belongs the responsibility for 
               <br />
               the administration of the lands. I listened 
               <br />
               to the Minister of the Interior just now, and 
               <br />
               I must say, if I followed him correctly, that 
               <br />
               he advanced a strange line of argument 
               <br />
               with regard to the land values. I under- 
               <br />
               stood him to make this argument, that the 
               <br />
               more lands we gave away so much more the 
               <br />
               remaining lands increase in value. That is 
               <br />
               a very strange proposition, the more of your 
               <br />
               assets you give away the more you will 
               <br />
               prize what are left—that is what his argu- 
               <br />
               ment amounts to. The more land we give 
               <br />
               away the more we will value those that are 
               <br />
               left. Then, if we continue to give away our 
               <br />
               lands, the time will come when What we 
               <br />
               have left will be worth $100 an acre. But 
               <br />
               would that be in the best interest of settle- 
               <br />
               ment? I think not. We want the lands, 
               <br />
               not only for settlers, but we want them 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">especially</span> for the right kind of settlers. 
               <br />
               We want them for good settlers. I 
               <br />
               believe it is very much better that we 
               <br />
               should grow solidly than that we Should 
               <br />
               grow rapidly. I do not know whether 
               <br />
               the hon. Minister of the Interior admires 
               <br />
               the class of settlers that is going in there 
               <br />
               now to a very great extent or not, but I 
               <br />
               must say, that, as far as I am aware, and 
               <br />
               I believe this is the view of a great many 
               <br />
               people in Ontario, it is not the right kind of 
               <br />
               settlers that these lands are being given 
               <br />
               away to. We would rather see 'a better 
               <br />
               class even if we grow more slowly. Rapid 
               <br />
               growth is not the desideratum that we 
               <br />
               should strive for. We should look for 
               <br />
               quality as well as quantity. Therefore, 
               <br />
               I think the hon. gentleman, in pursuing that 
               <br />
               kind of argument, has not justiﬁed his posi-

               <br />
               Ontario has done nothing with her Crown 
               <br />
               lands. He says: I want to know where 
               <br />
               they have ever placed a single settler up 
               <br />
               there. I am not here as the sponsor of the 
               <br />
               Ross government. We had that govern- 
               <br />
               ment for thirty years. I did my best to 
               <br />
               turn them out and I am glad to say that 
               <br />
               we did at last get them out. They gave

               away vast tracts of our estate to their 
               <br />
               political friends, but there is to-day in 
               <br />
               New Ontario a large area of land left 
               <br />
               from which a good deal of revenue will 
               <br />
               accrue to us for generations to come. If 
               <br />
               these lands in the west are worth as much 
               <br />
               as it is said they are and if they were 
               <br />
               handed over the government of that coun- 
               <br />
               try could be sustained for years and gen- 
               <br />
               erations on them. It would seem, accord— 
               <br />
               ing to the hon. gentleman, that the people 
               <br />
               of the west should say : We will part With 
               <br />
               our inheritance, but we will take a mess 
               <br />
               of potage for it. These $2,000,000 will be 
               <br />
               only a mess of potage as compared with 
               <br />
               the value of these lands in years to come. 
               <br />
               Just compare that with the position of 
               <br />
               a man who has fallen heir to a great 
               <br />
               estate and who, on the death of his father, 
               <br />
               says that he prefers to retire on a life an- 
               <br />
               nuity and refuses to take any responsibility 
               <br />
               in connection with the management of 
               <br />
               his estate. What would you say of such a 
               <br />
               man? Would you not say that he was 
               <br />
               a coward ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">So</span> he would be, because he 
               <br />
               would be laying down his birthright, sell- 
               <br />
               ing it for a mess of potage. Man is here for 
               <br />
               something more than to take an annuity and 
               <br />
               to live for ever in peaceful retirement. He 
               <br />
               should take the responsibility that falls to 
               <br />
               his lot. Why should these new provinces 
               <br />
               be put in a different position from that oc- 
               <br />
               cupied by the other provinces? All the 
               <br />
               other provinces have their Crown lands 
               <br />
               except Manitoba. Have you any reason 
               <br />
               for making an exception in this case ? They 
               <br />
               are the most competent and the best able 
               <br />
               to administer these lands. They are on the 
               <br />
               spot. If there is anything wrong in con- 
               <br />
               nection with the administration of these 
               <br />
               lands these people are in the best position 
               <br />
               to make it right. They are the people to say 
               <br />
               what class of settlers they want in that 
               <br />
               country. They may say: We will take 
               <br />
               them a little slower but we will get the 
               <br />
               right kind. We will take the kind that will 
               <br />
               be a big boon to the country, that will build 
               <br />

               <br />
               that they will not regret the policy of a lit-

               tle slower growth, of more solid growth, 
               <br />
               but of growth on right lines. Look at the 
               <br />
               great United States to the south of us. All 
               <br />
               that is best in that great republic came 
               <br />
               from that ﬁrst little band of settlers who 
               <br />
               landed on Plymouth Rock. They are 
               <br />
               the people who laid the corner stone and 
               <br />
               set the foundation of that great republic.
