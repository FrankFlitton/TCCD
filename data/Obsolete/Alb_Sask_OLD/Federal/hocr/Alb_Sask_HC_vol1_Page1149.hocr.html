               Education in Ontario to—day, and for years 
               <br />

               <br />
               there is a Minister of Education, and a 
               <br />
               Board of Education. There are twelve 
               <br />
               appointed members, six by the government 
               <br />
               and six, I think, by Toronto University; 
               <br />
               but there is not a word to the effect that 
               <br />
               any member of the board must be a Protest- 
               <br />

               <br />

               Well, they did not do that. What did 
               <br />
               they do ? But before I read the ordinance, 
               <br />
               i might refer to one matter which seems to

               tlemen opposite. A number of them think 
               <br />
               that because in the early days certain pri- 
               <br />
               vileges were given to Roman Catholics and 
               <br />
               Protestants those could never be taken 
               <br />
               away. They argue that when the Lieuten- 
               <br />
               amt Governor in Council, passed an ordin- 
               <br />
               ance, whereby Catholics had a certain num- 
               <br />
               ber on the board and sectional control over 
               <br />
               their separate schools, and the Protestants 
               <br />
               a like position as to the Protestant schools,

               any lawyer would hold an ordinance passed 
               <br />
               in 1884 by two or three gentlemen who had 
               <br />
               just entered the territory and knew very 
               <br />
               little about it, and who were legislating at-
