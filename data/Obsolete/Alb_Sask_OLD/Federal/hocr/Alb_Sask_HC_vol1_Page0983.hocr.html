               cussion on this question, which has been 
               <br />
               engaging the attention of the House so 
               <br />
               long, it would be a bold man indeed who 
               <br />
               Would be expected to say anything new 
               <br />
               upon the subject. It has been discussed in 
               <br />
               every possible phase, and the arguments 
               <br />
               both pro and con which have been presented 
               <br />
               have left very little to be said. However, 
               <br />
               on such an important issue as this, one 
               <br />
               hesitates to give a silent vote, and therefore 
               <br />
               at the risk of wearying the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House</span> I shall 
               <br />
               crave its indulgence for a very short time. 
               <br />
               There is one thing very gratifying in the two 
               <br />
               Bills now before the House. I do not think 
               <br />
               anything could illustrate better or aiford a 
               <br />
               stronger evidence of the great prosperity 
               <br />
               and the wonderful development of this coun- 
               <br />
               try. We are undertaking by these BiIIS\to 
               <br />
               create two new provinces in the great North- 
               <br />
               west, which a few years ago was scarcely 
               <br />
               known to civilized man, where the Indian 
               <br />
               and the Buffalo were the only dwellers— 
               <br />
               in those vast regions of wonderful extent, 
               <br />
               of immense resources, of almost incredible 
               <br />
               possibilities. Nothing could warrant that 
               <br />
               but the great progress that is taking place 
               <br />
               and the stream of immigration that is 
               <br />
               going into that country, owing to the wise 
               <br />
               administration of the department by the 
               <br />
               late Minister of the Interior, and also as a

               When we look around us it is almost 
               <br />
               incredible that such great changes should 
               <br />
               have taken place in the last ten years in this 
               <br />
               Dominion. We ﬁnd that our trade has 
               <br />
               more than doubled, we ﬁnd our young men 
               <br />

               <br />
               a plagne, now remaining in it and going 
               <br />
               out to build up homes for themselves in the 
               <br />
               Northwest. Not only that but we ﬁnd a 
               <br />
               stream of immigration 150,000 strong com- 
               <br />
               ing into this Dominion every year with 
               <br />
               strong arms and stout hearts to build up 
               <br />
               and develop the immense resources of the 
               <br />
               Northwest. That development is one of 
               <br />
               the most gratifying things to which the 
               <br />
               people of Canada can look forward and as 
               <br />
               I said before the necessity for creating 
               <br />
               these new provinces could only be brought 
               <br />
               about by the wonderful development that

               <br />
               privileges which they shall possess. First 
               <br />
               we have to decide whether there shall be 
               <br />
               one or two new provinces. The government 
               <br />
               of this country have decided that their 
               <br />
               shall be two provinces. Mr. Haultain, the 
               <br />
               premier of the Northwest differs from that 
               <br />
               decision and thinks that there should be 
               <br />
               only one, but in my opinion the government 
               <br />
               in coming to the conclusion that that vast 
               <br />
               region should be divided into two provinces 
               <br />
               has made a wise decision, a decision that 
               <br />
               I am sure will meet with the approval of 
               <br />
               not only the members of this House but of 
               <br />
               the great majority of .the people of the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion of Canada. We have other things to 
               <br />
               do. We have to decide What the bounda- 
               <br />
               ries of those Territories shall be. We must 
               <br />
               take these immense regions, these vast and 
               <br />
               boundless prairies with their rivers, streams 
               <br />
               and lakes, their mountains. hills and val-

               shall be. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\I</span> think the government have 
               <br />
               been wise in deciding that the boundaries 
               <br />
               shall be as is provided in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Bill.</span> We have 
               <br />
               also to decide what disposition shall be 
               <br />
               made of the public lands. Here we find 
               <br />
               that the premier of the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories and some members of this House 
               <br />
               differ from the decision arrived at by the 
               <br />
               government. The government have decided 
               <br />
               that the lands of the great Northwest shall 
               <br />
               be held by the Dominion of Canada. Mr. 
               <br />
               Haultain and some others believe that those 
               <br />
               lands should be handed over to the people 
               <br />
               of the Northwest Territories. FOr my part 
               <br />
               I quite concur in the decision arrived at 
               <br />
               by the government that the Dominion lands 
               <br />
               should be vested in the Dominion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parlia‘</span> 
               <br />
               ment as they are the best able to manage 
               <br />
               and take care of these lands. Then we have 
               <br />
               many other things to decide; we must 
               <br />
               decide whether these provinces should have 
               <br />
               any representation in this House or in the 
               <br />
               Senate and if so what that representation 
               <br />
               should be. The government have decided 
               <br />
               that for the present they shall have four 
               <br />
               members in the Senate and the usual pro- 
               <br />
               portionate number in the House of Com- 
               <br />
               mons. Then we have also to decide where 
               <br />
               the seat of government should be. We have 
               <br />
               in that respect provided only temporarily 
               <br />
               that the seat of government should be at 
               <br />
               Regina and Edmonton until otherwise de- 
               <br />
               cided by the provinces themselves. Then 
               <br />
               we have to decide whether each of these 
               <br />
               provinces shall have one or more legislative 
               <br />
               assemblies. Three provinces of this Dom- 
               <br />
               inion have two chambers, a legislative as- 
               <br />
