               carried into effect. We have to deal with

               it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> as we ﬁnd it and the provinces as

               All I can say at this moment is that if our

               efforts and their efforts could rid the new

               able at the present time to ﬁnd out. It 
               <br />
               might be by the way of legislation, it might 
               <br />
               be through a mutual agreement, or by expro- 
               <br />
               priation. There are some of these methods 
               <br />
               perhaps open to us, but I have only to say 
               <br />
               at this moment, that, regrettable as it is,

               loyally until such time as it may be possible 
               <br />
               to ﬁnd a remedy. That is all I have to say 
               <br />
               upon the ﬁnancial clauses of the contract.

               What is the meaning of the term ? Whence 
               <br />
               does it come, what was its origin and what 
               <br />
               was its object? Perhaps somebody will

               say: What is the use of discussing such 
               <br />
               a question ? The term separate schools ought 
               <br />
               to be familiar to every one. Sir, if any one

               Separate schools, Sir, go back to the old 
               <br />
               days of the legislature of Lower Canada. 
               <br />
               In these old days the system of schools in 
               <br />
               my province, in my native province, was 
               <br />
               rudimentary; there was practically no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sys—</span> 
               <br />
               tem, but from year to year allowances were 
               <br />
               made by the legislature for the support 
               <br />

               the province of Lower Canada at that time 
               <br />
               was, as it is to-day, divided in origin and 
               <br />
               in creed; it was largely Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               with a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">small</span> Protestant minority. I am 
               <br />
               glad to say, and perhaps it would be per—
