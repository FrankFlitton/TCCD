               purposes of the people in that country. I 
               <br />
               endorse heartily the proposition of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Calgary. He has given a great 
               <br />
               deal of study to the question. He is not 
               <br />
               prejudiced in the matter; he is not bound 
               <br />
               hand and foot by any previous proposition ; 
               <br />
               and in that respect he differs from the hon.

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman,</span> who made up <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> mind two or 
               <br />
               three months ago. The proposition of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Calgary (Mr. McCarthy) 
               <br />
               would turn very largely the ranching dis- 
               <br />
               trict into one province, so that the ranching 
               <br />
               laws could be dealt with by one province, 
               <br />
               and the laws relating more particularly to 
               <br />
               agriculture could be dealt with by the other 
               <br />
               province. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rItris</span> &amp; matter of importance that 
               <br />
               the ranching country should be as much as 
               <br />
               possible in the one province. I am still of 
               <br />
               the opinion that the proposition made by 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Calgary is the most 
               <br />
               rpracticable I have heard yet; and I would 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hope</span> that the government would listen to 
               <br />
               it, even at the expense of having two pro— 
               <br />
               Ivinces of somewhat different area, and 
               <br />
               Ithus meet the wishes o_f. the people of the

               Iwest. Surely some impression has been 
               <br />
               made upon hon. gentlemen opposite by the 
               <br />
               discussion to-day. I notice the Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior (Mr. Oliver) looking very 
               <br />
               directly at me with rather a pleasant smile, 
               <br />
               and I take it, he is receiving my argument 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> some considerable degree of satisfac- 
               <br />
               ‘tion. I hope he will not only listen to the 
               <br />
               argument, :but give some consideration to 
               <br />
               this question. He is a representative of 
               <br />
               'bo-th Alberta and Saskatchewan, and not 
               <br />
               like the hon. member for Assiniboia (Mr. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">!Scott).</span> He is the representative in the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span> of that whole country, and 
               <br />
               should endeavour to act fairly between 
               <br />
               'these two provinces and seek to establish 
               <br />
               the boundary line between the two, 
               <br />
               so as to consider in the best possible man- 
               <br />
               ner the interests of the people. If there 
               <br />
               is to be a vote on this question, I shall have 
               <br />
               no hesitation in supporting the proposition" 
               <br />
               of my hon. friend from Calgary. Move the 
               <br />
               boundary line between those two provinces, 
               <br />
               eastward ; extend it north to the Saskatche- 
               <br />
               wan river; then extend it westward along 
               <br />
               the Saskatchewan, and thence run to the 
               <br />
               north. In that way the ranching country 
               <br />
               would be thrown mostly into the province 
               <br />

               lieve the two provinces will then be large 
               <br />

               two provinces should be merged into one, 
               <br />

               extended westward and the remaining ter- 
               <br />

               <br />
               tainly think that the northern boundary 
               <br />

               Mr. OLIVER. I am very glad that the 
               <br />
               amendment has been moved. We have 
               <br />

               ter when hon. members come before the

               by way of a motion rather than keep up

               what might be called a guerilla warfare

               the tenor of this motion that they have

               decided that, because the district of Atha-

               baska at the present time contains only 
               <br />
