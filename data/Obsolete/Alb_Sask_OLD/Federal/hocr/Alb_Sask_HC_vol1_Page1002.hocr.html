               bec the public school is practically a French

               <br />
               instances, is not taught at all. I am told 
               <br />
               that the Irish Roman Catholic of Quebec is 
               <br />
               Worse oiï than the Protestant, because he 
               <br />
               has to send his children to a French school, 
               <br />
               ‘and these children have to learn French or 
               <br />
               they will not learn anything. When hon.

               <br />
               would have us believe. I want to deal out 
               <br />
               justice to all classes of the people in this 
               <br />
               country. I do not like these religious ques- 
               <br />
               tions in public affairs. I am sorry to see 
               <br />
               them introduced, and I am sorry from the 
               <br />
               bottom of my heart that the right hon. 
               <br />
               Prime Minister of this country has seen ﬁt 
               <br />
               to throw this question into the political 
               <br />
               arena in order that he may upset the people 
               <br />
               of this country and create strife, when the 
               <br />
               question should be settled by the provinces 
               <br />
               of the west themselves. The hon. Minister 
               <br />
               of Finance, in his speech, told us of the 
               <br />
               schools of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. 
               <br />
               He told us that they had schools down 
               <br />
               there where the sisters of the church taught 
               <br />
               in their garb during the day; he told us 
               <br />
               that when the right hon. Prime Minister 
               <br />
               was there he said : Why, this is a separate 
               <br />
               school, and that the answer was : No ; this 
               <br />
               is 9. Nova Scotia school, not a separate 
               <br />
               school. Now, we have before us the tele— 
               <br />
               rance of the people of Nova Scotia and New 
               <br />
               Brunswick. In the province of Ontario, al— 
               <br />
               though we have a separate school system, 
               <br />
               we have enlarged upon that system, and 
               <br />
               we have given the Roman Catholic minori- 
               <br />
               ty more than was given them in the original 
               <br />
               Act. Now, I say, in conclusion, that with 
               <br />
               the history of Nova Scotia. New Brunswick 
               <br />
               and Ontario before us, we have evidence 
               <br />
               that the people, if left to themselves, will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> 
               <br />
               kind and generous to the minority, will treat 
               <br />
               them as they should be treated, and accord 
               <br />
               to them all the tolerance that is due. With 
               <br />
               these examples before us, I say that we 
               <br />
               should have some faith in the two provinces 
               <br />
               of the west, Alberta and Saskatchewan; 
               <br />
               and we should trust them as Nova Scotia 
               <br />
               and New Brunswick have been trusted. and 
               <br />
               I have conﬁdence that these great provinces 
               <br />
               of the west will deal leniently and liberally 
               <br />
               with the minority. When I vote in favour 
               <br />
               of the amendment of my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden), 
               <br />
               I am not voting against separate schools. 
               <br />
               and I want that distinctly understood. I 
               <br />
               am voting for provincial rights. I am voting 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this.</span> question be left to the provinces 
               <br />
               themselves. I am voting for that, because 
               <br />
               I have faith that these provinces will deal 
               <br />
               out justice and equity to the Roman Catho- 
               <br />

               Mr. FISHER. It will perhaps be proper 
               <br />
               for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘me</span> to give a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">little</span> explanation of the 
               <br />
               objects of this Bill. Hon. gentlemen who 
               <br />
               have been for some time in the House will 
               <br />
               remember that about ﬁve or six years ago 
               <br />
               —I think in 1899—an Act was passed to 
               <br />
               authorize the incorporation of Dominion 
               <br />
               record associations. That Act was for the 
               <br />
               purpose of authorizing associations of a 
               <br />
               Dominion character for the purpose of keep- 
               <br />
               ing the records of thoroughbred live stock, 
               <br />
               under which the authority was given for 
               <br />
               the formation of associations, each associa— 
               <br />
               tion to be for the purpose of a particular 
               <br />
               breed or class of animals. Under the Act 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">associations</span> were empowered to adopt con- 
               <br />
               breed or class of animals. Under the Act, 
               <br />
               a number of associations were incorporated. 
               <br />
               Recently a request has come from the live 
               <br />
               stock <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">m‘en</span> of Canada. expressed particularly 
               <br />
               in the winter of 1904, to nationalize the re- 
               <br />
               cords of thoroughbred stock in Canada. 
               <br />
               That request was formulated and presented 
               <br />
               to me as Minister of Agriculture at the 
               <br />
               meeting of live stock men which took place 
               <br />
               last winter, and which was called the na- 
               <br />
               tional live stock gathering. They wished 
               <br />
               two things; in the ﬁrst place, to have the 
               <br />
               ofﬁcial stamp of the department afﬁxed to 
               <br />
               all pedigrees Which were to be issued by the 
               <br />
               record associations incorporated under this 
               <br />
               Act, and they wished, in the next place, to 
               <br />
               have this work of keeping these live stock 
               <br />
