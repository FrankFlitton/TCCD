               <br />
               very familiar with the territorial law, but

               <br />
               going to suggest at, ﬁrst that we should 
               <br />
               provide that the new provinces should be 
               <br />
               governed by the Dominion Elections Act, 
               <br />
               but the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂ‘lculrty</span> would be that there would 
               <br />
               be no Franchise Act to act as a basis. Might 
               <br />
               I suggest to the Minister of Justice the view 
               <br />
               that as to clause 6 it should be provided 
               <br />
               that so far as the qualiﬁcation of voters is 
               <br />
               concerned it should be based upon the Fran-

               <br />
               ries, but that so far as the election proceed-

               ings are concerned they should be govern-
