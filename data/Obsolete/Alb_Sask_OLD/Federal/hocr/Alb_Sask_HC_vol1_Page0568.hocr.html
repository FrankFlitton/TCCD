               Mr. L. G. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MCCARTHY</span> (North Simcoe). 
               <br />
               One thought occurred to me when the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) was 
               <br />

               <br />
               unciated this afternoon ? Coming <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> 
               <br />
               the province of Ontario, and as a consti— 
               <br />
               tuent of the hon. member for North Toronto, 
               <br />
               I have a right to ask him this: Are these 
               <br />
               clothes which he puts on this afternoon to 
               <br />
               be discarded as were the clothes he wore 
               <br />
               prior to 1896 should he be again defeated ? 
               <br />
               If he was speaking sincerely this afternoon. 
               <br />
               I would welcome his declaration and would 
               <br />
               be pleased with it. But I have heard him 
               <br />
               stand on platforms in the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario and denounce the late Dalton Mc- 
               <br />
               Carthy for the views which he entertained, 
               <br />
               I have heard him say that no such sec- 
               <br />
               tarian cry as Mr. McCarthy dared to raise 
               <br />
               would ever have any effect in this country ; 
               <br />
               l have heard him say, when Mr. McCarthy 
               <br />
               was speaking on behalf of Manitoba in 
               <br />
               another school case, that he must not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for-</span> 
               <br />
               get minorities; I have heard him say that 
               <br />
               to sit in a Conservative administration he 
               <br />
               would bury thOSe principles, and he did 
               <br />
               bury them from 1882 to 1896. Therefore, 
               <br />
               I ask the hon. gentleman now whether he 
               <br />
               has cast off for ever the yoke of the hierarchy 
               <br />

               hon. gentleman from North Toronto lived 
               <br />
