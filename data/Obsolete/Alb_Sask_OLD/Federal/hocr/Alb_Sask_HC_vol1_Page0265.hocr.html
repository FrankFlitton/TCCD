               them to select a non-competitive point as 
               <br />
               the provisional capital. _ They suggested 
               <br />
               the selection of Medicine Hat, Banff, 
               <br />
               Lethbridge, Macleod, Red Deer or any 
               <br />
               other point. that would be near the 
               <br />
               centre of trade and the centre of popula- 
               <br />
               tion, and that would meet the convenience 
               <br />
               of the people whose business called them 
               <br />
               to the capital and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">convenience</span> of the 
               <br />
               members of the first legislature. But, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> 
               <br />
               some reason, I cannot say what, the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment has seen ﬁt to select the point at 
               <br />
               the end of railway construction and away 
               <br />
               from what I hope <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> be able to show when 
               <br />
               the clause comes up in committee is the 
               <br />
               centre of trade and the centre of population. 
               <br />
               If it is the convenience of the people that 
               <br />
               is being considered, I would ask the First 
               <br />
               Minister to look at the map <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">again</span> and to 
               <br />
               look at the distribution in the local House
