               I venture also to quote the Prime Minister

               Now, Sir, a word as to the changes we have 
               <br />
               made in that clause. I stated the other day 
               <br />
               that we propose to make a. change and we have 
               <br />
               given notice of an amendment which we intend 
               <br />
               to move to clause 16. What is the reason of 
               <br />
               this change ? It is a fair question to ask and 
               <br />
               a question to be answered. Sir, we have taken 
               <br />
               the ground on more than one occasion, we again 
               <br />
               take this ground and it is the ground upon 
               <br />
               which we stand in dealing with the present 
               <br />
               case, that wherever <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">za</span> system of separate schools 
               <br />
               exists that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">syistem</span> comes into force and is con- 
               <br />
               stitutionally <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">entitled</span> to the guarantees which 
               <br />
               are embodied in secion 93 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. Be that system much, be it 
               <br />
               little, whatever it is, it is entitled to those 
               <br />
               guarantees. That is the position we take, and 
               <br />
               when we introduce section 16, as it is in the 
               <br />
               Bill, we had no other intention than to give to 
               <br />
               the minority the rights and privileges to which 
               <br />

               <br />
               mit, this is a legal question, not a question 
               <br />
               or a matter of policy. I repeat what I said 
               <br />
               before, that I believe this question was set 
               <br />
               at rest when confederation was formed, 
               <br />
               because in the Acts embodying confeder- 
               <br />
               ation and carrying out its principles we 
               <br />
               ﬁnd all the machinery, so to speak, and, I 
               <br />
               may safely say a method of working out all 
               <br />
               questions which might come before the par- 
               <br />
               liament of Canada in the then future. It 
               <br />
               does seem to me that the foundation was 
               <br />
               laid suﬂiciently broad and sufﬁciently deep, 
               <br />
               and that the terms of confederation were 
               <br />
               sufﬁciently elastic in themselves to permit 
               <br />
               of an honest and fair interpretation of 
               <br />
               that Act by the parliament of Canada in 
               <br />
               such a way that it will at all times bear 
               <br />
               the fruits intended by its founders, and 
               <br />
               at all times work out, the good that it was 
               <br />
               intended to produce for the Canadian peo- 
               <br />
               ple. There is little we can differ upon in 
               <br />
               that Act. It does seem to me to be a great 
               <br />
               pity that we in Canada who agree upon 
               <br />
               so many and who diﬁer upon IO few things, 
               <br />
               should be at variance on this question, a 
               <br />
               question which has aroused so much un- 
               <br />
               pleasantness, and I am sorry to say, so much 
               <br />
               bitterness in this country. I regret it ex- 
               <br />
               ceedingly. I say it is a lamentable condi-

               <br />
               after all, where are these questions ultimate- 
               <br />
               ly to be settled, where do they wind up ? I 
               <br />
               am safe in saying that constitutional mat- 
               <br />
               ters of this kind, matters of great weight 
               <br />
               and moment, do not end in parliament. The 
               <br />
               courts are to that extent above parliament 
               <br />
               in their right of deciding that they may 
               <br />
               interpret the powers of parliament, they 
               <br />
               have the power of deciding Whether an 
               <br />
               Act of this parliament is ultra vires or in- 
               <br />
               tra vii-es, whether this parliament can in- 
               <br />
               vade the provincial domain with impunity 
               <br />
               or whether it cannot. That principle has 
               <br />
               been invoked a hundred times in respect 
               <br />
               of provincial legislation, the correlative 
               <br />
               remedy has been applied, for in many cases 
               <br />
               where it has been invoked against provin- 
               <br />
               cial legislation which has been declared null 
               <br />
               and void. So it will be in the future with 
               <br />
               regard to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> Bill. Acts of this parliament 
               <br />
               have been passed upon by the courts and 
               <br />
               they will be in the future. It seems to me to 
               <br />
               be begging the question to say that we must 
               <br />
               take a business man’s view of a constitu- 
               <br />

               <br />
               nian’s view, because after all the View that 
               <br />
               will prevail will be the legal View. Why 
               <br />
               not view this whole question as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">&amp;</span> legal one, 
               <br />
               because that is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">what</span> it will ultimately be,
