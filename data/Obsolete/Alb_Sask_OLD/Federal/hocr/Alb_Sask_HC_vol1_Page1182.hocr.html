               Sir <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">VVILFRID</span> LAURIER. For my part 
               <br />
               I would not concur with the view just now 
               <br />
               enunciated by the hon. member for East 
               <br />
               Grey (Mr. Sproule). Speaking for myself 
               <br />
               personally. I think that the whole system 
               <br />
               of giving subsidies to the provinces is one 
               <br />
               subject to very serious objection, but we 
               <br />
               have adopted it at the time of confederation 
               <br />
               and wrong or right we have to abide by it 
               <br />
               and live up to it, although it is wrong in 
               <br />
               principle. As has been said by the hon. 
               <br />
               ' Minister of Finance <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">t-Mr.</span> Fielding) it is not 
               <br />
               a system satisfactory to the provinces. I 
               <br />
               agree with the Minister of Finance to this 
               <br />
               extent that if you adopt this principle of 
               <br />
               going by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">estimate—it</span> is wrong, 
               <br />
               have adopted it, you have put it 
               <br />
               in your Bill, and the reason for 
               <br />
               it was that the Dominion took away from 
               <br />
               the provinces their sources of revenue, 
               <br />
               customs and excise. If that be the case 
               <br />
               there is strong reason to support the View 
               <br />
               of the Minister of Finance that there should 
               <br />
               be no limitation to population, that there 
               <br />
               should be a system of adjustment which 
               <br />
               would work automatically, whereby the 
               <br />
               subsidy of 80 cents per head would increase 
               <br />
               with increasing population. That is a view 
               <br />
               of the case which is well worthy of con- 
               <br />
               sideration. The province of Quebec has 
               <br />
               complained against the present system it is 
               <br />
               true, but the prevince of Quebec is not 
               <br />
               alone in that complaint; all the provinces 
               <br />
               have complained, and without at all com- 
               <br />
               mitting the government. speaking for my- 
               <br />
               self, I think it is one of the questions which 
               <br />
               will have to be taken up by the federal 
               <br />
               government in conjunction with the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces at no distant date. but I do not 
               <br />
               think at this present time, as we are legis- 
               <br />
               lating within the corners of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act, that it would be ad— 
               <br />
               visable to depart in favour of these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces from the principle which has been 
               <br />
               applied to the other provinces. There is 
               <br />
               in the other provinces a limit of population 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l‘eyond</span> which their subsidy does not in- 
               <br />
               crease and so long as this is the case for 
               <br />
               the other provinces, I think there ought also 
               <br />
               to be a similar limit imposed upon the new 
               <br />
               provinces which we are about to create..

               <br />
               the provinces? They are made because we 
               <br />
               took away from the provinces their sources 
               <br />
               of revenue. Need I draw attention to the 
               <br />
               fact that their sources of revenue were 
               <br />
               customs and inland revenue, and what they 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               assuming that they have a certain number 
               <br />
               of acres of land and we are putting an ar- 
               <br />
               bitrary value on that which would be about 
               <br />
               the lowest value you could put on land in 
               <br />
               the Northwest ; not the value of lands <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> 
               <br />
               at the present time. The estimate of the 
               <br />
               land is not at all the amount of land that 
               <br />
               is within their territory nor is the arbitrary 
               <br />
               value the value that the lands could be 
               <br />
               sold at in that territory to-day, because if 
               <br />
               the lands were left in the possession of the 
               <br />
               new provinces and they could sell them at 
               <br />
               the price which they might fairly realize 
               <br />
               for them to—day they could secure a very 
               <br />
               much larger sum for them. But after a 
               <br />
               while, when a portion of the lands are sold, 
               <br />
               the crowding of population becomes greater 
               <br />
               and the lands <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">increase,</span> in value to $10 or 
               <br />
               $15 or $20 an acre, and yet there are mil— 
               <br />
               lions of acres of land in their territory un- 
               <br />
               sold, but held by the Dominion government. 
               <br />
               what about these people ? They are not 
               <br />
               allowed the advantage of the revenue de— 
               <br />
               rived from those lands nor are they receiv~ 
               <br />
               ing any part of their enhanced value. That 
               <br />
               will be a source of annoyance to them in the 
               <br />
               future, and will probably be a reason why 
               <br />
               they will come back here and ask a read- 
               <br />
               justment of the subsidies. Therefore I 
               <br />
               think we should ﬁx the subsidies on some 
               <br />
               principle that will be a ﬁnality. I remember 
               <br />
               on two different occasions, when this ques- 
               <br />
               tion was being considered in this House, 
               <br />
               and additional subsidies were being granted 
               <br />
               to the provinces—I think it was in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1884.</span> 
               <br />
               when we granted <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">additional</span> subsidies, that 
               <br />
               we were told that the arrangement then 
               <br />
               made was to be a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁnality;</span> as the previous 
               <br />
               arrangement was understood to be ; and yet 
               <br />
               the matter was brought up again afterwards, 
               <br />
