               It was found that the system of education of

               read and write. I could show you, if you were

               was proposed that we should require by our

               <br />
               and the ﬁrst thing we decided upon was that 
               <br />
               we would do away with the double management 
               <br />
               and have one set of expenses.

               <br />
               the public money. They so managed that, while 
               <br />
               the Protestant school districts received $197 
               <br />
               each, the Catholic districts got <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$347</span> each ; that, 
               <br />
               while for each Protestant teacher there was

               <br />
               was paid $195.05; that while the Protestant 
               <br />
               school district taxed itself on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">average</span> 
               <br />
               $456.20, the average direct taxation of the Cath— 
               <br />
               oli-c school district was only $277.95. The drift 
               <br />
               of the whole administration was in the same 
               <br />
               direction. The drift of the administration was 
               <br />
               to give the Roman Catholic Church the beneﬁt 
               <br />
               of the public money. That system is not, at 
               <br />
               all like the Ontario separate school system— 
               <br />
               you have nothing of that kind here. Under that 
               <br />
               system public money went direct to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> clergy

               of the Roman Catholic Church; under that sys-

               tem the clergy did practically what they liked 
               <br />
               with the money; they conducted the schools 
               <br />
               or not, as they saw ﬁt, with the result which I 
               <br />

               the trust conﬁded to them, but the money was 
               <br />

               Now, Mr. Speaker, I do not propose to

               read any more of the speeches of the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Brandon in my constituency. 
               <br />
               There are many more of them I could read 
               <br />
               that were delivered by him in that constitu- 
               <br />
               ency, which I think were an insult to the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic people of this country. I 
               <br />
               would like to know what the hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               opposite from Quebec think of the opinions 
               <br />
               of the hon. member for Brandon in 1895. 
               <br />
               They are evidently the same opinions he 
               <br />
               holds now, because when he stood up in 
               <br />
               this House he practically reiterated the 
               <br />
               opinions he expressed in 1895. What do 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen opposite from Quebec think 
               <br />
               of the slurs that he cast upon their 
               <br />
               race and upon their religion? Are we to 
               <br />
               believe that Roman Catholic schools mean 
               <br />
               ignorance and illiteracy ? Are we to believe 
               <br />
               that when church schools have been estab- 
               <br />
               lished for twenty years in a district, and 
               <br />
               where the people of that district have gone 
               <br />
               to those schools. that no man in the town— 
               <br />
               ship could be found who could read or write? 
               <br />
               Are we to believe that the Catholic priests 
               <br />
               of Manitoba took public money out of the 
               <br />
               public exchequer and put it into their 
               <br />
               pockets instead of giving it to the schools 
               <br />
               for which it was intended? Now, Sir, I 
               <br />
               want to say that so far as I am concerned I 
               <br />
               think these statements are gross exagger- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ations,</span> In the county of Haldimand where 
               <br />
               I now live, and where I have always lived, 
               <br />
               I have been associated with the Catholic 
               <br />
               priests during all my life, they have been 
               <br />
               my friends, and one of them particularly is 
               <br />
               one of the closest friends I have, and I 
               <br />
               want to say that I do not believe those 
               <br />
               men would take public money and put it 
               <br />
               into their pockets instead of using it to 
               <br />
               educate the people of their ﬂock. But so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">far,</span> 
               <br />
               there is not a gentleman from the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec or a supporter of the right hon.
