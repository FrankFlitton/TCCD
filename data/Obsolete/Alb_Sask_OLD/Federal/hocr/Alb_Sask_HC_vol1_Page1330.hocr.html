               Minister of Justice his legal adviser and who 
               <br />
               has got to square himself now before this 
               <br />
               House and the public. If there was one

               thing in the argument of the Finance Min- 
               <br />
               ister it was this: What is all this pother 
               <br />
               about ? What are you Protestants talking 
               <br />
               about, anyway ? What are you opponents of 
               <br />
               clerical, separate schools talking about, any- 
               <br />
               way ? We are only going to perpetuate this 
               <br />
               Northwest system which, as it is working 
               <br />
               out to—day, is absolutely and essentially the 
               <br />
               same as national schools with the simple

               clerical instruction or church instruction ac- 
               <br />
               cording to their creeds. Thestatement went, 
               <br />
               .and it was meant to go, and it has gone 
               <br />
               from one end of this country to the other, 
               <br />

               Mr. FITZPA’I‘RICK. I sincerely hope 
               <br />
               that not only will the men in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">galleries</span> 
               <br />
               have their eyes on us, but that they Will 
               <br />
               have their eyes on the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman.</span> (Mr. 
               <br />
               Foster) and if they and the country Will be- 
               <br />
               good enough to read what has been said 
               <br />
               here by both the hon. Minister of Finance- 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">myself</span> {both of us will be content. I 
               <br />
               trust that they will read not only what we- 
               <br />
               said but what my hon. friend (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Foster)</span> 
               <br />
               said. I must confess that I am embarrassed 
               <br />
               somewhat by the wealth of vocabulary 
               <br />
               of my hon. friends opposite. I have to deal 
               <br />
               with the high—water mark of separate- 
               <br />
               schools, and with the ring-bolt of education 
               <br />
               and ‘hand-springs of ﬁnance.’ It is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">em»</span>
