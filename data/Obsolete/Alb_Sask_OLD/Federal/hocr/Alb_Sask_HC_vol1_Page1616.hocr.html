               constituencies there were on the voters’ list 
               <br />
               last November, 13,264 votes, an average of

               1,701 voters in Edmonton or 2,053 in Cal- 
               <br />
               gary. Are the people in the north so much 
               <br />
               more intelligent, so much more powerful. 
               <br />
               so much more wealthy, so much more ac— 
               <br />
               tive, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> they are entitled to undue con- 
               <br />
               sideration in comparison with the people of 
               <br />
               I think it is a patent fact 
               <br />
               known to everybody that the bulk of these 
               <br />
               people in the north are half-breeds, and peo— 
               <br />
               ple from the south of Europe. In fact. 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁgures</span> I have read show that only about 
               <br />
               10 per cent of the votes in Athabaska are 
               <br />
               white people, and all the others are half— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bzerds.</span> Now, it is proposed to give to these 
               <br />
               half—breed voters in Peace River and Atha- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lnlska</span> all this extraordinary and undue pre- 
               <br />
               dominance in votes. Each of these half— 
               <br />
               breeds is to wield eighteen times as 
               <br />
               much power as a man in Calgary. and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ten</span> or twelve times as much as a man in‘ 
               <br />
               Edmonton. It seems to me that if int'elli- 
               <br />
               gence is to be taken into consideration, it 
               <br />
               ought to be the other way—the white man 
               <br />
               should have the greater power of voting. 
               <br />
               and not the half—breed. I understand that 
               <br />
               most of these half-breeds can neither read 
               <br />
               nor write, and that a large number of the 
               <br />
               people in that country from the south of 
               <br />
               Europe, know nothing of the sanctity of 
               <br />
               the franchise—do not understand what it 
               <br />
               means at all; and I submit that to give a 
               <br />
               greater proportion of voting power to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">peo«</span> 
               <br />
               pie of that character is a course that no 
               <br />
               reasonable man would suggest or expect. 
               <br />
               My idea is that a fair way of settling this 
               <br />
               purely local and temporary matter is to 
               <br />
               give as nearly as possible the same power 
               <br />
               to every voter in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">c.0untry</span> in this elec- 
               <br />
               tion. If this new province wishes to give 
               <br />
               these northern areas undue representation 
               <br />
               after it becomes a province, that is its own 
               <br />
               business; but so far as we are concerned, 
               <br />
