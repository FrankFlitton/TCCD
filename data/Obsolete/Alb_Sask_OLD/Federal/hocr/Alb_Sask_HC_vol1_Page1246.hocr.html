               ter of the Interior, or rather the would-be 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior, the member for 
               <br />
               West Assiniboia, has boldly asked: Why 
               <br />
               didn’t you go up to Edmonton and challenge 
               <br />
               the opinion of the people during the recent 
               <br />
               election if you believed the people of the 
               <br />
               west are opposed to the Dominion retaining 
               <br />
               those lands ? The hon. gentleman was very 
               <br />
               brave ; he was not nearly so satisﬁed as he 
               <br />
               tried to make us believe. The hon. .gentle- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">man</span> was quite willing himself to swallow 
               <br />
               the original clause 16 in the Autonomy Bill 
               <br />
               for the sake of getting the plum of the port- 
               <br />
               folio of the Interior. But to—day he says that 
               <br />
               we were afraid to go up to the constituency 
               <br />
               of Edmonton and challenge public opinion. 
               <br />
               Why did not the government select himself 
               <br />
               for the. portfolio. the man they had marked 
               <br />
               out for it ? Because they were afraid to 
               <br />
               open up a constituency where the average 
               <br />
               Canadian elector resides, and to take an ex- 
               <br />
               pression of opinion from men who under-
