               some people are opposed to it. Well, we can

               <br />
               in this Dominion of ours with all its possi-

               bilities and with all its generosity to set an 
               <br />
               example in speech and in action to those few 
               <br />
               people who cannot possibly comprehend the 
               <br />
               reason why the Catholic people, as well as 
               <br />
               a great many Protestant people, are asking 
               <br />
               to have this privilege granted to the minori- 
               <br />
               ties in the western Territories. If I thought 
               <br />
               there were people in this Dominion who 
               <br />
               required any further persuason in order 
               <br />
               to induce them to take a broad and liberal 
               <br />
               view of this question I would perhaps recall 
               <br />
               the words of Joseph Howe. He described 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia as the frontage of the whole 
               <br />
               British North American continent whose 
               <br />
               harbours, citadel and arsenal were not made 
               <br />
               for Nova Scotia alone but were designed by 
               <br />
               nature for the common beneﬁt of herself 
               <br />
               and of her sister provinces. I would ask my 
               <br />
               hon. friend the Minister of Finance (Mr. 
               <br />
               Fielding) to go down to Nova Scotia with 
               <br />
               his following and there call upon the gener— 
               <br />
               ous people of that province to break open 
               <br />
               the gate of that arsenal where the senti- 
               <br />
               ments of generosity, mutual forbearance 
               <br />
               and Christian charity have been stored since 
               <br />
               the days of Huntingdon, Uniacke, Young 
               <br />
               and Johnson, to be dispersed by the breezes 
               <br />
               and conveyed to those centres where the 
               <br />
               Toronto ‘World’ or the ‘News’ may yet 
               <br />

               It has been said that the Postmaster Gen- 
               <br />
               eral (Sir William Mulock) and the hon. Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Customs (Mr. Paterson) will have 
               <br />
               to face their constituents in the future. 
               <br />
               It has been said that great excitement 
               <br />
               exists in the constituency of the Post- 
               <br />
               master General, and that the same reSponsi- 
               <br />
               bility attaches to the Minister of Customs. 
               <br />
               For my part I would ask them to go before 
               <br />
               their constituents and ask them what crime 
               <br />
               they have committed in having been inspired 
               <br />
               and guided by that spirit of religious freedom 
               <br />
               that has spread over Ontario, Quebec and 
               <br />
               the other provinces. I would ask them to 
               <br />
               go and tell their constituents what they 
               <br />
               have done. But, Mr. Speaker, similar 
               <br />
               charges were made against the Liberal party 
               <br />
               not very long ago. It was said that when 
               <br />
               these same hon. gentlemen and their follow- 
               <br />

               <br />

               ada to the Northwest Territories. The same

               threat has been made before. Still men

               These hon. gentlemen opposite may again

               leader of the opposition has already been

               advanced. As a resident of the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories it has been very pleasing to me 
               <br />
               to notice that almost every hon. member 
               <br />
               who has spoken, has admitted that this Bill 
               <br />
               is a most important one, and that on this 
               <br />

               <br />
               not only the future prosperity of the new 
               <br />
               provinces but the prosperity of the whole 
               <br />
               Dominion. I maintain, Sir, that anything 
               <br />
               that tends to mar the harmony or interfere 
               <br />
               with the prosperity or check the develop- 
               <br />
               ment of these new provinces will be in- 
               <br />
               jurious to the whole of Canada.
