               Now, Dr. Carmichael was speaking of 
               <br />
               something he was fully acquainted with. 
               <br />
               He had lived in Regina for a dozen years

               the members of his congregation. And, 
               <br />
               when it was made plain to the members 
               <br />
               from the Northwest Territories supporting 
               <br />
               the government that section 16, No. 2,

               would not guarantee in regard to religious

               <br />
               have to insist upon an amendment. What 
               <br />
               we said in January before the Bill was 
               <br />

               ter the Bill was before us. and when we

               recognized that the government had failed in 
               <br />

               <br />
               reduced the Liberal majority to 75. Why 
               <br />
               was it not 125 ? Why, you could scarcely 
               <br />
               ﬁnd a Conservative in Braemar. I had the

               <br />
               has it come to this. that the government are 
               <br />
               going to restrict the House of Commons and

               <br />
               for a long time on this question. And I 
               <br />
               confess that I am somewhat surprised that 
               <br />
               at this late hour of the day and of the ses-

               sion we have another resolution proposing 
               <br />
               to put further restrictions upon these new 
               <br />
               provinces. I believe that the British North 
               <br />
               America Act gives to these provinces the 
               <br />
               exclusive power to make laws in relation to 
               <br />
               education. We may talk by the hour, but 
               <br />
               we cannot get over that fact—that the Brit- 
               <br />
               ish North America Act gives to these pro- 
               <br />
