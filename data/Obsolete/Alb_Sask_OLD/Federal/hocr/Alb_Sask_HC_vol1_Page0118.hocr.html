               gration and the question of the settlement 
               <br />
               of the public lands are closely associated. 
               <br />
               In most of the older provinces the amount 
               <br />
               of available land is not very great; at all 
               <br />
               events the land which is likely to attract 
               <br />
               settlers immediately is not very great—not 
               <br />
               so great as it is in the far west. Then, if 
               <br />
               we expect population to ﬂow rapidly into 
               <br />
               the west, if we are to control the immigra- 
               <br />
               tion policy, if we are to be able to 
               <br />
               carry out that vigorous policy which during 
               <br />
               the past few years has been converting that 
               <br />
               land into busy hives of industry in many 
               <br />
               sections, it, I say, we are to be able to 
               <br />
               carry on that vigorous policy which has 
               <br />
               built up the Northwest Territories in the 
               <br />
               last eight years, it is necessary that there 
               <br />
               shall be a retention of those lands in tine 
               <br />
               hands of the Dominion government. But, 
               <br />
               if we make a mistake at this point we, at 
               <br />
               all events, have the comfort of knowing 
               <br />
               that we err in good company, in company 
               <br />
               which my hon. friends opposite will be 
               <br />
               bound to consider very good company. My 
               <br />
               hon. friend did not note the fact that when 
               <br />
               the province of Manitoba was created, just 
               <br />
               as we are to-day creating these two pro- 
               <br />
               vinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, the 
               <br />
               land question was considered and that for 
               <br />
               the very reasons which I have ventured to 
               <br />
               advance to-night the government of Sir 
               <br />
               John Macdonald decided that it would not 
               <br />
               be wise to give the province of Manitoba 
               <br />
               control of its own lands. If for good and 
               <br />
               sufﬁcient reasons, the same reasons as those 
               <br />
               which have been advanced by this govern- 
               <br />
               ment, it was deemed well that in the case 
               <br />
               of the province of Manitoba, the lands 
               <br />
               should remain under the control of the Do- 
               <br />
               minion, why is it not an equally sound argu- 
               <br />
               ment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> to say that the lands in the 
               <br />
               case of these new provinces of Alberta and 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan shall remain in the hands of 
               <br />
               the Dominion? But, that did not settle 
               <br />
               the question. After the lapse of some 
               <br />
               years the province of Manitoba revived the 
               <br />
               question. The province of Manitoba <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ad-</span>
