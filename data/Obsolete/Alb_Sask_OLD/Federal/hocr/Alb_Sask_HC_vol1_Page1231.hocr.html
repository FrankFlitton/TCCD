               <br />
               opponents’ argument. He suggests that the

               <br />

               <br />
               when he suggests that at that time, if it

               arrives, this government will be able to say 
               <br />

               and therefore we cannot give it to you. That

               is the advantage of this agreement to the

               of coal lands or royalties on coal. In their 
               <br />
               comparison between the existence of coal in 
               <br />
               Alberta and the existence of coal in Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia our hon. friends on the other side 
               <br />
               of the House do not seem to appreciate the 
               <br />
               source from which the value comes. Coal 
               <br />
               and land in themselves have no value. The 
               <br />
               value in the coal is in the market that may 
               <br />
               be got for the coal, and the value of the 
               <br />
               land is in the demand that exists for the 
               <br />
               land. If nobody wants the coal or the 
               <br />
               land the coal and the land are worth 110- 
               <br />
               thing. In Alberta we have hundreds Of 
               <br />
               square miles of coal practically worth no- 
               <br />
               thing, because there is no market for it. 
               <br />
               Therefore, a comparison between the re- 
               <br />
               venue that may be derived from coal in 
               <br />
               Alberta and the revenue that is derived 
               <br />
               from coal in Nova Scotia is not a proper 
               <br />
               comparison.
