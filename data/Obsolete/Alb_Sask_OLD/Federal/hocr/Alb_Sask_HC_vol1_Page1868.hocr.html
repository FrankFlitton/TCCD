               not know whether or not this somewhat

               that the language employed may go further

               right hon. gentleman; I have said about all

               matter should be left to the provincial leg-

               hon. friend the interpretation I place upon 
               <br />
               this amendment. In my opinion there can 
               <br />
               be no doubt whatever that the legislation 
               <br />
               which has been passed in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories and which is now in force has 
               <br />
               been somewhat at variance with the prin- 
               <br />
               ciples laid down by the organic law of 1875. 
               <br />
               That is a point which I might have de- 
               <br />
               bated with my hon. friends from Labelle 
               <br />
               and Beauharnois when they accused us of 
               <br />
               giving nothing to the minority; that is a 
               <br />
               point which is rhetorical rather than legal 
               <br />
               and actual. One thing is certain. and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> 
               <br />
               is that when Mr. Mackenzie introduced the 
               <br />
               Act of 1875 he stipulated in so many Words 
               <br />
               that the majority could have such schools 
               <br />
               as they thought ﬁt, and that the minority

               also could have such schools as they
