               The ﬁrst step as regards education in 
               <br />
               the Territories was the Dominion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">VAct</span> 
               <br />
               of 1875, section 11. and it was fol-

               lowed by Territorial ordinances passed 
               <br />

               <br />
               Act of 1875, nor any of the 
               <br />
               ordinances—at all events those that it 
               <br />
               is claimed the minority rely upon—neither 
               <br />
               the Act nor the ordinances were the result 
               <br />
               of the will of the people of the Territor- 
               <br />
               ies. From ﬁrst to last the people of the 
               <br />
               Territories had nothing to do with it; they 
               <br />
               were never consulted. The Act of 1875, 
               <br />
               was passed by this parliament, and the 
               <br />
               ordinances were passed by the Lieutenant 
               <br />
               Governor and two or three gentlemen who 
               <br />
               formed his executive, all appointees of this 
               <br />
               government. These gentlemen passed or— 
               <br />
               dinances that, it is contended by some, must 
               <br />
               apply for all time not only to the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but</span> also to the provinces when 
               <br />
               created. The Hon. Mr. Dewdney. sitting up 
               <br />
               there in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1881,</span> with a couple of gentlemen, 
               <br />
               his executive, wrote out 177 clauses of ordi- 
               <br />
               nances in obedience to the dictates of the 
               <br />
               Ottawa government, and forsooth, the people 
               <br />
               of these Territories are never to be able 
               <br />
               to improve or alter their school system. I 
               <br />
               have read section 4 of the Act of 1871, 
               <br />
               which enabled us to pass the Act of 1875. 
               <br />
               The Act of 1875, did not give permis- 
               <br />
               sion even to the Lieutenant Governor in 
               <br />
               Council to pass laws as to education; it 
               <br />
               said : not you ‘may ’ create separate schools, 
               <br />
               but you ‘shall’ create separate schools. That 
               <br />
               was the beginning of it, and because the 
               <br />
               Dominion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appointed</span> oﬂicers up <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there—who</span>

               did not obey—because they passed these or- 
               <br />
               dinances we are now told that the people of 
               <br />
               the Territories passed them. And today, 
               <br />
               when constituting two provinces it appears 
               <br />
               we must work such ordinances into their 
               <br />
               laws. and discreetly alter subclauses of the 
               <br />

               <br />

               weeks later. he accepted it on the assurance

               <br />
               the Bill is in substance the same—Orders

               in Council were passed giving sectional con-

               trol of separate schools, Catholics controlling 
               <br />
               one set and Protestants the other; that these 
               <br />
               ordinances were amended by later ones, 
               <br />
               which did away with sectional control; 
               <br />
               that on one occasion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sir</span> John Thompson, as

               <br />
               ordinances giving Catholics control of Ga-

               That I understood to be his argu- 
               <br />
               ment, an argument based on the or- 
               <br />
               dinances, because there is not a word 
               <br />
               in the Act of 1875 giving more than a 
               <br />
               right for Catholics to have a school separate 
               <br />
               from Protestants. and vice versa. I 
               <br />
               have just read what he said on that point. 
               <br />
               Now, I propose -to show, ﬁrst, that by the Act 
               <br />
               of 1875 no right to religious teaching in the 
               <br />
               schools was given ; second <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> if clause 16 
               <br />
               remain in the Bill, that in itself Would have 
               <br />
               conferred no such right—that it went on 
               <br />
               further than the clause of 1875; third, 
               <br />
               that ordinances 29 and 30 are today in 
               <br />
               force. and contain all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">land</span> more than 
               <br />
               clause 16; fourth, that under the ori- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ginal</span> Bill ordinances 29 and 30, even as 
               <br />
               they are, could have been amended by the 
               <br />
               legislature of the new province. Section 15 
               <br />
               of the Bill provided that every ordinance 
               <br />
               should remain in force until altered by the 
               <br />
               legislature of the new province; therefore 
               <br />
               if the Bill had been left as it was ﬁrst drawn 
               <br />
               by the Minister of Justice ordinances 29 and 
               <br />
               30 would have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been,</span> subject to repeal or 
               <br />
               amendment by the new legislature; ﬁfth, 
               <br />
