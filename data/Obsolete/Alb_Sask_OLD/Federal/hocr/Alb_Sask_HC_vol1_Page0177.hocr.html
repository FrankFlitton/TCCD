               3. Because the section <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">32</span> of the said ordi- 
               <br />
               nance is in contradiction of section 14 of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories Act, in that it limits the 
               <br />
               rights of the minority more than it is limited 
               <br />
               by the said section 14. But of course the prin- 
               <br />
               cipal objection of the Catholics to the school 
               <br />
               ordinance is the absolute control, the choice of 
               <br />
               text books, the school inspection and so forth 
               <br />
               by the Protestant majority. If separate schools 
               <br />
               exist now in name they do not exist in fact.

               I have read these extracts for the purpose 
               <br />
               of showing that when the ordinance of 1892 
               <br />
               was passed the distinctive character of these 
               <br />
               schools as separate schools, as denomina- 
               <br />
               tional schools, as schools controlled by a 
               <br />
               sectarian body for sectarian purposes, ab- 
               <br />
               solutely disappeared. We have here the 
               <br />
               statement made by these gentlemen for the 
               <br />
               purpose of bringing the matter before the 
               <br />
               executive of Canada at that time, and in 
               <br />
               which they set out their grievances clearly 
               <br />
               and distinctly and in the most moderate 
               <br />
               We have it that the clerical control 
               <br />
               of these schools was absolutely abolished. 
               <br />
               Every one recognized that it was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">absolutely</span> 
               <br />
               abolished and in addition to that, I desire 
               <br />
               to say—Whatever we may think of the justi— 
               <br />
               ﬁcation for the action which was taken—it 
               <br />
               seems to me perfectly clear, that in abolish- 
               <br />
               ing the distinctive character of the schools, 
               <br />
               the legislature of the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               did go beyond the powers that were bes- 
               <br />
               towed upon it by this section of the Act of 
               <br />
               1875. Upon that'point Sir John Thompson 
               <br />
               expressed his opinion. In making a report 
               <br />
               on one of the ordinances passed shortly 
               <br />
               before 1892, but somewhat similar in- its 
               <br />
               effect—not so sweeping in its effect—Sir 
               <br />
               John Thompson in substance reported, that 
               <br />
               this ordinance, contracts or diminishes the 
               <br />
               rights of minorities to an extent not con- 
               <br />
               templated by the Act of 1875, and that the 
               <br />
               Act of 1875 must nevertheless be held to re- 
               <br />
               main in force notwithstanding the passage 
               <br />
               of the ordinance.
