               sider for a moment What has been the 
               <br />
               trend and object of the immigration policy 
               <br />
               of the present administration during the 
               <br />
               last four or ﬁve years. It is a com- 
               <br />
               plaint in some of the eastern provinces, 
               <br />
               as I personally know, that the money 
               <br />
               which has been expended on immigration 
               <br />
               by the government of Canada during the 
               <br />
               past four or ﬁve years has been expended 
               <br />
               practically altogether in the interest of: the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories and for the purpose 
               <br />
               of attracting immigration to those portions 
               <br />
               of the country. I am not for the moment 
               <br />
               concerned with discussing the question as 
               <br />
               to whether that complaint is well rounded. 
               <br />
               As a matter of fact we know that the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬂforts</span> of the government, if they had any 
               <br />
               result at all, have resulted in attracting 
               <br />
               immigration to the Northwest Territories

               rather than to other portions of the coun-

               gration to the Northwest Territories has 
               <br />
               been the result, not so much of any efforts 
               <br />
               on the part of the government or of its 
               <br />
               ofﬁcials, as of the advertisements which 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories have received by 
               <br />
               reason of the splendid crops which have 
               <br />
               been raised in that country, and by rea—

               that immigration, is it to be considered 
               <br />
               that the people of the Northwest are likely

               <br />
               have the result of deterring immigrants 
               <br />
               from coming into that country ? We are 
               <br />
               told, I think by my hon. friend the Minis- 
               <br />
               ter of the Interior, certainly by other gen— 
               <br />
               tlemen, that an immigrant going into the 
               <br />
               Northwest is not of value so much to the 
               <br />
               Northwsst as he is to the people of Can— 
               <br />
               ada as a whole. I would not be inclined 
               <br />
               to look at the matter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«from</span> that standpoint. 
               <br />
               1 would think that when you send into the 
               <br />
               new province of Alberta for example 100,— 
               <br />
               000 or 150,000 immigrants each year, the 
               <br />
               settlement and development of the country 
               <br />
               thus created must be a very potent factor 
               <br />
               in increasing the value of the possessions 
               <br />
               of the people of the Northwest who are al- 
               <br />
               ready settled there. There cannot, it seems 
               <br />
               to me, be any doubt about that. It is quite 
               <br />
               true that that immigration may be a source 
               <br />
               of increased expenditure to the govern- 
               <br />
               ment of the new provinces, and for that 
               <br />
               reason some provision must be made for 
               <br />
               such increased expenditure. But to say 
               <br />
               that an immigration of 100,000 or 150,000 
               <br />
               annually is not of beneﬁt to the people of 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories, seems to me to 
               <br />
               arrive in short at this conclusion, that it 
               <br />
               is not the interest of the people of the

               Northwest that there should be any more 
               <br />
               immigration into that country. That is 
               <br />
               the logical result of it, and that is a 
               <br />
               conclusion, I am sure, that no one of us 
               <br />
               would concur in. Then if I have made my 
               <br />
               premise good that the people of the North- 
               <br />
               west of Canada are interested not only 
               <br />
               equally with the rest of Canada. but to a 
               <br />
               far greater extent than the rest of Canada, 
               <br />
               in attracting immigration to that country, 
               <br />
               in having it opened up and settled, then 
               <br />
               surely we might reasonably arrive at the 
               <br />
               conclusion that the people of the North- 
               <br />
               west, through their representatives in their 
               <br />
               legislature, would not embark upon any 
               <br />
               policy or under-take any action which would 
               <br />
               be inconsistent with the best interests of 
               <br />
               the country viewed from the standpoint to 
               <br />
               which I have just alluded. Therefore it 
               <br />
               seems to me that so far as that particular 
               <br />
               aspect of the case is concerned, the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment have not founded their policy upon 
               <br />
               good and substantial grounds in declaring 
               <br />
               that these lands shall continue to be admin—

               to the gentlemen who sit on the Treasury 
               <br />

               and equally appropriate to this occasion. 
               <br />
               That hon. gentleman said that in his opinion

               the government of Canada should lose no

               very good reason. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:Does</span> any one for a mo-

               west Territories are less capable of dealing

               <br />
               Ontario, Quebec or the maritime provinces ? 
               <br />
               Is there any special advantage or reason in 
               <br />
               making it necessary that the people of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories should come to Ot-
