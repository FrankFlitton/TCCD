               it is a departure from what has been done 
               <br />
               under the British North America Act. But

               nothing improper in doing it, there is nothing

               you bring these provinces into the confeder~ 
               <br />
               ation you can establish what representation 
               <br />
               they shall have. That applies to those 
               <br />
               areas already existing as autonomous pro- 
               <br />
               vinces ; it applies also to territories, although 
               <br />
               those territories may have had representation 
               <br />
               in parliament before they were admitted to 
               <br />
               the dignity of provinces. I fully concede 
               <br />
               also that when territories having representa- 
               <br />
               tion enter the confederation you may provide 
               <br />
               that the representation which they possessed 
               <br />
               as territories shall be continued as their 
               <br />
               representation as provinces, although the

               constituencies may cross the boundary line. 
               <br />
               I am not disposed to dispute that much. But 
               <br />
               it seems to me that when you have once done 
               <br />
               that, you have exhausted your power of re- 
               <br />
               adjusting that representation except by 
               <br />

               that it is stretching our powers so far as

               they have been stretched in other cases. 
               <br />
               What I understand my hon. friend to say 
               <br />
               is that we are proceeding under section 2 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act, 1871,

               vides for a census which is to take place 
               <br />
               next year, and we, under our powers derived 
               <br />
               from section 2, declare that their represent- 
               <br />
               ation shall remain what it is until tha-t mo- 
               <br />
               ment, now not remote, when we shall know 
               <br />
               what the population is. Then the represent- 
               <br />
               ation will be ﬁxed deﬁnitely under section 
               <br />
               51 of the British North America Act. I can 
               <br />
               understand the position, but still it does not 
               <br />
               completely remove the objection that we are 
               <br />
               bound to ﬁx that representation now, and if 
               <br />
               we leave it to be decided in a year or so 
               <br />
               there will have to be a new redistribution 
               <br />
               for these two provinces and the proportion 
               <br />
               between the representation of the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec and the representation of the 
               <br />
               other provinces will not be touched at that 
               <br />
               time. In other words, in 1906 there will be 
               <br />
               a redistribution in so far as these two pro— 
               <br />
               vinces alone are concerned, having in view 
               <br />
               the representation of the province of Que- 
               <br />
