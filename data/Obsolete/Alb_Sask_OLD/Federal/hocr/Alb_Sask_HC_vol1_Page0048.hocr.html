               found another evidence of the hasty prepa-

               ration of this Bill, in the general scope 
               <br />

               not agree with my hon. friend in this 
               <br />

               Haultain which he asks to be placed on the 
               <br />

               <br />
               most every provision of the Bill, but, if I 
               <br />
               am to judge from the expressions of public

               Opinion which are coming from all parts of 
               <br />

               <br />
               Bill, and that the school clause, which has 
               <br />
               caused any comment. With regard to the 
               <br />
               number of provinces to be created; with 
               <br />
               regard to the land question, with regard to

               I know, Sir, that in dealing with this 
               <br />
               question we are walking upon very tender 
               <br />
               ground. It shall be my duty some time or 
               <br />
               other to discuss it, but I do not need to 
               <br />
               say anything as to the merits of the ques- 
               <br />
               tion at the present time. I take issue with 
               <br />
               my hon. friend when he says that the Bill 
               <br />
               bears evidence of hasty preparation. On 
               <br />
               the contrary it has every evidence of hav- 
               <br />
               ing been discussed and prepared with great 
               <br />
               care and deliberation, and, if the educa— 
               <br />
               tional phase were eliminated, I do not 
               <br />
               think the Bill itself would then receive a 
               <br />
               word of criticism. My hon. friend (Mr. R. 
               <br />
               L. Borden) says: You have not consulted 
               <br />
               Mr. So-and-So, and Mr. So—and—So, and in 
               <br />
               particular you have not consulted Mr. Haul- 
               <br />
               t'ain. On this ground I am prepared to give 
               <br />
               my hon. friend all the satisfaction, and per- 
               <br />
               haps more than all the satisfaction he is 
               <br />
               entitled to. Upon a recent occasion my hon. 
               <br />
               friend questioned me as to what had taken 
               <br />
               place in the conferences between us and 
               <br />
               Mr. I—Iaultain and Mr. Bulyea. I did not 
               <br />
               think it advisable to give my own version 
               <br />
               on that subject, and I gave my reasons to 
               <br />
               the House and it is for the House to decide 
               <br />
               whether these reasons were good or bad. 
               <br />
               I stated that in my judgment and to my 
               <br />
               way of thinking these conferences had been 
               <br />
               conﬁdential ; that there had been no secre- 
               <br />
               tary appointed ; that there had been no rec- 
               <br />
               ord kept, and that there had been simply an 
               <br />
               exchange of opinion across the table be— 
               <br />
               tween the members of the government at 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Under such circumstances, I do not think 
               <br />
               it would have been right for me to have 
               <br />
               given my own version of what had taken 
               <br />
               place at that conference. I am still of that 
               <br />
               opinion ; and, Sir. I can appeal to the judg— 
               <br />
               ment of any man in this House that when 
               <br />
               you have a conference, the proceedings of 
               <br />
               which are not recorded in writing. it is 
               <br />
               always a somewhat risky process to en- 
               <br />
               deavour to say exactly what took place. 
               <br />
