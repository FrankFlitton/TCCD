               Mr. Speaker, in opening my remarks, I 
               <br />
               said I would endeavour to show that ac-

               cording to the letter, as well as to the spirit, 
               <br />
               of the constitution, section 16 was absolute- 
               <br />
               ly necessary. I also said that, for what I 
               <br />
               believed to be reasons of high public policy, 
               <br />
               it was expedient and necessary that we 
               <br />
               should enact section 16. In the divergence

               for all of whose opinions I entertain the

               greatest respect, I ﬁnd the strongest possible 
               <br />
               reason for saying that considerations of high

               <br />

               doing. Who in this House or in this coun- 
               <br />

               the passions and the prejudices of the people 
               <br />
               aroused in the manner in which they were 
               <br />
               aroused at that time, bringing this country 
               <br />
               almost to the verge of civil war ? Who is 
               <br />
               willing to have the energies and activities 
               <br />
               of the nation paralyzed in the way they 
               <br />
               were paralyzed at that time ? I would 
               <br />
               ask the leader of the opposition <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> R. L.

               to which I have referred, the government 
               <br />
               did not dare, any more than the leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition would have dared, to repeal 
               <br />
               the Act of 1875. Lt chose to continue that 
               <br />
               Act in a modiﬁed form, thus doing one of 
               <br />
               the three things I have mentioned. But, in 
               <br />
               speaking as he has spoken in this House, 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman (Mr. R. L. Borden) 
               <br />
               has virtually taken the position that the 
               <br />
               law of 1875 should be repealed. He 
               <br />
               has told us that this matter should be 
               <br />
               left entirely to the new provinces and 
               <br />
               that we should not interfere, and that 
               <br />
               there is absolutely no danger to the rights 
               <br />
               of the minority being in any way taken 
               <br />
               away or impaired, but that we must trust 
               <br />
               to the spirit of justice and fair-play of those 
               <br />
               who live in these new provinces. For my- 
               <br />
               self, I have conﬁdence in the spirit of jus- 
               <br />
               tice and fair-play among the inhabitants of 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories. But how long 
               <br />
               would that feeling exist and the spirit of 
               <br />
               justice remain if the agitation that hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite and their friends and 
               <br />
               their press have caried on in this province 
               <br />
