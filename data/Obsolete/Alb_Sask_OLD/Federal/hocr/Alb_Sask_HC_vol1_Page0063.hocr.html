               In reply to the hon. member for South 
               <br />
               Lanai-k (Mr. Haggart), as to the resolution 
               <br />
               passed by the city council, or the promise 
               <br />
               made by it. I understand him to say that 
               <br />
               the city of Ottawa had promised a monopoly 
               <br />
               to the Ottawa Electric Company. It is 
               <br />
               true a resolution was passed by the council 
               <br />
               of the city of Ottawa promising a monopoly 
               <br />
               to the Ottawa Electric Company. I think it 
               <br />
               is open to the members of the Ottawa city 
               <br />
               council to change their minds on this ques- 
               <br />
               tion. Immediately after the resolution was 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">passed—and</span> it may have been secured in 
               <br />
               some way. although I am not suggesting 
               <br />
               anything of that kind—~notice of reconsider- 
               <br />
               ation was given, and it was pointed out by 
               <br />
               the solicitor of the company that the resolu 
               <br />
               tion promised something that no municipali- 
               <br />
               ty could give, that in common law it was im- 
               <br />
               possible to grant a monopoly to any one 
               <br />
               company. An illustration of the fact that 
               <br />
               it was against the common law was shortly 
               <br />
               afterwards afforded by something that hap— 
               <br />
               pened in the adjoining municipality of Hull. 
               <br />
               The corporation of the city of Hull endea- 
               <br />
               voured to give a monopoly to the Hull Com- 
               <br />
               pany and the Ottawa Company, which is 
               <br />
               to-day seeking a monopoly in the city of 
               <br />
               Ottawa, entered a protest; an appeal was 
               <br />
               taken to the courts, and it was found to be 
               <br />
               a violation of the common law. The result 
               <br />
               is that to—day there is competition in the 
               <br />
               city of Hull, where an endeavour was made 
               <br />
               to create a monopoly. Now the point made, 
               <br />
               as I understand it, by the hon. member for 
               <br />
               South <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lanai-k</span> is that the city of Ottawa 
               <br />
               had entered into a bargain, or made a pro- 
               <br />
               mise, that they afterwards did not keep. 
               <br />
               It is true this resolution was passed by the 
               <br />
               city council, but I do not think that should 
               <br />
               govern parliament. If we consider that in 
               <br />
               our judgment it is a wrong thing to inter 
               <br />
               t‘ere with the vested rights of the city of 
               <br />
               Ottawa, then I do not believe we should pass 
               <br />
               this legislation. W'e should not interfere 
               <br />
               with the rights of the municipality.

               many of the statements that have been

               remarks which I make, not to discuss the 
               <br />

               <br />
               here that when the proper time comes my 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬁort</span> will be to address this House on that

               question in a manner absolutely free from 
               <br />
               offence to any creed or any set of people 
               <br />
               in this House or in this country. I believe 
               <br />
               that this great question in connection with 
               <br />
               the formation of these two provinces in 
               <br />
               the Northwest is more than a provincial 
               <br />
               question; it is a national question; and 
               <br />
               I believe that whatever men, or whatever 
               <br />
               hon. members on this or the other side 
               <br />
               of the House think, that is the way in which 
               <br />
               we should endeavour to discuss it. There 
               <br />
               are one or two reasons why I wish to tres- 
               <br />
               pass upon the time of the House. One is 
               <br />
               that I represent a constituency of the west. 
               <br />
               which I can say—and I do not do it boast- 
               <br />
               fully—has to—day more elevators and grows 
               <br />
               more wheat. although it is somewhat of a
