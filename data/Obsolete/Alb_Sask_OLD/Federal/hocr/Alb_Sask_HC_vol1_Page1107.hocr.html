               tors have ever read the speech delivered by 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition, and possibly not 
               <br />
               one-hundredth of one per cent of them would 
               <br />
               understand it if they did read it. .There 
               <br />
               is no disguising the fact that the issue in 
               <br />
               the country in reference to this measure is 
               <br />
               on the abstract question of separate versus 
               <br />
               national schools. It is a condition that con- 
               <br />
               fronts us and not a legal proposition, and I 
               <br />
               submit that the leader ..of the opposition 
               <br />
               should have adopted the course which most 
               <br />
               of his followers have pursued, and discussed 
               <br />
               the question on its merits. It is said that 
               <br />
               this matter should be left to the new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. and that in any case the provincial 
               <br />
               governments will treat the minority fairly. 
               <br />
               Well, there are some things upon which one 
               <br />
               man will not trust another, one race will 
               <br />
               not trust another, one religion will not trust 
               <br />
               another. In ordinary business transactions 
               <br />
               it is not considered shrewd to enter into a 
               <br />
               contract without reducing it to writing, and 
               <br />
               where religious or racial prejudices may 
               <br />
               surround a bargain, I submit that it is only 
               <br />
               right that people who are asking .for protec- 
               <br />
               tion should have protection guaranteed to 
               <br />
               them in some form or another. Many good 
               <br />
               reasons have developed why the minority in 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories should not trust 
               <br />
               the provincial governments to do them jus— 
               <br />
               tice. If the legal argument made by the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition means anything. it 
               <br />
               means that the Territories came into con- 
               <br />
               federation in 1870. He quoted the Barrett 
               <br />
               case, and from that he concluded that there 
               <br />
               was no system of separate schools in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories, and he therefore sub- 
               <br />
               mits that section 93 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act could not possibly apply to 
               <br />
               the new provinces. and that the minority 
               <br />
               there would have no legal standing What- 
               <br />
               ever. We have seme hon. gentlemen stating 
               <br />
               that the provinces, when established. would. 
               <br />
               if they had the opportunity, legislate against 
               <br />

               tion. The province of Nova Scotia, when 
               <br />
               it entered confederation, was not satisﬁed 
               <br />
               to take the word of the fathers of confed- 
               <br />
               eration that the Intercolonial Railway 
               <br />
               would be built; it was provided for in the 
               <br />
               constitution. The province of British Col- 
               <br />
               umbia in the same way would not take 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway would be 
               <br />
               built. The construction of that road was 
               <br />
               one of the conditions on which that pro- 
               <br />
               vince agreed to enter the confederation. 
               <br />

               <br />
               there does seem to me, Mr. Speaker, no 
               <br />
               reason why there should be any agitation 
               <br />
               in this country over this issue, or why 
               <br />
               there should be any opposition to this mea- 
               <br />
               sure. In fact, very few members who 
               <br />
               have spoken in this House have expressed 
               <br />
               any aversion to the separate schools as 
               <br />
               they exist in the Northwest. Not one 
               <br />
               single member coming from the Territories 
               <br />
               has spoken a word against them. In fact, 
               <br />
               I doubt if more than two members of the 
               <br />
               opposition altogether have spoken against 
               <br />
               the system of schools which they have. 
               <br />
               That being the case. there is not in my 
               <br />
               judgment any ground whatever for the ap—

               I submit, Mr. Speaker, that this is a ques- 
               <br />
               tion of policy; and, if we read the history 
               <br />
               of this country, it will aid us in no small 
               <br />
               degree in reaching a proper conclusion in 
               <br />
               this case. The history of Canada is a his- 
               <br />
               tory of compacts from the very beginning 
               <br />
               up to the present time. The beginning of 
               <br />
               Canadian history dates from the Treaty of 
               <br />
               Paris. when this country passed from 
               <br />
               French to British control. By that treaty 
               <br />
               the rights of the French and the rights of 
               <br />
               the Catholics were protected. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">next</span> 
               <br />
               compact was the Confederation Act. in 
               <br />
               which special provision was made for the 
               <br />
               protection of the minorities in the provin- 
               <br />
               ces of Ontario and Quebec. and particu- 
               <br />
               larly for the continuation and perpetuation 
               <br />
               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">school</span> systems as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> existed in 
               <br />
               those provinces. Provision was also made 
               <br />
               for the continuation of minority schools 
               <br />
               which might be established in any other 
               <br />
               province coming into the union, and for 
               <br />
               granting a remedy in case any provincial 
               <br />
               legislature interfered with any system of 
               <br />
               separate,schools that had been established. 
               <br />
               In 1875. when the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               were given a form of constitution. it was 
               <br />
               specially provided that the minority might 
               <br />
               under certain conditions establish separate
