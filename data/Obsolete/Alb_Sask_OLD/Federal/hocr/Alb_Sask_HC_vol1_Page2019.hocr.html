               ister of Justice did not intend to suggest, 
               <br />
               although his words sounded like it, that 
               <br />
               Canada had purchased from the Hudson 
               <br />
               Bay Company, through the medium of Great 
               <br />
               Britain, the absolute title to one-third of the 
               <br />
               North American continent for £300,000. That 
               <br />
               sum. as I understand it, was paid for the 
               <br />
               surrender to the Crown of certain claims and 
               <br />
               privileges which the Hudson Bay Company 
               <br />
               had over this vast area. The claims and 
               <br />
               privileges of the company being thus re- 
               <br />
               moved, the property itself was vested in the 
               <br />
               Dominion, the title being in the Crown. The 
               <br />
               very fact that Great Britain having thus 
               <br />
               procured a surrender of the Hudson Bay 
               <br />
               Company's rights over this area then handed 
               <br />
               it over to the administration of the Domin- 
               <br />
               ion of Canada with the evident view of its 
               <br />
               ultimate formation into provinces is the 
               <br />
               very strongest argument that could possibly 
               <br />
               be used that the Dominion should hand over 
               <br />
