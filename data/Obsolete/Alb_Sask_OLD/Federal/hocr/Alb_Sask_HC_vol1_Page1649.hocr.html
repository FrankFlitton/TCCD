               tinctly that matter of the boundaries of the

               question of the delimitation of the constitu-

               necessary to decide Was what should be 
               <br />
               the boundary between the two provinces. 
               <br />
               The next point was to decide how many con- 
               <br />
               stituencies there should be, and certainly the 
               <br />
               question of the boundary between the pro-

               question as to the future of the new pro-
