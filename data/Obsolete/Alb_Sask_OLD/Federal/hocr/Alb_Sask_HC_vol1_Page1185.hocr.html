               <br />
               in 1867. Whenever a province enters con-

               federation, that very day it surrenders its

               of Saskatchewan and Alberta: Will you

               agree to come into confederation without 
               <br />
               compensation or subsidy at all? They 
               <br />
               would reply no. Of that there can be no 
               <br />
               doubt, and the gentlemen who represent 
               <br />

               Sproule) that it may be that the question 
               <br />
               of principle may have to be taken up at 
               <br />
               some future day. For my part, I think

               we shall have to revise the subsidy ques- 
               <br />

               <br />
               not because I am satisﬁed that it-is the 
               <br />
               best that could be. It is not the ideal. But 
               <br />
               we have to conform to the measure the peo-

               <br />
               may come, probably at no distant time, 
               <br />
               when the whole subject of the provincial

               subsidies will have to be taken up in a more

               <br />
               ereign provinces who made a compact. 
               <br />
               They existed before confederation. and they 
               <br />
               had their sources of revenue, and, before 
               <br />
               they gave these up, they exacted something 
               <br />
               from the common government, demanding 
               <br />
               so much per head ot“ their population. It 
               <br />
               was ﬁxed at 80 cents per head. I do not 
               <br />
               know why it was ﬁxed at that ﬁgure. but 
               <br />
               it was the consideration agreed upon. But 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories are not, in the 
               <br />
               proper sense, provinces coming into con- 
               <br />
               federation. They are Territories, they are 
               <br />
               lands we have bought. We. the Dominion 
               <br />

               <br />
               may use that word, of these provinces 
               <br />
               which were for a long time Territories. 
               <br />
               Those Territories are peopled by some who 
               <br />
               were formerly inhabitants of the older pro- 
               <br />
               vinces and also by many immigrants <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">who»</span> 
               <br />
               have come in from all over the world. We 
               <br />
               are deciding today to erect them into pro- 
               <br />
               vinces and to give them autonomy. But 
               <br />
               we are not in the same position with re- 
               <br />
               gard to them as we were with regard to 
               <br />
               the older provinces. So, it has struck me, 
               <br />
               as it has struck my hon. friend from Hal- 
               <br />
               ton <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Henderson) that we do not owe 
               <br />
               these new provinces 80 cents per head on 
               <br />
               their population for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some</span> consideration 
               <br />
               that we owed that money to the older pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. I would not say that I am op- 
               <br />
               posed to giving it, because I can imagine 
               <br />
               that some strong consideration must have 
               <br />
               actuated the government in deciding upon 
               <br />
               this proposal. But it seems to me that 
               <br />
               the argument of the hon. member for Hal- 
               <br />
               ton is a very strong one. As to any change 
               <br />
               in the allowances to the provinces generally, 
               <br />
               we have heard of that for many years. I 
               <br />
               should have thought that my hon. friend 
               <br />
               the Minister of Finance would have been 
               <br />
               able to give something of the reasons for 
               <br />
               the demands made upon the Dominion gov- 
               <br />
               ernment to increase the allowance, he hav-

               ing taken part in the conference of some 
               <br />
               years ago. I think the allowance <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposed"</span>
