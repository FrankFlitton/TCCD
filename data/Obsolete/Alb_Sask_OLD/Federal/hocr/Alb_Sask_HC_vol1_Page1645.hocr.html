               <br />
               But what has been the purport‘of all this 
               <br />
               discussion? Why all this discussion be- 
               <br />
               tween north and south? Why not look at 
               <br />
               the whole question from the boundary up 
               <br />
               to the limit of Athabaska rather than to 
               <br />
               Red Deer north and Red Deer south? If 
               <br />
               we look at the question on this broad basis, 
               <br />
               no fault will be found with the divisions. 
               <br />
               That they are, or can be, mathematical no- 
               <br />
               body can pretend; but that they are fair I 
               <br />
               assert in face of all the contradictions we 
               <br />
               have had in the last two days. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend, the leader of the opposition, said a 
               <br />
               moment ago that we could not take the 
               <br />
               census as a sufﬁcient basis. I agree with 
               <br />
               him. We have not taken the census as 
               <br />
               the only basis, but we have taken also the 
               <br />
               recorded vote, the registered vote, the post 
               <br />
               oﬂices, the school districts, and my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Calgary (Mr. McCarthy) has 
               <br />
               given us in addition the business done by 
               <br />
               the railways, banks and so on, and I think 
               <br />
               also the customs duties. I do not object t) 
               <br />
               all these things. They are all fair ele- 
               <br />
               ments for comparison and to be considered 
               <br />
               in our endeavour to give representation ac- 
               <br />
               cording to population. My hon. friend said 
               <br />
               a moment ago that in the committee on 
               <br />
               which he sat two years ago, they were 
               <br />
               guided by the census of the population. 
               <br />
               That is true, but what ﬁgures did they fol- 
               <br />
               low? They followed the census of 1901. 
               <br />
               in the old provinces of Canada; we can take 
               <br />
               the census as the basis of population until 
               <br />
               we have another census, because we know 
               <br />
               the population will not vary much from 
               <br />
               one census to another. There will be a 
               <br />
               small accession from immigration and the 
               <br />
               natural increase, but nothing to prevent the 
               <br />
               census being taken as a basis. In these 
               <br />
               Territories, however, the conditions are 
               <br />
               quite <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different.</span> There we cannot take the 
               <br />
               census alone but have to supplement it by 
               <br />
               all the information to which I have just 
               <br />

               no population in Stony Plain though it is in

               that High River should have a population 
               <br />

               The right hon. gentleman made a great 
               <br />
               deal of the point that in England judges 
               <br />
               were not selected. I was under the 
               <br />
               impression that judges were selected 
               <br />
               in Great Britain, but if judges were 
               <br />
               not selected there. men were selected who 
               <br />
               had the conﬁdence of both parties. The 
               <br />
               important part of it is that the delimitation 
               <br />
               was entrusted to an independent commis- 
               <br />
               sion, and that'was done after an agreement 
               <br />
               as to the principle had been arrived at by 
               <br />
               both parties. My right hon. friend (Sir

               Wilfrid Laurier) says it was his own inten- 
               <br />
               tion to have pursued that course in this case. 
               <br />
               I very much regret that although I have 
               <br />
               been pretty steadily in the House since the 
               <br />
               lst of February I have heard nothing until 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> of any such suggestion. I have not 
               <br />
               heard any such suggestion from the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman himself, as he will admit.

               I have not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">heard</span> any such suggestion from 
               <br />
               my friends on this side of the House from 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories, and I am inclined 
               <br />
               to think if they had been cognizant of any 
               <br />
               suggestion of the kind they would have im- 
               <br />
               parted it to me. The right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               says he regrets that that course has not been 
               <br />
               carried out. Whose fault is that ? It is his 
               <br />
               own fault. These matters are arrang-
