               ing this city, and a petition signed by a large 
               <br />
               number of the citizens of Ottawa has been 
               <br />
               laid on the table, in which this Bill is de- 
               <br />
               nounced as an invasion of the rights of the 
               <br />
               city. But this House, for some reason or 
               <br />
               another, proposes to override the rights of 
               <br />
               the people of Ottawa. What we see here 
               <br />
               to-day is a parliament prepared, not only to 
               <br />
               invade municipal rights, but public and pro- 
               <br />
               vincial rights; and the people outside are 
               <br />
               taking observations of these things. If par— 
               <br />
               liament will persist in doing this, they Will 
               <br />
               have to account to the common sense of the 
               <br />
               public. This proceeding cannot be justiﬁed 
               <br />
               on any pretext that it is in the interest of 
               <br />
               the Dominion. It is not in the interest of 
               <br />
               the Dominion that parliament should be 
               <br />
               used to break down the rights of any muni- 
               <br />
               cipality. We ﬁnd that the interests of great 
               <br />
               private corporations are protected and ad- 
               <br />
               vanced here, and these corporations enabled 
               <br />
               to evade their obligations. .

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               There was a solemn obligation on the part 
               <br />
               of this company not to amalgamate. It is 
               <br />
               seeking power to-day to make an amalga- 
               <br />
               mation, and its object is nothing else than 
               <br />
               that it may be in a position to increase its 
               <br />
               charges for electricity to its consumers the 
               <br />
               citizens of Ottawa. This parliament is 
               <br />
               setting an example to the legislatures of this 
               <br />
               country to leave out of consideration the 
               <br />
               rights of the people wherever those rights 
               <br />
               are opposed to the interests of private corpor- 
               <br />
               ations. I object to this, as I have objected 
               <br />
               to it; and I shall vote against it. I believe 
               <br />
               that when the people realize what this move- 
               <br />
               ment on the part of corporations means, they 
               <br />
               will put it down. I should like to see the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Ottawa (Mr. Stewart) make 
               <br />
               a ﬁght to a ﬁnish. And I should like to 
               <br />
               hear from the other member for Ottawa 
               <br />
               (Mr. Belcourt) that we may know what he 
               <br />
               says about this interference with the rights 
               <br />
               of the people.

               <br />
               cases you have to do a good deal of talking 
               <br />

               blocked; it could be prevented from going

               the other day a statement to the effect that

               glad to have the opportunity of putting my- 
               <br />
               self on record against the principle of this

               ment in contracts made by two parties out- 
               <br />
               side. I said the other night, and I repeat, 
               <br />
               that parliament should not assist one party 
               <br />
               to a contract to dishonour that contract at 
               <br />
               the expense of the other party. But that is 
               <br />
               what we are doing in this case. I am 
               <br />
               opposed also to parliament playing into the 
               <br />
               hands of a monopoly, as it will be doing by 
               <br />
               putting through this Bill, for there can be 
               <br />
               no other object on the part of this company 
               <br />
               than to become possessed of the stock of 
               <br />
               competing companies in order that it may 
               <br />
               establish a monopoly in its line of business 
               <br />
               in the city of Ottawa. This is the tendency 
               <br />
               of the age, especially in commercial life, 
               <br />
               and parliament should not assist or endorse 
               <br />
               it in any way, but should rather ﬁght against 
               <br />
               it and maintain the rights of the people. 
               <br />
               The people of Ottawa are plainly opposed 
               <br />
               to this measure. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">They</span> gave evidence of that 
               <br />
               as strongly as any people could in the peti- 
               <br />
               tion sent to the Prime Minister. Over 
               <br />
               2,000 citizens of Ottawa begged of him to 
               <br />
               oppose this measure on the ground that it 
               <br />
               was against the interest of the city. I take 
               <br />
               it that that means that the representatives 
               <br />
               of 2,000 families signed this petition. be- 
               <br />
               cause I assume that it is only the heads of 
               <br />
               families that would be likely to sign it. The 
               <br />
               average family is said to be composed of 
               <br />
               ﬁve, so that this means that over 10,000 peo- 
               <br />
               ple of the city of Ottawa have petitioned 
               <br />
               against this measure. Yet, I am sure that 
               <br />
               not one-ﬁfth of the people of Ottawa were 
               <br />
               asked to sign the petition, or that petition 
               <br />
               would have had many more signatures than 
               <br />
               appear upon it. Is not this an evidence of 
               <br />
               the desire of the residents of Ottawa that 
               <br />
               this Bill should not be passed ? Is not this 
               <br />
               plain evidence that we are going contrary 
               <br />
               to the will of the people of Ottawa in a mat- 
               <br />
               ter in which they are deeply interested ? It 
               <br />
               is said that this company cannot earn a 
               <br />
               reasonable dividend. And the evidence given 
               <br />
               of that is their own statement, not veriﬁed 
               <br />
               or analysed to ascertain whether it is correct 
               <br />
               or not. We who have been in the House 
               <br />
               any length of time have often heard this 
               <br />
