               <br />

               the government as expressed by the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Justice, brought into force the 
               <br />
               Act of 1875, both by means of section 93 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act and by 
               <br />
               direct <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reenactment</span> in subsection 2 of that

               the same Act of 1875 by preserving all 
               <br />
               rights under chapters 29 and 30 of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               this respect contained in the Act of 1875, is 
               <br />
               directly set forth and re-enacted. In other

               <br />
               2, proceed by different routes, but arrive at

               Now, my hon. friend the Minister of Jus- 
               <br />
               tice, at page 5985 of ‘Hansard,’ uses langu-

               <br />

               <br />
               demonstrated, to my own satisfaction at 
               <br />
               least, that section 16, No. 2, gives all that 
               <br />
               the Territorial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> of 1875 give, because it 
               <br />
               practically re-enacts it; in truth, however, 
               <br />
               it seems to me to give more: in the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               place it gives the right of separation which 
               <br />
               is the only thing given by rthe Act of 1875. 
               <br />
               The expression ‘separate schools’ is not a 
               <br />
               technical <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expression;</span> it has not so far

               it means exactly what it says: the right 
               <br />
               of separation. Section 16, No. 2, also gives 
               <br />
               the half hour of religious instruction and 
               <br />
               this was not guaranteed by the Act of 
               <br />
               1875. The position then of the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Brandon is this: that he resigned 
               <br />
               as a cabinet minister because of the pro- 
               <br />
               vision of section 16, No. 1, and he came 
               <br />
               back under the provisions of section 16, 
               <br />
               No. 2. which. so far as the character of the 
               <br />
               schools is concerned concedes all and more 
               <br />
               than all that was guaranteed by the Act 
               <br />
               of 1875. And yet, he reﬂects upon his col- 
               <br />
               leagues by referring to his own independent
