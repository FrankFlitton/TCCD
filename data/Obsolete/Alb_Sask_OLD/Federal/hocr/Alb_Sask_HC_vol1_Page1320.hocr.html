               <br />
               hear is to be done by the government. We 
               <br />
               have them informed oiﬁcially that the ten- 
               <br />
               ders have been let and therefore that they 
               <br />
               are out of the ﬁeld, and that it is of no 
               <br />
               use their tendering. The Speaker is writ- 
               <br />
               ten to on this matter by a ﬁrm wanting 
               <br />
               to tender, and he is misled and writes in— 
               <br />
               forming them that the contract has been 
               <br />
               awarded. It is only when a question is 
               <br />
               asked of the Prime Minister—and he ap- 
               <br />
               parently is the only innocent man in the 
               <br />
               Whole government, innocent to the extent 
               <br />
               that he knows nothing about these enor- 
               <br />
               mous contracts—that he learns there has 
               <br />
               been any correspondence or any tender 
               <br />
               or any contract to be agreed upon‘. The 
               <br />
               Prime Minister answers that no tender has 
               <br />
               been let. He leaves the impression on 
               <br />
               this House that there has been no negotia- 
               <br />
               tion for such a contract, that no tenders 
               <br />
               have been asked for and that the matter is 
               <br />
               simply one that has been discussed by the 
               <br />
               members of the government. We ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister’s answer is left out of 
               <br />
               ‘Hansard,’ a most extraordinary thing. 
               <br />
               The whole proceedings, one step after an- 
               <br />
               other in this transaction is so extraor- 
               <br />
               dinary that I think the country will require 
               <br />
               an explanation which will be so full that 
               <br />
               there can be no suspicion, as suspicion must 
               <br />
               now rest upon this transaction and on 
               <br />
               somebody in connection with it. We even 
               <br />
               ﬁnd, to cap the whole climax, a most ex- 
               <br />
               traordinary error in the estimates. We 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that the estimates as printed and put 
               <br />
               before us show that a sum of $100,000 was 
               <br />
               voted last year. We have from the Fin- 
               <br />
               ance Minister a very simple and reason- 
               <br />
               able explanation that the ﬁgures have been 
               <br />
               transposed and if this had been only one 
               <br />
               case it would have been accepted without 
               <br />
               question or any hesitation, but the addi- 
               <br />
               tions show $733,000 which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessitates</span> the 
               <br />
               inclusion of that $100,000 in the column of 
               <br />
               the estimates of last year. The Finance 
               <br />
               Minister’s explanation of that may be ac- 
               <br />
               cepted, that it is added up after the ﬁgures 
               <br />
               are printed. Now even that explanation 
               <br />
               would be accepted, but let us turn from 
               <br />
               that to the summary showing the total ex- 
               <br />
               penditure published by the Finance De- 
               <br />
               partment. and here we ﬁnd the total is $62,- 
               <br />
               179,344 and it requires that $100,000 
               <br />
               which is in error put into the estimates of 
               <br />
               last year, to make those ﬁgures. It can- 
               <br />
               not be possible that the Finance Minister 
               <br />
               has put forth to this House and this country 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial statements that simply on the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst blush, the ﬁrst time attention is called 
               <br />
               to them, show an error of $100,000 in the 
               <br />
               grand total. If that is the case I say that 
               <br />
               the ﬁgures which we have submitted here 
               <br />
               are not to be taken by this House or the 
               <br />
               country as being correct in any shape or 
               <br />
               way, because if the Finance Minister will 
               <br />
               issue his ﬁnancial statement showing on 
               <br />
               the face of it an error of $100,000 in the 
               <br />
               capital addition I say that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁgures</span> we

               the men who prepared the ﬁgures or this 
               <br />
               is done for some other purpose. When we

               ﬁnd an error of this amount there is some-

               Mr. FIELDING. I think when you have 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span> to the large number of items in 
               <br />
               the estimates, the marvel is not that once 
               <br />
               in a while‘some error occurs but that er- 
               <br />
               rors are so few, and I think I may say 
               <br />
               in justice to the ofﬁcers of the department, 
               <br />
               many of whom have been there a' great 
               <br />
               many years, that they are in every case 
               <br />
               capable, painstaking and careful ofﬁcers. 
               <br />
               But an error will once in a while happen. 
               <br />
               I think it is unfortunate that this has oc- 
               <br />
               curred. I have sent for my ofﬁcers and 
               <br />
               I have now the original item as it came 
               <br />
               from the Department of the Interior and 
               <br />
               I ﬁnd in that original item there is no sum 
               <br />
               placed in the column for 1904-5; the sum 
               <br />
               of $100,000 is placed in the column of 1905-6 
               <br />
               and it is also carried into the next column 
               <br />
               to the right, showing it to be an increase. 
               <br />
               Therefore the error in the estimates was not 
               <br />
               made in the Department of the Interior and 
               <br />
               1 must at once relieve the Department of 
               <br />
               the Interior from that charge and say that 
               <br />
               the error occurred in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the’</span> Finance Depart- 
               <br />
               ment, or rather it occurred in the Printing 
               <br />
               Bureau, in the printing of the estimates, 
               <br />
               but in the proof reading it should have been 
               <br />
               the business of the ofﬁcers of the Finance 
               <br />
               Department to discover it. I say most 
               <br />
               positively that so far as the Department of 
               <br />
               the Interior is concerned, they sent the 
               <br />
               Item over in proper form.
