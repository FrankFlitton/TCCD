               I want some more light on the subject. I 
               <br />
               think it will be admitted that the Dominion 
               <br />
               parliament in 1881 had power to legislate 
               <br />
               as to this exemption up to the time 
               <br />
               that these unorganized Territories, should 
               <br />
               be created into provinces. While 
               <br />
               these were unorganized Territories, and 
               <br />
               while they were not formed into provinces 
               <br />
               the only way by which that legislation 
               <br />
               could be interfered with would be by a re- 
               <br />
               peal of the statute. That, of course has 
               <br />
               not taken place up to the present ﬁme nor 
               <br />
               should it have taken place, because, in so 
               <br />
               far as the Dominion parliament in 1881 had 
               <br />
               power to legislate on the subject, I agree 
               <br />
               with the contention that it is the duty of 
               <br />
               this parliament to observe and maintain that 
               <br />
               compact. As my hon. friend beside me says 
               <br />
               it is a contract. I have not been able to give 
               <br />
               as much attention to this matter as I should 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have,</span> and I may be wrong, but this ques- 
               <br />
               tion strikes me: Had the parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada, in 1881, power to legislate for 
               <br />
               these unorganized Territories beyond the 
               <br />
               time that they remained unorganized Ter— 
               <br />
               ritories and to extend the operation of 
               <br />
               that legislation to the time after they be- 
               <br />
               came provinces ? If they had the power 
               <br />
               to do so we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aire</span> right still in continuing the 
               <br />
               exemption that is proposed here, but if they 
               <br />
               had not the power to do so, if when these 
               <br />
               unorganized Territories are created into pl'O- 
               <br />
               vinces they should have the right under the 
               <br />
               British North America Act to deal exclusive- 
               <br />
               ly with the subject of taxation then this 
               <br />
               question suggests itself to me: Are we 
               <br />
               justiﬁed in making good,. as I believe we 
               <br />
               would be by this provision, what might have 
               <br />
               been an excessive power exercised by the 
               <br />
               Dominion parliament at the time that this 
               <br />
               legislation was enacted in 1881? If that 
               <br />
               could be made clear to me I could quite 
               <br />
               easily see the position of the government 
               <br />
               and of those who are supporting it on the 
               <br />
               other side of the House. But, I would like 
               <br />
               to see the necessity for enacting this sec— 
               <br />
               tion 23. If we were to put something into 
               <br />
               this Bill which would destroy the rights of 
               <br />
               the Canadian Pacific Railway under the en- 
               <br />
               actment of 1881 we would be doing wrong 
               <br />
               just as much as we would be doing wrong 
               <br />
               by repealing the Act, but if we leave that 
               <br />
               absolutely alone, if we are absolutely silent 
               <br />
               in these Bills creating these provinces as to 
               <br />
               the exemption clause. what is the position ? 
               <br />
               If the Act passed by the parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada in 1881 was good or suﬂicient and 
               <br />
               they had the power to extend the exemp- 
               <br />
               tion as they have speciﬁed that they have 
               <br />
               extended it to the time when these 
               <br />
               Territories should become provinces, then, 
               <br />
               that cannot affect it, because, even if there 
               <br />
               is a provision in the British North America 
               <br />
               Act which gives the Territories exclusive 
               <br />
               jurisdiction as to taxation after they be-

               you. The hon. gentleman has been saying a 
               <br />
               great deal, and so have all the legal gentle-- 
               <br />
               men in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2House</span> about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Sanctity of con~ 
               <br />
               tracts and of vested rights. Let me tell the- 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen, and especially the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice, that tue government is compell- 
               <br />
               ing these little provinces to assume the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">obli—</span> 
               <br />
               gations of the Dominion. The Dominion, 
               <br />
               which entered into this contract and granted 
               <br />
               something to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Canadian Paciﬁc Railway, 
               <br />
               whose honour is at stake, has no hesitation 
               <br />
               in imposing upon these two little provinces 
               <br />
               the discharge of the obdigation they entered 
               <br />
               upon. If the minister wants <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> unload the 
               <br />
               obligation on the smaller party—on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro-»</span> 
               <br />
               vinces—he ought to make provision for the 
               <br />
               provinces assuming the obligation of the- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grealter</span> parliament. But he has not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">done'</span> 
               <br />
               so, and I do not think there are any morals 
               <br />
               in that. When hon. gentlemen are talking 
               <br />
               about morals in law and the sanctity of‘ 
               <br />
               contracts, I asked them what is their- 
               <br />
               opinion of unloading on these two new 
               <br />
               governments in the west, these new settlers, 
               <br />
