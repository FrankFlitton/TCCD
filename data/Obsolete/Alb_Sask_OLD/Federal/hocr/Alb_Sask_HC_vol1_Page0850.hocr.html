               Well, the Territories got additional represen- 
               <br />
               tation, and I would like to know to what 
               <br />
               extent these gentlemen were consulted in 
               <br />
               reference to this Bill. The Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior was not consulted, the Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance was not consulted, Mr. Haultain 
               <br />
               was not consulted, and the reason which the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister gave for postponing auton- 
               <br />
               omy was not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">”carried</span> out. It is interesting 
               <br />
               to note that when the Prime Minister intro- 
               <br />
               duced this Bill, his speech occupies forty- 
               <br />
               two columns of ‘ Hansard ’ and twenty-two 
               <br />
               of these columns are devoted to the school 
               <br />
               question. The whole time of the Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister was taken up in addressing the mem- 
               <br />
               bers on his own side of the House and try- 
               <br />
               ing to convince them. It was a most elo- 
               <br />
               quent address, and I have read it over and 
               <br />
               over again, and at its conclusion every man 
               <br />
               on the other side of the House With one 
               <br />
               exception battered his desk and clapped 
               <br />
               with the greatest enthusiasm. This indi- 
               <br />
               cated that they were absolutely and entirely 
               <br />
               satisﬁed with the ﬁrst draft of the Bill 
               <br />
               brought down to this House. You can talk 
               <br />
               as much as you like about a compromise. 
               <br />
               but the ﬁrst Bill brought into this House 
               <br />
               was the Bill the Prime Minister wanted 
               <br />
               passed and it would have been passed it the 
               <br />
               government had been able to pass it. Well, 
               <br />
               Sir, the scene was changed and the play on 
               <br />
               the other side of the House, from the date 
               <br />
               of the introduction of the Bill, to the pre- 
               <br />
               sent hour, is.worthy of the stage. When 
               <br />
               the member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) arrived 
               <br />
               in town he censured the Prime Minister for 
               <br />
               not consulting him on this important ques- 
               <br />
               tion, and there is no doubt but that the Bill 
               <br />
               was drafted by a set of men who were not 
               <br />
               familiar with the conditions in that western 
               <br />
               country. The only man We had who had 
               <br />
               the ability to stand up for the west was not 
               <br />
