               prices, as is now done, to induce settlement. 
               <br />
               Much of this land might be disposed of to 
               <br />
               great immediate proﬁt if a purely revenue 
               <br />

               Speaker, that I am amazed that any man 
               <br />
               in this House would give voice to such 
               <br />
               a suggestion, for such a violent invas-

               ion of provincial autonomy, as is con- 
               <br />
               tained in the suggestion of my hon. friend. 
               <br />
               It needs no argument to show the differ- 
               <br />
               ence that might be made in the receipts 
               <br />
               from this public domain by the application 
               <br />
               of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁerent</span> policy. The policy which is 
               <br />
               being pursued by this government is a settle- 
               <br />
               ment policy which yields practically no 
               <br />
               net revenue. There has been practically 
               <br />
               no net revenue from these lands in Mani- 
               <br />
               toba and the Northwest Territories since 
               <br />
               these lands were acquired thirty-ﬁve years 
               <br />

               But a purely revenue policy might be 
               <br />
               followed, as it would be the right of those 
               <br />
               provinces, if they were to assume the res—

               from the settlement .policy of the federal

               sity to-adopt a purely revenue policy; and 
               <br />
               .the suggestion contained in the speech of 
               <br />
               the hon. leader of the opposition would 
               <br />
               simply amount to putting a limitation upon 
               <br />
               the new provinces amounting in the years 
               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. Speaker, I dare say that it is hard

               members who felt the seriousness of the

               proposals different difficulties. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Brandon (Mr. Sifton) explained 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> House a week ago to-night that the 
               <br />
               school phase of the matter constituted the 
               <br />
               most serious difﬁculty for him. I have to 
               <br />
               confess that another detail constituted a 
               <br />
               very serious difﬁculty for me. That was 
               <br />
               with regard to the Canadian Paciﬁc Rail- 
               <br />
               way tax exemption embodied in section 23 
               <br />
               ot‘ the Bills. This is one feature in these 
               <br />
               provincial establishment proposals with re- 
               <br />
               gard to which 1 think that less than justice 
               <br />
               has been meted out to the people of those 
               <br />
               new provinces. As a matter of fact, as the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister can testify, and as my fel- 
               <br />
               low Liberal members from the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories know, in my opinion the un- 
               <br />
               settled position of that tax exemption mat- 
               <br />
               ter was a suﬂicient reason to justify fur— 
               <br />
               ther delay in granting autonomy to the 
               <br />
               Territories; and if act, protest or inﬂuence 
               <br />
               of mine could have prevented the prepara— 
               <br />
               tion and presentation of these Bills, the Bills 
               <br />
               would not be before the House. But when 
               <br />
               I found this Dominion government unani- 
               <br />
               mously, together with the Northwest govern— 
               <br />

               <br />
               bers all determined to proceed now, I had to 
               <br />
               come to a decision which would either pl‘e- 
               <br />
               vent me from exercising any inﬂuence in 
               <br />
               the details of autonomy or agree to forego 
               <br />
               my own opinion on the point, agree to ac- 
               <br />
               tion now, and take my part in obtaining a 
               <br />
               settlement of terms and conditions accord- 
               <br />
               ing to the wishes of the electors whom I 
               <br />
               represent. Even now, were I not satis- 
               <br />
               ﬁed that the ﬁnancial terms as a whole are 
               <br />
               so ample and generous as to offset in a 
               <br />
               great measure the ﬁnancial handicap meant 
               <br />
               by the exemption feature, I should deem 
               <br />
               it my duty to myself and the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories to oppose the Bills. I may say 
               <br />
               further that the overturning by the Supreme 
               <br />
               Court of the decision given by the Mani- 
               <br />
               toba Court in 1903, does seriously lessen the 
               <br />
               force of the position I held against creating 
               <br />
