               Throughout this whole discussion I have 
               <br />
               desired that this Bill should be referred to 
               <br />
               the Committee on Agriculture. What have 
               <br />
               we a Committee on Agriculture for if not 
               <br />
               to consider such questions as this? The 
               <br />
               fact that it has been before the Committee 
               <br />
               of the Whole House is no answer to the 
               <br />
               present motion for a reference. It is provided 
               <br />
               by our rules, and sanctioned by our practice, 
               <br />
               that a motion of this kind may be made 
               <br />
               at any stage of a Bill. I do not wish to be 
               <br />
               considered as opposing the principle of the 
               <br />
               Bill. .I recognize that the minister has de- 
               <br />
               voted much time and care to it, and it is 
               <br />
               shorn of many of the objectionable features 
               <br />
               which it had when it was introduced, Al- 
               <br />
               though I believe, as the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Brantford has suggested, that it is still full 
               <br />
               of the seeds of imperfection, yet these might 
               <br />
               be very well eliminated if it were referred 
               <br />
               to a special committee; and we have ex— 
               <br />
               cellent examples for that course. We have 
               <br />
               the example of Great Britain, a country 
               <br />
               many centuries older than our country, 
               <br />
               where, after a full and exhaustive investi- 
               <br />
               gation, it was decided that such a measure 
               <br />
               was not adapted to the conditions of the 
               <br />
               country; and there may be ground for 
               <br />
               pausing to see whether this Bill is adapted 
               <br />
               to the conditions of Canada. At all events, 
               <br />
               we would have experts on these matters, 
               <br />
               not only on the committee but coming be- 
               <br />
               fore the committee to give evidence. We 
               <br />
               would also have, what the members of the 
               <br />
               administration, from the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               down. have been pressing in Railway Bills 
               <br />
               that those most interested can come before 
               <br />
               the committee as they cannot come before 
               <br />
               the House, and express their views. I am 
               <br />
               entirely in accord with the practice that has 
               <br />
               prevailed, of threshing out these matters be- 
               <br />
               fore the House ; but this is a matter requir- 
               <br />
               ing special investigation, and the know— 
               <br />
               ledge of experts and practical farmers. I 
               <br />
               believe it is highly in the interest of 
               <br />
               agriculture that the Bill should be re— 
               <br />
               ferred to the Committee on Agriculture. with 
               <br />
               power to send for persons. papers and docu- 
               <br />
               meuts. and that the-re should be a thorough 
               <br />
               investigation in order that the faults still in 
               <br />
               the Bill may be eliminated, or, if not, that 
               <br />
               the Bill be discontinued.

               stowed upon this Bill, in the honest and

               faithful endeavour to obtain by legislation

               pure seed for the farmers of this country.

               But if, as appears to be the case, the Bill,

               which has been through several stages in 
               <br />

               sired, the hon. Minister of Agriculture 
               <br />
               should hesitate before he obstructs such 
               <br />
               further investigation as would throw light 
               <br />
               upon the Bill, and enable it to become more 
               <br />
               workable. The hon. gentleman suggested, 
               <br />
               I think, in committee, that I was here to 
               <br />
               oppose the Bill. ‘I am not opposing it. I 
               <br />
               recognize that the principle involved in the 
               <br />
               Bill is one very much to be encouraged, and 
               <br />
               I would not detract one iota from the credit 
               <br />
               due to the hon. minister for the labour 
               <br />
               which he has bestowed upon it. There are 
               <br />
               three classes aﬂected by this legislation—- 
               <br />
               the seed merchant, the farmer who pur- 
               <br />
               chases seed, and the farmer who grows his 
               <br />
               own seed. The farmer who grows his own 
               <br />
               seed has a different line of argument to ad- 
               <br />
               vance with respect to the provisions of this 
               <br />
               Bill, from those of the farmer who pur- 
               <br />
               chases his seed. The latter is entitled to the 
               <br />
               fullest protection. In my opinion, which 
               <br />
               entirely coincides with that of the hon. 
               <br />
               minister, it is of the utmost importance 
               <br />
               that pure seed should be guaranteed to the 
               <br />
               trade at large. As the hon. minister has 
               <br />
               said, this Bill has been before this House 
               <br />
               practically for two years. That may be so : 
               <br />
               but when it came to be considered in com- 
               <br />
               mittee during the ﬁrst few days of the 
               <br />
               present session, it was found to be so weak 
               <br />
               and to fall short in so many important re- 
               <br />
               spects that the hon. gentleman was forced 
               <br />
               to withdraw it and have it reprinted; and 
               <br />
               when it came down yesterday in its re- 
               <br />
               printed form, we found it to be still im- 
               <br />
               perfect. In one clause especially, it had to 
               <br />
               be amended. So the hon. minister is learn- 
               <br />
               ing day by day that even when this Bill 
               <br />
               goes through its ﬁnal stages, there will be 
               <br />
               much in it to be altered; and if it can be 
               <br />
               altered in one respect, it can be in others. 
               <br />
               I have not heard the hon. minister say that 
               <br />
               he has received expert testimony upon the 
               <br />
               clauses referred to by the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Brantford. It is of the utmost importance 
               <br />
               that expert testimony should be had before 
               <br />
               the various clauses of the Bill can be intel- 
               <br />
               ligently dealt with. I therefore submit to 
               <br />
               the hon. Minister of Agriculture that it 
               <br />
               would be in the interest of the purpose of 
               <br />
               this Bill, as a practical working measure, to 
               <br />
               have it put into such form that it would 
               <br />
               serve the interest of all the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">classes</span> of peo-

               ple sought to be beneﬁted or protected by 
               <br />
               it. There is one clause to which I have re— 
               <br />
               peatedly, I fear with tiresomeness, drawn 
               <br />
               the attention of the House and the hon. min- 
               <br />
               ister, that is, subsection 2 of section 8. It 
               <br />
               Is from my point of view an unheard-of 
               <br />
               thing to legislate that the honest agent for
