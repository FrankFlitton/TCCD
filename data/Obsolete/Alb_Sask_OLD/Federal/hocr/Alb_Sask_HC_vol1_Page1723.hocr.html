               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">information</span> asked for yesterday from 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister with regard to schools. 
               <br />
               He had told us that the number of schools 
               <br />
               in this district, and I asked him to state 
               <br />
               the attendance at those schools, distingu- 
               <br />
               ishing if possible between white, half- 
               <br />
               breed and the Indian pupils. It may not 
               <br />
               be possible to get <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> information, but I 
               <br />
               think if the attempt had been made in time 
               <br />
               it could have been procured. Some other 
               <br />
               sources of information may be discovered 
               <br />
               between now and Monday. That informa- 
               <br />
               tion is important, as enabling us to come 
               <br />
               to a conclusion as to the population in that 
               <br />
               northern country. Those are all the items 
               <br />
               I think of at the moment. If anything 
               <br />
               should occur to me between now and an 
               <br />

               hon. gentleman a reasonable time to pre- 
               <br />

               Mr. W.' WRIGHT. I pointed out some 
               <br />
               time ago that the census ﬁgures showing 
               <br />
               the population of Edmonton and Calgary 
               <br />
               extended into the country for miles and 
               <br />
               not for the cities alone.

               Mr. OLIVER. I can only give the infor-

               mation I get from the census bureau, and 
               <br />
               I took it for granted that when the census 
               <br />
               shows the population of the towns of Ed- 
               <br />

               like to urge the point to which I have just 
               <br />
               called attention. For instance take Pincher 
               <br />
               Creek. In 1901, according <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.to</span> the census it 
               <br />
               had a population of 837. But we are told 
               <br />
               that since <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">then.</span> it has very considerably in- 
               <br />
               creased. It seems to me it would be fairer 
               <br />
               to include incorporated villages over say 500.
