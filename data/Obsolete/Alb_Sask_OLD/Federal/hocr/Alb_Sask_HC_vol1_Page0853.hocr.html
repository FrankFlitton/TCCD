               whether he would take the position which 
               <br />
               he is taking upon the Bill. I have nothing 
               <br />
               to quarrel with in that attitude of the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman. But he went on to express his 
               <br />
               great sympathy for members on the gov— 
               <br />

               bound to stand by the government—bound 
               <br />
               in what way I do not know—in its proposed 
               <br />
               legislation in regard to the Northwest. I 
               <br />
               must say to the hon. gentleman that we can— 
               <br />
               not accept his sympathy on this side—we 
               <br />
               do not want it. And I take strong excep- 
               <br />
               tion to the innuendo in his remarks as to the 
               <br />
               attitude of government members in support- 
               <br />
               ing this Bill. I cannot understand him. 
               <br />
               Surely the hon. gentleman will not say that 
               <br />
               the same arguments for toleration, for re- 
               <br />

               <br />
               peal to him may not also appeal to indivi-

               There are several Conservative members vot- 
               <br />
               ing for the Autonomy Bills not because they 
               <br />
               personally approve <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«of</span> the principle, but because 
               <br />
               they believe it to be their duty to represent 
               <br />
               the feeling or a majority of their constituents. 
               <br />
               On the Liberal benches the members do not. 
               <br />
               appear to be afﬂicted with any concern as to 
               <br />
               how the majority of their constituents view the 
               <br />
               matter.

               I think that was a very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unkind</span> reﬂection 
               <br />
               for the chief organ of the Conservative 
               <br />
               party in Eastern Ontario to make upon 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite who support this Bill. 
               <br />
               Boiled down, what does it mean ? It means, 
               <br />
               if it means anything, that these hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men are trying to save their parliamentary 
               <br />
               hides by this vote. I think that a very poor 
               <br />
               compliment to pay to these gentlemen. I 
               <br />
               do not believe that to be the reason actuat-
