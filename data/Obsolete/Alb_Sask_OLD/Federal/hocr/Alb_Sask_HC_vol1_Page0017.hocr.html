               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. I am delight- 
               <br />
               ed that my hon. friend (Mr. Sproule) has 
               <br />
               asked me that question. In 1875, when the 
               <br />
               Bill to which I have referred went through 
               <br />
               parliament, Mr. Brown who was a member 
               <br />
               of one branch of this parliament, opposed 
               <br />
               the introduction of the new clause in that 
               <br />
               Bill providing for separate schools. He 
               <br />
               opposed it with all his might. He told 
               <br />
               the House that he had not changed his 
               <br />
               mind upon the subject, but he told the 
               <br />
               House also that if the principle of separate 
               <br />
               schools was introduced. then, according to 
               <br />
               the terms of the constitution. it was intro- 
               <br />
               duced for all time to come. I am delighted 
               <br />
               that my hon. friend brought my attention 
               <br />
               to this, because really the whole subject 
               <br />
               is contained in the question of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend. We have to decide this problem 
               <br />
               upon the very terms of the legislation which 
               <br />
               was introduced in 1875. Let me give to my 
               <br />
               hon. friend all the information to which he 
               <br />
               is entitled, and which I fain would hope 
               <br />
               will fall upon favourable ground; I will 
               <br />
               give him the whole history of that matter. 
               <br />
               Mr. Mackenzie himself introduced the Bill 
               <br />
               in 1875. The Bill as first introduced made 
               <br />
               no mention of separate schools; but after 
               <br />
               he had sat down and when Sir John A. 
               <br />
               Macdonald had spoken on the subject, Mr. 
               <br />
               Blake rose and brought this very subject 
               <br />
               of separate schools to the attention of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House,</span> and he did it with a height and 
               <br />
               breadth of thought which I hope will com- 
               <br />
               mand the admiration of my hon. friend. 
               <br />
               This is what Mr. Blake said :

               The task which the ministry had set for itself 
               <br />
               was the most important it was possible to 
               <br />
               conceive. To found primary institutions under 
               <br />

               <br />
               and the more sanguine among us think millions

               of men and families settled and ﬂourishing. 
               <br />
               was one of the noblest undertakings that 
               <br />
               could be entered upon by any legislative body, 
               <br />
               and it was no small indication of the power 
               <br />

               tant task. He agreed with the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Kingston that the task was one that re- 
               <br />
               quired time, consideration and deliberation, 
               <br />
               and they must take care that no false steps 
               <br />
               were made in such work. He did not agree 
               <br />
               with that right hon. gentleman that the gov— 
               <br />
               ernment ought to repeal his errors. The right

               hon. gentleman had tried the institutions for 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories which he now 
               <br />
               asked the House to frame, and for the same 
               <br />
               reason as he had given <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to-dayr-that</span> it would 
               <br />
               be better for the Dominion government to

               keep matters in their own hands and decide 
               <br />
               what was best for the future. He (Mr. Blake) 
               <br />
               believed that it was essential to our obtaining 
               <br />

               <br />
               we should tell the people beforehand what

               Now let me call renewed attention to 
               <br />
               these words of Mr. Blake: ‘I regard it as _ 
               <br />
               essential under the circumstances of the 
               <br />
               country, and in view of the deliberation of 
               <br />
               the last few days.’ What were the deliber- 
               <br />
               ations of those last few days in the House ot 
               <br />
               Commons to which Mr. Blake alluded ? 
               <br />
               Why, Sir, it was a resolution on that very 
               <br />
               subject of separate schools, separate 
               <br />
               schools in the province of New Brunswick, 
               <br />
               where at that time, and by the coustitution, 
               <br />
               the principle of separate schools was not 
               <br />
               adopted; the minority was asmng for 
               <br />
               separate schools, and came to this House 
               <br />
               for relief, but the House would not grant 
               <br />
               the relief because they would not invade 
               <br />
               the constitution. Mr. Blake said that in— 
               <br />
               stead of having such a state of things in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories it would be better to 
               <br />
               give to the people the religious instruction 
               <br />
               that all classes might want. Now what was 
               <br />
               Mr. Mackenzle’s answer to this ?

               As to the subject of public instruction, it 
               <br />
               did not in the ﬁrst place attract his attention, 
               <br />
               but when he came to the subject of local taxa.- 
               <br />
               tion he was reminded of it. Not having had 
               <br />
               time before to insert a. clause on the subject, 
               <br />
               he proposed to do so when the Bill was in 
               <br />
               committee. The clause provided that the 
               <br />
               Lieutenant Governor by and with the consent 
               <br />
               of his council or assembly, as the case might 
               <br />
               he, should pass all necessary ordinances in 
               <br />
               respect of education, but it would be specially 
               <br />
               provided that the majority of the ratepayers 
               <br />
               might establish such schools and impose such 
               <br />
               necessary assessment as they might think ﬂt; 
               <br />
               and that the minority of the ratepayers, whether 
               <br />
               Protestant or Roman Catholic, might establish 
               <br />
               separate schools; and such ratepayers would 
               <br />
               be liable only to such educational assessment- 
               <br />
               as they might impose upon themselves. This he
