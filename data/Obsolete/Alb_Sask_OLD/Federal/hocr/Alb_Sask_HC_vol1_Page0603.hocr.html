               Mr. OSLER. That is the charge that is 
               <br />
               made.- When the storm arose after this Bill 
               <br />
               was brought in, the Prime Minister and the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice, the next time they Spoke, 
               <br />
               both said that the intention of that clause 
               <br />
               was simply to let things in the Northwest 
               <br />
               remain as they are to-day. Is that true ? 
               <br />
               If that be true, it took a whole month after 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst Bill was introduced to get some- 
               <br />
               body to agree to the modiﬁcation as we 
               <br />
               have it now. If the Prime Minister and 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice, and all the other 
               <br />

               <br />
               rather meant, that one thing should be em- 
               <br />
               bodied in that clause but found that another 
               <br />
               thing quite different was really in the clause 
               <br />
