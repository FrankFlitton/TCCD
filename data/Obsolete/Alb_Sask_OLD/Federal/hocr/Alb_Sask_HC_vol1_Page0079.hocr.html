               denounced the position which the govern—

               <br />

               <br />

               but within two or three days of his arrival 
               <br />
               this Bill is brought down without his know-

               is the hon. member for Centre York (Mr. 
               <br />
               Campbell) doing on the present occasion ? 
               <br />
               He was at a meeting in his own riding the

               other night, at which the government was 
               <br />
               denounced on all sides, but the member for 
               <br />
               Centre York was afraid either to condemn 
               <br />
               the government or approve of their policy. 
               <br />
               His cry was: Wait, wait; you will see 
               <br />
               something will happen. To-day we have 
               <br />
               an intimation of What is going to happen. 
               <br />
               I suppose it will be a repetition of the Re- ' 
               <br />
               medial Bill experience in 1896, of members 
               <br />
               and ministers opposite giving their pledges 
               <br />
               that they are going to do this and that, and 
               <br />
               then doing the other thing. The debates on 
               <br />
               the Manitoba question show that the ques- 
               <br />
               tion of the Northwest schools was a live 
               <br />
               question in 1896, and although the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice did not go so far as to pledge his 
               <br />
               word of honour that in the event of a Reme- 
               <br />
               dia-l Bill not being passed he would oppose 
               <br />
               any administration that might be formed by 
               <br />
               Mr. Laurier ; yet there were other members 
               <br />
               who found their way into this chamber by 
               <br />
               giving pledges that when the question of 
               <br />
               the Northwest schools came up they would 
               <br />
               stand for legislation similar to the remedial 
               <br />
               legislation for Manitoba. There is fear and 
               <br />
               trembling among them to-day. The Solici- 
               <br />
               tor General (Mr. Lemieux) came to parlia- 
               <br />
               ment on one of these pledges.
