               <br />
               termines the whole question. It appears to 
               <br />
               me that if we could determine without any 
               <br />
               question or doubt when these Territories 
               <br />
               enter the union, we could then determine 
               <br />
               what legislation, if any, it was necessary or 
               <br />
               reasonable to make, in regard to educational 
               <br />
               matters for the new province. In 'my mind, 
               <br />
               I am satisﬁed that the' date of the union is 
               <br />
               necessarily the date upon which the Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories take upon themselves the duties 
               <br />
               and privileges of a province. The Domin- 
               <br />
               ion may have been possessed of this Ter- 
               <br />
               ritory, but I look upon the date of the 
               <br />
               union as being that time when the people 
               <br />
               of the Territories and the people of the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion agree upon conditions under which the 
               <br />
               one is willing to confer and the other to 
               <br />
               receive the constitution of the Dominion. 
               <br />
               This, as you will perceive, is not a matter 
               <br />
               pertaining to territory, but it refers to the 
               <br />
               people, and is therefore a union not of 
               <br />
               land but of the people of the Territories 
               <br />
               with those of the Dominion. What I under- 
               <br />
               stand to be the supreme moment, that the 
               <br />
               territory becomes a province and the union 
               <br />
               is consummated is when the Dominion gives 
               <br />
               and the territory receives the constitution, 
               <br />
               and thus becomes an integral part of the 
               <br />
               confederation, from henceforth living <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under</span> 
               <br />

               Dominion.

               I do not propose to quote any authorities, 
               <br />
               but this is the opinion held by some of the

               most eminent American constitutional law-

               <br />
               would be thrown back on the law of 1875,

               which gave to the Territories separate

               inate the youth of the land. There is no 
               <br />
               question but that the legislature of the Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories have pared down and eliminated 
               <br />
               many of the objectionable features of the 
               <br />
               1875 Act, so that to—day we have in the 
               <br />
               Northwest a system of schools which is 
               <br />
               entirely satisfactory to all parties, or as 
               <br />
               nearly so as you could expect to have in 
               <br />
               any country where there lived people of 
               <br />
               diverse opinions and who have all to come 
               <br />
               under one system. It would be utterly im-

               possible to have in any country where we
