               5,000 Scandinavians or 3-39 per cent of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               in the Territories, but there are 17,051 there

               to-day. Therefore the French have not in-

               creased as rapidly in proportion as any of

               very much stronger than the other national-

               <br />
               language oﬂicial or semi-ofﬁcial. But when 
               <br />
               we remember that they are only 4'43 per 
               <br />
               cent of the population to-day there seems to 
               <br />
               be no reason for such suggestion.

               governments keep up with the changed con- 
               <br />

               it is with provinces and localities. The lan-

               of it, because other people are occupying 
               <br />
               the ground. When the Romans occupied

               cause the conditions have changed. Other

               languages have come in and taken its place.

               So it must be in the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               as in every other part of the world; as the

               conditions change the language must 
               <br />
               change. We must deal with this matter in 
               <br />
               the light of existing conditions, and the _ex- 
               <br />
               isting conditions do not in my judgment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Jus-</span> 
               <br />
               tify either making the French language

               <br />
               thorizing its use in the courts. The hon. 
               <br />
               member read what Sir John Thompson said 
               <br />
               to the effect that it would be a strange 
               <br />
               thing if we convicted a man <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">belonging</span> to 
               <br />
               the French race in a court where the em- 
               <br />
               dence against him was given in a language 
               <br />
               which he did not understand. The same 
               <br />
               thing was done in the case of an Italian 
               <br />
               who was tried at North Bay the other day; 
               <br />
               it was all done through an interpreter. _Is 
               <br />
               not the same thing done every day both in 
               <br />
