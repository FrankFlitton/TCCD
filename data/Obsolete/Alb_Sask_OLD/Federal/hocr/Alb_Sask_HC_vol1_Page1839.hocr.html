               Let us take the amendment proposed by 
               <br />
               my hon. friend from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa). 
               <br />
               My hon. friend has by his amendment 
               <br />
               sought to apply purely and simply clause 
               <br />
               93 of the British North America Act. It is 
               <br />
               true that there is the educational provision 
               <br />
               which exists in all these amendments as to 
               <br />

               tion that this important, this grave defect 
               <br />
               in the present section will be remedied by 
               <br />
               applying section 93 purely and simply. This 
               <br />
               is undoubtedly a very complicated matter. 
               <br />
               I doubt if section 93. applied purely and 
               <br />
               simply, does assure that protection to the 
               <br />

               ﬁrst clause 16 and that given them by clause 
               <br />
               16, No. 2. Let me point out what I think is 
               <br />
               of some importance to this committee and 
               <br />
               what may explain the great divergencies of 
               <br />
               opinion existing among lawyers as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> what 
               <br />
               our powers are in creating a province. I 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">argued,</span> when I ﬁrst spoke on this subject— 
               <br />
               and I think that opinion was also expressed 
               <br />
               by many legal gentlemen—that our only 
               <br />
               power under the British Nonth America Act 
               <br />
               and its amendments was to create a pro- 
               <br />
               vince. We could create a province and 
               <br />
               unde' section 2 of the Imperial Act of 1871 
               <br />
               we could provide suﬁicient machinery to 
               <br />
               bring the province into existence and sub- 
               <br />
               ject it to the provisions of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. But we could not go beyond 
               <br />
               that. We could not invade in any way the 
               <br />
               division of the ﬁeld of jurisdiction which 
               <br />
               has been made by the British North America 
               <br />
               Act. I' proceeded upon that assumption at 
               <br />
               that time, and it did not seem to me to 
               <br />
               admit of doubt. A very different proposi- 
               <br />
               tion, however. has been enunciated here by 
               <br />
               my hon. friend the Minister of Justice, and 
               <br />
               I think it is the proposition of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment, namely, that we are not restricted 
               <br />
