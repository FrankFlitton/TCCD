               and those not now afﬁliated, I thought that

               some slight reference 'to the association,

               Act to incorporate the Grand Orange Lodge 
               <br />
               of British America, which was assent- 
               <br />
               ed to on April 24th, 1890. Among the names 
               <br />
               of the corporators are those of the late 
               <br />
               Hon. N. Clarke Wallace, the late Edward 
               <br />
               F. Clarke and other leading men. I have 
               <br />
               looked very brieﬂy over the clauses of this 
               <br />
               Act of incorporation of the Grand Orange 
               <br />
               Lodge of British America to see if any

               special favours had been given to the asso- 
               <br />
               ciation by this parliament. I ﬁnd that no 
               <br />
               special favours were given—this is simply a 
               <br />
               Bill permitting the members of the associa-

               <br />
               take care of their own rights, and to extend 
               <br />
               those rights to every other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">loyal</span> citizen

               in Canada. whatever his creed may be. 
               <br />
               And I have here a copy of the Orange con- 
               <br />
               stitution, which I will be glad to send to 
               <br />
               my hon. friend from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa), 
               <br />
               for evidently he has not looked into this

               constitution is open to every man in Can- 
               <br />
               ada, and from beginning to end there is no 
               <br />
               clause in it that interferes with the rights 
               <br />
               and privileges of any class of people in this 
               <br />

               good grace from the hon. gentleman to cast

               to sound a note of warning to the Canadian

               I was wondering what the hon. gentle-

               men-t representing western constituencies 
               <br />
               would think about that clause, a clause 
               <br />
               which says that the provincial governments 
               <br />
               of these two territories cannot control their 
               <br />

               <br />
               trolled by the parliament sitting at Ottawa.
