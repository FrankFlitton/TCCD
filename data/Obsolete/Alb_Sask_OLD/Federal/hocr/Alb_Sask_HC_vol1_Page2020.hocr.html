               word of personal explanation and to give 
               <br />
               the reasons why I do not feel disposed to

               <br />
               I am in favour of the principle of the Bill; 
               <br />
               that is. I am in favour of giving the North-

               west Territories their autonomy, but the 
               <br />
               Bill does not contain what in my opinion is 
               <br />
               a sufﬁcient guarantee of the rights Of the

               this motion a further word of protest with 
               <br />
               regard to this feature of the measure; and 
               <br />
               I do this notwithstanding that I am prob— 
               <br />
               ably bringing again upon myself the severe 
               <br />
               disapprobation of the hon. leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition. In face of the fact that that 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman has for three or four months 
               <br />
               been responsible for a waste of the time 
               <br />
               of this parliament. and responsible for a 
               <br />
               great deal of disturbance throughout the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada upon these autonomy 
               <br />
               measures, be rises to censure a representa- 
               <br />
               tive from the Northwest Territories who 
               <br />
               has the hardihood to ask the House to listen 
               <br />
               for thirty or forty minutes to a protest with 
               <br />
               regard to a limitation on the autonomy pro- 
               <br />
               posed to be given to the people of these two 
               <br />
               provinces, which is a very serious matter 
               <br />
               in comparison with the comparatively triﬂ— 
               <br />
               ing matter that he is responsible for causim.r 
               <br />
               to be discussed at such great length and 
               <br />
               disturbing the country to such an extent. 
               <br />
               The hon. leader of the opposition said that 
               <br />
               the words I used in my amendment were 
               <br />
               meaningless—that the power of expropria- 
               <br />
               tion was inherently in this parliament, and 
               <br />
               that, therefore. it was meaningless to ,put 
               <br />
               in this Act words giving notice to the people 
               <br />
               of these provinces and to the Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway Company that this parlia- 
               <br />
               ment intends to exercise its inherent powers 
               <br />
               of expropriation if it were not able by some 
               <br />
               other means to obtain the reiinquishment 
               <br />
               of these exemptions.
