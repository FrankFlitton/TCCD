               Mr. W. J. ROCHE (Marquette). Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker. After hearing the very full dis- 
               <br />
               cussion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on”</span> this Bill by members on both 
               <br />
               sides of the House; a discussion from a 
               <br />
               constitutional standpoint, the standpoint 
               <br />
               of public policy and from the standpoint 
               <br />
               of political exigencies by some hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen on the other side of the House, 
               <br />
               it is not with the idea that I can add 
               <br />
               anything of a very original character 
               <br />
               that I propose for a short time to con- 
               <br />
               tinue the debate. However, being a western 
               <br />
               man; a resident of Manitoba for the past 
               <br />
               22 years, quite naturally I take a great in- 
               <br />
               terest in anything pertaining to the welfare 
               <br />
               of our great western heritage, and my ideas 
               <br />
               are not so provincial that I desire to limit 
               <br />
               that interest to matters mainly connected 
               <br />
               with the province of my adoption. In 
               <br />
               looking over the history of our country I 
               <br />
               think there are few of us but must admit, 
               <br />
               in the light of past experience, that there 
               <br />
               are some things that we might very well 
               <br />
               improve <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">upomhad</span> we the drafting of our 
               <br />
               constitution anew. The great fathers of con-

               <br />

               ous provinces of this Splendid Dominion 
               <br />
               are deserving of every enlogium that can 
               <br />
               possibly be bestowed on them. They had 
               <br />
               many intricate and delicate questions to 
               <br />
               cope with, prejudices to overcome, rights 
               <br />
