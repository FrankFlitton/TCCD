               to all those counties through which this

               <br />
               Simcoe, Victoria and Peterborough. My 
               <br />
               lion. friend (Mr. Cochrane) also suggests the 
               <br />
               county of Northumberland for the reason 
               <br />
               that there is a line from Peterborough to 
               <br />
               Belleville and by reason of that fact it will 
               <br />
               also interest the county of Hastings with 
               <br />
               the considerable city of Belleville. There 
               <br />
               is a branch line of the Grand Trunk from

               <br />
               way from Georgian Bay ports is carried to 
               <br />
               Peterborough and is then in turn carried to 
               <br />
               Believille over this road which is known, I 
               <br />
               believe, as the Grand Junction Railway. 
               <br />
               But, there are other advantages in the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment utilizing the Midland division of 
               <br />
               the Grand Trunk Railway, a noticeable fea- 
               <br />
               ture of which would be the very desirable 
               <br />
               harbour they would become possessed of. I 
               <br />
               do not know whether the hon. Minister of 
               <br />
               Railways and Canals has been at Depot 
               <br />
               Harbour, the terminus of the Canada At- 
               <br />
               lantic Railway, but if he has he will bear 
               <br />
               me out in saying that it is a harbour that 
               <br />
               has accommodation of the most limited na- 
               <br />
               ture. The bay is hardly over a quarter of 
               <br />
               a mile in length, and the amount of dock— 
               <br />
               age for boats is of the most limited char- 
               <br />
               acter, while at Midland, owing to the fact 
               <br />
               that the Grand Trunk Railway, with fore— 
               <br />
               sight, have practically possessed themselves 
               <br />
               of the bulk of the water frontage, there is 
               <br />
               to-day dockage not only for the Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway, the Grand Trunk Railway 
               <br />
               and the Intercolonial Railway, but probably 
               <br />
               for half a dozen other lines. A line of ele- 
               <br />
               vators could be erected at that point pro— 
               <br />
               bably with a frontage of nearly three- 
               <br />
               quarters of a mile with the necessary water 
               <br />
               depth sufﬁcient to make the harbour acces- 
               <br />
               sible to the largest vessel on the lake. There 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> another advantage to be had too it is ap-

               <br />
               are no rocks or shoals outlying. Ifthe hon. 
               <br />
               Minister of Railways and Canals happened 
               <br />
               to be in the House the other evening, and he 
               <br />
               in all probability was, when the estimates 
               <br />
               of the Department of Marine and Fisheries 
               <br />
               were being passed in respect to the buoy 
               <br />
               service, he will know that it costs some 
               <br />
               $2,500 a year to properly light and buoy 
               <br />
               the vessels coming into Depot Harbour. 
               <br />
               Again, let me point out that if you utilize 
               <br />
               the port of Depot Harbour, you do not im- 
               <br />
               prove the facilities, or advance the inter- 
               <br />
               ests of any other harbour on the Georgian 
               <br />
               bay. It is conﬁned strictly and solely to 
               <br />
               Depot Harbour, but, if, on the other hand, 
               <br />
               you should adopt the policy of government 
               <br />
               control, or government interference, or what- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ever~</span> you may term it, in reference to the 
               <br />
               Midland division of the Grand Trunk, just 
               <br />
               as soon as that line leaves Midland on its 
               <br />
               way to Peterborough you interest not only 
               <br />
               the town of Midland but the towns of Col- 
               <br />
               lingwood and Meaford, and I want to call 
               <br />
               the attention of the minister and the mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the House to the fact that these are 
               <br />
               towns of considerable importance. The 
               <br />
               town of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Collingwood</span> has a large established 
               <br />
               trade, it has a large passenger trade with 
               <br />
               well established lines of steamers which 
               <br />
               have been running for a number of years. 
               <br />
               The government has expended a large 
               <br />
               amount of money and a large amount of 
               <br />
               money has also been expended at Meaford. 
               <br />
               These two harbours are greatly to be bene- 
               <br />
               fited by the trade of the Grand Trunk Pa- 
               <br />
               ciﬁc which, if everything turns out as has 
               <br />
               been prophesied, will be very considerable. 
               <br />
               We all hope it will grow into millions and 
               <br />
               millions and it cannot with any great ad- 
               <br />
               vantage be all carried by way of Depot 
               <br />
               Harbour, while on the other hand, by the 
               <br />
               government acquiring or being interested in 
               <br />
               the Midland division of the Grand Trunk 
               <br />
               Railway, you will then have accessible har- 
               <br />
               bours at Collingwood, Meaford and Midland. 
               <br />
               all three, as against this single harbour. I 
               <br />
               hope the hon. minister will lay the view 
               <br />
               which I have submitted to the committee 
               <br />
               before his colleagues and when the matter 
               <br />
               does come up in the House again I will en- 
               <br />
               deavour to place my views before the House, 
               <br />
               and I trust that hon. gentlemen represent- 
               <br />
               ing districts along the line of the Midland 
               <br />
               division of the Grand Trunk Railway and 
               <br />
               those interested in different points on the 
               <br />
               Georgian bay will press strongly for the 
               <br />
               adoption of the scheme of utilizing the Mid- 
               <br />
               land division of the Grand Trunk between 
               <br />
               Peterborough and Midland rather than 
               <br />
               spending a large sum of money on this 263 
               <br />
               miles of railway between Depot Harbour 
               <br />
               and Ottawa. I may say to the hon. min- 
               <br />
               ister that the country through which the 
               <br />
               Canada Atlantic Railway passes is practi- 
               <br />
               cally a barren country; it is not an agri- 
               <br />
               cultural country. You never can expect to 
               <br />
               have any local trade along that railway. 
               <br />
               That is patent to—day owing to the fact that 
               <br />
