               an explanation saying that in the year 1894 
               <br />
               Great Britain made a commercial treaty 
               <br />
               with Japan to which treaty the self-goV- 
               <br />
               erning colonies were privileged <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘to</span> adhere if 
               <br />
               they saw ﬁt and these colonies were given 
               <br />
               two years in which to adhere to the treaty. 
               <br />
               The expiry of the two years occurred on 
               <br />
               the 16th July, 1896, three days after the 
               <br />
               present Prime Minister was sworn into 
               <br />
               ofﬁce. When this government came into 
               <br />
               ofﬁce we found a recommunication from 
               <br />
               the imperial authorities asking whether Can- 
               <br />
               ada would like to adhere to the Japanese 
               <br />
               treaty. It was some little time before we 
               <br />
               could take the matter up for discussion or 
               <br />
               investigation. The time had really expired, 
               <br />
               but we did consider the matter and in view 
               <br />
               of the difﬁculties which we were then fore— 
               <br />
               seeing in regard to commercial treaties be- 
               <br />
               tween the mother country and foreign coun- 
               <br />
               tries which contained favoured nation 
               <br />
               clauses, clauses which might hamper Can- 
               <br />
               ada in her commercial dealings, and also in 
               <br />
               view of the fact that at that time our people 
               <br />
               generally classed the Japanese and Chinese 
               <br />
               together in regard to their entering into Can- 
               <br />
               ada and their relationships with us as a 
               <br />
               labouring class in our country, the govern- 
               <br />
               ment thought it was better for us not to 
               <br />
               adhere to the treaty. Some little time 
               <br />
               afterwards, and especially at the time that 
               <br />
               I was delegated to go to Japan in connec- 
               <br />
               tion with the exhibition there, I made a 
               <br />
               careful study of the commercial relations 
               <br />
               between Canada and Japan, and I found 
               <br />
               what had not been, I think, thoroughly un- 
               <br />
               derstood in this country before even by 
               <br />
               those in ofﬁce, and yet is not understood by 
               <br />
               the people of the country at large. The 
               <br />
               Japanese goverment have treaties with four 
               <br />
               commercial nations, Great Britain, Ger- 
               <br />
               many, Austro-Hungary and France. By 
               <br />
               these treaties Japan accords to each of these 
               <br />
               countries special reduced duties on special 
               <br />
               speciﬁed articles, not a general reduction, 
               <br />
               but special speciﬁed duties on special arti- 
               <br />
               cles. Each of these treaties contains a

               most favoured nation clause.
