               Mr. M. S. MCCARTHY. As to the choice 
               <br />
               of the 38th line of townships, I may say 
               <br />
               that I am willing to take any line the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman (Mr. Scott) suggests. Whatever 
               <br />
               line he takes the calculation will be the 
               <br />
               same. My reason for taking the 38th line 
               <br />
               was because it left eleven constituencies 
               <br />
               north and eleven south of the line, exclusive 
               <br />
               of the Athabasca constituencies.

               Mr. FITZPATRICK. This is a matter

               <br />
               the province, just as will the question of 
               <br />
               redistribution, of which we have heard so 
               <br />
               much. It is practically left to the province 
               <br />
               to settle. For the time, we take Edmonton,

               <br />
               the honour to look at the map, he will ob-

               <br />
               of affairs is being established here which 
               <br />
               cannot be found to exist in any other pro- 
               <br />
               vince of the Dominion. Edmonton is one 
               <br />
               constituency—the hub. Stony Plain comes 
               <br />
               into it like the spoke of a wheel; as does 
               <br />
               Strathcona; and Sturgeon is another; and 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan is practically another and St. 
               <br />
               Albert also. Already three candidates have 
               <br />
               been nominated for these constituencies who 
               <br />
               reside in Edmonton. So when the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman (Mr. Fitzpatrick) says that this 
               <br />
               is a matter for the local legislature to de- 
               <br />
               cide, I may tell him that the people in the 
               <br />
               south are perfectly willing to leave the 
               <br />
               capital to be ﬁxed according to the will of 
               <br />
               the people. But under this measure the 
               <br />
               hands of the legislature are tied—for there 
               <br />
               are six constituencies out of twenty-four 
               <br />
               bordering on Edmonton.
