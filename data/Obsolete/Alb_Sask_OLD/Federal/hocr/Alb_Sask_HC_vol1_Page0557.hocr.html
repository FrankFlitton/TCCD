               The ﬁnances of Manitoba in their actual state 
               <br />
               are not made to attract the free residents of 
               <br />
               the districts. Manitoba has a debt of $4,000,000. 
               <br />
               The school legislation of the little province is 
               <br />
               not of a nature to attract the immigrants who 
               <br />
               people the districts. The Northwest has its 
               <br />
               separate schools. Manitoba has abolished them.
