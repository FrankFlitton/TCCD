               Macdonald said on that occasion, although 
               <br />
               he has been quoted by my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Labelle in support of what he said a day 
               <br />
               or two ago concerning the school law. I 
               <br />
               may say that this was a most interesting 
               <br />
               debate, from which I would quote at great- 
               <br />
               er length if time permitted. i could show 
               <br />
               that upon that vexed question both parties,

               the moderate men on both sides of the

               incorporated in my amendment. The agree-

               ment they came to was incorporated in a 
               <br />
               resolution ﬁnally adopted by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House,</span> 
               <br />
               which is word for word the amendment I 
               <br />
               have offered to-day. They came to that 
               <br />

               <br />
               and different political colour, was a proper 
               <br />
               settlement of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> time of the needs

               same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">time—because</span> they all expressed that 
               <br />
               opinion—maintaining the sacredness of the 
               <br />
               agreement arrived at in 1870 under the cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances I have indicated to the House. 
               <br />
               Mr. Blake suggested the substance of an 
               <br />
               amendment, but had been obliged to leave 
               <br />
               the House during the debate. Finally a 
               <br />
               form was agreed upon for which both Sir 
               <br />
               John A. Macdonald, my right hon. friend, 
               <br />
               and leading men on both sides of the House, 
               <br />
               voted. This is how Sir John A. Macdonald, 
               <br />
               towards the end of the debate, spoke upon 
               <br />
               that question:

               'I go a great way with my hon. friend (Mr. 
               <br />
               Laurier) in his remarks concerning the prin- 
               <br />
               ciple of this Bill. I sympathize with his very 
               <br />
               natural feelings of indignation at much of the 
               <br />
               language that has been used in support of this 
               <br />
               measure now before the House. I have no 
               <br />
               accord with the desire expressed in some quar- 
               <br />
               ters that by any mode whatever there should be 
               <br />
               an attempt made to oppress the one language 
               <br />
               or to render it inferior to the other; I be— 
               <br />
               lieve that would be impossible it it were tried, 
               <br />
               and it would be foolish and wicked if it were 
               <br />
               possible. The statement that has been made 
               <br />
               so often that this is a conquered country is 
               <br />
               ‘ à propos de rien.’ Whether it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> conquered 
               <br />
               or ceded, we have a constitution now under 
               <br />
               which all British subjects are in a position of 
               <br />
               absolute equality, having equal rights of every 
               <br />
               kind—of language, of religion, of property and 
               <br />
               of person. There is no paramount race in this 
               <br />
               country; there is no conquered race in this 
               <br />
               country ; we are all British subjects, and those 
               <br />
               who are not English are none the less British 
               <br />
               subjects on that account. But while I say so 
               <br />
               much, Mr. Speaker, .I must regret that my hon. 
               <br />
               friend perhaps yielding to the necessity of his 
               <br />
               position as a party leader, should have com- 
               <br />
               menced his speech with some party attacks 
               <br />
               against the Tories. My hon. friend felt con- 
               <br />
               strained, I suppose, to make thbse allusions 
               <br />
               which, in the circumstances of the case, I 
               <br />
               think were not altogether generous or alto— 
               <br />
               gether politic. The hon. gentleman spoke of 
               <br />
               the spirit of this Bill being that of Toryism, 
               <br />
               utter Toryism, oppressive Toryism. Why, Sir, 
               <br />
               if he looks at the history of England in modern 
               <br />
               days, I think he will ﬁnd that most of the 
               <br />
               Liberal measures passed there have been 
               <br />
               passed, it not by Tories, by Conservatives. I

               think also, if he will look at the history of 
               <br />
               Canada, he will ﬁnd at all events, that liber- 
               <br />
               ality towards the French Canadian race was 
               <br />
               pretty much cohﬁned to the Conservative party. 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman had to admit that while 
               <br />
               this Bill was, as he aﬂlrmed, an evidence of 
               <br />
               utter Toryism, the exclusion of the'French lan— 
               <br />
               guage, the injury done to the French people, 
               <br />
               the insult offered to them, came from a Radi- 
               <br />
               cal, the Earl of Durham. To be sure, my hon. 
               <br />
               friend said that Lord Durham was a Radical 
               <br />
               who did not understand all about liberty. That 
               <br />
               is quite evident; and so great a Radical was 
               <br />
               he that in order to get rid of him the English 
               <br />
               goverment sent him to this country to show 
               <br />
               us his liberalism by attempting to deprive half 
               <br />
               the people of their rights to use their own lan- 
               <br />
