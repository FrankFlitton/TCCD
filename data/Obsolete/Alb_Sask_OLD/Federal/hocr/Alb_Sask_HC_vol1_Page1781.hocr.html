               <br />
               the bases of the Roman Catholic religion, 
               <br />
               so far as teaching is concerned, is that the 
               <br />
               Catholic idea should permeate the whole

               The provision with regard to the teaching 
               <br />
               of language was also changed. In the pre- 
               <br />
               ceding ordinances, even in 1888, Sir John 
               <br />
               Thompson pointed to one of the clauses as 
               <br />
               being unwantonly complained against by tue 
               <br />
               minority. That clause was to the effect that 
               <br />
               the teaching in English was imperative in 
               <br />
               the schools. On that point I share the opinion 
               <br />
               of Sir John Thompson. There was no harm 
               <br />
               in that. French Canadians do not object to 
               <br />
               it. We all wish to learn English. I may 
               <br />
               say, without boasting, that, so far as the 
               <br />
               study of the dual language is concerned, 
               <br />
               we are far in advance of any of the Eng- 
               <br />
               lish—speaking provinces. Take, for instance. 
               <br />
               only this House, and I ask what is the pro- 
               <br />
               portion of English members who have taken 
               <br />
               the trouble to learn French compared with 
               <br />
               the number of French-speaking members 
               <br />
               who speak English? In this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> where 
               <br />
               one-third of the population is French Cana- 
               <br />
               dian, where the whole system of our consti- 
               <br />
               tution is based on a fair understanding be 
               <br />
               tween the two races, it should be the duty 
               <br />
               of every provincial government to insert in 
               <br />
               its education laws the provision that both 
               <br />
               languages should be taught in its schools. 
               <br />
               Let those gentlemen who are often so ready 
               <br />
               to give lessons in loyalty go to the mother 
               <br />
               country, and they will ﬁnd that no man in 
               <br />
               England considers his education complete 
               <br />
               unless he learns the French tongue. Here 
               <br />
               in this country, where the French is the 
               <br />
               mother tongue of one-third of the population, 
               <br />
               why should so many of our English—speaking 
               <br />
               fellow-citizens show that blind inexplicable 
               <br />
               hatred against the teaching of French in 
               <br />
               our schools ? Make the teaching of Eng- 
               <br />
               lish imperative if you like, but give the 
               <br />
               French Canadians the right to impart the 
               <br />
               most important part of our teaching in 
               <br />
               French. That I maintain is perfectly just. 
               <br />
               But under the ordinance of 1892 the teach- 
               <br />
               ing of French was prohibited in the Terri— 
               <br />
               tories, and it became imperative that all 
               <br />
               matters should be taught in the English 
               <br />
               language. Why, at a banquet given at Prince 
               <br />
               Albert some years ago, at which I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span>

               <br />
               spectors telling the audience, in the presence

               of Mr. Haultain, that their educational sys- 
               <br />
               tem, in so far as the teaching of languages 
               <br />
               was concerned, was absurd, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,unjust</span> and 
               <br />
               criminal. He ridiculedthe idea of forcing

               small children of ﬁve or six years of age to 
               <br />
               study geography, history and arithmetic 
               <br />
               in a foreign tongue. What happened after 
               <br />
               the adoption of the law of 1892 ? Inspectors 
               <br />
               were sent by Mr. Haultain to examine the

               <br />
