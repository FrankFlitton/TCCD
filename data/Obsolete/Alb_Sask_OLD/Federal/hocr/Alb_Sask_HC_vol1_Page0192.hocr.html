               people of the Northwest would have had

               to say that under the Act now before the

               House minorities in the Northwest have

               the day of 1875 When the hierarchy were

               <br />
               stress—page 1517 of ‘ Hansard ’—on the fact 
               <br />
               that we, the people of Canada. occupied a 
               <br />
               peculiar position, because we have bought 
               <br />
               and owned these Northwest lands. He de- 
               <br />
               clared that we had bought these lands, that 
               <br />
               we owned them and that we own them now 
               <br />
               and therefore surely the old saying should 
               <br />
               hold good: Can a man not do as he likes with 
               <br />

               see the hon. Minister of Justice in his

               Minister of Justice, on behalf of his chief, 
               <br />

               lands, when she bought them and how Can- 
               <br />
               ada got her title to those lands ? When the 
               <br />
               statement is made, from which inferences 
               <br />
               are drawn, that we own these lands, I say 
               <br />
               that the right hon. gentleman should be pre- 
               <br />
               pared with some proof to substantiate that 
               <br />
               statement. I am quite prepared to admit 
               <br />
               that an hon. gentleman sitting behind him 
               <br />
               having heard him make the statement 
               <br />
               that we did own these lands might give 
               <br />
               his support to the measure which he might 
               <br />
               not give if he knew we did not own these 
               <br />
               lands and that we never owned them. If 
               <br />
               there were any doubt about the question 
               <br />
               one would only have to look at the state 
               <br />
               papers at the time the Hudson Bay Com— 
               <br />

               George Cartier and Mr. McDougail; they 
               <br />
               looked thoroughly into the subject and they 
               <br />
               made a report. Their report was to the
