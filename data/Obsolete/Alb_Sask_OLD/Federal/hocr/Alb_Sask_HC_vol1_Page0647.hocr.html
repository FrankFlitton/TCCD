               it could be carried out with greater ad-

               throughout the discussion of this Bill, and I

               is of a character that has not been subject- 
               <br />
               ed to any criticism in the past. Two years 
               <br />
               ago this parliament gave to the Canada At— 
               <br />
               lantic Railway Company practically the 
               <br />
               power asked for in section 1 of this Bill; 
               <br />
               and, on behalf of the companies interested, 
               <br />
               I submit that it is not fair for this com— 
               <br />
               mittee to refuse to agree to a proposition 
               <br />
               which a committee of this House considered 
               <br />
               carefully, and to which no objection of the 
               <br />
               slightest kind was taken by anybody, simp- 
               <br />
               ly because there is a Bill on the order paper 
               <br />
               relating to an amendment or the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment Railways Act, which will be discussed 
               <br />
               here, if not on Friday. then on the ﬁrst day 
               <br />
               that the Minister of Railways moves his Bill, 
               <br />
               when the subject which is of so much in- 
               <br />
               terest to the hon. leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               and the hon. member for Hamilton can be 
               <br />
               fairly threshed out. I submit, therefore, 
               <br />
               that this measure should not be considered 
               <br />
               on the basis of the government’s Bill.

               Mr. BARKER. I wish to make quite 
               <br />
               clear the ground upon which I desire that 
               <br />
               the whole subject relating to this Bill or 
               <br />
               connected with it shall now be fully dis- 
               <br />
               cussed, and I think I can point out to the 
               <br />
               Minister of Railways. a railway manager, as 
               <br />
               be practically is, why it should be discussed. 
               <br />
               I am not looking at it from the point of 
               <br />
               view of the hon. member for Pictou, who 
               <br />
               is pressing this Bill on behalf of the Grand 
               <br />
               Trunk Railway Company; but I am trying 
               <br />
               to present the interests of the people of Can- 
               <br />
               ada on this question, and I am sure that in 
               <br />
               what I am about to say I shall have the 
               <br />
               sympathy of the Minister of Railways, 
               <br />
               whether he agrees with me or not. The
