               Mr. BOURA-SSA. I do not think that 
               <br />
               this quarrel will throw light upon the legis- 
               <br />
               lation before us; but, having taken the 
               <br />
               course which I thought the only one that I 
               <br />
               could take with propriety, I intend to keep 
               <br />
               to that course without regard to the com- 
               <br />
               ments upon my conduct or upon my utter- 
               <br />
               ances. So <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fur</span> as the legal strength of my 
               <br />
               amendment is concerned, I have every re- 
               <br />
               spect for the opinion of the Minister of In- 
               <br />
               land Revenue (Mr. Braden-r), but I may tell 
               <br />
               that hon. gentleman that I have still more 
               <br />
               respect for the Minister of Justice <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> a 
               <br />
               legal authority. The words of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘worth—</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">less</span> amendment’ of which the hon. minister 
               <br />
               (Mr. Brodeur) speaks were taken from the 
               <br />
               clause prepared by the Minister of Justice, 
               <br />
               accepted by the whole government and pre- 
               <br />
               sented as the means of securing the rights 
               <br />
               of the Catholic minority in the Northwest 
               <br />
               and so upheld by the government and their 
               <br />
               supporters up to the time they changed their 
               <br />
               policy. '
