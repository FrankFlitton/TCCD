               more reliable than direct evidence. The 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick), an 
               <br />
               eminent lawyer, I have no doubt has ad- 
               <br />
               vanced that plea over and over again. Ap- 
               <br />
               plying it to the hon. gentleman himself and 
               <br />
               his government, is there any circumstancial 
               <br />
               evidence here to justify the conclusion that 
               <br />
               Hon. Robert Rogers. when he assumed that 
               <br />
               the Papal delegate was speaking for the 
               <br />
               government, and that the Minister Of Justice 
               <br />
               was in it and the Prime Minister was in it ? 
               <br />
               Certainly there was. He goes 011 to say.

               Mr. Campbell then asked me what would be 
               <br />
               my desire in this respect, I then gave him the 
               <br />
               memorandum which has already appeared in

               This, he says, is the sum and substance 
               <br />
               of the interview. Now, What was the memo- 
               <br />
               randum he gave? It was two carefully 
               <br />
               drawn clauses handed by the Papal delegate 
               <br />
               to Hon. Colin Campbell to enable him to 
               <br />
               facilitate the object he had in view—the 
               <br />
               extension of the boundaries of Manitoba. 
               <br />
               He proposed to this end the alteration of the 
               <br />
               statute of Manitoba relating to education, 
               <br />
               by adding to section 125 two subsections. 
               <br />
               One was as follows :—

               quested by a petition of parents or guardians of 
               <br />
               such number of such classes, provide separate 
               <br />
               accommodation for each of such classes and 
               <br />
               employ for them respectively Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               and non-Roman Catholic teachers.

               That was one of the amendments. The 
               <br />
               other was to provide for exactly the same 
               <br />
               in the country—two carefully drawn, well- 
               <br />
               worded subsections to put in a statute. And 
               <br />
               what conclusion did the Manitoba delegates 
               <br />
               reach with regard to the matter? I say 
               <br />
               the only conclusion they could come to was 
               <br />
               that these clauses were drawn up by the 
               <br />
               government here. And I think that they 
               <br />
               honestly believed that they were drawn up 
               <br />
               by the Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick). 
               <br />
               Does that hon. gentleman deny that he had 
               <br />
               anything to do with the drawing up of these 
               <br />
               subsections ?
