               sense of the wor.d Why, Sir, at that time 
               <br />
               these Territories were unpeopled. They 
               <br />
               had not even institutions of the most 
               <br />
               primitive sort. In my humble judgment, 
               <br />
               the real consummation of union Wih' 
               <br />
               take place on the passage and going into 
               <br />
               force of these Bills. It would seem to me 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"a</span> matter of grave doubt whether, under the 
               <br />
               British North 
               <br />
               had the power to admit these districts into 
               <br />
               the Dominion, except on a provincial 
               <br />
               status. The Imperial Act <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 1871, called the 
               <br />
               doubt removing Act, took away, however. 
               <br />
               any doubt on that point, and these regions 
               <br />
               in the west were incorporated with the 
               <br />
               Dominion, not as provinces. but as Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories. In my judgment, I believe that in 
               <br />
               legislating as we did in 1870. we exhausted 
               <br />
               the powers given us in that regard by sec- 
               <br />
               ‘tion 146 of the British North America Act 
               <br />
               of 1867. But those powers were ampliﬁed 
               <br />
               or extended by the Imperial legislation 
               <br />
               of 1871.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               It has been a matter of wonder to me 
               <br />
               that the Imperial House did not, in its Act 
               <br />
               of 1871, content itself with simply validat- 
               <br />
               ing the Manitoba Act; but it did not stop 
               <br />
               there. It went 011 to treat of the admis- 
               <br />
               sion of further Territories west of Mani- 
               <br />
               toba, and gave us power to constitute them 
               <br />
               into provinces, and in the meantime to 
               <br />
               make provision for their peace, order and 
               <br />
               good government. Had it been the intention 
               <br />
               of the Imperial parliament merely to valid— 
               <br />
               ate our legislation admitting Manitoba into 
               <br />
               the union, surely that parliament would 
               <br />
               have stopped there, but instead it went on 
               <br />
               to add to our power ; and in my judgment 
               <br />
               we are to-day properly acting under clause 
               <br />
               section 2 of the Imperial Act of 1871 in 
               <br />
               constituting these provinces. Acting under 
               <br />
               the power given by that Act of 1871 this 
               <br />
               Dominion parliament undertook to provide 
               <br />
               for the administration of those Territories 
               <br />
               and for the maintenance of peace, order 
               <br />
               and good government therein. The most 
               <br />
               important piece of legislation in that re— 
               <br />
               gard was Mr. Mackenzie's Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               torial Act of 1875. In the exercise of our 
               <br />
               powers, we granted a constitution to these 
               <br />
               Territories. The educational enactment of 
               <br />
               that Act of 1875 has been so often referred 
               <br />
               to that I shall spare the House a repetition 
               <br />
               of it. Sufﬁce to say that a system of sepa- 
               <br />
               rate schools was instituted, and 011 that 
               <br />
               system was based the Territorial school 
               <br />
               system such as we know it to-day. Take 
               <br />
               up the debate which took place in 1875 on 
               <br />
               that measure, and you will ﬁnd the utter-

               Blake’s remarks and not be struck

               by the fact that, in his opinion the

               what the Hon. David Mills, also an Ontario
