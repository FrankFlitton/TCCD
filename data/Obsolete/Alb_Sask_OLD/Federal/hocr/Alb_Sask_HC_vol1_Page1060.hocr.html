               <br />

               dencing as much care as had been recently 
               <br />
               given this question. We have likewise opi-

               nion-s from very able men indeed at the pre- 
               <br />
               sent time. The Prime Minister of this coun- 
               <br />
               try no doubt thinks that the Dominion par- 
               <br />
               liament has the power, under this section of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act of 1871, and 
               <br />
               should exercise it, or he would not have sub- 
               <br />
               mitted to us the measure we are now con-‘ 
               <br />
               sidering. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cit-Minister</span> of the Interior 
               <br />
               (Mr. Sifton) thinks also the Dominion has 
               <br />
               the power, but he prefers that we should 
               <br />
               not use it. He thinks it should be left to 
               <br />
               the new provinces; and he suggests that. 
               <br />
               in the event of our using it. it would be well 
               <br />
               to get a conﬁrming Act. The hon. member 
               <br />
               for Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk) thinks this 
               <br />
               parliament has only the power to create a 
               <br />
               province or call it into existence and to 
               <br />
               enact all the necessary details in that con- 
               <br />
               nection, and that after our powers in that 
               <br />
               respect are fully exercised, the province 
               <br />
               comes automatically under the control, of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act of 1867. We 
               <br />
               ﬁnd further that that very able lawyer, Mr. 
               <br />
               Christopher Robinson, is doubtful whether 
               <br />
               the Dominion has the power. We ﬁnd the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition saying that we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> 
               <br />
               no constitutional authority to pass the edu- 
               <br />
               cational clauses. All these conclusions are 
               <br />
               arrived at from consideration of the same 
               <br />
               clause, and no doubt all these men have 
               <br />
               conscientiously come to these different con- 
               <br />
               clusions through a desire to arrive at what 
               <br />
               is true and correct in the case. If that be 
               <br />
               so, it necessarily causes some anxiety to 
               <br />
               one who approaches the question for him— 
               <br />
               self. I have watched with some interest 
               <br />
               the methods by which, as far as I can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">judge.</span> 
               <br />
               these gentlemen arrived at their conclusions. 
               <br />
               If there be anything specially legal or con- 
               <br />
               stitutional in their methods that is shut out 
               <br />
               from ordinary laymen. then we must <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">leave</span> 
               <br />
               the question entirely to these legal gentle- 
               <br />
               men. We admire and cannot equal their

               very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">skilful.</span> method of presenting their 
               <br />
               arguments, but as far as I have been able to 
               <br />
               judge their methods of interpretation, I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd they make selection of clauses bear- 
               <br />
               ing on the subject, I ﬁnd that each one 
               <br />
               groups together the features that bear out 
               <br />
               his contention and draws comparison be- 
               <br />
               tween the importance of those features and 
               <br />
               others that are antagonistic to it. There 
               <br />
               is a certain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amount</span> of inquiry as to the
