               lowing in the footsteps of those missionaries, 
               <br />
               it was to those apostles of religion that they 
               <br />
               had to turn to for consolation. It is very easy 
               <br />
               nowadays to ride in a pnllman car and gaze 
               <br />
               out of its windows at the beautiful prairie, 
               <br />
               but you must not forget the hardships and 
               <br />
               the anxieties and the sacriﬁces which those 
               <br />
               men made who went into that country ﬁrst, 
               <br />
               who went there alone, having nobody to de- 
               <br />
               pend upon but themselves. Those men, I 
               <br />
               repeat, have acquired individual rights and 
               <br />
               are entitled to the request of our legislators. 
               <br />
               And if so far the people in the Territories 
               <br />
               to-day have thought that these men were 
               <br />
               entitled to their own school systems, why 
               <br />
               should we take it upon ourselves to decide 
               <br />
               that they are not. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Toronto asked why did not the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister prevent in 1896 the robbery of the 
               <br />
               minorities rights ? Well, it was not for the 
               <br />
               First Minister to prevent it. That was the 
               <br />
               duty of hon. gentlemen opposite. If they 
               <br />
               thought that an injustice was being done, 
               <br />
               why did they not veto the legislation instead 
               <br />
               of throwing upon individuals the onus of 
               <br />
               pleading against the local government. It 
               <br />
               the late Conservative government had vetoed 
               <br />
               the legislation of the province of Manitoba, 
               <br />
               and the provincial legislature considered 
               <br />
               that in so doing they had exceeded their 
               <br />
               jurisdiction, then there would have been a 
               <br />
               fairer ﬁght. It was the duty of hon. gentle— 
               <br />
               men opposite to have prevented the-wrong— 
               <br />
               doing, but they did not; and all we could 
               <br />
               do, after the harm was done, was to apply 
               <br />
               a remedy.

               Let us hope this debate shall soon be at 
               <br />
               an end and that this little ﬂurry of disagree- 
               <br />
               ment, this little wave which looked rather 
               <br />
               wicked at the top, will soon subside. The 
               <br />
               ground taken by hon. gentlemen opposite is 
               <br />
               in defence of provincial rights. And they 
               <br />
               talk much about these young provinces. 
               <br />
               Well, though the provinces are young, I 
               <br />
               think they know best what they want. And 
               <br />
               the election of the Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               (Mr. Oliver) is a fair indication of the senti- 
               <br />
               ment of the Northwest. The fact that the 
               <br />
               Conservative party has not offered any oppo- 
               <br />
               sition to the return of the Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior surely indicates that hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men opposite have found that they have 
               <br />
               entered upon slippery ground and that the 
               <br />
               further they go in the same direction the 
               <br />
               more slippery it becomes. 
               <br />

               It has been well said that the measure 
               <br />
               before us is a very important one. I trust 
               <br />
               that the two new provinces to which auton-

               of the Prime Minister and his cabinet to take 
               <br />

               Mr. J. HERRON. (Alberta). Mr. Speaker, I

               <br />

               I presume he is an old resident of that

               country by the remarks he has made. But 
               <br />
               I may say, in beginning. that I think he is

               a little wide of the mark in some of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               sided in Manitoba, but I think he is not 
               <br />
               familiar with the conditions in the North- 
               <br />
               west. He is not the only member of this 
               <br />
               House who has spoken of settlements made 
               <br />
               in the Northwest previous to the establish- 
               <br />
               ment of the means of law and order. He has 
               <br />
               said that the missionaries carried on a great 
               <br />
               work there and thatit was followed up by 
               <br />
               the settlement of the country by those of his 
               <br />
               race and religion. To that I take a certain 
               <br />
               exception. I was in that country in the 
               <br />
               very early days, and I travelled all over the 
               <br />
               length and breadth of the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories south of the great Saskatchewan and 
               <br />
               east ofthe Rocky mountains, and I think 
               <br />
               I am safe in saying that there was no such- 
               <br />
               settlement in that country, certainly none 
               <br />
               except at the present town of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Morley</span> west 
               <br />
               of Calgary and that was the settlement. of 
               <br />
               a Methodist missionary. There was no 
               <br />
               French settlement in that country as has 
               <br />
               been alleged in this House from time to 
               <br />
               time. Nor, were there, I regret to say, 
               <br />
               these great establishments of the church 
               <br />
               which have been referred to. Because, 
               <br />
               while I did not claim a greater share of the 
               <br />
               spirit of tolerance than any other hon. 
               <br />
               member of this House. I may say that I 
               <br />
               helped to build the ﬁrst Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               church that was built between the North 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan river and the International 
               <br />
               boundary which embraces the foothills 
               <br />
               of the Rocky mountains. This was 
               <br />
               some thirty years ago. Under the 
               <br />
               circumstances, I think I have the right 
               <br />
               to take exception to some of the state- 
               <br />
               ments that have been made in this House. 
               <br />
               I admit that at the present time we have a 
               <br />
               number of French Canadians in the North- 
               <br />
               west and, of course, Roman Catholics are 
               <br />
               there as in every other part of the Dominion. 
               <br />
               These French Canadians are certainly as 
               <br />
               good a class of settlers as any others we 
               <br />
               have. But, when you give them credit for 
               <br />
               beginning the settlement of the Northwest, 
               <br />
               I think you go further than is necessary, 
               <br />
               because that credit is not wholly due them.
