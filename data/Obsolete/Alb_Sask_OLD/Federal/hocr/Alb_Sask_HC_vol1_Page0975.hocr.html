               hon. gentlemen from the province of Que- 
               <br />
               bec in saying that the Catholic minority 
               <br />
               had rights in these Territories because 
               <br />
               years and years ago their missionaries dis- 
               <br />
               covered that country. All honour to those 
               <br />
               reverend gentlemen who entered that great 
               <br />
               Northwest in the early days. They had 
               <br />
               much to contend with and we honour the 
               <br />
               work they did there, but these hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen invariably laid down the rule that 
               <br />
               they are entitled to these rights because 
               <br />
               the country forsooth was discovered by 
               <br />
               these missionaries. I am told by an hon. 
               <br />
               member who comes from the Northwest 
               <br />
               that they never <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discovered</span> the territory 
               <br />
               which will form these Northwest provinces. 
               <br />
               They never got within 300 miles of these 
               <br />
               provinces. Therefore, that claim to the 
               <br />
               right of separate schools in that country, 
               <br />
               falls absolutely to the ground. But, what 
               <br />
               I have noticed in the speeches of these hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen is that they entirely ignore the 
               <br />
               constitutional point. They do not desire 
               <br />
               to have just what the constitution gives 
               <br />
               them, but they want a little more than 
               <br />
               the constitution gives them. I would pre- 
               <br />
               sent for the information of these hon. gen- 
               <br />

               <br />
               an American, a breezy westerner, who 
               <br />
               came down to see his member of congress 
               <br />
               at Washington. He had in his mind a 
               <br />
               Bill of tremendous importance of some 
               <br />
               kind or other, and he thought that he had 
               <br />
               only to speak to his member about it to 
               <br />
               get it through the House. But, on pre- 
               <br />
               senting <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">itvto</span> his member, this is what the 
               <br />
               latter said to him: Well, my dear fellow 
               <br />
               that is contrary to the constitution ; it can- 
               <br />
               not be done, ‘to which the westerner made 
               <br />
               reply: To the devil with the constitution; 
               <br />
               what is the American constitution between 
               <br />
               friends! That is about the attitude of these 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen in giving to the Catholic 
               <br />
               minority in the western provinces, not ab- 
               <br />
               solute justice, but more than they are en- 
               <br />
               titled to. What does the constitution 
               <br />
               amount to so long as they can deal out 
               <br />
               what they consider to be fair-play, but 
               <br />
               what we consider is a little beyond fair 
               <br />
               play? There is no one in this House who 
               <br />
               will not. accord to the Catholic minority such 
               <br />
               absolute fair-play as they are entitled to un— 
               <br />
               der the constitution. I do not believe there 
               <br />
               is a man on this side who would not be 
               <br />
               willing to give that fair-play, and when 
               <br />
               these questions are fraught with so much 
               <br />
               doubt and so much difficulty there is only 
               <br />
               one course, as I shall state presently, to 
               <br />
               he adopted in order to satisfy the public 
               <br />
               mind. The debate so far has been a very 
               <br />
               exhaustive one, and the arguments pro and 
               <br />
               con have been so exhaustive that it is al- 
               <br />

               <br />
               interest to the country, but I simply desire 
               <br />
               to impress upon the members of the House 
               <br />
               this view in regard to the constitution. The 
               <br />
               right hon. leader of the government (Sir 
               <br />
               Wilfrid Laurier) in introducing these Bills 
               <br />
               stated that he was going to give <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">absolute</span> 
               <br />
               autonomy to the Northwest provinces. I 
               <br />
               have already stated what that autonomy 
               <br />
               amounts to where‘ these reservations are 
               <br />
               made and I desiresimply to call the atten—

               tion of the House to the fact that the right

               hon. gentleman, in introducing his Bills, 
               <br />
