               couuse was entirely without any partisan 
               <br />
               bias—that distribution gives the Macleod 
               <br />
               district which cast a vote of 1,700 or 1,800 
               <br />
               at the last election, one representative, while 
               <br />
               it gives two representatives to the adjoining

               districts of Oardston and Lethbridge which 
               <br />
               together did not give as large a vote. Now,

               we may not have made a division absolutely 
               <br />

               <br />
               tainly have made a distribution which shines 
               <br />
               by comparison with that made by our

               <br />
               because it was not the latest available in- 
               <br />
               formation. We took the latest ﬁgures 
               <br />
               available and we arrived at the result now 
               <br />
               before the House. I submit that the con- 
               <br />
               tention as to an undue preponderance of 
               <br />
               representation to the north country which 
               <br />
               according to the census has a population 
               <br />
               of 36,398_as against a population of 33,040 
               <br />
               in the south country, does not carry with 
               <br />
               it the imputation of unfairness. Taking 
               <br />
               the census, taking all the facts, taking the 
               <br />
               comparative areas, taking the railroad con- 
               <br />
               struction now in progress and the further 
               <br />
               railroad construction in prospect, there has 
               <br />
               been an eminently fair and an entirely sat- 
               <br />
               isfactory distribution of seats in the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Alberta. It is too bad that the 
               <br />
               same percentage of undue advantage that 
               <br />
               was held by the southern country under 
               <br />
               the distribution of the local assembly, has 
               <br />
               not been con-tinned. My hon. friend (Mr. 
               <br />
               M. S. McCarthy) has stated frankly to the 
               <br />
               House that he thinks it should be, and 
               <br />
               the statement of his views in that regard 
               <br />
               is sulﬁcient to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">convince,</span> the House as to 
               <br />
               the fairness with which he approaches this

               subject.
