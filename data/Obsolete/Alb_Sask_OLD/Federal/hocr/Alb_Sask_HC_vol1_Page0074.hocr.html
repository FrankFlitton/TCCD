               express the sincere convictions which I 
               <br />
               entertain. My hon. friend (Mr. Foster) <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span>

               spoken of the leader of the government (Sir

               Wilfrid Laurier) as one who has been shorn 
               <br />
               of his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“feathers;</span> he has referred to him in 
               <br />
               contemptuous terms as the erring cham- 
               <br />
               pion of provincial rights. Now in the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               instance let me say that in so far as my hon. 
               <br />
               friend’s allusion to the leader of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) as one who has 
               <br />
               been shorn of his feathers is concerned, 
               <br />
               our answer to him is this : We have heard 
               <br />
               that statement, not so eloquently put forth 
               <br />
               but put forth very frequently in this House, 
               <br />
               and our answer is to appeal to the verdict 
               <br />
               which the people of this country have given 
               <br />
               in 1896, have given again in 1900 and have 
               <br />
               renewed in the month of November-last, 
               <br />
               1904. He has said that the leader of the 
               <br />
               government has lost the respect and the 
               <br />
               conﬁdence of the people of this country. 
               <br />
               I venture to make this statement, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, that the leader of the government 
               <br />
               has not lost the respect nor the conﬁdence 
               <br />
               of any man in this country whose respect 
               <br />
               and whose conﬁdence he values. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend has gone on, leaving the path marked 
               <br />
               out by the leader of the opposition when he 
               <br />
               began this discussion to-day, to challenge the 
               <br />
               government to appeal to the country at the 
               <br />
               present time so as to see whether or not, 
               <br />
               under existing conditions, the conduct of the 
               <br />
               government in respect to this Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories Bill will be approved of. I say 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, and I say it deliberately, and I 
               <br />
               say it with the honest conviction that.my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from Toronto (Mr. Foster) will 
               <br />
               agree with me that designedly gentlemen

               <br />
