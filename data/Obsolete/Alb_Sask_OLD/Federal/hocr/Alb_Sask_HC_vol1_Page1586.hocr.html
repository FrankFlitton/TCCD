               of them were stationed at the hotel where I 
               <br />
               was residing, I could not help but notice the 
               <br />
               splendid physique of the boys and the manly, 
               <br />

               who had control over it. I thought they were 
               <br />
               the most splendid lot of boys I ever saw, and 
               <br />
               boys who will no doubt give a good account 
               <br />
               of themselves in the future. Admiring them 
               <br />
               as much as 1 do, I would like to have the 
               <br />
               Minister of Militia if possible make an ex— 
               <br />
               ception in favour of this corps and give them 
               <br />
               the assistance required to prevent their being 
               <br />
               dissolved. In this he would be doing a good 
               <br />
               thing for the country, and not only reﬂect

               Mr. A. ZIMMERMAN. The order passed 
               <br />
               by the Dominion government has been 
               <br />
               taken advantage of in the province of On- 
               <br />
               tario to a very great extent. In the city 
               <br />
               of Hamilton we have an exceedingly ﬁne 
               <br />
               cadet corps which has been attached to 
               <br />
               the 13th regiment. The Ontario govern- 
               <br />
               ment have contributed $150 towards their 
               <br />
               uniforms and the Dominion government 
               <br />
               have supplied them with riﬂes. In so far 
               <br />
               as their drill is concerned I question whe- 
               <br />
               there there is a regiment in Canada that 
               <br />
               can drill any better than these boys can. 
               <br />
               They are a tine manly lot of boys and they 
               <br />
               will make ﬁrst-class ofﬁcers for the militia. 
               <br />
               The measure attaching these cadet corps to 
               <br />
               the regimentsis one of the wisest that the 
               <br />
               department has passed. It has given great 
               <br />
               encouragement to the boys and we take 
               <br />
               great pride in them. I may say I was in 
               <br />
               Toronto some time ago——

               <br />
               Montreal and I will conclude with a mo- 
               <br />
               tion. The Highland C-adet corps is an his- 
               <br />
               toric institution in Montreal and if the 
               <br />
               hon. Minister of Militia and Defence could. 
               <br />
               see his way clear to encourage it in any 
               <br />
               way it would be an advantage to the force 
               <br />
               generally. I would be sorry to see_that 
               <br />
               corps allowed to go down. Undoubtedly 
               <br />
               the expense of a corps of this kind is very 
               <br />
               abnormal because of the uniform. It is 
               <br />
               largely sustained by subscriptions and I 
               <br />
               think the hon. minister should takesome 
               <br />
               steps to bring this senior cadet corps into 
               <br />
               a more active existence than it has at the 
               <br />
               present time by giving it the support of 
               <br />
               the department. This corps furnishes a 
               <br />
               great many men to the regiments in Mont- 
               <br />
               real, especially -the Royal Scots, and a very 
               <br />
               large number of the men in the Royal 
               <br />
               Scots who enlisted to go to South Africa 
               <br />
               were boys who had been trained in this 
               <br />
               Highland cadet corps. I wish to add my

               er, before the Orders of the Day are called 
               <br />
               I would like to ask the hon. Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance (Mr. Fielding) if he has forgotten 
               <br />
               to bring down the treaty in connection 
               <br />
               with Japan. I noticed that in a late com- 
               <br />
               munication from our agent in Japan he 
               <br />
               cites special instances of where products 
               <br />
               from Canada are charged two and three 
               <br />
               times as much duty and sometimes more 
               <br />
               than those from other countries, thus mak- 
               <br />
               ing it absolutely impossible, it would seem, 
               <br />
               to carry on trade in these products with 
               <br />
               Japan. He points out very strongly how 
               <br />
               detrimental it is to Canadian trade. I 
               <br />
               spoke of the difﬁculty about three weeks 
               <br />
               ago and the hon. minister said that he 
               <br />
               would bring down the treaty or make a 
               <br />
               statement as to the way and in what par- 
               <br />
               ticulars it was considered that the adoption 
               <br />
               or adherence to the treaty by Canada 
               <br />
               would be prejudicial. Here are actual 
               <br />
               prejudicial effects in commerce. What are 
               <br />
               the supposed difﬁculties or prospective trou- 
               <br />
               bles we may anticipate providing we do 
               <br />
               adhere to the treaty? 
               <br />
