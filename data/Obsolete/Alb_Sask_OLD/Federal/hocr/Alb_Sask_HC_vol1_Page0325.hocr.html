               clause 16 of the original Bill as submitted 
               <br />

               Clause 16 to my mind was what it should 
               <br />
               have been, and I would have supported it, 
               <br />
               because it was giving the minority in the 
               <br />
               Northwest justice. Of course, I am speak- 
               <br />
               ing for myself and expressing my own views. 
               <br />
               I am in favour of separate schools; I be- 
               <br />
               lieve in separate schools—not merely in 
               <br />
               the word ‘separate,’ but in the tuition which 
               <br />
               children get in separate schools. I want 
               <br />
               religion to be taught in the schools. I want 
               <br />
               the child to hear of God and to pray in the 
               <br />
               school—not all the time; but I want it to 
               <br />
               be understood that the name of God shall 
               <br />
               be mentioned there. I have heard men 
               <br />
               who .are very sincere say: ‘You are a 
               <br />
               broad—minded man <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">;.</span> why not let all the 
               <br />
               children go to the same school together, with 
               <br />
               the national ﬂag ﬂoating from the top of 
               <br />
               the building ? Of course. there would be 
               <br />
               no prayer in the school, because it would 
               <br />
               offend the Roman Catholics, the Methodists, 
               <br />
               the Presbyterians or the Baptists. There 
               <br />
               would be no religion taught. The children 
               <br />
               would simply go there and learn what is 
               <br />
               necessary to earn their living. They would 
               <br />
               play together, and would grow up to re— 
               <br />
               spect each other.’ I do not believe'in that 
               <br />
               kind of school, and I do not believe that is 
               <br />
               true. I remember that when I was attend—

               there, and it was not very long before we 
               <br />
               were separated. Our differences would 
               <br />
               come out without thinking about them, and, 
               <br />

               posite know the college—it is the Jesuits’ 
               <br />
               College. They have now a separate college 
               <br />
               for English boys. The cause of difference 
               <br />
               between the boys was not religion only ; it 
               <br />
               may have been something else ; but, at any 
               <br />
               rate, we fought together. As men we are- 
               <br />
               surrounded by friends who have been 
               <br />
               brought up in different schools, and we 
               <br />
               appreciate one another; but that apprecia- 
               <br />
               tion is not developed in children. A man 
               <br />
               appreciates in another man certain qualities 
               <br />
               for which he respects him, but a child can- 
               <br />
               not do that. I do not want to convert any- 
               <br />
               body to my opinions, because I know that 
               <br />
               those who have opposite opinions are as 
               <br />
               sincere and honest in holding them as I am 
               <br />
               in holding mine. But I am explaining my 
               <br />
               opinions; and, holding them, when clause 
               <br />
               16 of this Bill was brought down I hailed 
               <br />
               it with pleasure, and I was happy at the 
               <br />
               deliverance which my right lhon. friend 
               <br />
               made on that occasion. It did not last, 
               <br />
               however. Why did it not last ? My hou. 
               <br />
               friend from St. John and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I‘berville</span> (Mr. 
               <br />
               Demers) says we are not doing what we 
               <br />
               would like to do ; we would like to do more, 
               <br />
               but we do what we can in a country like 
               <br />
               this. This is not the way our forefathers 
               <br />
               talked. This is not the way the men who 
               <br />
               built up Canada talked. When Sir John 
               <br />
               A. Macdonald, in 1863, voted for separate 
               <br />
               schools in the province of Ontario, the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Canada at that time, he was not 
               <br />
               doing what he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">himself</span> preferred, for he 
               <br />
               was in favour of public schools; but he 
               <br />
               did so because he thought it was the best 
               <br />
               thing that could be done in the province 
               <br />
               of Canada at that time, on account of the 
               <br />
               different nationalities and creeds in Upper 
               <br />
               and Lower Canada. We have often seen 
               <br />
               occasions of the same kind. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Shall</span> I speak 
               <br />
               of something nearer to us ? In 1896 we 
               <br />
               had before parliament a question very much 
               <br />
               like the present one. except that we were 
               <br />
               dealing with a state of things which was 
               <br />
               existing at that time, whilst at present we 
               <br />
               are creating a state of things. In 1896 the 
               <br />
               Manitoba school question was before parlia- 
               <br />
               ment. It had been before the country since 
               <br />
               1890. I heard the other day the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) boast of hav- 
               <br />
               ing had a great deal to do with the Mani- 
               <br />
               toba school business. I was sorry to hear 
               <br />
               him talk like that, although he gave some 
               <br />
               reasons, in a very clever way, which hid. 
               <br />
               if I may use the word, the odious part of 
               <br />
               the business. He declared that the separate 
               <br />
               schools were not efﬁcient, that they were 
               <br />
               not what they should have been, and that 
               <br />
               money was squandered on them. I need 
               <br />
               not tell the House that those statements 
               <br />
               have been refuted time and time again.

               There may have been some abuses, as there 
               <br />
               are in most things, but on the whole the
