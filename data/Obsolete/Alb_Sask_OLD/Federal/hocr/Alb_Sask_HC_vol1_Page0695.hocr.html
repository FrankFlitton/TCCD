               Now, Mr. Willison has said in the T0-

               for the people to do will be to keep up the 
               <br />

               <br />
               member of this House, I have been a mem- 
               <br />
               ber of pariiament for three months, but I 
               <br />
               will say that during all that time no ques- 
               <br />
               tion has arisen in this House, no legislation 
               <br />
               has been brought forward in relation to 
               <br />
               which any member of the cabinet, any party 
               <br />
               whip or any member of parliament has ap- 
               <br />
               proached me to know how I would vote in 
               <br />
               one way or the other. I say that in this 
               <br />
               article in the ‘ Guardian ’ is the lash, here is 
               <br />
               what the hon. member for North Toronto 
               <br />
               will call a ‘lead-loaded’ lash, and I refuse . 
               <br />
               to be driven by any' such lash as that. 'Iihere 
               <br />
               is also a threat that if I will not vote as 
               <br />
               the man who penned these words and 
               <br />
               those who agree with him say I ought to 
               <br />
               vote, I will never again get back to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> 
               <br />
               House. Sir, I think it is the right of the 
               <br />
               electors in any riding, it is not only the 
               <br />
               right but the duty—and a duty perhaps that 
               <br />
               is not often enough exercised—I believe it 
               <br />
               is the right of the people in every riding 
               <br />
               to keep in touch with their representative, 
               <br />
