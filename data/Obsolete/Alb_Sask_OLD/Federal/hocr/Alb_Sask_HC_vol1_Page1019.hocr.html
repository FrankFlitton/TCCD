               the Territories with which this Bill deals, I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that they are housed in 1,100 school- 
               <br />
               houses. Of these less than a dozen—to be 
               <br />
               exact, eleven—are occupied by the separate

               Protestant and nine are so-called Roman

               Catholic. I ﬁnd that these 1,100 are using 
               <br />
               exactly the same text—books; are taught, 
               <br />

               <br />
               amined by the same government inspectors ; 
               <br />
               in fact, in every way are public government

               tion. One difference only exists, and it is 
               <br />
               this: I ﬁnd that in the two so-called Pro-

               <br />

               <br />
               Methodist, Presbyterian, Anglican, or what- 
               <br />
               ever other denomination—may come after 
               <br />
               school hours are done, after 3.30 o’clock, and 
               <br />
               may for thirty minutes give religious instruc- 
               <br />
               tion. I ﬁnd that in the nine so—called Catho-

               lic separate schools, if a majority of parents 
               <br />
               desire it, a clergyman of that faith may have 
               <br />
               the same privilege, at the same hour, and 
               <br />
               for the same length of time; and I further 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that no child is obliged to remain whose

               parents object. This provision is in exact

               been in these Territories for about thirty
