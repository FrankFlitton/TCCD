               are permitted no more say in the management

               an appearance of compliance with the law?

               Why is it that the bishop deems it necessary

               a certain point. To discharge its obligations 
               <br />
               properly the state should guarantee that the 
               <br />
               schools should be free and open to all, Prot— 
               <br />
               estant and Catholic, Jew and Gentile. The 
               <br />
               state does not interfere with any religious 
               <br />
               denomination ; it leaves all free to teach what 
               <br />
               doctrines they will and how they will; the 
               <br />
               denominations, on their part, should leave the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">state</span> free in the matter of secular education. 
               <br />
               The duty of a state is to encourage the child- 
               <br />
               ren of all creeds and races to grow up together, 
               <br />
               as Canadian citizens. Surely it is not bigotry 
               <br />
               for a public journal to work for the removal 
               <br />
               of differences, dissensions and prejudices in a 
               <br />
               country whose destiny depends on the ability 
               <br />
               and willingnes of all her people to live and 
               <br />
               work together in harmony. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">»</span>

               the union to-day is stronger than it ever
