               <br />

               <br />
               April. 011 looking over those lists, I found 
               <br />
               that only one was printed, and I went to 
               <br />
               the King’s Printer and asked him if I might 
               <br />
               have one of the printed Edmonton lists.

               evidently printed in the Government Bureau,

               knew that it was printed.

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">INGRAM.</span> I do not care for ‘Han- 
               <br />
               sard.’ Usually I quote it, but when an hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman undertakes to say that Han- 
               <br />
               sard’ is c011'ect,we had the evidence only 
               <br />
               the other day that a question asked in this 
               <br />
               House was not to be found' in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Hansal'df</span> No 
               <br />
               one pretends to say that ‘Hansard’ is cor- 
               <br />
               rect. It is not. Every one knows that when 
               <br />
               the House is in committee there'is a great 
               <br />
               deal said that does not appear in ‘Han~ 
               <br />
               sard.’ and I do not wonder at it, because 
               <br />
               frequently there is so much noise that it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is,</span> 
               <br />
               impossible for the ‘Hansard’ men to take 
               <br />
               down accurately all that is said. When I 
               <br />
               asked-last night if there <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«were</span> lists for the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories, I understood the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Justice to say that there were not. 
               <br />
               We were speaking about the Franchise law, 
               <br />
               and I was asking certain questions in regard 
               <br />
               to the Northwest Territories ln connection 
               <br />
               with the amendments that had been made to 
               <br />
               that law. We are creating these Territories 
               <br />
               into provinces, and to my mind, the question 
               <br />
               of the lists was an important question. That 
               <br />
               is the reason. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘had</span> no object in attacking 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice. I simply under- 
               <br />
               stood him to say that there were no lists in 
               <br />
               the Territoxies. I did not suppose that he 
               <br />
               knew any thing about the printed lists. Evi- 
               <br />
               dently my hon. friend from Westein Asslni— 
               <br />
               boia (\I1. Scott) did not know anything 
               <br />
               about that and I venture to say that many 
               <br />
               other members 011 that side did not know 
               <br />
               that there were p1inted lists. But what I 
               <br />
               do insist on knowing is who ordered the lists 
               <br />
               to be printed at the Government Bureau; 
               <br />
               why was the Conservative party, who have 
               <br />
               rights in this country, as well as the other 
               <br />
               side, debarred from having these printed
