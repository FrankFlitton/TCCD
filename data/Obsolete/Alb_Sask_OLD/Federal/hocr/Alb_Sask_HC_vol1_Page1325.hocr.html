               acter, to which so much objection has been

               L. McCarthy) takes the same position. He 
               <br />
               says that if you leave clause 2 in the Bill, a 
               <br />
               more effective system of separate schools 
               <br />

               <br />
               hon. friend from Saskatchewan (Mr. La— 
               <br />
               mont) has declared himself of the opinion 
               <br />
               that section 16 is necessary in order to 
               <br />
               prevent the establishment of clerical schools, 
               <br />
               which were imposed by the Act of 1875. He 
               <br />
               has declared that in two aspects—ﬁrst, in 
               <br />
               dealing with the meaning of my amend- 
               <br />
               ments, and, in the next place, in deal- 
               <br />
               ing with the effect of clause 2—he ﬁnds 
               <br />
               clerical schools provided for in the Act of 
               <br />
               1875. A great many other hon. gentlemen, 
               <br />
               such as the hon. member for Western Assi- 
               <br />
               niboia (Mr. Scott) and the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Centre York (Mr. Campbell), also ﬁnd cle- 
               <br />
               rical schools provided for in that Act. When 
               <br />
               We advance a little in the discussion of 
               <br />
               clause 16, I shall be very glad to learn from 
               <br />
               some of those hon. gentlemen the exact 
               <br />
               words in the Act of 1875 on which they 
               <br />
               rely as bringing about that result. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend from West Peterboro (Mr. Hall) 
               <br />
               makes the same argument. He says in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> that if you leave clause 2 in this 
               <br />
               Bill, you impose clerical schools on the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories. My hon. friend from 
               <br />
               North Ontario (Mr. Grant), at page 4712 of 
               <br />
               ‘Hansard,’ expresses himself as rather of 
               <br />
               that opinion, although he is not so positive 
               <br />
               as some of the other hon. gentlemen to 
               <br />
               whom I have referred. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Guysboro’ (Mr. Sinclair) takes exactly 
               <br />
               the same view. He declares, not by direct 
               <br />
               words perhaps, but by inference, that the 
               <br />
               effect of section 2 will be to bring into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬂame</span> 
               <br />
               and perpetuate in the Northwest clerical 
               <br />
               schools. My hon. friend from Winnipeg 
               <br />
               (Mr. Bole) twice declares that, not by in- 
               <br />
               ference, but in so many words ; and I gather 
               <br />
               the same view from the words of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from South Wellington (Mr. Guthrie). 
               <br />
               These are rather important considerations 
               <br />
               for my hon. friend the Minister of Justice, 
               <br />
               who takes the ground, as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«I</span> understand his 
               <br />
               argument, that apart altogether from sec-

               <br />
               under such words as we have in section 2 of 
               <br />

               <br />
               organic law of the Territories, in so far as

               it restricts the right of the provinces to 
               <br />
               create an educational system without creat-

               ing separate schools as well. Of course, I

               fully, or else they have not taken very great 
               <br />
               care with regard to the language they use. 
               <br />
               So far as I understand the object of the le- 
               <br />
               gislation and the possible effect of section 2, 
               <br />
               and the effect of section 16, it is not the 
               <br />
               continuance of a system, but it is the im- 
               <br />
               position upon the Northwest Territories of 
               <br />
               a restriction in respect of any system which 
               <br />
               they may continue at present or may create 
               <br />
               in the future. A restrictive principle would 
               <br />
               perhaps be a good term to apply to it. That 
               <br />
               is the thing that is being continued. Apart 
               <br />
               from the continuance of that, the people of 
               <br />
               the Northwest'in their legislature can deal 
               <br />
               with the school system exactly as they see 
               <br />
               ﬁt. Now, my hon. friend the Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior, to Whose remarks I shall devote 
               <br />
               some attention when we come to clause 16, 
               <br />
               took the ground that the Act of 1875 had 
               <br />
               been in some way restricted by the territo- 
               <br />
               rial ordinances, and he cited an opinion of 
               <br />
               Sir John Thompson on a question of the 
               <br />
               disallowance of those ordinances. Sir John 
               <br />
               Thompson did not deal with the question 
               <br />
               in the light presented by the Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior at all. He was not dealing, as I 
               <br />
               understand his report, with the question of 
               <br />
               cutting down the rights of the minority in 
               <br />
               respect to the character of the public 
               <br />
               schools ; he was only dealing with the effect 
               <br />
               of the ordinances as making it unnecessary 
               <br />
               to establish separate schools in certain un- 
               <br />
               organized districts.
