               Mr. EMMERSON. If any one had the 
               <br />
               intention of proposing such an amendment 
               <br />
               he did not make it known before the com- 
               <br />
               mittee. I would call my hon. friend’s at- 
               <br />
               tention to the fact that section 5 as now in 
               <br />
               the Bill is the standard section, and I think 
               <br />
               it we adopt the amendment it would be 
               <br />
               a departure from the course invariably pur— 
               <br />
               sued by the committee with respect to all

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HENDERSON.</span> The amendment

               Whieh was drafted and put into my hands 
               <br />
               seems to be for the improvement of the 
               <br />
               Bill, to make it conform with what is gen- 
               <br />
               erally done in the Railway Committee. The 
               <br />
               clause makes reference to the construction 
               <br />
               of the railway authorized by the said Act 
               <br />
               of the province of British Columbia. Now 
               <br />
               are we not making a provision for the con- 
               <br />
               struction of the railway authorized by this 
               <br />
               Act? It seems to me that the clause offered 
               <br />
               is a limited clause, and will not in the event 
               <br />
               of section 3 being adopted cover the Whole
