               upon the people of Canada certain legis- 
               <br />

               <br />
               eral way a scheme for the distribution of 
               <br />
               legislative powers to be exercised by the 
               <br />
               Dominion or the provinces. It suggests in 
               <br />
               a general way that some of these powers, 
               <br />
               of which it gives a list, may properly be 
               <br />
               given to a province, and the others may 
               <br />
               properly be left to the Dominion. But the 
               <br />
               British North America Act, according to 
               <br />
               those who look at its spirit rather than its 
               <br />
               letter, does not in itself contain a model 
               <br />
               constitution that automatically attaches, 
               <br />
               without the variation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of"a</span> word or a letter, 
               <br />
               to every province the moment it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">becomes</span> the 
               <br />
               province. If the reasoning of the leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition is right, there is no reason 
               <br />
               why, when a province is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">establishFd,</span> par- 
               <br />
               liament should trouble itself to declare any 
               <br />
               of these powers. And yet, if you trace the 
               <br />
               history of theseveral provinces of Canada 
               <br />
               from their creation up to the present, you 
               <br />
               will ﬁnd that, in every instance, the parlia- 
               <br />

               diiferent from those that the Confederation 
               <br />
               Act would suggest. If each province gets 
               <br />
               its constitution automatically from the 
               <br />
               British North America Act, we in this House

               <br />
               stitution of the new provinces. But if we 
               <br />
               interpret the British North America Act, 
               <br />
               not by its letter, but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘by</span> its spirit and by the

               the creation of every one of the provinces 
               <br />
               from confederation down to the present 
               <br />
               time, we fail to ﬁnd a single instance where 
               <br />
               the doctrine of the leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               has been adopted, where any province has 
               <br />
               been given a constitution exactly in bar— 
               <br />
               mony with the general scheme of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act. There are no two pro- 
               <br />
               vinces whose constitutions are the same, 
               <br />
               though all derive their constitutions from 
               <br />
               the British North America Act. It is 
               <br />
               the spirit that suggests how the constitu- 
               <br />
               tion shall be framed. So, where is the 
               <br />
               model? And how can it be argued that 
               <br />
               when a province acquires the provincial 
               <br />
               status it acquires immediately certain rights 
               <br />
               and powers without any intervention or 
               <br />
               exercise of discretion on the part of the Do-

               <br />
               others by the provincial parliament. Take,

               for instance, the important subject of di- 
               <br />
               vorce. Under the British North America 
               <br />

               <br />
               jurisdiction of the Dominion parliament. 
               <br />
               If the literal wording of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act is adopted in giving a consti-

               <br />
               divorce court unless it was so authorized 
               <br />
               by this parliament. This parliament has 
               <br />
               never established a divorce court in any 
               <br />
               province. And yet to—day there are divorce 
               <br />
               courts in several provinces—in Nova Scotia, 
               <br />
               in New Brunswick and, I think, in British 
               <br />
               Columbia. How comes it that the subject 
               <br />
               of divorce. which, under the British North 
               <br />

               <br />
               jurisdiction of the Dominion parliament, is 
               <br />
               dealt with by several provinces? Simply 
               <br />
               because, when it came to the creation of 
               <br />
               confederation, certain provinces had at that 
               <br />
               time this institution. Nova Scotia had a 
               <br />
               divorce court and desired to retain it. The 
               <br />
               British North America Act allowed it to be 
               <br />
               retained in that province. In that respect 
               <br />
               it allowed a departure from the British 
               <br />
               North America Act. The province of Que— 
               <br />
               bec had no divorce court, and no divorce 
               <br />
               court was given it under the British North 
               <br />
               America Act—the Act recognized the status 
               <br />
               quo as respects that subject in the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec. New Brunswick had a divorce 
               <br />
               court and wished to retain it, and the British 
               <br />
               North America Act recognized the wish of 
               <br />
               that province and allowed it to retain the 
               <br />
               divorce court, thus making an exception 
               <br />
               from the letter of the Act. Ontario had no 
               <br />
               divorce court and was given no divorce court 
               <br />
               by the Act. Later on British Columbia 
               <br />
               came into confederation. As I understand 
               <br />
               it. British Columbia had a divorce court 
               <br />
               then, and it was left in the employment of 
               <br />
               that institution—the letter of the law was 
               <br />
               departed from, but the spirit was observed ; 
               <br />
               the general scheme of confederation was 
               <br />
               made applicable, but, with exceptions, re- 
               <br />
               cognizing local peculiarities and local insti- 
               <br />
               tutions. Then—going rapidly over the sub- 
               <br />
               jects of special importance to the provinces 
               <br />
               ——take the subject of languages. This is 
               <br />
               an English-speaking country; and it was 
               <br />
               assumed, doubtless, that English would be 
               <br />
               the prevailing language throughout the 
               <br />
               country. The use of language in the courts 
               <br />
               and legislatures of the provinces is a civil 
               <br />
               right, and, as such, is under the exclusive 
               <br />
               jurisdiction of the province. Yet, turning 
               <br />
               to the constitution as affecting the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec, you will ﬁnd that, unlike the 
               <br />
               other provinces, Quebec was not left to 
               <br />
               determine what languages shall or shall 
               <br />
               not be used in its courts and legislature, 
               <br />
               but the British North America Act declares 
               <br />
               that the English language, along with the 
               <br />
               French. shall be lawful in the courts and 
               <br />
               legislature of that province.
