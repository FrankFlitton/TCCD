               not seem to be in a communicative mood,

               I wish to say a few Words with respect to 
               <br />
               the legal aspect of this question and the 
               <br />
               constitutional rights of this parliament to 
               <br />
               enact this legislation. Will the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice deny that if the amendment is 
               <br />
               passed ordinances 29 and 30 of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories become the organic law of 
               <br />
               the provinces to be organized ? He will not. 
               <br />
               If it is the organic law of the provinces to 
               <br />
               be organized, how can we be blamed if we 
               <br />
               do not know just exactly what the law is 
               <br />
               when these ordinances contain about 200 
               <br />
               sections ? And yet this is being forced by 
               <br />
               legislation by reference into the constitu- 
               <br />
               tion of these new provinces in a way which 
               <br />
               I say ought not to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Jbe</span> tolerated in any legis- 
               <br />
               lature in Canada. I state, as a lawyer, that 
               <br />
               no mortal man can tell with any degree of 
               <br />
               certainty what the constitution of either 
               <br />
               province will be if you legislate in the way 
               <br />
               that is proposed by the First Minister in 
               <br />
               this Bill. The Minister of Justice will not 
               <br />
               deny that I am right in that statement. 
               <br />
               Now, the First Minister, in introducing this 
               <br />
               Bill. said there was a necessity on the part 
               <br />
               of the government to import into the consti- 
               <br />
               tution of the new provinces the school 
               <br />
               clauses of the British North America Act. 
               <br />
               I think I am correctly stating the position 
               <br />
               taken by the First Minister when he intro- 
               <br />
               duced this Bill. Where does any lawyer 
               <br />
               ﬁnd in the British North America Act, or 
               <br />
               in the Act of 187]. or in the Act of 1886. 
               <br />
               any foundation for any such statement as 
               <br />
               that ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“’hy,</span> Sir. section 93 of the British

               at the time of the union. And it was stated 
               <br />
               by some hon. gentleman yesterday—I think 
               <br />
               it was the hon. member for South Welling-

               <br />
               going to apply himself to the discussion of 
               <br />
               the legal question, but that he was going to 
               <br />
               answer my hon. friend the leader of the

               <br />

               <br />
               why cannot we do so today ? I would like

               to ask my hon. friend the Minister of Jus- 
               <br />
               tice if he thinks that is a fair argument? 
               <br />
               I would like to ask my hon. friend the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Justice if he thinks that is a legal 
               <br />
               argument? He does not. For he well . 
               <br />
               knows that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> we are legislating for 
               <br />
               the constitution of a province, but in 1875 
               <br />
               we were legislating for the government of 
               <br />
               an unorganized <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">territory—two</span> entirely dif- 
               <br />
               ferent things. And yet the Minilter of Jus- 
               <br />
               tice sought to convince the members of this 
               <br />
               House—he did not believe it himself, I am 
               <br />
               satisﬁed—that that was a valid argument, 
               <br />
               and that what we could do with respect to 
               <br />
               the law of an unorganized territory in 1875 
               <br />
               we could do with respect to the constitution 
               <br />
               of a province in 1905. The statement has 
               <br />
               only to be made to refute itself. The Act 
               <br />
               of this parliament of 1875 was only tem- 
               <br />
               porary, it applied to the organization of a 
               <br />
               territory for the time being. And the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Justice this afternoon used the argu- 
               <br />
               ment that the people of the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories voluntarily voted in support of the 
               <br />
               school system of that province. Did they ? 
               <br />
               Where is it ? Will the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               point it out ? It cannot be done, Mr. Speak- 
               <br />
               er. Why, what he referred to was this— 
               <br />
               that under the Act of 1875 they made ordin- 
               <br />
               ances to carry out the terms of the separate 
               <br />
               school clause imposed upon the people of the 
               <br />
               west by that Act. Was it a voluntary act 
               <br />
               on the part of the people of the west, pass- 
               <br />
               ing these ordinances ? Will the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice say that? No; he cannot say 
               <br />
               that. It was not a voluntary act, and he 
               <br />
               knows it, because, under section 11 of the 
               <br />
               Act of 1875, it is provided that they ‘ shall’ 
               <br />
               make ordinances to carry out the terms of 
               <br />
               the legislation. Yet this is the kind of argu- 
               <br />
               ment that was met with thunderous applause 
               <br />
               by hon. gentlemen opposite. Now, Sir, I go 
               <br />
               further. The Act of 1875 never received the 
               <br />
               assent of the people of the west. They had 
               <br />
               no option in the matter; it was imposed 
               <br />
               upon them whether they willed it or not. I 
               <br />
               am not questioning the right of parliament 
               <br />
               to pass the Act of 1875. That Act was 
               <br />
               with respect to an unorganized territory. But 
               <br />
               I do question the right of parliament to pass 
               <br />
               the legislation now proposed. But hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite say that because the 
               <br />
               separate school system under that Act of 
               <br />
               1875 has existed in that country for thirty 
               <br />
