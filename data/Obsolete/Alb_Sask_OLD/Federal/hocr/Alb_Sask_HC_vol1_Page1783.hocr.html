               the same reason that this government has 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> for not doing justice, the principal 
               <br />
               reason probably was that Sir John Thomp- 
               <br />
               son, who had been attacked by a certain 
               <br />
               wing of his party, wanted to have himself 
               <br />
               forgiven for being a Roman Catholic. . That 
               <br />
               was the political reason. The ostensible 
               <br />
               reason given by Sir John Thompson was 
               <br />
               that the time was too short because he had 
               <br />
               received the petitions only a few days be- 
               <br />
               fore the year elapsed, and he gave further 
               <br />
               this reason, that the complaint of the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholics was rather based 
               <br />
               upon dangers which might arise from 
               <br />
               the ordinances of 1892 and that they 
               <br />
               had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘not</span> yet received any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ill-treat~</span> 
               <br />
               ment under these ordinances, that he 
               <br />
               did not see any special article under these 
               <br />
               ordinances which clashed, in his opinion, 
               <br />
               legally with the dispositions of the law of 
               <br />
               1875. As the Prime Minister has rightly 
               <br />
               stated this afternoon, the law of 1875 did 
               <br />
               not pretend to be a public instruction law, 
               <br />
               it was simply an organic law to be con- 
               <br />
               sidered the basis of future legislation.

               Mr. BOURASSA. Certainly. There is no 
               <br />
               doubt the ordinance of 1892 was against 
               <br />
               the spirit of the law. Of course when it 
               <br />
               comes to the ﬁne legal point as to Whether 
               <br />
               this or that article of the ordinance of 1892 
               <br />
               was legally against the law of 1875, there 
               <br />
               is no doubt, I suppose, that Sir John Thomp— 
               <br />
               son could ﬁnd_the same easy excuse that 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition and that the 
               <br />
               government are now ﬁnding in order not to 
               <br />
               do full justice. But I want to remind gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen on both sides of the House that the 
               <br />
               fact that the ordinance of 1892 was not dis- 
               <br />
               allowed did not have the same result as if 
               <br />
               it hâd been a law from another province, 
               <br />
               that the fact that the ordinance of 1892 
               <br />
               was not disallowed within the 12 months 
               <br />
               following its sanction by the Lieutenant 
               <br />
               Governor of the Territory did not 'deprive 
               <br />
               this parliament of the right of rendering 
               <br />
               justice when these dangers which Sir John 
               <br />
               Thompson pointed out as being only in the 
               <br />
               future were to arise. In connection with 
               <br />
               this I will quote the words of Sir John 
               <br />
               Thompson in a debate in this House on a 
               <br />

               I echo these sentiments. I say that this 
               <br />
               parliament has always the right at any 
               <br />
               time on any occasion to remedy the in- 
               <br />
               justice that was committed in 1892. Is 
               <br />
               this not the very occasion when we are 
               <br />
               going to abandon all that right of sover- 
               <br />
               eignty which we now possess, when we are 
               <br />
               going to hand over for ever to the provinces 
               <br />
               the right to deal with these matters, re- 
               <br />
               serving to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ourselves</span> what I might call the 
               <br />
               empty right of remedial legislation under 
               <br />
               clause 93? If there is a time when we 
               <br />
               should not create injustice it is when we 
               <br />
               are building a constitution in that country. 
               <br />
               If there is a time when we should do that 
               <br />
               justice for which my hon. friend the Min— 
               <br />
               ister of Inland Revenue OMr. Brodeur) was 
               <br />
               appealing to the English-speaking Protestant 
               <br />
               Liberal members of this House in 1894. I 
               <br />
               think this is the occasion and it is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">only</span> 
               <br />
               occasion, and if you let it pass justice Will
