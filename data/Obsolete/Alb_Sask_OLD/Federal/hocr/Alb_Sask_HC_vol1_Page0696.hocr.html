               Sir, speaking of the hon. the Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister, it has been said by Conservatives, it 
               <br />
               has been said by Reformers, it has been 
               <br />
               said by men who have no great political 
               <br />
               inclination one way or the other, that the 
               <br />
               Grits never could get into power while Sir 
               <br />
               John A. Macdonald was alive; and that 
               <br />
               while Sir Wilfrid Laurier is alive and the 
               <br />
               leader of his party, the Conservatives never 
               <br />
               can get into power. I believe that a great 
               <br />
               many people in this country accept that 
               <br />
               statement as expressing the situation. I 
               <br />
               believe that a great many Conservatives 
               <br />
               accept that view, and without any regret 
               <br />
               they desire that Sir Wilfrid Laurier shall 
               <br />
               continue to be Prime Minister for many 
               <br />
               years to come. I believe there are many 
               <br />
               Conservatives as well as Reformers who 
               <br />
               believe that Sir Wilfrid Laurier stands to- 
               <br />
               day pre~eminently as the one man best 
               <br />
               titted to occupy the position he now occu- 
               <br />
               pies as Prime Minister of this Dominion. 
               <br />
               But, Sir, there are in this country other 
               <br />
               people who so hunger and thirst for power, 
               <br />
               who perhaps having once tasted the sweets 
               <br />
               of oﬂice, hope to taste these sweets of oiﬁce 
               <br />
               again, and there are others who are so 
               <br />
               bitterly partisan that they want their party 
               <br />
               to win whatever may be the result to 
               <br />
               the country, and who would like to see 
               <br />
               the political death of Sir Wilfrid Lau- 
               <br />
               rier as being the one thing that will 
               <br />
               give them a chance to come back into 
               <br />
               power. They are willing to shoot poisoned 
               <br />
               arrows and poisoned darts from any refuge, 
               <br />
               they are willing to draw the long bow, and 
               <br />
               stop at nothing to injure the premier and 
               <br />
               to cast him from the position which he oc- 
               <br />
               cupies. I have heard it said that certain 
               <br />
               charges, that a great number of charges 
               <br />
               which have been made against the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister in this paper or in that paper must 
               <br />
               be true because they have not been denied. 
               <br />
               I say that every insinuation, every charge 
               <br />
               Of iittleness, of smalless, of subserviency,

               preceded 1896, they remember the compara-

               men believe that she is likely to attain to
