               Honourable the Secretary of State for the Colo—

               nies was advised that it was not considered

               expedient that Canada should take advantage of

               That, as I understand from the minister, 
               <br />
               was owing to the fact that the details of the 
               <br />
               tarilÏ were not well understood at that time. 
               <br />
               Perhaps it would be of advantage, if these 
               <br />
               communications are not already before the

               <br />
               veniént time. I am not sure whether I 
               <br />
               gathered correctly from the minister (Mr. 
               <br />
               Fisher) that so far as Canada is concerned 
               <br />
               we would be exactly in the same position as 
               <br />
               the United States—that is we could take 
               <br />
               advantage of this treaty without offering 
               <br />
               any special tariff concessions in return. I 
               <br />
               was absent for a moment or two while the 
               <br />
               minister was speaking and am not sure that 
               <br />
               I followed exactly what he said concerning 
               <br />
               the opportunities which might be given to 
               <br />
               Canada to take advantage of the treaty now.

               Mr. FISHER. First, in regard to the

               <br />
               has mentioned the United States. Of course,

               if we adhere to the British treaty, we shall

               <br />
               that does not involve any change except in

               therefore there will be no change in our
