               came back to Canada for the purpose of

               In a book which he published some years

               ed. That is not all. We ﬁnd that after 
               <br />
               Archbishop Taché went to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northwest,</span> a 
               <br />
               delegation was sent from the settlers of that

               country to Ottawa to confer with the Gana— 
               <br />
               dian government and the Governor General, 
               <br />
               Sir John <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,Young.</span> Those settlers presented a 
               <br />
               Bill of Rights covering the demands which 
               <br />
               they intended to make upon the Dominion 
               <br />
               government. Among other things, they ask- 
               <br />
               ed the Canadian government that the 
               <br />
               privileges which they had hitherto enjoy- 
               <br />
               ed should be continued. More than that. 
               <br />
               Let me call special attention to this fact, 
               <br />
               because it shows what was the agreement 
               <br />
               and contract then entered into. The imperial 
               <br />
               and Canadian governments had both been 
               <br />
               asking the settlers to formulate their de- 
               <br />
               mands, to mention what they wanted in con- 
               <br />
               nection with the establishment of Canadian 
               <br />
               authority in their country. The represen-

               tatives of these settlers came to Ottawa, 
               <br />
               and among the demands they made is the 
               <br />
               following, which we ﬁnd in article 7 of their 
               <br />
               Bill of Rights:

               <br />
