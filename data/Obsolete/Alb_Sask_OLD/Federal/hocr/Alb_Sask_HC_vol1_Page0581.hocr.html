               their failure to give relief to the Catholics

               said in this debate as to the right of the

               sible for the conduct of that ablegate in 
               <br />
               this country. It is up to the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman, either to endorse what the ableg-

               ate did in that interview with Mr.

               Campbell or to repudiate it, and if 
               <br />
               he repudiates it, to ask for the recall 
               <br />
               of the Papal ablegate. We are told as a 
               <br />
               matter of fact that he has been recalled and 
               <br />
               that he is to leave the country—or rather 
               <br />
               it is put in a more polite way—that he is to 
               <br />
               go back to Rome to explain his conduct in 
               <br />
               this matter. I believe they are most anx-

               the Minister of Justice has already drawn
