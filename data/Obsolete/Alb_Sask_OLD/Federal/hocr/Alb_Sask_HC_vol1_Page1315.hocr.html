               <br />
               we could have had very considerable com-

               <br />
               should be given to it and I rather think that 
               <br />
               the government will not require to expend 
               <br />
               very much money now to give publicity to 
               <br />

               <br />
               into a contract it would be well that all

               <br />
               would not mislead the House, but I found 
               <br />
               in the correction I made, I unwittingly fell 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">into</span> another blunder. I do not hold myself

               the hon. Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding) 
               <br />
               responsible for that because he should have 
               <br />
               known that his estimates were incorrect 
               <br />
               Somebody was responsible for it. I would 
               <br />
               not like to say that the hon. Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance was responsible for it, but it is a 
               <br />

               ments before, that the estimate for this 
               <br />
               work came in this session, was correct, and 
               <br />

               friend the impression that there was a sum 
               <br />
               asked for last session are not correct. The 
               <br />
               estimates are correct in regard to the sum 
               <br />
               that they ask for, but in the comparative 
               <br />
               column, there is an error. I did not observe 
               <br />
               it until my hon. friend spoke. I sent for my 
               <br />
               olﬁcial at once and he points out that these 
               <br />
               ﬁgures which were intended to appear in 
               <br />
               two columns had been moved over to the 
               <br />
               left. The sum of $100,000 appears in the 
               <br />
               appropriation column for 1905-6. So far cor- 
               <br />
               rect. Then it should have appeared in the 
               <br />
               right hand column under the head of ‘in- 
               <br />

               <br />
               fault it is. but in the printing of this item, 
               <br />
               instead of appearing in the column for the 
               <br />
               appropriation for 1905—6 and in the column 
               <br />
               of increase, it appeared in the appropriation 
               <br />
               column and in the comparative column of 
               <br />
               votes last year. This comparison should be 
               <br />
               correct and I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">want</span> to explain how the error 
               <br />
               occurred. When my hon. friend said yes-

               <br />
               importance, to the question we are discussing. 
               <br />
               The ex—Minister 'of the Interior (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Stitch)</span> 
               <br />
               dominated that department—whether he has 
               <br />
               dominated outside of that department or 
               <br />
               not—for a number of years. Has any one 
               <br />
               the shadow of a doubt that the minister 
               <br />
               having taken all the initial steps necessary 
               <br />
               to award the contract, that contract would 
               <br />
               have been absolutely awarded and would 
               <br />
               have been in effect to-day, had that minister 
               <br />
               been in Ottawa ? The fact that the contract 
               <br />
               was not awarded is due to the accidental cir- 
               <br />
               cumstance that the minister was obliged to 
               <br />
               be absent, and that for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some‘reaso'n</span> there 
               <br />
               was delay in either waiting for the minister 
               <br />
               or for the advent of a new minister. This is 
               <br />
               what has occurred so far as we can judge. 
               <br />
               A project was on hand to build a line of 
               <br />
               costly wire fence. That project had its in- 
               <br />
               ception in the Department of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Interior,</span> 
               <br />
               and without any appropriation being asked 
               <br />
               for or obtained from this parliament, the re— 
               <br />
               sponsible minister of the department decided 
               <br />
               that the work should go on ; work for which 
               <br />
               there was not a dollar of money voted. He
