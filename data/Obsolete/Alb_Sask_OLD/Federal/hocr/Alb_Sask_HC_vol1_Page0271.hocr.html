               stated that he had dissented from clause 16

               Interior (Mr. Sifton) say the other day? 
               <br />
               He said that the moment he read that

               clause, he went to the Prime Minister and

               the Interior, resigned because he could not

               accept clause 16. And, now, a strange

               thing happens. and one most <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁcult</span> to re— 
               <br />
               concile with all that has gone before. The 
               <br />
               Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) him- 
               <br />
               self, in his place in parliament, declared: 
               <br />
               I never intended that in that legislation any 
               <br />
               more should be granted than is at present 
               <br />
               enjoyed under the ordinances of the North- 
               <br />
               west. And the Minister of Justice (Mr. 
               <br />
               Fitzpatrick) from his place in this House 
               <br />
               declared that it was never the intention of 
               <br />
               the government that anything more should 
               <br />
               be put into the constitution of the new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces than absolutely what was enjoyed 
               <br />
               under the ordinances I have spoken of. Now, 
               <br />
               it is to be presumed—at least, it ought to 
               <br />
               be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">presumable—that</span> when the Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior, an intelligent man, went to the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister, another intelligent man and, 
               <br />
               as we suppose, told him that because of his 
               <br />
               - reading of clause 16 he was obliged to dis— 
               <br />
               sent an-d leave the cabinet, it ought to be 
               <br />
               presumable in that case that the other in— 
               <br />
               telligent man the Prime Minister must have 
               <br />
               said to him: Mr. Sifton, I never meant 
               <br />
               what you read in that clause; all that I 
               <br />
               meant, or mean <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today.</span> is that the North- 
               <br />
               west shall enjoy, as to separate schools, 
               <br />
               only the privileges that it has at the pre- 
               <br />
               sent time. Did that conversation take place? 
               <br />
               The moment it did. Mr. Sifton, and the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister were at one, and there 
               <br />
               was no cause for resignation. Did that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conversation</span> not take place. at least so 
               <br />
               far as the Prime Minister is concerned ? 
               <br />
               Then, if the Prime Minister’s statement, 
               <br />
               made in this House. is correct and he never 
               <br />
               intended anything but what is in the pre- 
               <br />
               sent ordinances. it was clearly his duty to

               most mysterious mystery, as to why the

               three weeks time? The clause is brought

               down exactly to the liking of the Minister

               <br />

               But let me give, in effect, the reason why

               the Minister of the Interior could not as- 
               <br />
               sent to clause 16, as that reason was given 
               <br />
               by the hon. gentleman (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Siftoni</span> himself. 
               <br />
               He said, in the ﬁrst place. that the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister had been very ill—advised to bring 
               <br />

               <br />
               chance to impart his knowledge and opinions 
               <br />
               concerning it. It turns out that that was 
               <br />
               correct on the part of the Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior anyway. But the reason why 
               <br />
               the Minister of the Interior could not swal— 
               <br />
               low clause 16 was this—that in the verbiage. 
               <br />
               compact. well thought out. put together by 
               <br />
               the hand of a master. there was something 
               <br />
               concealed. Not altogether concealed from 
               <br />
               himself. the Minister of the Interior said—— 
               <br />
               he knew too much for that. But what was 
               <br />
               concealed in that verbiage? There was an 
               <br />
               irrevocable constitutional ear-mark upon 
               <br />
