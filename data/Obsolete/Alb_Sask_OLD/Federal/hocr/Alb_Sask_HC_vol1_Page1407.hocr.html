               that I challenge the Minister of the Interior

               <br />
               the character of the man I have to deal with. 
               <br />
               His conduct and his language has been such 
               <br />
               since he has returned as a minister of the 
               <br />

               <br />

               that if the geographical position of the North-

               would be occupying a less important seat

               than that which he occupies now. But the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman had to refer to some personal

               affairs: he could not treat this in a way

               <br />
