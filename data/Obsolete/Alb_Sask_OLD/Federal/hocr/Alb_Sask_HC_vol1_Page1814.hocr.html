               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">BE‘RGERON.</span> I am not aware that 
               <br />
               heirs and inheritors of privileges are obliged 
               <br />
               to carry them around in that way in this 
               <br />
               country. England was not giving to the 
               <br />
               French Canadian people any emolument: 
               <br />
               she was granting privileges. Surely the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice is not serious, because 
               <br />
               he must have had these things in his mind 
               <br />
               when he drafted clause 16, No. 1, or else 
               <br />
               there is no sense in that clause.

               that the treaty was given to the country
