               Mr. FITZPATRICK. The conditions now

               are quite exceptional. We give to the Ter-

               principle which is applicable to other por- 
               <br />
               iions of the country. We have given them 
               <br />
               ten .l'epresentatives practically without re-

               in as provinces it will be necessary to ﬁx 
               <br />
               their representation upon the same principle 
               <br />

               existing in Quebec at the then last decennial

               whatever representation they are entitled to

               and the representation will be re-adjusted 
               <br />

               <br />
               sented in this House as territories. The ob— 
               <br />
               Ject to be attained is to give them represen- 
               <br />
               tation in thisparliament as provinces under 
               <br />
               the British North America Act. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suDIJOSe</span> 
               <br />
               you can do that by providing that the re- 
               <br />
               presentation which they have had as terri- 
               <br />

               tation as provinces although in doing so you 
               <br />
               will have constituencies which cross the 
               <br />
               boundary line. That seems rather anomal- 
               <br />
               ous although I am not prepared to say that 
               <br />
               it could not be done. There is one step 
               <br />
               further. So far you have provided for their 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representation</span> as provinces by declaring 
               <br />
               in the statute that their representation as 
               <br />
               territories shall be continued, you go just 
               <br />
               that far in section 4. Now you want to do 
               <br />
               something else, you want to provide for a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">readjustment,</span> and the question about which 
               <br />
               I am still troubled a little is whether or 
               <br />
               not, having ﬁxed their representation when 
               <br />
               they entered the confederation as provinces, 
               <br />
               you can readjust that representation except 
               <br />
               in accordance with section 51 of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act. I know the answer of 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice, he says that he 
               <br />
               is practically (icing it under the Act of 
               <br />
               1871 by postponing the time. You are 
               <br />
               readjusting upon a quinquennial census 
               <br />
               although the British North America Act 
               <br />
               says you shall readjust under a decennial 
               <br />
               census. That is the point raised by my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk), and 
               <br />
               about which I shall have a little difﬁculty, 
               <br />
               although I cannot say I have a strong 
               <br />
               opinion on the subject.

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> to say, they had a ﬁxed number when they 
               <br />
               came in. and after that they were to submit 
               <br />
               to the rule applicable to all the other pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. Conditions are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁferent</span> here. Here 
               <br />
               we have a territory to which we have 
               <br />
               given a ﬁctitious, an arbitrary represen- 
               <br />
               tation. We have said, you shall be en- 
               <br />
               titled to ten, no matter what your 
               <br />
               population is. Now they are coming into 
               <br />
               the confederation, and it is important—and 
               <br />
               in this respect we are departing from any- 
               <br />
               thing done heretofore—it is important to 
               <br />
               ascertain the number 01‘ representatives to 
               <br />
               which they will really be entitled. There 
               <br />
               will be a quinquennial census taken next 
               <br />
               year by which we will ascertain what the 
               <br />
               true population of the two provinces is and 
               <br />
               when we have ascertained it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> true
