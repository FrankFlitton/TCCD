               how we would divide the remaining twenty-

               <br />
               exact population of that country. We all 
               <br />
               believe, I know the hon. members on the 
               <br />

               sentation by population. Unfortunately we

               cannot get the exact population and there 
               <br />
               are no means by which we can get it. I con- 
               <br />
               tend that the nearest thing will be to take 
               <br />
               the vote that was actually polled in the late

               any other evidence of settlement that we 
               <br />
               can ﬁnd. That is what I did and I came to 
               <br />
               certain conclusions. I found south of Red 
               <br />

               Now. there are ﬁve cities in the North- 
               <br />
               west—Regina, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> Moosejaw, Prince Albert, 
               <br />
               Edmonton and Calgary. Some of these 
               <br />
               citiesare slightly larger than others, but 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> is no great difference in their size. 
               <br />
               We believe that each of these cities should 
               <br />
               have a representative of its own. I have said 
               <br />
               there were 10,566 votes south of Red Deer. 
               <br />
               Take away the vote polled in the city of 
               <br />
               Calgary, which, I think, was 2,186. This 
               <br />
               leaves, for the rural part south of Red Deer, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">8,380</span> votes. I have said that north of Red 
               <br />
               Deer there were 9,563 votes. Take out 
               <br />
               the vote polled in Edmonton—1,343, and we 
               <br />
               have. 8,320 votes remaining. That will leave

               I wish to draw attention to the ﬁgures 
               <br />
               prepared by the hon. member for Calgary 
               <br />
               (Mr. M. S. McCarthy). I maintain that there 
               <br />
               is not a very great difference between his 
               <br />
               and ours. At the same time, I think I can 
               <br />
               show where he has made some slight mis- 
               <br />
               takes. According to .the hon. gentleman’s 
               <br />
               calculation there were 10,833 votes cast in 
               <br />
               the south, and 9,394 cast in the north.

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Take</span> from the vote cast in the south 2,180

               <br />
               mainder of 8,653. Take from the votes 
               <br />

               <br />
               ton and you have a remainder of 8,051. So. 
               <br />
               according to the hon. member’s ﬁgures, 
               <br />
               there is an average for the ten rural consti- 
               <br />
               tuencies of the south of 865, and in the 
               <br />
               rural ten constituencies in the north, of 805. 
               <br />
               Therefore there is only a difference of 60 
               <br />
               or, for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> 10 constituencies, GOO—not enough

               because the lines run through the polling
