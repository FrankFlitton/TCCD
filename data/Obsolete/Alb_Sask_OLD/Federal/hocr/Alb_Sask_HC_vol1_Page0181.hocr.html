               Now. what I have tried to do in this 
               <br />
               discussion has been not to waste the time 
               <br />
               of the House going over and over, and over 
               <br />
               again what has been said by other speak- 
               <br />
               ers as well or better than I could say it, 
               <br />
               but to endeavour to make clear what the 
               <br />
               effect of the legislation now proposed to 
               <br />
               the House will be when it is actually car— 
               <br />
               ried into operation. And the conclusion, 
               <br />
               therefore, is this—-that if this legislation is 
               <br />
               carried into effect it preserves just the two 
               <br />
               privileges which I spoke of the privilege 
               <br />
               of the Roman Catholic or Protestant mino- 
               <br />
               rity to have a separate school house. and the 
               <br />
               privilege of having religious instruction be— 
               <br />
               tween half-past three and four o'clock in 
               <br />
               the afternoon. But there cannot be under 
               <br />
               this system any control of the school by 
               <br />
               any clerical or sectarian body. There can— 
               <br />
               not be any sectarian teaching between nine 
               <br />
               o'clock in the morning and half-past three 
               <br />
               in the afternoon.‘ So that. so far as we have 
               <br />
               objections to separate schools based upon 
               <br />
               the idea of church control. clerical control, 
               <br />
               or ecclesiasticism in any form, this system 
               <br />
               of schools is certainly not open to that ob-
