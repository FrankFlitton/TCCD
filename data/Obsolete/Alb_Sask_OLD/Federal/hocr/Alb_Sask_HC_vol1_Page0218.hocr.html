               <br />
               What we are denied is not our right to pay. 
               <br />
               Oh. no, it is our right to have full freedom. 
               <br />
               Archbishop Taché acted at once on this 
               <br />
               appeal. He abandoned his functions at the 
               <br />
               Ecumenical Council at Rome and came to 
               <br />
               the Red River settlement, and on his way 
               <br />
               stopped at Ottawa to meet Sir John Mac- 
               <br />
               donald. ‘Take any steps. said Sir John to 
               <br />
               him, to arppease the Indians and the half- 
               <br />
               breeds.’ Archbishop Taché however did not 
               <br />
               want to impose any pledges on politicians 
               <br />
               which perhaps they would not be strong 
               <br />
               enough to keep, and all he promised the 
               <br />
               native population was that the division of 
               <br />
               their lands would be respected and that they 
               <br />
               would have the free exercise of their re- 
               <br />
               ligion and the schools they preferred for 
               <br />
               their children. What has become of those 
               <br />
               pledges? The lands were divided against 
               <br />
               the wishes of those people and a second re-

               <br />
               have come to. And now we are called upon 
               <br />
               to bow to this storm of feeling that has been 
               <br />
               aroused and to allow a still greater invasion 
               <br />

               <br />
               It is time to face the storm. The pow-

               serve that we should acknowledge their

               sovereignty. The principle of provincial

               Past pledges are against them. I will go

               further and say that a religious principle
