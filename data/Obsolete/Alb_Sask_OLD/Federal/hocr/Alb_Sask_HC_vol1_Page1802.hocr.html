               Mr. SPROULE. That is a very charitable 
               <br />
               explanation. 
               <br />

               Mr. LEMIEUX. I am not here to justify 
               <br />
               or to answer what my hon. friend attacked. 
               <br />
               I am simply stating a question of fact. My 
               <br />
               hon. friend read an extract. I am reading 
               <br />
               the whole article and translating it to the 
               <br />
               best of my ability. Now, Sir, in what 
               <br />
               position are the Liberal members from 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec ? Here is my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from East Grey who quotes 
               <br />
               an extract from ‘Le Canada.’ He pre- 
               <br />
               tends that ‘Le Oanada’ has compared 
               <br />
               himself and his friends to yellow dogs. 
               <br />
               We are, of course. accused by the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman of fanning the prejudices 
               <br />
               and passions of the people against himself 
               <br />
               and his party in the province of Qucbec. 
               <br />
               On the other hand here is my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) who repeats 
               <br />
               the same accusation. I do not intend to 
               <br />
               answer the long and able speech which he 
               <br />
               made this afternoon and evening on the 
               <br />
               school question, but having been connected 
               <br />
               with the press in the province of Quebec for 
               <br />
               the last ﬁfteen years and having had some— 
               <br />
               thing to do with the Liberal press as a 
               <br />
               member of the Reform-party, I deny in 
               <br />
               toto the accusation made by my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Labelle. We are .not fanning the 
               <br />
               passions and prejudices of the electors in. 
               <br />
               the province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of,</span> Quebec. I say. that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ever»</span> 
               <br />
               since this school issue has been before the 
               <br />
               people of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country;</span> the Liberals of Que- 
               <br />
               bec have stood ﬁrm to their guns and have 
               <br />
               behaved like patriots and good Canadians. 
               <br />
               We have a good illustration of our stand 
               <br />
               at the present time. We have on. the 
               <br />
               one hand my hon. friend from Labelle who 
               <br />
               is supposed to represent the extreme views 
               <br />
               of Quebec, and I use this word in no oiIen- 
               <br />
               sive sense, while on the other hand we have 
               <br />
               my old friend from East Grey who is sup- 
               <br />
               posed to represent the extreme views of 
               <br />
               Ontario, or of a certain body called the 
               <br />
               Orange body. and here they are pulling to- 
               <br />
               gether against the government on this very 
               <br />
               issue.
