               <br />
               Catholics have any control, do we ﬁnd

               the display of passion and prejudice we are

               now witnessing among those who advocate

               I do not believe in quoting newspaper

               against newspaper or Speech against speech, 
               <br />
               but you can take every minister of this

               government and you can quote any speech 
               <br />
               of his one year against another speech

               <br />
               more active than papers supporting the 
               <br />
               government in the province of Quebec—- 
               <br />
               which I presume are Roman Catholic papers 
               <br />
               ———in exciting religious and race antagonism. 
               <br />
               You will ﬁnd them excelling in charging all 
               <br />
               sorts of intolerance against the Protestants 
               <br />
               of Ontario, and you will ﬁnd men like the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Labelle going through that 
               <br />
               province and appealing to the fanaticism 
               <br />
               and prejudices of that magniﬁcent people. 
               <br />
               I have every faith in that people, but we 
               <br />
               must admit that they are not as well posted 
               <br />
               in public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attairs</span> as they should be. I 
               <br />
               regret that we have no Chapleau in the 
               <br />

               right and counteract the schemes of hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite. I remember when the 
               <br />
               late Sir Joseph Chapleau stood in the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec and faced the demagogues 
               <br />
               of rthe Liberal party, led by the late Mr. 
               <br />
               Mercier, who sought to inﬂame the public

               <br />

               <br />
               I regret that to—day there is not one
