               the government of the day are responsible 
               <br />
               because all the members of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span> 
               <br />
               are responsible for the acts of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">individ9</span>

               the government is responsible for the con-, 
               <br />
               duct of the government in this matter. We ‘ 
               <br />
               referred to Russian rule the other day. They ‘ 
               <br />
               have the procurator general of the Holy 
               <br />
               Synod in Russia, and it looks now to me as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               if the Papal ablegate in this country <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">occu-T</span>

               pies the same position as a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">member</span> of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> 
               <br />
               government. Any way the evidence of that 
               <br />
               is not denied ; it has not been denied to—day. 
               <br />
               The Papal ablegate has had an oppourtunity 1 
               <br />
               day after day of denying it. For some rea- <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3</span>

               <br />
               less he does deny it, it will be taken as true 
               <br />
               that he did have that conversation with 
               <br />
               Mr. Rogers, that he did press the acceptance 
               <br />
               of these two amendments upon them, that 
               <br />
               he did tell them that if they did <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accept,</span>

               there has been some recognition of religion

               There is no accounting for that, but the

               fact remains that legislation was actually
