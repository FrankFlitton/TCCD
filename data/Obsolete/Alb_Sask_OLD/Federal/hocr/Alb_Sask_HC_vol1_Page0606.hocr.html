               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. Then I must say at 
               <br />
               once that I very much misunderstood the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman. He was pointing his ﬁnger 
               <br />
               at me in a somewhat dramatic way, and on 
               <br />
               several occasions at least he alluded to me 
               <br />
               because he mentioned the leader of the oppo- 
               <br />
               sition. I do not think that gentlemen 
               <br />
               throughout this country, and many of them 
               <br />
               Liberals who have protested against cer- 
               <br />
               tain features of the Bill now under dis- 
               <br />
               cussion—I will not discuss it at all, the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman spent about twenty minutes or 
               <br />
               half an hour in discussing the Bill, which 
               <br />
               he had no right to do—I do not think these 
               <br />
               gentlemen can be accused of exciting re- 
               <br />
               ligious prejudice or race discord. Nor do 
               <br />
               I think that they should be characterized, 
               <br />
               as the member for Ottawa (Mr. Belcourt) 
               <br />
               has characterized them, as renegade Lib- 
               <br />
               erals.
