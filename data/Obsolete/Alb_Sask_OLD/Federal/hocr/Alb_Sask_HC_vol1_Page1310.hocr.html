               this is a contract involving about $110,000 
               <br />
               namely, 200 miles at $550 per mile. I do 
               <br />
               not know anything about the usual price. 
               <br />
               Some gentlemen have named as the usual 
               <br />
               price a sum less than one half that given

               anything about it from personal knowledge; 
               <br />
               but what I do wish to call attention to is 
               <br />
               this, that except for the incident that the

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">err-Minister</span> of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) re-

               signed in the month of February last, that 
               <br />
               contract would have gone through. My 
               <br />
               right hon. friend shakes his head. With 
               <br />
               what warrant does he signify his dissent? 
               <br />
               The matter had gone this far, that a con- 
               <br />
               tract had been asked for from one single 
               <br />
               ﬁrm and public tenders had not been ad- 
               <br />
               vertised for at all as the statute required. 
               <br />
               A contract had been called for from one 
               <br />
               ﬁrm for the construction of 200 miles of 
               <br />
               fencing at what seems to be regarded as 
               <br />
               a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">very</span> high price; and the only reason it 
               <br />
               was not put through and the country did 
               <br />
               not become liable. to pay that sum, was 
               <br />
               the incident to which I have referred. 
               <br />
               Does the right hon. gentleman dissent from 
               <br />
               that? Is it not stated in the letter he has

               read that the matter had gone so far that 
               <br />

               It seems remarkable that for a period 
               <br />
               of about two months the Page Wire

               pression upon information furnished by the 
               <br />
               Department of the Interior—not only direct- 
               <br />
               ly but through Mr. Speaker—that this con- 
               <br />
               tract had actually been let ? When the De— 
               <br />
               partment of Public Works <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">receﬁed</span> the

               opinion from the Department of Justice, they 
               <br />
               had already embarked on the policy of cons- 
               <br />
               tructing this Wire fence. Why did they not' 
               <br />
               at once advertise for tenders, if they intend- 
               <br />
               ed to carry out and comply with the law ? 
               <br />
               The matter was pressing in the month of 
               <br />
               January last, so pressing that one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">_ﬁrm—a</span>

               to make an offer. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*</span> There was haste then. 
               <br />
               They were getting ready for the approach— 
               <br />
               ing season ; and in the month of March, or 
               <br />
               a little later on, the Department of the in- 
               <br />
               terior ascertained from the Department of 
               <br />
               Justice that it was necessary to have this 
               <br />
               work carried out by the Department of 
               <br />
               Public Works and that tenders and adver- 
               <br />
               tisement were required under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«the</span> law. Why 
               <br />
               was not this company which was making 
               <br />
               inquiry, not only directly, but through his 
               <br />
               honour the Speaker, informed of the de- 
               <br />
               cision of the Department of Justice and 
               <br />
               told that advertisements calling for tend- 
               <br />
               ers would appear in the public press very 
               <br />
               shortly? That is a very pertinent ques— 
               <br />
               tion. I do not know whether my right 
               <br />
               hon. friend will answer it by shaking his 
               <br />
               head. That is a very convenient way of 
               <br />
               disposing of these matters. .I did not 
               <br />
               catch the date of the letter of the Depart- 
               <br />
               ment of Justice.
