               Company more fully prove. During this

               dealing with this matter at some length now

               sons in her settlement on the Red river have 
               <br />
               handed themselves together to oppose by force 
               <br />
               the entry into her Northwest Territories of the 
               <br />
               ofﬁcers selected to administer in her name the 
               <br />
               government when the Territories are united to 
               <br />
               the Dominion of Canada under the authority of 
               <br />
               the late Act of parliament of the United King—

               <br />
               with violence prevented other of her loyal sub-

               The Queen is convinced that in sanctioning
