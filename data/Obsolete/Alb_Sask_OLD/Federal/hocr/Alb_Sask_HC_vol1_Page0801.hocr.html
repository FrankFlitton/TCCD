               would be by having recourse to section 93

               of the British North America Act. But sure—

               that constitutionally the minority in the

               That is the ground upon which, as I have 
               <br />
               stated, the appeal of the Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               citizens of New Brunswick failed in the 
               <br />
               New Brunswick school case. The Supreme 
               <br />
               Court held that the system was not a de- 
               <br />
               nominational school system. If we are 
               <br />
               to accept the statements which have been 
               <br />
               made in this House by those hon. gentle— 
               <br />
               men, to whom I have already alluded, that 
               <br />
               these schools in the Northwest are not de- 
               <br />
               nominational schools then they would not 
               <br />
               have been entitled under the terms of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>

               original Act to any protection. Why then 
               <br />
               should we give to these schools in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories &amp; protection and a 
               <br />
               guarantee which the original British North 
               <br />
               America Act withheld from the original 
               <br />
               provinces forming the confederation? It
