               certainty, it divides the area into two equal 
               <br />
               parts, and it gives to each almost the same

               <br />
               map I have here, which shows how investi- 
               <br />
               gation has demonstrated the limit of the

               <br />
               growing country. It will be found that the 
               <br />
               ranching country was originally supposed 
               <br />
               to extend far down into Assiniboia, almost 
               <br />
               to the southeast or southwest corner of 
               <br />
               Manitoba. Recently, however, it has been 
               <br />
               discovered that it is practically limited to 
               <br />
               Swift Current, in Assiniboia, so that I think 
               <br />
               on :the whole we have settled these two 
               <br />
               points : ﬁrst, we divide the country into two 
               <br />
               equal .parts contiguous; we give each pro- 
               <br />
               vince practically the same area, and we give 
               <br />
               a certain line as the boundary line between 
               <br />
               the two, a line which is accepted for all 
               <br />
               purposes with respect to the division of dis- 
               <br />
               'tricts and municipalities, and so forth. In 
               <br />
               so far as regards the difﬁculty pointed out 
               <br />
               by my hon. friend from Alberta (Mr. Her- 
               <br />
               ron) before the adjournment with respect 
               <br />
               to the confusion that is likely to arise in the 
               <br />
               branding of cattle, my information—which, 
               <br />
               of course, I give subject to his better in— 
               <br />
               formation—is that there are about 15,000 
               <br />
               of these brands registered in the whole of 
               <br />
               the Territories, and that about 50 per cent 
               <br />
               are registered applicable to that district 
               <br />
               which will be in the province of Saskatche- 
               <br />
               wan. Although the number of cattle held 
               <br />
               by each individual owner is somewhat small- 
               <br />
               er in Saskatchewan than in Alberta, the 
               <br />
               difﬁculty arising from the branding will not 
               <br />
               be remedied to any large extent by placing 
               <br />
               the boundary line where he suggests. Solu- 
               <br />
               tions of diﬁiculties are always likely to 
               <br />
               create embarrassment in one direction or 
               <br />
               another, and on the whole the best division 
               <br />
               possible is that which gives the practical

               <br />
               pears that Athabaska, which we are includ- 
               <br />
               ing'in these two provinces, is a very large 
               <br />
               territory, which at present, has only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">242</span> 
               <br />
               white people in it. It does strike me that 
               <br />
               it requires some very peculiar conditions to 
               <br />

               about one-half of the whole area or the two

               the territory has only 242 white people 
               <br />
               in it. If we throw aside all political 
               <br />
               considerations and look at it solely from 
               <br />
               the commercial point of view, it seems 
               <br />
               to me a most extraordinary thing that 
               <br />
               any man should centemplate putting 
               <br />
               Athabaska into these provinces at all. What 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> the object of it ? It must be absolutely 
               <br />
               clear that Athabaska is about as far at the 
               <br />
               present day from the provincial status as 
               <br />
               these other districts were in 1875 when they

               were given only territorial administra-

               tion. I should not like to try to divide 
               <br />
               up the population of Athabaska and see how 
               <br />
               many it makes to the mile; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I—</span> am afraid

               unsettled district to all intents and
