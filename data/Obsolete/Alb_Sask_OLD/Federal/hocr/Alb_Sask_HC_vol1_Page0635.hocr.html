               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon.</span> member for North Toronto. He was 
               <br />
               here in 1896, after the election, and after 
               <br />
               the government of which 'he had been a

               onto sitting at his side, declared that he 
               <br />
               was still prepared to pass a remedial Bill, 
               <br />

               The Hoñ. George Eulas Foster sat at his 
               <br />
               side and endorsed that declaration, so that 
               <br />
               he had not then experienced a change of 
               <br />
               heart, and, so far as that parliament was 
               <br />
               concerned, I suppose he was bound by those 
               <br />
               speeches. Now, what does the hon. gen— 
               <br />
               tleman say in 1905? Here are his words:

               tier t-han the constitution. We invoked the 
               <br />
               constitution in 1896. We tried to give it its 
               <br />
               full force in a clear case and we were pre- 
               <br />
               vented by the leader of a. great party. After 
               <br />
               we were prevented, that leader and his party 
               <br />
               went to the people in 1896. 1900 and 1904, and 
               <br />
               the people declared that they did not want 
               <br />
               remedial legislation. In the interests of the 
               <br />
               41 per cent which has been talked about in this

               bc which was specially interested, we on this 
               <br />
               side tried to get for the minority their rights

               in the only way we possibly could under the 
               <br />
               constitution. We were prevented from doing 
               <br />
               it by the Liberal party, and during three suc- 
               <br />
               cessive elections the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ditberal</span> party have en— 
               <br />
               dorsed the policy; we want no hands laid on

               do not prevail to-day we have the pleasure 
               <br />
               of knowing that those who most loudly 
               <br />
               denounced him are now enunciating the 
               <br />
               same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">views</span> as he enunciated. I make no 
               <br />
               apology for speaking <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thus»</span> in regard to the 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Toronto. I believe 
               <br />
               I am justiﬁed in doing so, and I say fur— 
               <br />
               ther that so far as this speech discloses 
               <br />
               hypocrisy and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.apos’oasy,</span> it can do no 
               <br />
               harm. I had: expected to see the hon. mem— 
               <br />
               ber for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) at the 
               <br />
               conclusion of the speech of the rhon. mem- 
               <br />
               ‘ber for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) 
               <br />
               rise and congratulate him and accept 
               <br />
               him as an acquisition. He did not do it, 
               <br />
               although he was kind enough to do that 
               <br />
               when I pronounced myself. I did see, or 
               <br />
               I imagined I saw, rather a smile of satis- 
               <br />
               faction ﬂit across the face of that hon. gen- 
               <br />
               He went through it 
               <br />
               in 1896, he was jeered at, he was sneered 
               <br />
               at, he was almost read out of his party be- 
               <br />
               cause he dared to enunciate these same 
               <br />
               views, and he was silently able to look at 
               <br />
               the member for North Toronto (Mr. Foster). 
               <br />
               squirming in his endeavor to rid himself
