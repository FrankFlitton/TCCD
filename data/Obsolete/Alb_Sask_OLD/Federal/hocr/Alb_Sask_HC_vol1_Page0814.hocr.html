               <br />
               ness, that the uniﬁcation of races is a de- 
               <br />
               lusion. All attempts to make us renounce 
               <br />
               our national characteristics are bound to 
               <br />
               fail, whether at his hands or at the hands 
               <br />
               of others, and whatever be the means taken 
               <br />

               <br />
               of our separate schools. Every effort Has 
               <br />
               been made, and what has been the result ? 
               <br />
               Although separated from our old mother 
               <br />
               country by the breadth of the Atlantic ocean, 
               <br />
               although deprived by the fate of war of our 
               <br />
               old ﬂag, although more than a century has 
               <br />
               rolled by, we in spite of a most painful and 
               <br />
               prolonged abandonment, have remained 
               <br />
               Frenchmen, have remained Catholics; and 
               <br />
               that persistence of that patriotic attachment 
               <br />
               to, French sentiments and ideas, is certainly 
               <br />
               one of the most striking facts in the history 
               <br />
               of'all nations. Henry IV used to say that 
               <br />
               natives of Gascony would thrive every- 
               <br />
               where ; but what would he not have said of 
               <br />
               the French Canadians, had he known them. 
               <br />
               The 60,000 settlers, given up by France to 
               <br />
               England in 1763, now number 1,322,115 in

               <br />
               1,649,371. And we are nearly 2,000,000 in 
               <br />
               the United States, who are working our way 
               <br />
               over there in all directions. We have ﬁve 
               <br />
               representatives in the Ontario legislature, 
               <br />
               and one cabinet minister. Our political in- 
               <br />
               ﬂuence in that province is such, to-day that, 
               <br />
               according to a member of the press gallery, 
               <br />
               with whom I had a talk, the other day, if 
               <br />
               no change occurs in the meantime, we will, 
               <br />
               twenty-ﬁve years hence, be holding the 
               <br />
               balance of power in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thatlprovince.</span> Is that 
               <br />
               the result of the denominational teaching 
               <br />
               in our separate schools ? I could not say. 
               <br />
               But what I do know it is that if We have 
               <br />
               our faults as all other people have theirs, 
               <br />
               we have, thank God, a deep respect for 
               <br />
               divine and human laws. We are in favour 
               <br />
               of harmony. Our wish is to live peaceably 
               <br />
               with other races ; we respect them ; we are 
               <br />
               loyal subjects of ﬁll Majesty, but as for 
               <br />
               uniﬁcation, never. Listen to these words of 
               <br />
               Sir George Etienne Cartier which I ﬁnd in

               Objection had been taken to the scheme now 
               <br />
               under consideration, because of the words 
               <br />
               ‘New Nationality.’ Now, when we were 
               <br />
               united together, it“ union were attained, we 
               <br />
               would form a political nationality with which 
               <br />
               neither the national origin, nor the religion of 
               <br />
               any individual would interfere. It was la- 
               <br />
               mented by some that we had this diversity ot 
               <br />
               races, and hopes were expressed that this dis- 
               <br />
               tinctive future would cease. The idea of unity 
               <br />
               of races is Utopian—it is impossible. Distinc- 
               <br />
               tions of this kind will always exist. Dissmi-

               <br />
               physical world and of the moral world, as well 
               <br />
               as of the political world. But with regard to 
               <br />
               the objection based on this fact, to the effect 
               <br />
               that a great nation could not be formed be- 
               <br />
               cause Lower Canada was in great part French 
               <br />
               and Catholic, and Upper Canada was British 
               <br />
               and Protestant and the lower provinces were 
               <br />
               mixed, it was futile and worthless in the ex- 
               <br />
               treme. Look, for instance, at the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom, inhabited as it was by three great 
               <br />
               races. (Hear, hear.) Had the diversity of 
               <br />
               races impeded the glory, the progress, the 
               <br />
               wealth of England ? Had they not rather each 
               <br />
               contributed their share to the greatness of the 
               <br />
               empire? Of the glories of the Senate the 
               <br />
               ﬁeld and the ocean, of the successes of trade 
               <br />
               and commerce. how much was contributed by 
               <br />
               the combined talents, energy and courage of 
               <br />
               the three races together? (Cheers.) In our 
               <br />
               federation we should have Catholics and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Protestants,</span> English, French, Irish and Scotch. 
               <br />
               and each by his efforts and his success would 
               <br />
               increase the prosperity and glory of the new 
               <br />
               confederacy. (Hear, hear.) He viewed the di- 
               <br />
               versity of races in British North America in 
               <br />
               this way: We were of different races, not for the 
               <br />
               purpose of warring against each other, but in 
               <br />
               order to compete and emulate for the general 
               <br />
               welfare. (Cheers) We could not do away 
               <br />
               with the distinctions of race. We could not 
               <br />
               legislate for the disappearance of the French 
               <br />
               Canadians from American soil, but British and 
               <br />
               French Canadians alike could appreciate and 
               <br />
               understand their position relative to each other 
               <br />
               They were placed like great families beside 
               <br />
               each other, and their contact produced a heal- 
               <br />
               thy spirit of emulation. It was a beneﬁt rather 
               <br />
               than otherwise that we had a diversity of races. 
               <br />
               Of course, the difﬁculty, it would he said, would 
               <br />
               be to deal fairly by the minority. In Upper 
               <br />
               Canada, the Catholics would ﬁnd themselves 
               <br />
               in a minority. In Lower Canada, the Protest- 
               <br />
               ants would be in a minority, while the lower 
               <br />
               provinces were divided. Under such circum- 
               <br />
               stances, would any one pretend that either 
               <br />
               the local or the general governments would 
               <br />
               sanction any injustice ?
