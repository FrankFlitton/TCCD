               those two provinces there are only half a 
               <br />
               million people, surely not more than enough 
               <br />
               for one province. It has been said before, 
               <br />
               and I will say it again, that we are very 
               <br />
               much over-governed in the Dominion of 
               <br />

               every legislature than are required. We 
               <br />
               have too much legislative machinery. So I 
               <br />
               say that if there were only one province in- 
               <br />

               machinery would be required. Perhaps there 
               <br />
               would need to be a greater number of re— 
               <br />
               presentatives. but only one parliamentary 
               <br />

               <br />

               Now with reference to the land in those

               would be to the interest of the Dominion of

               lands. Manitoba has not, because circum- 
               <br />
               stances were very different when she was 
               <br />
               created a province, there were only about 
               <br />

               <br />
               Manitoba, and they were not in a position 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               comprising among them able meu such as 
               <br />
               have composed their legislative assemblies. I 
               <br />
               freely admit that the Dominion has dealt 
               <br />
               liberally with them, we have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">given</span> on the 
               <br />
               whole to each province, $1,124,125. That is 
               <br />
               a large sum indeed, larger than the revenue 
               <br />
               which the Dominion will get out of the land. 
               <br />
               At the same time it is not sufﬁciently large

               <br />
               money out of the land, and the payments 
               <br />
               we are making to those provinces will be a 
               <br />
               burden on this Dominion which will be felt 
               <br />
               for many years to come. I contend that 
               <br />
               it would be better for the province to keep 
               <br />
               the land because it would be administered 
               <br />
               much better and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">much</span> more economically 
               <br />
               than it is at the present time. Take the 
               <br />
               land ofﬁces in the Northwest Territories, I 
               <br />
               submit that many of them are perfect cess- 
               <br />
               pools of corruption, and I speak whereof I 
               <br />
               know, as I have had some dealings through 
               <br />
               agents and otherwise with these land oﬂices, 
               <br />
               and my conclusion is that they are not con— 
               <br />
               ducted in a proper manner. For instance, 
               <br />
               they are surrounded by heelers, by those 
               <br />
               who have claims upon the government, and 
               <br />
               the result is that when an actual settler 
               <br />
               goes there, when he has picked out his land 
               <br />
               and desires to place his name upon it. in- 
               <br />
               variably he is told that it will require some 
               <br />
               consideration. Now if the business was pro- 
               <br />
               perly conducted. they would be able to say 
               <br />
               at once to that man: You can have it, or: 
               <br />
               lt is sold. But that is not the course pur- 
               <br />
               sued. He is annoyed, and, in many cases, 
               <br />
               he has to settle with the claims of some other 
               <br />
               parties. The result is hardships to the actual 
               <br />
               settler, to the immigrant coming in to make 
               <br />
               his home there. Many of them do not 
               <br />
               get the land after they have gone to much 
               <br />
               trouble in picking it out. Whilst that is 
               <br />
               the case with the actual settler, it is much 
               <br />
               worse with the prospector, of whom ,there 
               <br />
               are many. they are the most important class 
               <br />
               of the community. I speak from knowledge 
               <br />
               on this subject. Prospectors are numerous 
               <br />
               there. they travel all over the country, hun— 
               <br />
               dreds of thousands of miles exploring the 
               <br />
               land, digging down into the bowels of the 
               <br />
               earth to see. if they can ﬁnd anything that 
               <br />
               is worth taking up. When they make ap- 
               <br />
               plication to the land ofﬁce, in almost every 
               <br />
               case. I venture to say in ninety-nine cases 
               <br />
               out of a hundred. they are told that it is 
               <br />
               impossible to decide whether that land is 
               <br />
               taken up or otherwise, and they will have 
               <br />
               to wait a few days.
