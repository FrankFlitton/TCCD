               <br />
               Bill purely from the standpoint of the legal 
               <br />
               and constitutional questions involved, and 
               <br />
               I regret that on this occasion we are call- 
               <br />
               ed upon to deal with acrimonious questions 
               <br />
               that were discussed in former days and 
               <br />
               which we had hoped were set at rest when 
               <br />
               confederation was formed. I believe it 
               <br />
               was the intention of the founders of con- 
               <br />
               federation to arrive at a ﬁnal decision as 
               <br />
               to what should be the underlying principles, 
               <br />
               the substrata of the confederation of Can- 
               <br />
               ada, and it seems to me that the idea of 
               <br />
               the public men of that day was that the 
               <br />
               questions which we are now discussing 
               <br />
               were then ﬁnally settled. In my view the 
               <br />
               powers which the then provinces were to 
               <br />
               have, and that all new provinces were to 
               <br />
               be accorded were laid down in deﬁned and 
               <br />
               well understood axioms of our constitution. 
               <br />
               I believe that the educational question 
               <br />
               which is a very important one was sought 
               <br />
               to be set at rest by the Confederation Act 
               <br />
               of 1867, as amended by subsequent Acts. 
               <br />
               In looking at this Bill from a general stand- 
               <br />
               point the two most important features of 
               <br />
               it refer to the control of the lands and ques- 
               <br />
               tion of education. It is my opinion that 
               <br />
               the public domain of the new provinces 
               <br />
               should be controlled by those who are to 
               <br />
               administer the affairs of that country, and 
               <br />
               I found this opinion largely upon the state- 
               <br />
               ments of Hon. Alexander Mackenzie and 
               <br />
               the Hon. Edward Blake, which were made 
               <br />
               during the discussion in this parliament 
               <br />
               when the Northwest Territories were being 
               <br />
               admitted into the union as Territories, and 
               <br />
               when the question also arose as to the then 
               <br />
               proposed admission of Newfoundland. It 
               <br />
               was proposed that Newfoundland should be 
               <br />
               given $150,000 a year in lieu of its lands. 
               <br />
               and the Hon. Edward Blake is on record as 
               <br />
               having said : 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               He was very strongly opposed to the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion acquiring the Crown lands of Newfound- 
               <br />

               <br />
               He commended the policy of the framers of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               objectionable: (1) its distance from the seat 
               <br />
               of government, (2) and its small representation 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parliament</span> would lead to an unsatisfactory

               I think that is a very fair statement 
               <br />
               ol‘ the principle that should guide parliament 
               <br />
               to-day; and I cite the case of my own 
               <br />
               province of Ontario, in which we exer- 
               <br />
               cise actual ownership over the public do- 
               <br />
               main—the land, the timber and the minerals 
               <br />
               —as do the other provinces. There may 
               <br />
               be minor reasons why it might be Wise to 
               <br />
               keep the lands under the management of 
               <br />

               <br />
               simply for to-day; we are legislating for 
               <br />
               all time, and I think all the larger points 
               <br />
               of advantage are in favour of allowing the 
               <br />
               public domain to remain in the hands of 
               <br />
               the provinces and not in the hands of the 
               <br />
               Dominion. I think that the policy we should 
               <br />
               pursue in Canada in regard to the adminis- 
               <br />
               tration of the public domain should be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the'</span> 
               <br />
               British policy ; and the British North Am- 
               <br />
               erica Act lays down in its very ﬁrst recital 
               <br />
               that it is intended to establish ‘a Domin- 
               <br />
               ion under the Crown of the United King- 
               <br />
               dom of Great Britain and Ireland, with a 
               <br />
               constitution similar in principlle to that 
               <br />
               of the United Kingdom.’ Now, we ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               it has been the custom of the imperial autho- 
               <br />
               rities,Imay safely say at all times, to allow 
               <br />
               the colonies, be they great or small, after 
               <br />
               they have ceased to be Crown colonies, and 
               <br />
               have become entitled to representative gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, to retain in their hands the ad- 
               <br />
               ministration of their own affairs with regard 
               <br />
               to the publicdomain. We are to-day giv- 
               <br />
               ing these provinces an indemnity in lieu 
               <br />
               of their lands; and I venture to say that 
               <br />
               that is only a matter of guess work. We 
               <br />
               are giving them what is now considered a 
               <br />
               fair compensation for depriving them of 
               <br />

               work out as a hardship on this parliament,

               case may be. Further, pursuing what I 
               <br />
               understand to be the policy of the Liberal 
               <br />
               party, the policy of decentralization, which 
               <br />
               has always commended itself to my mind, 
               <br />
               I think it is best to let the local authorities 
               <br />
               have such power as they are entitled to. 
               <br />
               and as it is reasonably possible to let them 
               <br />
               have, so as to prevent congestion at one 
               <br />
               particular point of interest which may be 
               <br />
               diverse in character.
