               find the British North America Act was 
               <br />
               amended in England; we ﬁnd that it did 
               <br />
               not strictly adhere to the lines of the reso— 
               <br />
               lution. It was amended by somebody. Who 
               <br />
               amended it? That is the question. I lis- 
               <br />
               tenedcarefuily to the First Minister speak- 
               <br />
               ing on that subject, and he went on to say 
               <br />
               that Sir <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Alex.</span> Gait was anxious about 
               <br />
               the rights of the Protestants in the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec that he desired to have an 
               <br />
               amendment in order to secure their rights. 
               <br />
               But that was not the only amendment. The 
               <br />
               other amendment went further, and who 
               <br />
               was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responsible</span> for introducing he did 
               <br />
               not know. But we know one thing, we 
               <br />
               know that there is always an eye that 
               <br />
               never sleeps, a vigilance that knows no re- 
               <br />
               cess, that the one party and the one church 
               <br />
               always seems to be provided for in every 
               <br />
               law that passes, that somehow or other it 
               <br />
               gets its work in, and I am afraid that that 
               <br />
               is the explanation of this amendment. That 
               <br />
               is the reason why to-day we have that de- 
               <br />
               parture from the original resolutions. It 
               <br />
               was never contemplated, except as regards 
               <br />
               Ontario and Quebec, that there was to be 
               <br />
               any control or interference with the exclu- 
               <br />
               sive rights of the provinces regarding edu- 
               <br />
               cation; and in accordance with that under- 
               <br />
               standing all these provinces have enjoyed 
               <br />
               that right ever since. From time to time 
               <br />
               that right has been sought to be interfered 
               <br />
               with. One time the attempt was made in 
               <br />
               the province of New Brunswick, another 
               <br />
               time in the province of Manitoba, but this 
               <br />
               federal parliament has put itself upon re- 
               <br />
               cord as declining to interfere with that 
               <br />
               right. We have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> the contention put 
               <br />
               forward, as it was expressed to me by an 
               <br />
               hon. membtr of this House in 1896. 
               <br />
               We understand confederation to mean this, 
               <br />
               that in every province the Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               minority shall have the same rights in 
               <br />
               every province in the Dominion with 
               <br />
               regard to education as they enjoy in On— 
               <br />
               tario, and we shall never cease to ﬁght until 
               <br />
               that is accomplished, whether it be gained 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">early</span> or late. Our experience rather justiﬁes 
               <br />
               our belief that the desire and intention and 
               <br />
               the aim of that church is never to cease 
               <br />
               that ﬁght until it secures that right in 
               <br />
               every province of the confederation. It will 
               <br />
               have succeeded in bringing a large propor- 
               <br />
               tion of the Dominion under that right, if it 
               <br />
               succeeds in putting this clause through. 
               <br />
               In the Yukon it has had that right intro-
