               imported into the discussion upon the ﬁrst

               what is the question before the House?

               It is not a question of separate schools; it

               is not a question of race or religion, and

               <br />
               by virtue of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constitutional]</span> rights has had 
               <br />
               introduced to it by the First Minister a Bill

               say are not justiﬁed by the constitution, 
               <br />
               clauses we say that should be eliminated,

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now, Sir, let me refer to the policy of the 
               <br />
               First Minister upon this question. In 1896 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman declared, or pro- 
               <br />
               fessed to declare, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> he stood upon the 
               <br />
               rock of provincial rights; to—day he and 
               <br />
               his party stand upon the slippery platform 
               <br />
               of coercion. The policy of the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman to-day is directly opposed to the 
               <br />
               policy he pursued in 1896. And how shall 
               <br />
               I characterize his policy now ? Well, I 
               <br />
               might say that it could be aptly characteriz- 
               <br />
               ed as a sort of kangaroo policy—ﬁrst a hop 
               <br />
               in one direction and then a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"hop</span> in the oppo— 
               <br />
               site direction, and no mortail man can tell 
               <br />
               what will be the direction of the next hop. 
               <br />
               Time will not permit me to dilate further 
               <br />
               upon that interesting topic. I regret that 
               <br />
               my hon. friend the Minister of Finance is 
               <br />
               not in his place to—night. When this Bill 
               <br />
               was introduced the Minister of Finance was 
               <br />
               not in Ottawa; he came here shortly after- 
               <br />
               wards, and the rumour was that there was 
               <br />
               8. sort of civil insurrection in the ranks of 
               <br />
               the government.

               having resigned, it would dissolve his gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, and then, under the constitutional 
               <br />
               usages of our country, the Governor General 
               <br />
               would call upon my hon. friend the leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition to form a government, 
               <br />
