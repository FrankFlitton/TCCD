               the opposition were apparently coming

               down one seat a day. I submit that no 
               <br />
               such interpretation can be placed upon our 
               <br />
               action. At the outset we proved beyond 
               <br />
               contradiction—by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">simply.</span> calling attention 
               <br />
               to the map of the local seats as distributed by 
               <br />
               the Northwest legislature in 1902—that there 
               <br />
               were nine seats given to the sOuthern por— 
               <br />
               tion and six seats given to the northern 
               <br />
               portion. We showed by simply-pointing to 
               <br />
               the map that that distribution by the local 
               <br />
               legislature was a fair one, and we stated 
               <br />
               that it had been decreed by a non-partisan 
               <br />
               government after all localities in the coun- 
               <br />
               try had been represented and had had an 
               <br />
               opportunity of stating their views. We 
               <br />
               showed that in that distribution there were 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> that time three local seats, or only a 
               <br />
               part of three seats, north of the northern 
               <br />
               limit of railway construction, and we show 
               <br />
               that under this proposed distribution to- 
               <br />
               day there are now eight seats north of the 
               <br />
               northern limit of railway construction. 
               <br />
               \Ve showed that in the southern country, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under</span> the distribution of 1002, there were 
               <br />
               eight seats south of the main line of the 
               <br />
               Canadian Pacific Railway, and we show 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> these eight have only been in- 
               <br />
               creased to nine. We have therefore proven 
               <br />
               very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[clearly</span> indeed that if the local dis— 
               <br />
               tribution of 1902 was fair. this proposed 
               <br />
               distribution is manifestly unfair. The sug- 
               <br />
               gestion has been made on the other side 
               <br />
               that the local distribution was unfair, and 
               <br />
               in answer we have pointed out that no 
               <br />
               complaint has ever been made in the local 
               <br />
               assembly against it; and if there had been 
               <br />
               complaint, there is no doubt that gentle- 
               <br />
               men opposite would have been informed of 
               <br />
               it. In order to justify the division which 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> government now proposes, they must 
               <br />
               proceed upon the assumption that all the

               development has been in the northern part 
               <br />
               or the country, and that the southern part 
               <br />

               not see how any person can oppose it. We

               own distribution of 1903. Let me say that

               when that redistribution was made in this

               prove that there has been a greater inﬂux

               six to Calgary, six to Strathcona, six to Ed- 
               <br />
               monton. Then we say there will be one 
               <br />
               left which you can place in Athabaska, and 
               <br />
               which is giving Athabaska very generous 
               <br />
               treatment. An attempt has been made to 
               <br />
               charge this side of the House with a desire 
               <br />
               to prevent a certain section of that country 
               <br />
               being represented at all. That is not a fact, 
               <br />
               and in order to demonstrate that it is not 
               <br />
               a fact, I may say that -I had an alternative 
               <br />
               schedule prepared, and in that schedule I 
               <br />
               proposed that Athabaska should get one 
               <br />
               representative along with the northern sec— 
               <br />
               tion of Alberta. We do not desire that any 
               <br />
               portion of that country should not have re- 
               <br />
               presentation, but we do desire that no sec- 
               <br />
               tion of the country shall have undue repre— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sent-ation</span> to the detriment of another sec— 
               <br />
               tion. That is our position. We are taking 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">division}</span> made by this government itself, 
               <br />
               and we merely suggest that these four rid— 
               <br />
               ings be divided up into local constituen- 
               <br />
               cies so as to prevent the friction which 
               <br />
               will arise between different localities, such 
               <br />
