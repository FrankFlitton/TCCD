               was dealing with the right lhon. gentleman

               ‘man Catholic , may establish separate 
               <br />
               schools therein.’ That .is the language of 
               <br />
               the Act of 1875. The word ‘ separate ’ has 
               <br />
               no technical meaning, as I have pointed out. 
               <br />

               ate schools. A distinction has been drawn 
               <br />
               in the courts between those. The word 
               <br />
               ‘ separate' simply implies separation, but 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman sees a great deal 
               <br />
               more in cit. And why ? Because the terri- 
               <br />
               torial legislature <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">established</span> a dual system 
               <br />
               of schools—clerical schools and public 
               <br />
               ”schools ; but surely the most cursory glance 
               <br />
               .at this Act of 1875 should inform him that 
               <br />
               it was perfectly competent for the territorial 
               <br />
               legislature to do that, but not necessary that 
               <br />
               it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[should</span> do cit. It was perfectly competent 
               <br />
               for that legislature to establish a dual sys- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tem</span> of schools. He speaks of interpretation, 
               <br />
               but we cannot get any aid from the Ter- 
               <br />
               ritorial legislation, because the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territorial</span> 
               <br />
               legislature had no power to interpret this 
               <br />
               enactment. The ordinances of 1884 and 
               <br />
               1887 were measures which the Territorial 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{government</span> passed, and which were within 
               <br />
               its powers as deﬁned in the Act of 1875. 
               <br />
               They cannot be regarded as interpretation of 
               <br />
               that Act because they might or might not 
               <br />
               go to the full extent of the power 
               <br />
               which it conferred. The situation seems 
               <br />
               to me so absolutely plain that it is almost 
               <br />
               impossible to argue it. They had the DOWel‘ 
               <br />
               to establish clerical schools and public 
               <br />
               school, if they saw ﬁt. It appears they 
               <br />
               did so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'by</span> the ordinance of 1884. and, be- 
               <br />
               cause they did so under the full powers 
               <br />
               given them, it is said they interpreted the 
               <br />
               Act of 1875 in the sense that that Act made 
               <br />
               it necessary for them to do this. According 
               <br />
               t(. that argument, you would say <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> be- 
               <br />
               cause parliament could pass clause 16, No. 
               <br />
               ‘i, having the power to do so; therefore, 
               <br />
               there is a constitutional obligation on this 
               <br />
               parliament to pass that clause. It is mere- 
               <br />
               ly necessary rto state the proposition to 
               <br />
               confute it. Then, come down, in the end. 
               <br />
               to the expression ‘separate school’ which 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman deﬁnes as having 
               <br />
               a certain meaning, for which deﬁnition he 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span> no other warrant than the interpre_ta- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tion—as</span> he calls it—of the Territorial gov- 
               <br />
               ernment in 1884. And merely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> speak of 
               <br />
               that is to indicate in the clearest manner 
               <br />
               that no such so—called interpretation could 
               <br />
               have any etïect. Suppose some one were to 
               <br />
               go to court to-morrow and contend that the 
               <br />
               Act of 1875 made it necessary to establish 
               <br />
               a dual system of schools in the Territories: 
               <br />
               and the judges should examine the Act and 
               <br />
               declare that they found no expression of 
               <br />

               that kind in it; and counsel should ans- 
               <br />
               wer: ‘Ah, but the Territorial legislature, 
               <br />
               under this Act, did establish a dual sys— 
               <br />
               tem.’ Any man who would make that 
               <br />
               argument before a court, it seems to me, 
               <br />
               would not favourably impress the court: 
               <br />
               the argument would be laughed to scorn. 
               <br />
               You must distinguish between the power 
               <br />
               given by the Act of 1875, and the restriction 
               <br />
               imposed by the Act of 1875 with respect to 
               <br />
               the establishment of separate schools. 
               <br />
               There was power, I repeat, to establish a 
               <br />
               dual system of schools, but there was no 
               <br />
               obligation to do so. The right hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) goes back to the 
               <br />
               expression ‘separate schools’ for his sole 
               <br />
               warrant that under the Act of 1875 the 
               <br />
               schools were to be controlﬂed, so far as their 
               <br />
               teaching is concerned, by the particular 
               <br />
               body that established them. I cannot see 
               <br />
               any room for such an argument. Perhaps 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman desires to make 
               <br />
               some observation before I deal with an-

               other point.

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. This Act of 1875 
               <br />
               must have been of a most extraordinary 
               <br />
               character, if we are to take the tWo inter- 
               <br />

               <br />
               gentlemen on the other side of the House 
               <br />
               woo have spoken. According to the Miu- 
               <br />
               ister of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) it meant, 
               <br />
               in the ﬁrst place, that the Territorial legis- 
               <br />
               lature. although it received the power to 
               <br />
               make ordinances with respect to education. 
               <br />
               was to have no control over educatton, but 
               <br />
               that the majority in each district was to 
               <br />
               make the ordinances, the laws, the regu- 
               <br />
               lations with regard to that district. There- 
               <br />
               fore, you might have not merely ﬁve or 
               <br />
               ten, but forty or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁfty</span> different systems Of 
               <br />
               laws in the Territories under the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provi—</span> 
               <br />
               sions of the Act of 1875. It seems to me it 
               <br />
               is not necessary to mass arguments to re- 
               <br />
               fute an interpretation of that kind. And 
               <br />
               then my hon. friend from Labelle (Mr. Bour- 
               <br />
               assa) declared further that the majority 
               <br />
               of the ratepayers who were to estab- 
               <br />
               lish what mighrt be called the majority 
               <br />
               school was a religious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">majority</span> and not a 
               <br />
               majority of the ratepayers. That is, the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman's argument would mean 
               <br />
               that in a district in which there were 
               <br />
               2.000 Protestants, 2,400 Roman Catholics. 
               <br />
