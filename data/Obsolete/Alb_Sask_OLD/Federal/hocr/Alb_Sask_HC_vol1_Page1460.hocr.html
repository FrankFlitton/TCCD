               Mr. FOSTER. I am going to carry it on ;

               I say you have to carry on this in a reason- 
               <br />
               able way. You cannot set your 25,000,000 
               <br />
               acres off and say you will not sell a single 
               <br />
               acre of it, but you can be careful to sell it 
               <br />
               as a reasonable price and if you can sell 
               <br />
               what you do sell, and as little as is neces- 
               <br />
               sary for $5 or $6 per acre, you will have the 
               <br />
               remainder of it to sell later on at an en- 
               <br />
               hanced price. Suppose that you kept it for 
               <br />
               ﬁfteen years. With the tide of progress and 
               <br />
               development going on continuously, and ac- 
               <br />
               celerated as it will be, is it too much to say 
               <br />
               that your land at that time Will be worth 
               <br />
               $$ per acre, intrinsically worth it ? If you 
               <br />
               saved a portion of it, and a considerable 
               <br />
               portion, unsold for twenty years, you would 
               <br />
               have land which would be certainly worth 
               <br />
               $10 an acre, intrinsically worth it.. If you 
               <br />
               had 15,000,000 acres left, you would have at 
               <br />
               the increased price a still larger endowment 
               <br />
               upon which you could draw for all time 
               <br />
               to come. Now, you can pick ﬂaws in that 
               <br />

               <br />
               down on the plan which you have thought 
               <br />
               out and are going to put through, or 
               <br />
               which you have not thought out still 
               <br />
               are going to put through. But it is 
               <br />
               not outside of fair ﬁnancial ability and 
               <br />
               of fair practical arrangement with refer- 
               <br />
               ence to the best interests of that country 
               <br />
               to take some such measures as that, and to 
               <br />
               raise for your present necessities, either on 
               <br />
               the security of your land, which it would 
               <br />
               pay you to do, or on some such arrange— 
               <br />
               ment as I have outlined with the Dominion 
               <br />
               government, what you require, and to keep 
               <br />
               your patrimony intact as a large endow— 
               <br />
               ment for your future needs. That would 
               <br />
               accomplish two things. The Dominion gov- 
               <br />
               ernment would be lending a helping hand 
               <br />
               at the present. It would get back every- 
               <br />
               thing it had advanced. The government of 
               <br />
               each province would be getting what was 
               <br />
               necessary for it during the time of its adoles- 
               <br />
               cence, its infancy, so to speak, and it would 
               <br />
               be saving that patrimony for an enhanced 
               <br />
               endowment for the future, when it could 
               <br />
