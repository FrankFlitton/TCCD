               <br />
               which were sold to this company, conditions

               place so many settlers in each township. It 
               <br />
               is part of the bargain and they put up a

               section, some ﬁfty or sixty million acres. 
               <br />
               was reserved from settlement and it was a 
               <br />
               hardship to the people of that country to 
               <br />
               bring those conditions into existence, and 
               <br />
               it drove thousands of people out of that

               country owing to the fact that settlement 
               <br />
               was so sparse that they could not establish '

               schools and they were so scattered that the 
               <br />
               country was hardly habitable. Settlement 
               <br />

               on that account, owing to the condition

               know that I have changed the opinion of

               the money I ought to at this time. I would 
               <br />

               <br />
               in taking the position I do on this matter. 
               <br />
               The school law is good, in fact the best law 
               <br />
               possible. as some of our friends opposite 
               <br />
               have claimed. Now if that is the case. why 
               <br />
               should we not continue it. especially if by 
               <br />
               so doing we can cut out this agitation that 
               <br />
