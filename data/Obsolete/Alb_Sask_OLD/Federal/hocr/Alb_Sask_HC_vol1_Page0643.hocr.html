               questions of this kind, and thus we

               have introduced by the Act now before the

               British North America Act with a rider such 
               <br />
               as I have just quoted. If it is correct,

               ton) argues that the ordinances have no

               effect and that the law of 1875 is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stillin</span>

               force in the Territories the result will be

               that by this Act and we will be im-

               posing upon the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               separate schools to the most extreme type to 
               <br />
               which they have attained at any time since 
               <br />
               1875. The people of the Northwest Territor- 
               <br />
               ies will have to accept this position at the in- 
               <br />
               stance of the minority whether they like it 
               <br />
               or not. We had yesterday produced in this 
               <br />
               House a statement made by the Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               Rogers in reference to an interview with the 
               <br />
               Papal ablegate. Yesterday we had also 
               <br />
               read in the House the statement which the 
               <br />
               Papal ablegate gave to the press. In that 
               <br />
               statement we are told by the ablegate 
               <br />
               that the reason for the interview with Mr. 
               <br />
               Campbell was that he had a previous ac- 
               <br />
               quaintance with Mr. Campbell. Now, no one 
               <br />
               pretends for an instant that there was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any?</span> 
               <br />
               thing wrong in the Papal ablegate having 
               <br />
               interviews with either of these gentlemen. 
               <br />
               Mr. Rogers or Mr. Campbell, if he sees ﬁt. 
               <br />
               The question of signiﬁcance yesterday was, 
               <br />
               and the question to-day is whether or not the 
               <br />
               representative of the Holy See was inter- 
               <br />
               fering unduly with the aﬁairs of Canada 
               <br />
               and was endeavouring by means of certain 
               <br />
               propositions which he made to those repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives of Manitoba to bring about a 
               <br />
               state of things which he desired. Hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen of the government yesterday sought 
               <br />
               to convey the impression that the Papal 
               <br />
               ablegate had no ulterior design of any kind 
               <br />
               and that it was only a private interview 
               <br />
               which the Papal ablegate had sought be- 
               <br />
               cause he had had a previous acquaintance 
               <br />
               with Mr. Colin Campbell. I propose to read 
               <br />

               Now there are other aspects of the case 
               <br />
               which require attention to-day. We have 
               <br />
               this fact brought very painfully to our 
               <br />
               minds that not only has the First <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Minister</span> 
               <br />
               developed lately a peculiarly tyrannical dis— 
               <br />
               position, a desire for more power and a de— 
               <br />
               sire to manage the affairs of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country</span> 
               <br />
               without seeking the constitutional advice of 
               <br />
               his associates something for which per— 
               <br />
               haps he may not be altogether accountable, 
               <br />
               but he has also developed a peculiar lack 
               <br />
               of memory, an unfortunate lack of memory, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l,&gt;ecause,</span> I can attribute some things he has 
               <br />
               said and done to nothing else. Nobody 
               <br />
               would question that the right hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man was perfectly honest in telling what 
               <br />
               occurred, I would not at all events, for I 
               <br />
               have too much respect for the fact that he 
               <br />

               say anything of that kind, but I do point 
               <br />
               out that there have been some fatal lapses 
               <br />
               of memory lately and many of them are 
               <br />
               brought forcibly to light in connection with 
               <br />
               this matter which is important in itself, in- 
               <br />
               volves as well the vital question of whether 
               <br />
               we shall have a proper system of govern-

               outside inﬂuences, sinister and improper to
