               portion of the province where I consider it 
               <br />
               should come from, that the three Regina 
               <br />
               seats should be altered as regards their area 
               <br />
               and that one of the seats, the south Regina 
               <br />
               seat. or a portion of it, should be given to the 
               <br />
               800 line. I found that the three Regina seats, 
               <br />
               Lumsden or North Regina, Regina city and 
               <br />
               South Regina, on the average had only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1,344</span> 
               <br />
               voters on the voters’ list, and I thought that 
               <br />
               the adoption of my suggestion would be a 
               <br />
               proper way of ﬁnding an additional con—

               <br />
               the 800 line. who, I think, are justly en- 
               <br />
               titled to have a representative of their own. 
               <br />
               They have forwarded to me a copy of a 
               <br />
               resolution. which they have also forwarded 
               <br />
               to the hon. member for West Assiniboia 
               <br />
               and the hon. Minister of the Interior, on the 
               <br />
               subject. During the discussion which took 
               <br />
               place in this committee I submitted a ten- 
               <br />
               tative suggestion of my own showing how 
               <br />
               the constituencies might be divided up in the 
               <br />
               new provinces in such a way as to give a 
               <br />
               fairly even distribution of votes to each con- 
               <br />
               stituency. I did this for the purpose of demon- 
               <br />
               strating that it was possible to make a com— 
               <br />
               paratively even distribution, a distribution 
               <br />
               based on existing conditions,‘that is to say, 
               <br />
               by preserving as far as possible the constitu- 
               <br />
               encies as they exist at the present time and 
               <br />
               giving additional representation where the 
               <br />
               additional population and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">additiona‘</span> 
               <br />
               number of votes on the list appear to demand. 
               <br />
               This distribution which accounted for 
               <br />
               seven seats in the northern portion of the 
               <br />
               district and eighteen seats in the southern 
               <br />
               portion, even then gave an advantage of 
               <br />
               8 per cent to the northern constituencies. 
               <br />
               The suggestion was, of course, purely ten- 
               <br />
               tative; it was drawn up after a pretty 
               <br />
               close examination of the vote that was 
               <br />
               polled and was marked on the map which 
               <br />
               I had in my possession, but without any 
               <br />
               very prolonged consideration of the matter. 
               <br />
               On the whole, I think it met the purpose 
               <br />
               fairly well, and I believe it could have been 
               <br />
               made into a very good distribution indeed 
               <br />
               if the committee had discussed the details 
               <br />
               and had made alterations here and there 
               <br />
               Where the local conditions would appear to 
               <br />
               demand them. 
               <br />

               under seal in the hands of the Clerk ‘of the 
               <br />
               Crown in Chancery. I do not know if that 
               <br />
               is the way in which the government have 
               <br />
               got at the ﬁgures they have submitted; I 
               <br />
               have taken the ﬁgures of the government all 
               <br />
               through, not that I think they are abso- 
               <br />
               lutely reliable, but at all events sufﬁciently 
               <br />
               so to enable one to make a comparison. I 
               <br />
               said that the second constituency into which 
               <br />
               the old constituency of Souris is divided 
               <br />
               would have 1,593 voters on the list and 
               <br />
               l,836 square miles. A part of Cannington 
               <br />
               would also go to a new constituency, which 
               <br />
               would take in the Regina-Arcola branch, 
               <br />
               from Arcola some little distance westward. 
               <br />
               Cannington would have 1,460 voters on the 
               <br />
               list and an area of 1,332 square miles. The 
               <br />
               other Cannington constituency would have 
               <br />
               1,456 voters on the list <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and_2,340</span> square 
               <br />
               miles of area. The old district of Mooso— 
               <br />
               min would have 1,895 voters on the list and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aan</span> area of 1,165 square miles; Whitewood 
               <br />
               would have 1.357 voters on the list and an 
               <br />
               area of 1.335 square miles; Grenfell would
