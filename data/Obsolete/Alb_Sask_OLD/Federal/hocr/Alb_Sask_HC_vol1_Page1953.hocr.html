               Conservatives were elected in the southern

               <br />
               leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) 
               <br />

               has to work on these maps, and I venture to 
               <br />
               say he cannot produce a map in any man- 
               <br />
               ner or shape which will not show a Liberal 
               <br />
               majority in both provinces. What is the 
               <br />
               use of charging gerrymander simply be- 
               <br />
               cause possibly these plans when worked 
               <br />
               out on last fall’s vote show a Liberal ma- 
               <br />
               jority in these provinces, if my hon. friend 
               <br />
               cannot produce any map which will not do 
               <br />
               so ? It is not only the northern part that 
               <br />
               is Liberal, even by last fall’s vote. It is 
               <br />
               true the north gave a Liberal majority of 
               <br />
               7,000, but the south also gaveaLiberal ma- 
               <br />
               jority. and the best possible proof that there 
               <br />
               is no injustice is that in-the ﬁve south ridings 
               <br />
               there was a Liberal majority of fully 1,000, 
               <br />
               but nevertheless our friends opposite have 
               <br />
               three members to our two. If the lines had

               ten seats had to be added to ﬁfteen, and it 
               <br />
               was necessary to very largely recast the

               lines of the old districts as they had existed 
               <br />
               for the purposes of representation in the

               on the other hand. we were only compelled 
               <br />
               to add ﬁve to twenty seats, making it a

               lowing the general plan which was agreed 
               <br />
               upon at the outset, of giving incorporated 
               <br />
               cities a seat, we found it possible, by allow-

               <br />
               two to the south and by putting the two in
