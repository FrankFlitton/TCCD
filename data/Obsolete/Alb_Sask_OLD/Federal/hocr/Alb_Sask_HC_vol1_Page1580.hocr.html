               A great deal of time has been spent 
               <br />
               to-night in discussing the relative rapid- 
               <br />
               ity with which the north and the south 
               <br />
               are ﬁlling. and the homestead entries are 
               <br />

               a better test of population in the various 
               <br />
               distributions. so it is only necessary to take 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               calculation because the present district of 
               <br />
               Alberta is almost entirely covered by the 
               <br />
               Lethbridge, Calgary, Red Deer and Ed— 
               <br />
               monton agencies. A very small portion of 
               <br />
               Battleford is west of the fourth, but on the

               <br />
               to calculate the returns of the Calgary and

               <br />
               3.815, a total of 8.201, of which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">5313.1)er</span> cent

               north. In <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1903—4,</span> as judged by the home— 
               <br />
               stead entries, the south increased much more

               rapidly than the north. The minister spoke 
               <br />
               of the homestead entries being brought 
               <br />
               down to the 31st of March, 1905. We will

               This division, which gives to the present ter- 
               <br />
               ritory of Alberta, ﬁfteen members, was made 
               <br />
               by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">loud</span> Hones in 1902. We have been 
               <br />
               taught to consider the local House of that 
               <br />
               day as a non—partisan body. It was so at 
               <br />
               that time at least. We do not know that 
               <br />
               politics entered into consideration in this 
               <br />
               case; and although we have diligently 
               <br />
               searched, we have been unable to ﬁnd that

               any serious exception was taken to the dis- 
               <br />
               tribution then made. That gave nine seats 
               <br />
               south of township 38 and six north of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               twelve and the six to thirteen. You add one-

               third to the south and more than double
