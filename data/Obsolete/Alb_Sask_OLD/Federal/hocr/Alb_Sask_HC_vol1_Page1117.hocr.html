               this country at least, church and state

               <br />
               not believe it is right that the church and 
               <br />
               the state should have any connection what- 
               <br />
               ever with each other. The country should 
               <br />
               be run entirely independent of the church, 
               <br />
               and the church should be allowed to man- 
               <br />
               age its own affairs. And in thus speaking 
               <br />
               I do not refer to any particular church. As 
               <br />
               far as my constituency is concerned, we 
               <br />
               had no trouble with the separate school 
               <br />
               question. Mine is an Ontario constituency, 
               <br />
               and in the province of Ontario the school 
               <br />
               question has been settled since confeder- 
               <br />
               ation, and we have had no trouble. Con- 
               <br />
               cessions have been made in the Separate 
               <br />
               School Act by the provincial government 
               <br />
               from time to time, though the government 
               <br />
               always has a majority of Protestants. I 
               <br />
               believe they have always done what is 
               <br />
               fair to the minority, and I believe that in

               <br />

               Northwest Territories and the new <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern-</span>

               ments to be established. Even if there is a 
               <br />
               Protestant majority, they will do what is 
               <br />
               fair and right to the minority. Should there 
               <br />
               be a Roman Catholic majority in the new 
               <br />
               provinces, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lI</span> should have the same faith in 
               <br />
               their Willingness to do justice to the minor— 
               <br />
               ity. I believe that if the matter is left 
               <br />
               entirely in the hands of provincial authority 
               <br />
               the minority can trust them without fear.

               <br />
               by any member of the Manitoba govern-

               ment, though 1 have read in“ the newspapers

               that such a thing might be done. This, how- 
               <br />
               ever, may be mere newspaper agitation. 
               <br />
               On the other hand, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> believe the present

               <br />
               their best to make things satisfactory for 
               <br />
               the minority. And I believe that from time 
               <br />
               to time they will help the minority if they 
               <br />
               ﬁnd it necessary. And I also believe that 
               <br />
               so far as any provincial government through- 
               <br />

               <br />
               testant or Catholic, the same thing is true. 
               <br />
               So believing, and also believing that this 
               <br />
               measure will be injurious to immigration 
               <br />
               and that will still create an agitation that
