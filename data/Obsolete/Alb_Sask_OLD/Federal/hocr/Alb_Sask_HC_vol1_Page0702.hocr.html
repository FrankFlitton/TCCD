               be borne in mind that this 348,981.01 acres 
               <br />
               received by the province has cost her the 
               <br />
               sum of $71,748.08. This is about 20 cents an 
               <br />
               acre. Now under the old administration 
               <br />
               these lands were handed over to the pro- 
               <br />

               half of what they had been, but as a matter 
               <br />
               of fact they are costing us twice as much 
               <br />
               at 10 cents an acre. It is hardly working 
               <br />
               it out that way. Let me read to you an

               <br />

               Now let me analyse that statement for a

               moment, to give you some idea how we are 
               <br />
               being treated in regard to our swamp lands. 
               <br />
               First, the area selected is cut down from 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">284,034</span> to 146,227 acres. Secondly, the area 
               <br />
               of 146,274 acres is cut down to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">43,192:‘_7</span> 
               <br />
               only as being available. The province is 
               <br />
               charged with the cost of examining <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">284,034</span> 
               <br />
               acres, and only gets 43,192'27 acres. It 
               <br />
               will be observed that it is stated that out of 
               <br />
               these 284,034 acres examined by the inspec- 
               <br />
               tors, the province only get 146,274 acres as 
               <br />
               her property. But out of these only 43,192‘27 
               <br />
               are handed over. Now I would like to know 
               <br />
               what has become of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dilference</span> ? What 
               <br />
               compensation has been given, or is proposed 
               <br />
               to be given, by this government for this 
               <br />
               forced conﬁscation ? This is a question for 
               <br />
               the new Minister of the Interior, and 1 
               <br />
               would ask him to answer this question. 
               <br />
               Of course it would not be right to recall him 
               <br />
               from the west <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ait/this</span> particular time; his

               mind and his money no doubt are running

               in other channels. Now I will not deal any

               <br />
               at that time, there were fully 7,000,000 acres

               will come to the conclusion that it would

               be much better for the provinces to 
               <br />
               retain control of their public lands. The 
               <br />

               <br />
               tion. or when purchasing the territory, set 
               <br />
               aside certain lands to be used for edu- 
               <br />
               cational purposes. There is no doubt that it‘ 
               <br />
               these lands were handed over to the pro—

               better and more wisely than the federal gov-

               ernment. So far as Manitoba is concerned. 
               <br />
               there never was a time in the history of that

               lands and the revenue derived therefrom, 
               <br />
               as at the present. Our schools have been

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nationalized,</span> but, Sir, we are taking a step

               in advance of that, we are endeavouring to

               centralize them and therefore we need all

               Fortunately, in this instance, it is not one

               our making, and therefore subject to our un-
