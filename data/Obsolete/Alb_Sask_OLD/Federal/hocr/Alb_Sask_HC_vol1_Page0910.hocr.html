               Now, Sir, a word as to the changes we have 
               <br />
               made in that clause. I stated the other day 
               <br />
               that we propose to make a change and we have 
               <br />
               given notice of an amendment which we intend 
               <br />
               to move to clause 16. What is the reason of 
               <br />
               this change ? It is a. fair question to ask and 
               <br />
               a question to be answered. Sir, we have taken 
               <br />
               the ground on more than one occasion, we again 
               <br />
               take this ground, and it is the ground upon 
               <br />
               which we stand in dealing with the present 
               <br />
               case, that wherever a system of separate 
               <br />
               schools exists that system comes into force 
               <br />
               and is constitutionally entitled to the guaran— 
               <br />
               tees which are embolded in section 93 of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act. Be that system 
               <br />
               much. be it little, whatever it is, it is entitled 
               <br />
               to those guarantees. That is the position we 
               <br />
               take and when we introduce section 16, as it is

               not a lawyer, much less a constitutional 
               <br />
               lawyer. I do not want to become involved 
               <br />

               <br />
               I have common sense enough to take issue 
               <br />
               with the Minister of Justice when he says 
               <br />
               that this clause does not go one inch further 
               <br />

               <br />
               this clause goes as far as it possibly could

               <br />
               to have the right to religious teaching in 
               <br />
               their schools from half-past three to four 
               <br />
               o’clock. Is there anything in this clause 
               <br />
               that would prevent religious teaching in 
               <br />
               those schools from 9 o’clock in the morning 
               <br />
               to 4 o’clock in the afternoon ? I do not think 
               <br />
               so. I do not think that is within the four 
               <br />
               corners of the whole resolution. Certainly 
               <br />
               they could not prejudically affect the right, 
               <br />
               they could not limit it to a quarter of an 
               <br />
               hour in the afternoon. The power could be 
               <br />
               given, at any rate, if the Territories chose to 
               <br />
               use it, to have religious teaching from 9 
               <br />
               o’clock In the morning until 4 o’clock in the 
               <br />
               afternoon. Now how did it come about that 
               <br />
               this serious blunder has been made, that 
               <br />
               clause 16 as originally put in the Bill found 
               <br />
               its way there instead of clause 16 of Which 
               <br />
               the right hon. the First Minister has given 
               <br />
               notice to be inserted when the Bill comes 
               <br />
               before the Committee of the Whole? He 
               <br />
               says he did not authorize it, the ex—Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior tells us the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               did not draft it, the eX-Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior says he does not blame the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice for drafting it. Who drafted it ': 
               <br />
               Who is responsible for it ? No member of 
               <br />
               the government ? Why, they say, it was the 
               <br />
               draughtsman. They will not assume re- 
               <br />
               sponsibility for it, because the country has 
               <br />
               condemned it, parliament has condemned 
               <br />
               it because their own followers would not 
               <br />
               agree to it.
