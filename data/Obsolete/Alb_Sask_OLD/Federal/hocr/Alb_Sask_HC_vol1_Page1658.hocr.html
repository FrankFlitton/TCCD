               want any credit for a sense of justice they

               Antoine (Mr. Ames). This would be a 
               <br />
               practical display of his sense of justice, but 
               <br />
               I have heard no mention that he has any in-

               But he is prepared to sacriﬁce the well-

               <br />
               Ontario as well. I see my hon. friend from

               Peel (Mr. Blain) sitting right alongside the

               hon. member for St. Antoine (Mr. Ames). 
               <br />
               My hon. friend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from.</span> Peel has been a member 
               <br />
               of this House for two parliaments. He sat 
               <br />
               in the previous parliament for a constituency 
               <br />
               which according to the census, had a popula- 
               <br />
               tion of 13,687, as against 47,000 in the con- 
               <br />
               stituency of the hon. member for St. Antoine. 
               <br />
               But we do not need to go to the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec to show a discrepancy. While the 
               <br />
               hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">membt</span> for Peel sat here with 13,687 
               <br />
               people at his back the hon. gentleman (Mr. 
               <br />
               W. F. Maclean) who then represented East 
               <br />
               York sat here as the representative of 40,405 
               <br />
               people. Three of the people represented by 
               <br />
               the then member for East York had just as 
               <br />
               much right in this parliament as one of those 
               <br />
               represented by the hon. member for Peel. 
               <br />
               But my hon. friend from Peel did not offer 
               <br />
               objection to that condition of afﬂairs. I 
               <br />
               know that the wrong has been, to some ex- 
               <br />
               tent, righted since that time ; but I have not 
               <br />
               heard that the hon. gentleman (Mr. Blain) 
               <br />
               manifested any great enthusiasm in sup- 
               <br />
               porting that change. Let me instance the 
               <br />
               province of Nova Scotia, from which the hon. 
               <br />

               <br />
               Borden) and which he represented in the 
               <br />
               last parliament. Of course, the discrepancies 
               <br />
               are not quite so marked in that province as 
               <br />

               <br />
               lation was 13,515. The county of Cumber- 
               <br />
               land, also represented by one member, had

               <br />
               36,168. This cannot be justiﬁed on the

               known about when the Redistribution Bill 
               <br />

               <br />
               did not hear the leader of the opposition (Mr.

               good time for him to assert his love of fair-

               <br />
               as I understand. He waits until the case of

               north and south. And, according to their

               own statement, the fairest proposition for

               redistribution within their knowledge was 
               <br />
               that of the Transvaal, and in that case the
