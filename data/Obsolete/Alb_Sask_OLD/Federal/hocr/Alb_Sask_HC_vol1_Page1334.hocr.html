               <br />
               then that later on—perhaps in that, 
               <br />
               or, at all events, the succeeding session—we 
               <br />
               would make provision in the line indicated 
               <br />
               by my hon. friend from Hamilton (Mr. 
               <br />
               Barker). Accordingly, in 1904, after much 
               <br />
               consideration, parliament in its wisdom 
               <br />
               thought ﬁt to amend the Railway Act by 
               <br />
               introducing section 5, that is section 5 of 
               <br />
               chapter 32 of 4 Edward VII. That section 
               <br />
               provided that the majority of the directors 
               <br />
               of any company which has heretofore re- 
               <br />
               ceived or shall hereafter receive from the 
               <br />
               government of Canada aid towards the con- 
               <br />
               struction of its railways or undertakings or 
               <br />
               any part thereof, shall be British subjects, 
               <br />
               provided that this Act shall not, until the 
               <br />
               Slst January, 1905, apply to any company, 
               <br />
               the majority of whose directors are not 
               <br />
               British subjects when this Act comes into 
               <br />
               force. It has been said that the hon. gen— 
               <br />
               tleman who is promoting this Bill has made 
               <br />
               out an exceptional case. But at the time 
               <br />
               we introduced this legislation, 9. year ago, 
               <br />
               we decided that there would be no excep- 
               <br />
               tion. We decided that all railway companies 
               <br />
               which had received money from the public 
               <br />
               funds of Canada should be treated upon the 
               <br />
               same basis. These railway companies are 
               <br />
               not compelled to receive aid. They can 
               <br />
               stand by the provisions of section 109 if 
               <br />
               they so desire. If they will bring foreign 
               <br />
               money into the country and construct their 
               <br />
               railway as an independent enterprise, they 
               <br />
               are still at liberty to do it under that sec- 
               <br />
               tion ; but if they have come or are coming 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parliament</span> for public money, that money 
               <br />
               can only be granted them on the basis that 
               <br />
               the enterprise is peculiarly in the interests 
               <br />
               of Canada, and they must have on their di- 
               <br />
               rectorate a majority of British subjects at 
               <br />
               least. I am inclined to think that it we 
               <br />
               have erred at all, we have erred in not going 
               <br />
               far enough. There may be a good deal in 
               <br />
               what has been suggested to the effect that 
               <br />
               we have not the desired control, even Where

               <br />
               on unless we are very careful. This is a

               railway which has received aid and if these 
               <br />

               and repay to parliament the aid that has 
               <br />
               been given. This railway, by the way, 
               <br />
               has had the attention of the public particu—

               larly directed to it in the matter of this 
               <br />
               same Cornwall bridge. It was pointed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out,</span> 
               <br />
               i think by Mr. Pettipiece, that a peculiar

               condition of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁairs</span> exists in reference to 
               <br />
               the bridge, that is to say that the portion

               of the bridge which is in Canadian ter- 
               <br />
               ritory received aid to a very large amount 
               <br />
               from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“Dominion</span> government, but the 
               <br />
               other end on the American side received 
               <br />
               no aid and—although it may not be pertin— 
               <br />
               cut to this particular argument when you 
               <br />
               travel on the Canadian end you pay 3 cents 
               <br />
               a mile, but on the American end you pay 
               <br />
               only 2 cents. It is not immediately 
               <br />
               relevant to the discussion and I do not want 
               <br />
               to arouse prejudice against the company, but 
               <br />
               I want to say that it would be very un- 
               <br />
               wise to open the door to difﬁculties_which 
               <br />
               might arise With other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canadianrailways</span> 
               <br />
               carrying on much vaster operations than 
               <br />
               this ; railways which controlling much 
               <br />
               greater capital and representing larger in- 
               <br />
               terests might bring to bear on this par- 
               <br />
               liament a degree of inﬂuence that this 
               <br />
               railway cannot bring to bear. We may 
               <br />
               ﬁnd ourselves in the position of being un- 
               <br />
               able to control the situation, if we open 
               <br />
               the door now. I have no prejudice against 
               <br />
               this railway company; I know nothing to 
               <br />
               their disadvantage, but we are trustees of 
               <br />
               the public in this matter and I feel that 
               <br />
               in indulgence to railways the people of 
               <br />
               Canada, through their representatives in the 
               <br />
               House of Commons, have gone as far as they 
               <br />
               ought—sometimes farther—in deference to 
               <br />
               the wishes of the railway promoters, and 
               <br />
               we should be careful, this matter having
