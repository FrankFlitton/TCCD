               Mr. LAMONT. The local legislature could 
               <br />
               not then pass any law which would prejudi- 
               <br />
               cally affect any right or privilege granted 
               <br />
               under subsection 1, which. like the clause in 
               <br />
               the British North America Act, prevents any 
               <br />
               interference-with the denominational schools

               Mr. LAKE. I am personally greatly in 
               <br />
               favour of allowing this half hour’s instruc-
