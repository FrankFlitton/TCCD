               to the land, in every instance, I believe I 
               <br />
               am right in saying the prayer of that peti- 
               <br />
               tion was that the people of the west should 
               <br />
               have the right to govern their lands. 1 do 
               <br />
               not recall a single instance where the people 
               <br />
               petitioned that the Dominion government 
               <br />
               should administer the lands belonging to 
               <br />
               the Crown in that country. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now, I do not believe that the people of 
               <br />
               the west will be satisﬁed with this kind of 
               <br />
               legislation. I believe we are simply creat- 
               <br />
               ing a grievance that will have to be re- 
               <br />
               moved some day, otherwise there will be 
               <br />
               dissatisfaction in that country for many 
               <br />
               years to come. Hon. gentlemen opposite 
               <br />
               may be perfectly sincere, but I cannot for 
               <br />
               the life of me believe that members from 
               <br />
               the west supporting the government reﬂect 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l'O—day</span> the feeling of. that country. But then 
               <br />
               they tell us : See the verdict in Edmonton. 
               <br />
               Have we had a verdict from Edmonton with 
               <br />
               respect to the land question or the school 
               <br />
               question? I say we have not. Edmonton 
               <br />
               is a very large district and I apprehend 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> a large proportion of the people, pro- 
               <br />
               bably one-half or three-quarters did not 
               <br />
               know that there was an election going <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on:</span> 
               <br />
               The statement that they expressed an oi)- 
               <br />
               inion is absolutely absurd. They had no 
               <br />
               opportunity to vote, nor do I believe they 
               <br />
               had the opportunity of knowing that the 
               <br />
               question Was being submitted to them who 
               <br />
               their representative should be. When these 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen say: Look at the verdict 
               <br />
               from Edmonton ; I say : Look at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">verd</span> 
               <br />
               dict from Western Assiniboia. It I mis- 
               <br />
               take not, .Western Assiniboia was asked to 
               <br />
               pronounce a verdict on this question before 
               <br />
               Edmonton was. And their answer was :- 
               <br />
               Stay away, don’t come here, for the verdict 
               <br />
               will be against you. That is a section of
