               Canadian refused to participate in the 
               <br />
               schools then existing, because it was against 
               <br />
               their conscience to do so, and I consider 
               <br />
               that their ignorance was a glorious one. In 
               <br />
               1800 there was a school system established 
               <br />
               for which the French Canadians were taxed; 
               <br />
               the Royal Institution,‘in which the money 
               <br />
               was given to the Protestant schools and to 
               <br />
               them only. Again the French Canadians 
               <br />
               refused to attend those schools, because it 
               <br />
               was against their conscience to do so, and 
               <br />
               they remained in their glorious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ignorance.</span> 
               <br />
               In 1824 we had the ﬁrst schools worthy of 
               <br />
               the name, but as there was no public money 
               <br />
               given them, they could not work very well. 
               <br />
               In 1837 our rights were still not recognized 
               <br />
               and the Protestant minority had still con— 
               <br />
               trol of the public funds. In 1841 the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               move was made towards giving our people 
               <br />
               :1 schools system which they could support, 
               <br />
               and in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1846</span> we had our separate school sys— 
               <br />
               tem established, and our French Canadian 
               <br />
               people could go to schools where their rights 
               <br />
               were recognized and which they could at- 
               <br />
               tend without a blush of shame. Considering 
               <br />
               that we started our school only in 1846, we 
               <br />
               have made marvellous progress and to-day 
               <br />
               our system is at the head of the whole con-

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1‘</span> little further. I said that our system of 
               <br />
               schools in Quebec was started in 1846. But 
               <br />
               it was not in full operation until 1855. And 
               <br />
               then, as my hon. friend from Labelle (Mr. 
               <br />
               Bourassa) has rightly put it, the people 
               <br />
               were for a long time very cautious about 
               <br />
               the schools. They had long been tyrannized 
               <br />
               over, and they saw in the schools, as they 
               <br />
               thought, an instrument to rob them of what 
               <br />
               they held dear—their language and their in— 
               <br />
               stitutions. Therefore, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“it</span> was only slowly 
               <br />
               and with great caution that they accepted 
               <br />
               the work of the schools. But in 1855 the 
               <br />
               system was at work almost as completely 
               <br />
               as it is to-day. As to overcoming illiteracy, 
               <br />
               we have made greater progress in Quebec 
               <br />
               than in any other province. Let me give 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mir.</span> Sproule) the ﬁgures. 
               <br />
               In 1871, in Quebec. there were of illiterates 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~people</span> who could neither read nor write— 
               <br />
               35'93 per cent of the population. In 1891 
               <br />
               only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2905</span> per cent_of the population were 
               <br />
               illiterate. Thus in the twenty years we 
               <br />
               have made progress to the extent of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">689</span> per 
               <br />
               cent. In Ontario, in 1871, there were 7'90 per 
               <br />
               cent of the people who could-neither read 
               <br />
               nor write. In 1891 this had been reduced 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">705</span> per cent, showing progress to the 
               <br />
               extent of only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">0'8?»</span> per cent. In New Bruns-

               wick, where there are no separate schools, 
               <br />
               they had, in 1871, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1445</span> per cent of illiter- 
               <br />
               ates, and in 1891 the proportion was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">14-99</span> 
               <br />
               per cent, or an absolute retrogression to the 
               <br />
               extent of '54 per cent. I do not say that 
               <br />
               we lead confederation in the proportion of 
               <br />
               our people who can read or write; but I 
               <br />
               do say that we lead in the progress that 
               <br />
               we have made in extending the blessings of 
               <br />
               education.

               Hon. gentlemen opposite tell us that we 
               <br />
               should have in the Northwest 21 national 
               <br />
               system of schools. Sir, do you call it a 
               <br />
               national system of schools which is opposed 
               <br />
               to the conscience of 40 per cent of the na- 
               <br />
               tion? Do you call those national schools 
               <br />
               against which 40 per cent of the nation 
               <br />
               have fought for more than a century? I 
               <br />
               say that what these hon. gentlemen call 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">national</span> schools are anti-national schools. 
               <br />
               because they are forced upon 40 per cent 
               <br />
               of the people against their will ; I say that 
               <br />
               what you call free schools are the exact 
               <br />
               reverse of free, because they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deny‘the</span> liber-

               ty of the individual and make him a slave 
               <br />
               in the hands of the state. The hon. member 
               <br />
               for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) told us that 
               <br />
               in the province of Quebec a Protestant boy 
               <br />
               was obliged to go to a Catholic school. But
