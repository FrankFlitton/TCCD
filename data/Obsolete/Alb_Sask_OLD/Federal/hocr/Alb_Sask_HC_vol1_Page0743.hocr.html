               That resolution is a very moderate one 
               <br />
               and a very Wise one, and either of the 
               <br />
               three courses it recommends should have ap-

               The general elections, Sir, took place a 
               <br />
               few weeks before the meeting of this House. 
               <br />
               These Bills had no doubt been fully decid— 
               <br />
               ed upon, at any rate in their general lilies, 
               <br />
               before that election; and that being the 
               <br />
               case, surely their provisions should have 
               <br />
               been submitted to the people. It constitutes 
               <br />
               a gross deception upon the electors, espec- 
               <br />
               ially the electors of the Northwest, that 
               <br />
               such measures should have practically been 
               <br />
               decided upon, and not one reference made 
               <br />
               to them by any one on behalf of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment during the last general elections. In 
               <br />
               my opinion this conduct of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment is deserving of the ‘severest censure. 
               <br />
               As my right- hon. friend is aware, that meet- 
               <br />
               ing at Massey Hall was attended by an 
               <br />
               enormous number of his followers—men 
               <br />
               who had been his steady followers for 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years—and</span> 1 believe I am quite within the 
               <br />
               mark in saying that the Prime Minister has 
               <br />
               received more strong remonstrances from his 
               <br />
               own supporters in Ontario than from all 
               <br />
               the rest of the country put together. The 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman made his appeal stand- 
               <br />
               ing upon the constitution of the country. In 
               <br />
               that respect he was right because if the 
               <br />
               constitution is good for anything it surely 
               <br />
               ought to be capable of meeting such a case 
               <br />
               as the present. But the Minister of Fin- 
               <br />
               ance (Mr. Fielding) threw to the winds 
               <br />
               the constitution. He said the question was 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> a constitutional one, but‘ one of ex- 
               <br />
               pediency. The Minister of Justice (Mr. 
               <br />
               Fitzpatrick), I understand, believes that 
               <br />
               the substituted clause is practically the 
               <br />
               same as the clause in the original Bill. If 
               <br />
               that be the case, what power has been 
               <br />
               brought to bear upon the Minister of the 
               <br />
               interior (Mr. Sifton) to induce him to swal- 
               <br />
               low that amended clause as almost sufﬁ- 
               <br />
               cient for the needs of the people of the 
               <br />
               west and as not placing upon them any 
               <br />
               more onerous restrictions than the law now 
               <br />
               in force in the Territories does ? The ‘Globe’ 
               <br />
               the other day took the view of the Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior with regard to the original 
               <br />
               educational clause and held that it was the 
               <br />
               duty of the Liberals to reject it, who 
               <br />
               believed in provincial rights and provincial

               called forth their indignation and surprise? 
               <br />
               The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">err-Minister</span> of the Interior (Mr. Sif- 
               <br />
               tcn) paid the Minister of Justice the com— 
               <br />
               pliment of saying that he certainly could 
               <br />
               not have drafted those clauses, if they 
               <br />
               were supposed to mean what the First 
               <br />
               Minister said he intended them to mean, 
               <br />
               and an attempt was made to put the onus 
               <br />
               on the draughtsman. I am quite sure that the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice will not shirk respon- 
               <br />
               sibility in any such manner. Those clauses 
               <br />
               were drawn deliberately, they were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">drawn</span> 
               <br />
               knowingly, they were drawn in the shape 
               <br />
               they were, although it was known that they 
               <br />
               would not be accepted by the great bulk 
               <br />
               of the people. They were concealed from 
               <br />
               those who, the Prime Minister and the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Justice knew, would oppose them 
               <br />
               tooth and nail. They Were only presented 
               <br />
               to Mr. Haultain the day they were sub- 
               <br />
               mitted to this House and to the Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior and Finance not more than 
               <br />
               a day or two before they were introduced 
               <br />
               here. They were deliberately suppressed 
               <br />
               and kept back from all those who as the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister and other members of the 
               <br />
               government well knew, would strongly and 
               <br />
               strenuously oppose them. What the people 
               <br />
               want to know is why were these clauses 
               <br />
               forced on an unwilling cabinet ‘? Why were 
               <br />
               they forced upon people who objected 
               <br />
               to them ? Why were they forced upon the 
               <br />
               very people who are most interested in 
               <br />
               this Bill ‘? These people were not consulted 
               <br />
               The man who represented them in the 
               <br />
               cabinet was not consulted, and yet apparent— 
               <br />
               ly such force was brought to bear upon 
               <br />
               the government that they were inserted in 
               <br />
               the Bill and kept secret until the very 
               <br />
               last moment. Surely that is not the way to 
               <br />
               bring about conciliation, but it is rather 
               <br />
               the way to arouse the worst feelings on 
               <br />
               both sides. There must have been some 
               <br />
               strong power that forced the government to 
               <br />
               take this position and what the people want 
               <br />
               to know is who is that power, who pulled 
               <br />
               the strings? When the clause was ﬁrst 
               <br />
               read and created such excitement through- 
               <br />
               out the country, if it was so innocent as 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister said it was intended to 
               <br />
               be. why did nearly ﬁve weeks elapse be- 
               <br />
               fore it was re-drafted and again submitted 
               <br />
               to this House? During that interval we 
               <br />
               had the resignation of one of the ministers ; 
               <br />
               we had bickerings among hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               opposite, and the country was aﬂame- with 
               <br />
               excitement. There was more than a simply 
               <br />
               re-drafting of that clause to cause all that 
               <br />
