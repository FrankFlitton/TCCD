               remarked that he thought it would be advis-

               why it is that one of those he mentioned,

               <br />
               greater than that cast in the city of

               )Ioosejaw, I think, was actually great- 
               <br />
               er than that o-f the residents of the city 
               <br />
               of Regina. With reference to the argument 
               <br />
               that schools are a very good indication of the 
               <br />
               population of a country, and the fact stated 
               <br />
               that there are more schools in the northern, 
               <br />
               part of Alberta than in the southern part, I 
               <br />
               think that argument may be met by this 
               <br />
               statement. It is certainly true that where 
               <br />
               you have a settlement of agriculturlsts living 
               <br />
               close together, they are likely to form a 
               <br />
               school district ; but where you have a ranch- 
               <br />
               ing district, the ranchers are much more dis- 
               <br />
               tant from each other, and it is more difﬁcult 
               <br />
               for them to form a school district. In south— 
               <br />
               ern Alberta I have met the complaint that 
               <br />
               the ranchers do not form school districts. 
               <br />
               but move into the town in the Winter and 
               <br />
               make use of the town schools. The 
               <br />
               trustees of these schools complain that 
               <br />
               it is rather hard on them to have to bear 
               <br />
               the expense incurred by the ranchers coming 
               <br />
               in and using their schools in this way. 
               <br />
               So I think that the ﬁgures given as regards 
               <br />
               the school districts cannot be considered 
               <br />
               reliable in this connection. This afternoon 
               <br />
               when the Minister of the Interior was deal— 
               <br />

               <br />

               exception to a statement of mine that the 
               <br />
               district of St. Albert. a very large district 
               <br />

               ran. Within 6 miles of the city of Edmonton, 
               <br />
               I was asking why. if they considered that 
               <br />
               these vast areas should be taken into con- 
               <br />
               sideration. it was necessary to run in a huge 
               <br />
               area of that sort within 6 miles of Edmon- 
               <br />
               ton. The minister stated it was 9 miles 
               <br />
               from Edmonton. I have the map here is—

               marked within 4 miles. Does the Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior intend to repudiate this map 
               <br />

               Mr. LAKE. This map places the district 
               <br />
               of St. Albert Within 4 miles of the city of 
               <br />
               Edmonton instead of 9. It seems to me that 
               <br />
               just looking at the map should arouse sus- 
               <br />
               picions as to an improper distribution of 
               <br />
               seats. Here you have four constituencies 
               <br />
               touching the city of Edmonton, the town of 
               <br />
               Edmonton and three other constituencies, 
               <br />
               and you have three other constituencies a'll 
               <br />
               poking their noses within 12 milesof Ed- 
               <br />
               monton. That is to say that the city of 
               <br />
               Edmonton controls practically 7 seats in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> legislature. I would like the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister to look at that point especially on 
               <br />
               the map ; he will see that 7 different consti- 
               <br />
               tuencies all come up within 12 miles of 
               <br />
               Edmonton. Take that into consideration 
               <br />
               when you say that the areas should be espe—
