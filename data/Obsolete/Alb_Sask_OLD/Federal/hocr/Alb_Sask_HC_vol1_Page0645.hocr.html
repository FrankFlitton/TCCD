               the right hon. gentleman says—and I think

               the Postmaster General (Sir William Mu-

               lock) endeavoured the other day to substan-

               tiate it, that there had been no appli-

               <br />
               cords will prove otherwise. On page 15 of 
               <br />
               the records before the House there is a 
               <br />
               printed letter. That letter written on the 
               <br />
               16th or the 6th,—if it was the 16th it shows 
               <br />
               the failure of memory to be all the worse— 
               <br />
               was written and, I think, signed by the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister, to Mr. Whitney saying: I

               <br />
               from Hamilton that the discussion, if there 
               <br />
               is to be one, or the suggestions, if there <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> 
               <br />
               any to be made, should be such as would be 
               <br />
               pertinent purely to the propositions con- 
               <br />
               tained in these measures. There is no mat-

               Mr. BARKER. I, from no fault of my 
               <br />
               own, was unable to be present on the even- 
               <br />
               ing of the 5th when the discussion took 
               <br />
               place that the hon. gentleman has referred 
               <br />
               to. I do not clalm any privilege on that ac- 
               <br />
               count. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'I</span> only explain I was unable to be 
               <br />
               present. I was not well. I did desire to 
               <br />
               be present on that evening, not for the pur-

               <br />
               Bill to public interests. It relates to the

               acquisition of a railway which the country 
               <br />
