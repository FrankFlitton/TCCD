               speaking population. That was one reason 
               <br />
               why our French friends at that time claim— 
               <br />
               ed that the boundaries of Manitoba should 
               <br />
               be enlarged, so that it, being regarded to a 
               <br />
               large extent as a French province, would 
               <br />
               have more room for development; but the 
               <br />
               expectation was that the new territories 
               <br />
               would become English. They were given sep- 
               <br />
               arate schools more on the ground of lan- 
               <br />
               guage than of creed. The teachers in those 
               <br />
               schools were principally the priests of the 
               <br />
               various localities. There were only ﬁve or 
               <br />
               six hundred families in all the territories.

               A comparison has been drawn between the 
               <br />
               separate schools of the province of Quebec 
               <br />
               and those of the province of Ontario. We 
               <br />
               are told that the English minority in the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec were granted certain 
               <br />
               privileges. Let me tell the hon. member

               <br />
               but to the French Roman Catholic majority. 
               <br />
               At the time of the conquest they were 
               <br />
               granted the rights and liberties that had

               <br />
               the liberties they enjoy to-day; and when 
               <br />
               Quebec capitulated, the liberties which had

               men from the province of Ontario. When

               Ontario and Quebec became parts of the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada, each had its own 
               <br />
               separate school system established by law. 
               <br />
               When New Brunswick became part of the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada, it had its own school 
               <br />
               system established by the votes of its own 
               <br />

               <br />
               ward Island came in, each had its own 
               <br />
               school system established by the votes of 
               <br />
               its own people. The Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               occupy an entirely different position. They 
               <br />
               came into the Dominion away back in 1870. 
               <br />
               They had no school system anterior to the

               them. At the present time we are not unit-

               Canada ; we are only transforming them into 
               <br />
               provinces, and the people of the whole of 
               <br />
               Canada have the making of their charter, 
               <br />
               not the people of the territories themselves. 
               <br />
               What we contend is that in granting them 
               <br />
               their charter, we must apply the British 
               <br />
               North America Act, so far as it relates to the 
               <br />
               establishment of provinces.

               That is the point of difference we make 
               <br />
               between the union of the Territories as 
               <br />
               such with confederation and their entry 
               <br />
               into it as provinces. There is no union of

               the Territories, as provinces, with confed- 
               <br />

               <br />
               Territories, and their creation as provinces 
               <br />
               is merely a development. I chanced to be

               the new <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">autonomy</span> Bius was being <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discussed.</span> 
               <br />
               As Ipassed along. I heard mention of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mys—</span> 
               <br />
               terious trips taken by the First Minister 
               <br />
               here and there throughout the country, but 
               <br />
               not taken where he could consult his Fin—

               Haultaiu and his cabinet in the Territories. 
               <br />
               It was understood then that there was ques-

               tion of a clause being put into the measure 
               <br />
               creating the new provinces, fastening upon

               cember. when that probability was mentioned

               to the followers of the right <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon-gentleman</span> 
               <br />
               in this House, they scoffed at the idea. They 
               <br />
               said that he who had been the champion of 
               <br />
               provincial autonomy in 1896, who had de- 
               <br />
               claimed then against the coercion of Maui- 
               <br />
               toba, who had advocated the policy of hands 
               <br />
               off Manitoba, was not likely to consent to 
               <br />
               anything which would fetter these new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces and prevent them from working out 
               <br />
               freely their own destinies along the lines he 
               <br />
               had laid down with regard to Manitoba in 
               <br />
               1896. In that year of 1896, I considered it 
               <br />
               my duty to oppose the Bill of my own lead- 
               <br />
               er (Sir Charles Tupper) just as I opposed the 
               <br />
               resolution of the right hon. gentleman, and 
               <br />
               I Opposed both on the ground that I would 
               <br />
               vote against any attempt to coerce Mani- 
               <br />
               toba. On that occasion I took a unique 
               <br />
               position and have seen no ground for chang- 
               <br />
               ing any of the sentiments I then uttered. 
               <br />
               I took the ground then that the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba should be free, that the people 
               <br />
               there were eminently well ﬁtted to work out. 
               <br />
               their own destiny, and should not be fet- 
               <br />
               tered or hampered by the federal power in 
               <br />
               that work ; and I would have supported the
