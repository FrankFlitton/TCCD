               been in every respect a good and satisfac-

               <br />
               ment in the new provinces will carry it on 
               <br />
               in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">same‘manner;</span> but, not owning their 
               <br />
               own lands, they will not have the same 
               <br />
               temptation, and they will not have these 
               <br />
               magnates after them every day trying to 
               <br />
               get bonuses and guarantees as would be 
               <br />
               the case if the provinces were the owners 
               <br />
               of the public lands. I notice how that hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen on the other side of the House 
               <br />
               are very anxious to hand over the lands to 
               <br />
               the governments of the new provinces. But 
               <br />
               what has been the record of these hon. gen- 
               <br />
               rtlemen? When the province of Manitoba 
               <br />
               asked for its own lands, these gentlemen 
               <br />
               refused. If they were so anxious to con- 
               <br />
               serve the lands of the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               for the people of these Territories, why did 
               <br />
               they give away to railroads millions and 
               <br />
               millions of acres of those lands? I do not 
               <br />
               say so much about the land grant given to 
               <br />
               the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway, for in those 
               <br />
               days it was difﬁcult to get a road built 
               <br />
               through that part of the country, because 
               <br />
               we did not know it as well as we do now. 
               <br />
               But, since then, millions of acres of lands in 
               <br />
               he Northwest have been given away as 
               <br />
               bonuses for the building of railways in 
               <br />
               Manitoba. If hon. gentlemen on the other 
               <br />
               side are so anxious as they appear to be to 
               <br />
               conserve the lands of the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories for the people of those Territories, 
               <br />
               why did they act in that manner? It comes 
               <br />
               with a bad grace from hon. gentlemen op- 
               <br />
               posite to talk of handing over the lands to 
               <br />
               the people of‘ the Northwest when they 
               <br />
               themselves gave away millions of acres of 
               <br />
               the choicest of our lands to railway com- 
               <br />
               panies. We in the Northwest Territories, in 
               <br />
               addition, must pay our share of the cash 
               <br />
               bounties given to railways in every part of 
               <br />
               the country.

               I am aware that among Protestants we have 
               <br />
