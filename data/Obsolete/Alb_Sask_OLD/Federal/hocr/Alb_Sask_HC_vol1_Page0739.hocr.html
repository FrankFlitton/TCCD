               of belief and feeling, my sympathies for the 
               <br />
               minorities are well enough known to my

               to represent, for toleration, benevolence and 
               <br />
               fairness, has come to their knowledge. It 
               <br />
               cannot be. said that, as a matter of course, 
               <br />
               the views of the minorities are wrong. The 
               <br />
               fundamental principles of justice and truth 
               <br />

               morrow, in the same way as the wealthy 
               <br />
               man of to-day may be destitute to—morrow. 
               <br />
               The main difﬁculty, if I may say so with- 
               <br />
               out hurting too much our self-conceit, lies 
               <br />
               in the limited disposition or ability of man 
               <br />
               to grasp what constitutes justice and truth. 
               <br />
               And the very sense of our inadequacy in 
               <br />
               that respect should be sufﬁcient reason for 
               <br />
               all good-natured and sincere men, who 
               <br />
               would not unwillingly commit an injustice, 
               <br />
               to move slowly and show toleration under 
               <br />
               circumstances such as these. ‘Those who 
               <br />

               <br />
