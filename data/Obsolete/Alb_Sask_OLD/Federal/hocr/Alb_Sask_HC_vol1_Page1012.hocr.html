               leader of the government about the affairs 
               <br />
               of the Yukon: and, as the non. leader 01' 
               <br />
               the opposition yesterday left it open to me 
               <br />
               to propose some one who would make a 
               <br />
               ﬁrst-class Governor of the Yukon. I believe 
               <br />
               Dr. Pringle would be a good man to ﬁll that 
               <br />
               position. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now, Mr. Speaker, I will not take up much 
               <br />
               more of the time of the House. The educa- 
               <br />
               tional clauses in the Bill are of a very in- 
               <br />
               teresting and important character, and no 
               <br />
               doubt that is why there has been so little 
               <br />
               The consti- 
               <br />
               tutional question I do not propose to dis— 
               <br />
               cuss. Like the speaker who preceded me, 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Haldimand (Mr. Lalor), 
               <br />
               I do not belong to the legal profession. and 
               <br />
               therefore shall leave constitutional points to 
               <br />
               be discussed by men who are versed in legal 
               <br />
               science. I believe, however, that laymen 
               <br />
               are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">quite»</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">icapaibsle</span> of judging from the 
               <br />
               speeches we have had in this House who 
               <br />
               has ‘had the best of the argument; and I 
               <br />
               am sure that there is no man in this House, 
               <br />
               who wishes to express an opinion consistent 
               <br />
               with his own conscience and who is not tied 
               <br />
               down by the leader of his party, who will 
               <br />
               say that the weight of the argument on the 
               <br />
               constitutional question has not been on the 
               <br />
               government side. Let me also say that I 
               <br />
               stand up for provincial rights; and if we 
               <br />
               want more evidence that we are doing so 
               <br />
               than the hon. member for Centre York (Mr. 
               <br />
               Campbell) gave us last night, then we are 
               <br />
               pretty hard to please. I believe he proved 
               <br />
