               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. (Translation) 
               <br />
               I am very much pleased to hear that state- 
               <br />
               ment: in the heat of the debate the hon. 
               <br />
               member seems to have gone beyond what 
               <br />
               he intended to say. At any rate, if. in this 
               <br />
               House. we have the right to use both langu— 
               <br />
               ages, it is not simply a theoretical right. It 
               <br />
               is because the great majority of the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec send French Canadian re- 
               <br />
               presentatives to parliament.

               I am now coming to the principle <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">express.</span> 
               <br />
               ed by the hon. member for Labelle—and I 
               <br />
               trust he will recognize it as I do on all 
               <br />
               occasions—and that is that the rights of the 
               <br />
               provinces are absolute within the limits of 
               <br />
               the constitution, and that among these 
               <br />
               rights there is the freedom to legislate as 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1‘etg'ards</span> the language to be used in the 
               <br />
               counts and the legislative assembly.

               Now, if the House agreed to that amend—
