               Mr. JOHN HERRON. In reference to 
               <br />
               this fence along the boundary line, I may 
               <br />
               Say that the Americans have about sixty 
               <br />
               miles of fence, built about eight rods to the 
               <br />
               south of the boundary line. On the Cana- 
               <br />
               dian side a number of ranches have about 
               <br />
               seventy miles of fence built about four 
               <br />
               rods north of the boundary line. It is re- 
               <br />
               ported that the government are about to 
               <br />
               purchase or take over the fences on our 
               <br />
               side of the, line. Whether that is so or not 
               <br />
               I do not know; it is only common rumour 
               <br />
               in that part of the country. If tenders are 
               <br />
               to be let for the construction of this fence, 
               <br />
               there are a large number of men in that 
               <br />
               country who do that kind of work and have 
               <br />
               machinery for the purpose; and if tenders 
               <br />
               were called for in the ordinary way, we 
               <br />
               could get the fences built at very much 
               <br />
               less than the ﬁgures mentioned here. I 
               <br />
               think the fence built on the American side 
               <br />
               of the boundary line has posts one rod 
               <br />
               apart. with ﬁve barbed wires, and is wonth 
               <br />
               about $150 a mile. The fence built on the 
               <br />
               Ganadian side has cedar posts two rods 
               <br />
               apart, with four wires, and is worth about 
               <br />
               $120 or $125 a mile. These facts show that 
               <br />
               there are people in that-pant of the country 
               <br />
               who make a business of building this class 
               <br />
               of fence, and if the government contemplate 
               <br />
               building a fence along the boundary line 
               <br />
               for a considerable distance and will call 
               <br />
               for tenders. I hope they will give the people 
               <br />
               in that part of the country an opportunity 
               <br />
               to tender for the work.

               Mr. T. S. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SPROUL‘E.</span> There is one thing

               plain. that there is a large sized Ethiopian 
               <br />
               in this fence. In the ﬁrst place, the answer 
               <br />
               given by the premier, I take it. was the 
               <br />
               answer. of the department. Why should 
               <br />
               the department give him an incorrect an- 
               <br />
               swer? Either the department knows or it 
               <br />
               does not know. If the department knows, 
               <br />
               why should it send that answer to the House 
               <br />
               to mislead both the premier and the House ? 
               <br />
               There are one of two things apparent in this 
               <br />
               Whole transaction ; either there is very bad 
               <br />
               business management in the department 
               <br />
               that would not do credit to any business 
               <br />
               ﬁrm in the Dominion of Canada, and the 
               <br />
               people know very little of what is taking 
               <br />
               place in the department, or itis deliberately 
               <br />
               playing into the hands of friends. I do not

               care which is the fact, it is reprehensible 
               <br />

               this matter is followed up, I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">think</span> you will 
               <br />
               lind that :1 good round ﬁgure has been given

               for the contract, perhaps very much 
               <br />
               more than would have been given 
               <br />
               it public tenders had been invited. and 
               <br />
               every one had been allowed to tender. I 
               <br />
               think the First Minister cannot move a 
               <br />
               moment too soon in looking into this mat-

               <br />

               others are prevented from tendering for a

               the whole House will agree that that is a
