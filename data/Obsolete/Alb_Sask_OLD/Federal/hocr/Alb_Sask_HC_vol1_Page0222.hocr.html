               <br />
               the liberty of divulging to the House. When 
               <br />
               Mr. Dalton McCarthy, in 1892 and in 1894, 
               <br />
               brought into this House a Bill to abolish 
               <br />
               separate schools and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'French</span> language

               <br />
               upon an address voted in the legislature of

               , in this House by Mr. Dalton McCarthy, and 
               <br />
               which he developed by a very eloquent argu-

               passions of the majority were aroused and 
               <br />
               successfully aroused against the Catholic 
               <br />
               minority. In consequence. a feeling has 
               <br />
               developed—not of distrust—but a feeling 
               <br />
               has developed amongst us that if we want 
               <br />
               equality and peace to reign in this country, 
               <br />

               the right to do what Sir Oliver Mowat did. 
               <br />
               I took an active part in two elections in 
               <br />
               the province of Ontario; I was but a boy 
               <br />
               at the time, but I was proud to stand by 
               <br />
               Sir Oliver Mowat and help in his campaign 
               <br />
               for justice and equality. I was living on 
               <br />
               the borders of the province of Ontario and 
               <br />
               I crossed the river of my own free will- 
               <br />
               without being asked by anybody, without 
               <br />
               being known by anybody, to do what I 
               <br />
               could in support of the old statesman. What 
               <br />
               was the argument used by Sir Oliver Mo- 
               <br />
               wat? He was prudent and he knew of 
               <br />
               the power of the appeals made by such men 
               <br />
               as the member of East Grey. When the 
               <br />
               system of separate schools was attacked in 
               <br />
               Ontario, Sir Oliver Mowat said. ‘I shall 
               <br />
               not discuss the relative merits of separate 
               <br />
               schools and public schools; I am not any 
               <br />
               partisan of separate schools; but separate 
               <br />
               schools have been established in this pro- 
               <br />
               vince under law, and therefore it is use- 
               <br />
               less to agitate against the law of the land.’ 
               <br />
               What <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I»</span> want is that the future rulers 
               <br />
               of the Northwest may be put in such a posi- 
               <br />
               tion that when passions are aroused and 
               <br />
               prejudices fomented by such men as we 
               <br />
               have in this House, by such newspapers as 
               <br />
               we have in this country, these future rulers 
               <br />
               of the Northwest will be in a position to 
               <br />
               say—when passion is too strong or when 
               <br />
               they are not strong enough to oppose it— 
               <br />
               ‘What is the use ? there is .a law protecting 
               <br />
               the minority.’ I do not wish to cast any 
               <br />
