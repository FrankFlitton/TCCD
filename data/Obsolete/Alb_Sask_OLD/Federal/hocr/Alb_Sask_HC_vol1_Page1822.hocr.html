               their iiberality by the Education Act passed 
               <br />

               <br />
               Majesty Queen Victoria. During this dis-

               <br />
               separate schools in which no religion at all 
               <br />

               Education Act of 1902, under Which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not—only</span>

               do they teach religion in the' schools but 
               <br />
               they teach the religion that the parent de-

               sires, and no religion will be taught in the 
               <br />
               English schools unless it is approved of by 
               <br />
               the bishop of each denomination. And why 
               <br />
               is this ? It is because the great principle 
               <br />
               is understood in England, that the state has 
               <br />
               not the right to teach the child in any way 
               <br />
               other than as the parent desires. That is 
               <br />
               the natural right of the parent. No law 
               <br />
               and no constitution can change that. It is 
               <br />
               the natural law that you have the right to 
               <br />
               educate your child as you desire. But my 
               <br />
               right hon. f1iend is giving to the state the 
               <br />
               control of the education of the child, and

               it the Catholic minority in the Northwest

               <br />
               education which it provides, then they will 
               <br />
               have to pay out of their own pockets for 
               <br />
               private education, and at the same time 
               <br />
               pay taxes to support the state educa-
