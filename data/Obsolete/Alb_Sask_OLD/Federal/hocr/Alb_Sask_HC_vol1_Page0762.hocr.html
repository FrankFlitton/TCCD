               be adduced from this teaching of our history ‘! 
               <br />
               The lesson we should deduce is that it it was a 
               <br />
               wise provision to establish this power in the 
               <br />
               constitution for the supervision of the local 
               <br />
               legislatures, perhaps it was dictated by unmixed 
               <br />
               wisdom. For, Sir, experience has taught us 
               <br />
               that this remedy of interference with local 
               <br />
               legislation has never been applied and prob- 
               <br />
               ably never can be applied without friction, dis- 
               <br />
               turbance and discontent; that you cannot ap- 
               <br />
               ply that remedy without causing as much dis- 
               <br />
               satisfaction as satisfaction.
