               school question, given in 1872, and which 
               <br />
               has been our guide there ever since. And 
               <br />
               in that judgment the court declared, con-

               argument of the hon. gentleman. In the

               speech which I had the honour to deliver 
               <br />
               on the second reading of this Bill, I thought 
               <br />
               I had made this point perfectly clear, but 
               <br />
               inasmuch as some hon. members evidently 
               <br />

               I thought it would not be at all out of place

               <br />
