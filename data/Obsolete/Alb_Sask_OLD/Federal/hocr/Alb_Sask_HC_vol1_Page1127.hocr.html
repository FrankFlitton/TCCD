               went- to the imperial authorities it was

               to explain why the imperial parliament

               <br />

               of the Crown in 1871, expressed at a time 
               <br />
               when the ink was scarcely dry on the Act 
               <br />

               Sir John Coleridge; these were the men 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               2, 22 and 30 of the Manitoba Act. I think

               Let me draw your attention to the fact 
               <br />
               that when section 22 of this Manitoba Act 
               <br />
               was enacted for the special protection 
               <br />
               of the minority in Manitoba, there 
               <br />
               was no word of criticism in this House 
               <br />
               or in the great newspapers of those days— 
               <br />
               then the ‘Globe’ was edited by George 
               <br />
               Brown, no word raised against the action 
               <br />
               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span> which at that time was 
               <br />
               seeking to give to the minority of 
               <br />
               Manitoba the very guarantee with respect to 
               <br />
               education which we' are now trying 
               <br />
               to give to the minority of the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories. Surely it will not be argued 
               <br />
               that there was no word of protest raised 
               <br />
               at that time because it was then thought 
               <br />
               that Manitoba was to be a French preserve.

               but it is almost certain that we could not.

               Undoubtedly not. A delegated power once

               liament to Her Majesty, and once exercised 
               <br />
               that power was exhausted. Could we do it 
               <br />
               under the Order in Council of 1870? Un- 
               <br />
               doubtedly not, because there is another prin-

               ciple of law which is equally certain with
