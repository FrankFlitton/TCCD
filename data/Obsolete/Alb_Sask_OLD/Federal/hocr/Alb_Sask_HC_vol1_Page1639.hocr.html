               You see practically the same discrepancy, 
               <br />

               lation between the lowest and the highest, 
               <br />
               there does seem to be no principle based 
               <br />
               on population, to which you can attribute 
               <br />
               the preparation of these tidings. Perhaps 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman will do me the 
               <br />
               kindness to state now how it is that we 
               <br />
               have these extraordinary discrepancies upon 
               <br />
               the list which I have before me; and as to 
               <br />
               the ﬁgures, there is not any great dispute be- 
               <br />
               tween the hon. members on this side of the 
               <br />
               House and those on that side of the House. 
               <br />
               Now that is the situation as it strikes me at 
               <br />
               present. In dealing with these constituen- 
               <br />
               cies it seems to me that we ought to have re— 
               <br />
               gard, in the ﬁrst place, as I said before, to 
               <br />
               this prime question : Can we possibly have 
               <br />
               in this committee the information which is 
               <br />
               necessary to make a fair and just distribu- 
               <br />
               tion of the ridings in these two provinces ? 
               <br />
               I do not think so. I have read the debates 
               <br />
               with a great deal of care, and I do not think 
               <br />
               that this House possesses any such informa- 
               <br />
               tion as should be before us for that purpose. 
               <br />
               The very circumstance that hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               on that side of the House, and hon. gentle-

               no doubt in both cases with the utmost good

               cilable conclusions, seems to me a strong

               <br />
               information, if these discrepancies have not 
               <br />
               already impressed themselves upon his atten- 
               <br />
               tion. We ought to conclude that this 
               <br />
               division can be much better done by 
               <br />
               an independent body having the means of 
               <br />
               investigation which I have referred to; 
               <br />
               and if the government does not adopt that 
               <br />
               very reasonable principle, that very fair 
               <br />
               conclusion, then it seems to me that some 
               <br />
               principle should be stated which would be 
               <br />
               applicable both to the province of Alberta 
               <br />
               and to the province .of Saskatchewan, and 
               <br />
               upon which the government can show that 
               <br />
               they have acted in delimiting the ridings 
               <br />
               which are contained in the schedules to both 
               <br />
               Acts. Now I understand that the principle 
               <br />
               which has been stated from :the other side 
               <br />
               of the House with regard to the province of 
               <br />
               Alberta produces the most extraordinary 
               <br />
               results when applied to the province of 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan, as was set forth in the 
               <br />
               speech of my hon. friend from Qp’Appelle 
               <br />
               (Mr. Lake). It does not seem that the prin- 
               <br />
               ciple which was put forward and which was 
               <br />
               illustrated by my hon. friend from Qu’Ap- 
               <br />
               pelle can really be the principle upon which 
               <br />
               the government has proceeded. It has been 
               <br />
               suggested .that the ridings have been de- 
               <br />
               limited, and that a principle is now sought 
               <br />
               for the purpose of supporting that division. 
               <br />
               I do not suggest this, but if any such 
               <br />
               course has been pursued, it is obviously 
               <br />
               not a proper and ﬂair course. Some prin— 
               <br />
               ciple should be adopted, and a very proper 
               <br />
               principle I think is to adopt a principle 
               <br />
               and have it carried out, a commission of 
               <br />
               judges or to a commission of independent 
               <br />
               and trustworthy persons. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">If</span> that principle 
               <br />
               is not adopted, then surely it lies with the 
               <br />
               government to show the principle upon 
               <br />
               which they have acted and to apply that 
               <br />
               principle without fear or favour, not only 
               <br />
               to the province of Alberta, but to the pro—
