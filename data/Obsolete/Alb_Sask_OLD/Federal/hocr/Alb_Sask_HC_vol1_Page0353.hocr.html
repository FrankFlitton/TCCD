               fore the assembly and unanimously endorsed 
               <br />
               by them. The only dissenting voice was in 
               <br />
               reference to the question whether there 
               <br />
               should be one or two provinces. In regard 
               <br />
               to every other detail the Bill was endorsed 
               <br />
               with unanimity. On the 21st of May, 1902, 
               <br />
               a general election <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> held throughout the

               Territories and the question of autonomy

               Bill was distributed throughout the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whole.</span>

               ple by the premier and by other gentlemen 
               <br />
               who were supporting him in that election 
               <br />
               in these words : ‘ These are the matters up- 
               <br />
               on which your judgment is invited. The 
               <br />
               issue is plain: it is for the people of the

               The people of the Territories did <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">decidel</span>

               overwhelming majority. In spite of this 
               <br />
               fact a great many excuses were made by

               the Dominion government for delay in deal- 
               <br />
               ing with the question. Two more sessions 
               <br />
               of the legislative assembly were held and 
               <br />
               in 'each one of these sessions a resolution 
               <br />
               demanding that this question be taken up 
               <br />
               was passed unanimously, being voted for 
               <br />
               by both Liberals and Conservatives. There 
               <br />
               was no dissentient voice on either occasion, 
               <br />
               but still the matter was not taken up by the 
               <br />
               Dominion government. During the session 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1904,</span> when it was again probable that 
               <br />
               the demand would be repeated, we suddenly

               received the well known letter from the 
               <br />

               of the present year. The premier of the

               Territories and a member of his executive 
               <br />
               council attended the meeting. I wish to say 
               <br />
               here that as far as my information goes, 
               <br />
               there was no change in the conditions which 
               <br />
               Mr. Haultaiu demanded from the Prime

               Mr. Haultain. It is inconceivable that

               if he disagrees with his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">colleagues</span> on such

               the fact remains, that he is still a mem-

               <br />
               also gone into this history to show that two

               Dominion general elections have been held 
               <br />
               since this matter was placed before the 
               <br />
               Dominion government. The government 
               <br />
               refused to act or deﬁne their policy in any 
               <br />
               particular during the Whole lifetime of one 
               <br />
               parliament. More than that, when another 
               <br />
               appeal to the people became imminent they 
               <br />
               refused to deﬁne their policy before the elec-

               positions before them for three years they 
               <br />
               were not prepared to declare themselves in 
               <br />
               any respect. The hon ex—Minister of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               in regard to this matter he refused to com-

               <br />
               shall mention just now, but on all the main

               points in connection with the draft Bill
