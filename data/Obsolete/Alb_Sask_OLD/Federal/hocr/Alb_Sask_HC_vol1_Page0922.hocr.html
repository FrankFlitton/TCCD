               <br />
               like to ask the hon. gentleman if he is aware

               Mr. BRODER. That has been the law for 
               <br />
               so long that I thought everybody knew it. 
               <br />
               I did not make any distinction. I was 
               <br />
               speaking of the fact. Of course the public 
               <br />
               school is common to everybody as well as 
               <br />
               the high school or collegiate institute, but 
               <br />
               the point I was making was this, that, in 
               <br />
               the collegiate institutes and high schools of 
               <br />
               the English province of Ontario, there are 
               <br />
               33,595 pupils studying the French language. 
               <br />
               That does not look as if there were a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pre</span> 
               <br />
               judice against the French people. When 
               <br />
               you come to sift matters you will ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               Ontario’s tolerance is as broad as anybody’s 
               <br />
               tolerance, and there are none who know that 
               <br />
