               pledges in regard to the legislative council. 
               <br />

               Abolish the legislative council and your

               responsible for the agitation which we had

               refer to a statement that was made by the

               choose, if we deny them the right to select for 
               <br />
               themselves, then, when the day comes, as it 
               <br />
               must before long, when some part of the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories will ask for admission and be entitled 
               <br />
               by their population and position to have this 
               <br />
               clause enacted, then this parliament would be 
               <br />
               bound to repeal the law, otherwise We should 
               <br />
               be, as I say, riveting the system of separate 
               <br />
               Schools upon them. This point I think a most 
               <br />
               important one.

               There was a long discussion in regard to 
               <br />
               the motion of the late Dalton McCarthy to 
               <br />
               give the power to the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               to abolish their system of separate schools, 
               <br />
               but the position taken by Sir John Thomp— 
               <br />
               son was as I have just read and we know 
               <br />
               the result of the vote. The vote was 114to 
               <br />
               21. It was considered not wise to change 
               <br />
               the conditions that existed in those Territor- 
               <br />
               ies and why? Largely because in 1875 
               <br />
               when the Northwest Territories Act was 
               <br />
               framed, it was conceded that we were put- 
               <br />
               ting this clause in so that the people who 
               <br />
               were coming into those Territories might 
               <br />
               know exactly what the laws would be in 
               <br />
               the Territories in regard .to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘their</span> schools. 
               <br />
               It is suggested now by some that we wipe 
               <br />
               out these rights absolutely. It is suggested 
               <br />
               by others that we leave it entirely to the 
               <br />
               provinces to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deal,</span> with; but the position 
               <br />
               taken as I say in 1894 was that it was wise 
               <br />
               to leave it Just as it stood at that time, and 
               <br />
               when the provinces were to be created the
