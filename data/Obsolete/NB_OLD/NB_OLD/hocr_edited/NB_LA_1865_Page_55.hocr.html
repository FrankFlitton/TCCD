<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might</span> have been informed on the

by a full discussion of it ? The hon. mem-<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ber</span> for St. John says, there are

and tricksters, and schemers all around <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />

But I should like to know who were the<br />
plotters in Ireland in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1848 ?</span>
Perhaps if<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
he were to go Home as one ol the dele-<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gates,</span> he would be well known by

maybe that would be as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">good</span> a
way as<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
any to cut off some of these plotters and<br />
schemers. I think we should have heard <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
less about plotters if some hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentlemen</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
had stayed in the home of their fathers. I<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
was born in this country, and I remember<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
when there were not more than fifty<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
houses on the upper St. John, and they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
were the homes of those who have made<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
the bone and sinew of the country. But<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
new comers step in and take it upon <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">themselves</span> to call our people
plotters and<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schemers ;</span> the very men who are
uphold-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
ing the rights and interests of the Pro-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vince </span>are thus called. The
majority of<br />
votes east in opposition to Confederation<br />
were by men who are not natives of this <br />
Province ; but I think a short time will <br />
suffice to convince many of them that they <br />
were in error,—many of them are so al- <br />
ready. The reason why I speak <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strongly</span><br />
on this subject is that I am strongly in<br />
favor of Confederation, and so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terms</span> may be applied to me. But
even<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
though the question comes up before this<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">again, and</span> fail to he

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will not</span> rebel,—as it was said on
the<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />

carried, those who opposed it would<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rebelled.</span> Why, this
question of Con-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
federation was urged on the old colonies<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by Benjamin</span> Franklin, and why did

mention the name of the Hon. Joseph<br />
Howe, of Nova Scotia, and the Hon. J.<br />
A. MacDonald, of Canada. I think we<br />
need not look upon ourselves as so very<br />
diminutive ; we have men who have gone<br />
away from us and became famous. Look<br />
at the Inglis, of Nova Scotia, and General<br />
Williams, of Kars. I have no doubt that<br />
the hon. President of the Council and the<br />
hon. membrr for St. John, (Mr. Anglin),<br />
will be appointed delegates to go home,<br />
and show the people of England what a<br />
great wrong they intend to inflict upon<br />
us. And yet I hope there will be some<br />
means by which we shall be able to show<br />
the British Government that there was a<br />
very large minority in favor of Confedera-<br />
tion, and that it has been stated that the<br />
people have not had a fair chance to test<br />
the question. I believe the not getting<br />
it has already shown that we should have<br />
been financially and commercially better<br />
off it we had got it. I believe that the<br />
great minority will not be over-ridden by<br />
the delegates who go home. The Govern-<br />
ment are the patriots now ; they hold the<br />
interests of the people in their hands,<br />
they guide the ship of State, and should<br />
keep it off the shoals in time of peril. We<br />
shall see what they can do in managing<br />
the affairs of a country with 250,000 in-<br />
habitants, less than many towns in Eng-<br />
land. In Nova Scotia the question is in<br />
abeyance ; but I hope that it will be de-<br />
cided favorably. In Lower Canada there<br />
was but a small minority in opposition to<br />
the Scheme, and that was led by Mr.<br />
Dorion, the leader of the Rouge party.<br />
I oppose the delegation now, because I<br />
believe it will be useless. I happen to<br />
know that it will have no effect there. I<br />
will now close by quoting the opinion of<br />
a great Colonist, (General Williams), ex-<br />

would be injurious to the best interests of<br />
these Colonies, and recommends that a<br />
delegation proceed to England to force<br />
that idea on the ministry of that country.<br />
I have listened with a great deal of atten-<br />
tention, and I may say patience too, to<br />
the long address of the hon. member from<br />
the County of Carleton. He says he has<br />
given this subject his attention prior to<br />
the elections, and turned it over, and re-<br />
volved it in what he is pleased to term<br />
his mind, and come to the conclusion that<br />
it will be beneficial. I have listened ,<br />
willing to be convinced, ready to yield<br />
to reason whether it comes from a friend or<br />
an opponent ; and I must confess I have not<br />
discovered anything to lead me to believe<br />
that his premises are correct. When, in<br />
the early part of Session, we had un-<br />
der discussion the the Governor's Speech, I<br />
took occasion to express my disappoint-<br />
ment at the policy which the Government<br />
were pleased to set forth in that Speech, I<br />
not in reference to a Union of the Colo-<br />
nies, but in reference to the great public<br />
works which should have been taken up. I<br />
said I regretted that the Government was<br />
not formed on any defined policy. I then<br />
expressed my desire and intention to give<br />
them my support so far as they introduc-<br />
ed measures which I believed for the good<br />
of the country. Not taking my position<br />
as a tame follower, or servile supporter<br />
of the Government, I have supported<br />
them when their measures were good, and<br />
opposed them when I considered they<br />
were not so. On the Militia Bill I oppos-<br />
ed them, as I thought the money could be<br />
better expended. The Post Office Bill I<br />
supported, thinking it would save some<br />
$3,000 or $4,000 a-year to the country.<br />
I supported the Treasury Note Bill also,<br />
because I believed it would be the means<br />
of saving a large amount of money to the<br />
country. And now lest the people might<br />
misconstrue my position on Confedera-<br />
tion, I desire to express my opinions on<br />
these Resolutions, so that I may not be<br />
misinterpreted or misunderstood by my<br />
constituents on a question, the greatest<br />
that ever came before this House. I say<br />
it is of great importance, and therefore<br />
we feel a deep regret that we are called<br />
on to discuss it, for it has not grown out<br />
of our wants, but of the local necessities<br />
of Canada</span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—out of the differences which<br />
