<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delayed</span> this matter it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might</span> cost them <br />
trouble, for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parties</span> who paid

<br />
it, and those officers must be protected, <br />
which would cause a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expense</span> to this <br />
country. But they say it is not Consti- <br />
tutional to pass an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex</span> post

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there could be any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thing</span> in the Constitu- <br />

hundreds of <br />
laws in England, and hundreds of laws in <br />
our own country that are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex</span> post
facto. <br />
The only thing that can be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said</span>
is, that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> <br />
is exceptional legislation, and done only <br />
in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extreme</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cases,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">when</span>
the exigencies of <br />
the case <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">requires</span> it. If it was
unconsti- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tutional</span> it never could be done.
This <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature</span> has the power to pass
this <br />
Bill, and after they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pass</span> it the
Bill be- <br />
comes law and cannot be unconstitutional. <br />
If the House is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">going</span> to pass
this Bill to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legalize</span> the collection of export

public interest, that no wrong <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span>
be <br />
done to the people. A great deal of this <br />
money would go into the pockets of the <br />
men who shipped the deals, and would be <br />
a clear profit to them. That money when <br />
paid, was considered to have been paid ac- <br />
cording to law. No man will pay this export <br />
duty now, and if they delayed the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">passage</span>
<br />
of this law it would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">open</span> a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">door</span> for itiga- <br />

This money does not belong to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shipper.</span>
<br />
If it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">belongs</span> to any one but the
Province, <br />
it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">belongs</span> to everyone that has
been con- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cerned</span> in the transaction ; and
it would <br />
be impossible, by any means, to divide <br />
that money among them all. This export <br />
duty is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">put on</span> in the place of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stumpage</span>.<br />
Suppose a man cut logs on your farm with- <br />
out an agreement to pay <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stumpage.</span>
If <br />
you could obtain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stumpage</span> it
would be <br />
doing that man no wrong. The law, it <br />
appears, is a Revenue Bill, but it is in lieu <br />
of stumpage. He had no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interest</span>
in the <br />
matter, but he wished to have it settled. <br />
This oversight was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">very much to be

to <br />
blame he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> take his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">share,</span> for it was <br />
as much his business as it was the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">busi-</span>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">LINDSAY</span>
said it was admitted by <br />
a member of the Government that they <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">knew</span> of it in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">September.</span> Why, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">then,</span> <br />
was not this Bill brought in the first day <br />

would not <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taken</span> up until the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Address</span> had <br />

that this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">law</span> <br />
had expired, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consequence</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">being</span> over- <br />

he would have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">given</span> them credit

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lost</span> in <br />

</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MR. KERR</span>
said it was very evident that <br />
every <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Deputy</span> Treasurer was
liable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to have</span> <br />
on action brought against him for money <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">received</span> as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">export duty,</span> if they delayed <br />
the passage of this Bill, for in many parts <br />
of' the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Province</span> there may be
parties who <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">think</span> they are hardly dealt with,
and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discovering</span> that something had <br />
been done contrary to law, may bring an <br />
action against the officers of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern-</span>
<br />
ment to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recover</span> their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">money.</span> The pas- <br />
sage of this Bill will not be the cause of <br />
any hardship to any individual. A retro- <br />
spective law in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">punish</span> a man <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might</span> be <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">considered</span> a hardship, but this
law to <br />
continue another law will do injustice to <br />
none. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. L. P. W. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">DESBRISAY</span> said he <br />
took a. different view in regard to this <br />
from any he had heard expressed. He <br />
was against any export duty whatever, <br />
for it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> his opinion that no
expert duty <br />
should be imposed upon lumber shipped <br />
in this Province. He had always intend- <br />
ed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">when</span> a Bill came before them
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revive</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> law to oppose it. This
country <br />
ought not to trammel the exportation of <br />
lumber by imposing an export duty at all. <br />
It is said that is in the place of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stumpage,</span>
<br />
but we have to pay mileage in place of <br />
stump<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">age ;</span> we have to pay our £20
a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mile</span> <br />
for the ground on which we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lumber,</span>
be- <br />
sides the export duty. It was very well <br />
to hear one side of the story, but he could <br />
tell them of men who had shipped lumber <br />
for the last four years, and had received <br />
half price for it, and he would ask whether <br />
it would be a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dishonor</span> for those
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">men</span> to <br />
take the export duty. The hon. member <br />
of the Government may speak of the £1100 <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he has</span> paid, but he stands in a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> <br />
position from the lumber merchant. He <br />
is a broker, and does not give <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his</span>
eighteen <br />
months credit, as other men in the coun- <br />
try do ; he receives an order from the <br />
other side of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Atlantic,</span> and
he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fills</span> it.<br />
That law ought to exempt logs cut on<br />
private lands. He would oppose this<br />

ist, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> would not only be a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">benefit</span> to<br />

was no time just now to create difficulties <br />

A <br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">together</span> to remedy the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">defect,</span> and called <br />
again five or six <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">weeks</span> after to transact <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">business</span>
of the Session. He then <br />
mentioned a case which had occurred <br />
some time ago, in which money had been <br />
paid by individuals who alleged <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span>
had <br />
no right to pay <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> The
controversy went <br />
on for some time, but after a calm review <br />
of the matter the principal and interest <br />
had to be repaid. If, after due consider- <br />
ation, we ﬁnd we have the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">right</span>
to retain <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this money,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> had better <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exercise</span> that <br />
right ; but if it be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wrong</span> in

do so, then no money consideration <br />

and if they paid him the money back, it <br />
would not be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his</span> money, and if
