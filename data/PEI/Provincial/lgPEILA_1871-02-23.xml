     Con<lb break="no"/>federation had been discussed in the same<lb/>manner, and before that question had been<lb/>before the people, they pronounced against it ;<lb/>the consequence was there was not now an avow<lb break="no"/>ed Confederate in the House. It was proba<lb break="no"/>ble that the people would oppose the Railway<lb/>Question just as strongly as they had opposed<lb/>Confederation ; and if they did so, he believed<lb/>the Government would not carry out the<lb/>scheme without their consent.

     <persName ref="pers:DAVI2">Hon. B. DAVIES</persName>.â€”It will require an 
     <lb/>
    addition of eight per cent to our present 
     <lb/>tariff to provide for the interest on the cost 
     <lb/>of the raiIway, and that is only the com<lb break="no"/>mencement. How are Souris and St. 
     <lb/>Peter's to get branch lines, supposing the 
     <lb/>trunk line is constructed. We find it diffi<lb break="no"/>cult to keep up our present roads and 
     <lb/>bridges, and we shall get so much in debt 
     <lb/>that I fear our liberties may be lost. This 
     <lb/>scheme is intended to pave the way to 
     <lb/>Confederation; for, once let Our tariff 
     <lb/>be as high as that of Canada, no voice will 
     <lb/>be raised against our union with that coun<lb break="no"/>try.<lb/>

            <p>[<persName ref="pers:LEFU2">Mr. Lefurgy</persName>] I am glad 
     <lb/>to think that this matter has been brought 
     <lb/>under our notice, but cannot see what pos<lb break="no"/>sible connection can be traced between it and 
     <lb/>Confederation. I have been called a Con<lb break="no"/>federate,for what reason I know not,nnless 
     <lb/>it be that I am in the habit of buying flour 
     <lb/>from some of the Canadians. I do not 
     <lb/>think that the Government has any idea of 
     <lb/>bringing us into Confederation by building 
     <lb/>a railway .
