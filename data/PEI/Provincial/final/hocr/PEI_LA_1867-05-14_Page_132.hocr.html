If a foreign</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-11-743"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-12-743">invasion was to take place, or was likely to happen it</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-13-569"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-14-569">would be different; every man would then be in earnest,</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-15-13"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-16-13">and would feel it to be a please and a duty to do all in</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-17-507"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-18-508">his power for the defence of the country. But at present</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-19-129"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-20-129">there was no more necessity for anything of the kind,</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-21-47"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-22-47">than there was for our getting alarmed at the telegram</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-23-622"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-24-622">read by the hon. member for Murray Harbor. The terror</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-25-236"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-26-236">of Fenianism must not frighten us into foolish acts. As</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-27-857"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-28-857">to the Bill, he thought hon, members opposite were under</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-29-415"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-30-415">a mistake, and had been fighting with a phantom. The</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-31-106"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-32-106">Bill brought down by the Government last year had been</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-33-393"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-34-394">amended in committee, and surely members of the Gov-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-35-741"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-36-741">ernment might submit an amendment to this one. It</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-37-10"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-38-10">had been said that indifference on the part of the Gov-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-39-805"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-40-805">ernment in this matter might be usual as an argument for</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-41-293"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-42-293">Confederation. The Government had not shown indif-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-43-729"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-44-729">ference on military matters. They intended to support the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-45-946"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-46-947">volunteers, and this they had made manifest in the appro-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-47-994"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-48-994">priation for that service. Before the general election the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-49-45"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-50-45">late Government were going to do something for the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-51-599"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-52-599">volunteers, but these becoming offended. threatened their</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-53-725"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-54-725">representative or the Government with their opposition.</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-55-60"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-56-60">Again if the Commander-in-Chief did that they considered</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-57-587"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-58-587">not fully right, they would not retain their arms. Men so</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-59-646"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-60-646">acting lost respect for themselves. IT was too much like</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-61-909"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-62-909">a Bull's Run affair. He hoped, bye-and-bye, that the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-63-453"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-64-453">Volunteers would do better than to throw down</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-65-586"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-66-587">their arms one day and take them up another. As to</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-67-352"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-68-352">the exemption from statute labor, it was but three shill-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-69-831"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-70-831">ings a year, and was not a matter worth an exemption.</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-71-733"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-72-733">If the bulk of the people on a road in the winter were</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-73-158"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-74-158">exempted, there would not be enough to turn out to break</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-75-510"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-76-511">the roads, and travelling for a time might be entirely</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-77-763"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-78-763">stopped.
