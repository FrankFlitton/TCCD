  to refer) seceded from it. The Government, by thus<lb/>
  taking care that the parliamentay opposition or minority<lb/>
  should be fairly represented at the Conference, shewed<lb/>
  that they had no intention of making the Confederation<lb/>
  question a party one. The Governments of the other<lb/>
  Provinces acted in the same fair and impartial manner;<lb/>
  and men of every party and of the most conflicting<lb/>
  political opinions were brought together in the Confer-<lb/>
  ence, for the purpose of considering whether, measures<lb/>
  could not be devised for the greater security of our<lb/>
  free institutions, for the consolidation of British power<lb/>
  in these Provinces, and for the more thorough establish-<lb/>
  ment and perpetuation therein of the ennobling and<lb/>
  invigorating principles of the British Constitution.<lb/>
  Well, indeed, might the Hon. the Leader of the Oppo-<lb/>
  sition (Mr. Coles) say of the result of that Conference,<lb/>
  as he did at Ottawa, that "he thought they (the Dele-<lb/>
  gates) had reason to congratulate themselves upon the<lb/>
  labours of the Conference. That thirty-three men,<lb/>
  representing the various political opinions of six differ-<lb/>
  ent Provinces, could have assembled, and so amalga-<lb/>
  mated their opinions as to agree upon a Constitution,<lb/>
  suited for that great Confederation, was something, he<lb/>
  believed, such as the world had never seen before, and<lb/>
  shewed that the Delegates were worthy of the position<lb/>
  they held. He said this although there was no man<lb/>
  more disappointed than himself with regard to some<lb/>
  parts of that constitution; <i>but, by mutual concessions,<lb/>
  they had arrived at a result which they could all agree<lb/>
  in supporting and submitting to the people; for he held<lb/>
  that it must be submitted to the people. They must<lb/>
  not force it on the people; they must endeavour to show<lb/>
  them that it is for their benefit, and thus induce them to<lb/>
   accept it."</i> The harmonious and happy result of the<lb/>
  Quebec Conference had, by the Hon. the Leader of the<lb/>
  Opposition, been very justly attributed, in a consider-<lb/>
  able measure, to liberal and wise concessions and com-<lb/>
  promise of individual opinions on the part of the several<lb/>
  Delegates engaged in that Conference. He himself,<lb/>
  as well as that hon gentleman, had, for the sake of<lb/>
  harmony and the general good, foregone some of his<lb/>
  own opinions in that important Convention. For in-<lb/>
  stance, he was strongly impressed with the opinion<lb/>
  that, as in the Senate of the United States, all the<lb/>
  sections of the Confederation should be equally repre-<lb/>
  sented in the Upper House—that the greatest in terri-<lb/>
  torial extent and population, should not, in tht branch<lb/>
  of the Federal Legislature, be allowed a greater num-<lb/>
  ber of representatives, than any of the smaller or less<lb/>
  populous sections; and, in the Conference, he urged<lb/>
  his opinion to that effect; but, finding, from the strong<lb/>
  opposition which was made to it, that, if he continued<lb/>
  to press it, his doing so would not only retard the pro-<lb/>
  gress of the Convention towards a solution of the<lb/>
  great problem under their consideration, but might<lb/>
  even, in some considerable degree, mar the result of<lb/>
  their deliberations, he forbore to insist upon it. Con-<lb/>
  cession and compromise were necessary, not only to<lb/>
  the formation, but to the good and efficient working,<lb/>
  of every system of free government. They were not<lb/>
  only necessary in the formation and maintenance of<lb/>
  the governments of free states, but in that of every<lb/>
  association for general purposes or mutual benefit; in<lb/>
  that of banking companies, and all other such corporate<lb/>
  bodies; nay, even in domestic government, for it was<lb/>
  well known that peace and harmony of action could never<lb/>
  prevail or be secured in any family, independently of<lb/>
 <cb/>
  mutual concessions on the part of husband, wife and<lb/>
  children. The projected Confederation, continued the<lb/>
  hon. and learned gentleman, had not been taken up<lb/>
  as a Government question in any of the Provinces;<lb/>
  neither could it, in any of them, have been so<lb/>
  brought forward without a gross violation constitutional<lb/>
  principles: for not one of the Governments then exist-<lb/>
  ing in the Provinces had attained its position thorough<lb/>
  the support of a parliamentary majority, elected by<lb/>
  the people directly for the purpose of either entertain-<lb/>
  ing the question of Confederation, or of deciding con-<lb/>
  cerning it in any way. He then, at some length, fav-<lb/>
  ourably reviewed the proceedings concerning the<lb/>
  question which had taken place in Nova Scotia;<lb/>
  and, in noticing the imputations of dishonesty and<lb/>
  treachery which Nova Scotian anti-Confederates had<lb/>
  so freely thrown out against the Hon. Mr. Tilley, for<lb/>
  the course which he had pursued with respect to it, he<lb/>
  fully justified the conduct of that hon. gentleman, and<lb/>
  declared that, notwithstand all the base calumnies<lb/>
  which had been directed against him, there was not<lb/>
  a blot upon his escutcheon. He (Hon. Haviland),<lb/>
  then entered into a pretty full recapitulation and review<lb/>
  of the parliamentary and government proceedings, for<lb/>
  and against Confederation, in New Brunswick, and con-<lb/>
  cluded that part of his speech by saying, that the dis-<lb/>
  solving of the Assembly, on that question, in that Pro-<lb/>
  vince, by Governor Gordon, in opposition to the views<lb/>
  of his Cabinet, although an extreme exercise of the<lb/>
  prerogative with which, as Her Majesty's Representa-<lb/>
  tive, he was clothed, had yet been justified by the result.<lb/>
  That arbitrary and unconstitutional proceeding, as it<lb/>
  had been called, of Governor Gordon, had been com-<lb/>
  mented upon with very great severity by our Island<lb/>
  anti-Confederates; but he begged leave to remind them<lb/>
  that a similar gubernatorial proceeding here, some years<lb/>
  ago, had, by some of those anti-Confederates, been<lb/>
  lauded and extolled as an act of most dignified, patriotic,<lb/>
  and constitutional independence. He alluded to the<lb/>
  time when Governor Bannerman, in opposition to, and<lb/>
  in contempt of, the advice of his Council—although<lb/>
  that Council was sustained by a large and respectable<lb/>
  majority of the parliamentary representatives of the<lb/>
  people—dissolved the Assembly, and called a new<lb/>
  election. The result, in that case, having proved<lb/>
  quite satisfactory to those who had laboured to induce<lb/>
  the Governor to exercise the prerogative in so unusual<lb/>
  a manner, great were their exultation and rejoicing<lb/>
  thereat, and scarcely ever had it been referred to since,<lb/>
  but the recollection of it had called forth from them a<lb/>
  jubilant peal of their bells. When further comment-<lb/>
  ing upon the recent changes in political sentiments, in<lb/>
  New Brunswick, which were attributable to the agita-<lb/>
  tion of the Confederation Question in that Province,<lb/>
  the hon. and learned gentleman pronounced the highest<lb/>
  eulogium upon the Hon. Mr. Wilmot, whose character,<lb/>
  he said, was above suspicion, and who, in the noblest<lb/>
  and most disinterested spirit of patriotism, seeing that,<lb/>
  if the peoples of these Provinces desired to retain their<lb/>
  free institutions, to preserve to themselves, and trans-<lb/>
  mit to their posterity, the principles and blessings of<lb/>
  Britain's glorious Constitution, and to have her glorious<lb/>
  and protecting flag to continue to wave over them, they<lb/>
  must strengthen their loosely existing fraternal relations<lb/>
  by the stronger and firmer bonds of a federal union,<lb/>
  he had cast from him the trammels of office, had resigned<lb/>
  his seat in the cabinet, and nobly stood forward as one<lb/>
