In the British Parliament, it was</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-241-923"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-242-924">never found that, upon important questions, one member of</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-243-163"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-244-164">the Administration voted in one way, and another, in an-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-245-381"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-246-381">other. It was said by those who argued in favour of Con-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-247-501"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-248-501">federation, that if we valued British institutions, if we</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-249-709"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-250-709">valued our rights and privileges as British subjects, we</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-251-937"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-252-937">would accede to Confederation. He, however, maintained</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-253-183"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-254-183">that were we to become a member of the projected Union,</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-265-137"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-266-137">we would actually be deprived of all these, and retrograde</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-255-435"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-256-435">a century. Confederation, instead of being a means of bind-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-257-662"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-258-662">ing us more closely and indissolubly to the British Crown,</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-259-864"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-260-864">would, eventually, be the cause of our separation from it.</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-267-745"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-268-745">The moment the Upper House should come into collision</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-269-958"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-270-958">with the Lower House, some extreme measure would be had</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-271-142"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-272-142">recourse to. Should we, however, remain as we were, we</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-273-346"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-274-346">would be safe. If we entered into Confederation, we would</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-275-568"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-276-568">be much more in danger of quarreling with the United</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-285-278"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-286-278">States than we are now.

The glory argument was, that,</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-281-269"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-282-269">by confederating with Canada and the other Provinces, we</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-283-25"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-284-25">should become part and parcel of a great nation ; byt the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-261-84"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-262-84">people of Prince Edward Island knew themselves to be al-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-263-284"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-264-284">ready part and parcel of a great nation, and they had no</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-287-999"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-288-999">desire to belong to any other.
