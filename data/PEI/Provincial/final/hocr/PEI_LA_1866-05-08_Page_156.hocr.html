  —he had never, even when they were the supreme<lb/>
  dispensers of place and emoluments, urged upon their<lb/>
  attention a recognition of his services, with a view to<lb/>
  exacting at their hands any thing like a pecuniary<lb/>
  recompense for them; and neither had he received any<lb/>
  such recompense, except that might be said to be so,<lb/>
  which had recently been bestowed upon him, in a salary<lb/>
  of £200 a year, for his professional services, as Solicitor<lb/>
  General. No one could be actuated by a more disin-<lb/>
  terested and patriotic regard for the good of his country<lb/>
  than he was, and had, he was bold to say, throughout<lb/>
  the whole period of his public career, proved himself<lb/>
  to be. An impartial review of his past public life,<lb/>
  was, he felt confident, sufficient to exonerate him from<lb/>
  every charge of venality and corruption; and, in the<lb/>
  sacred ties of his home, he could, in the persons of his<lb/>
  children, three sons and three daughters, point to the<lb/>
  surest pledges of his fidelity and devotion; to the in-<lb/>
  terests to his country; for, than the present and future<lb/>
  <cb/>
  welfare and happiness of his children, nothing, save<lb/>
  the holy obligations of duty and rectitude of life, could<lb/>
  be dearer to his affections, or more precious in his esti-<lb/>
  mation; and that welfare and that happiness, he was<lb/>
  deeply and firmly persuaded, could not, by any means<lb/>
  to which it was possible for him to have recourse, be<lb/>
  so likely to insure to them, as by steadfast adherence<lb/>
  to the principles and practice of social morality and<lb/>
  public integrity. The hon. and learned gentleman<lb/>
  then, in proceeding to the close of his speech, gave<lb/>
  additional effect to his own arguments in favor of Con-<lb/>
  federation, by citing the sentiments concerning it of<lb/>
  Lord Durham and Mr. Charles Bulwer, and of Mr.<lb/>
  Oliphant, the private Secretary of Lord Elgin; and,<lb/>
  after having favourably commented thereon at some<lb/>
  length, concluded by again simply saying he would<lb/>
  support the amendment submitted by the hon. member<lb/>
  for St. Peter's (Hon. Mr. Whelan).<lb/>
