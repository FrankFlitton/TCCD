The hon member who last spoke, has, I understand,</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-36-581"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-37-581">declared his views on the Union scheme at a public meeting ;</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-38-452"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-39-453">and after expressing himself as decidedly opposed to it, I am</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-40-201"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-41-201">astonished that he, as a member of the Government, should give</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-42-710"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-43-710">his sanction to the appointment of a gentlemen to be one of his</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-44-57"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-45-57">colleagues, who has announced himself to be a "red-hot</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-46-179"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-47-180">Unionist." I contend that it was the duty of the Government</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-48-524"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-49-524">to declare their principles, and then appeal to the people at once,</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-50-166"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-51-166">and not to wait until the House was in Session some time before</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-52-763"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-53-764">they agreed upon their policy--then perhaps only to put off the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-54-182"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-55-183">question. In Canada they deemed the matter of such importantance</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-56-520"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-57-521">as to grapple with it at the very opening of the Session. If we</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-58-599"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-59-599">should delay giving a decision upon the question here until the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-60-677"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-61-678">House dies out, it will not be treating the Canadians fairly, who</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-62-51"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-63-52">are desirous to have the measure carried immediately into effect.</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-64-593"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-65-594">It was the duty of the Government, instead of acting as they have</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-66-805"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-67-805">done, to have aimed at leading public opinion, and then taken</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-68-679"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-69-679">the case to the polls. It is a very easy course for a Government</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-70-954"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-71-954">to pursue, merely to slip along without advancing their views on</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-72-292"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-73-293">questions of the greatest importance to the country. There is</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-74-623"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-75-624">another subject occupying a share of public attention-- a Union</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-76-697"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-77-697">of a different description to that under consideration, which has</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-78-972"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-79-972">been passed over in silence in His Excellency's speech. I</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-80-574"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-81-574">allude to the Tenant Union, and I am partly disposed to censure</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-82-241"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-83-241">the Government for not declaring their sentiments in reference to</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-84-133"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-85-133">this organization, as its principles may have to be tested at the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-86-511"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-87-511">next general election. But I will not enter into that</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-1-238"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-2-238">subject now. The Government of New Brunswick have</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-3-113"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-4-113">taken decided action on the question of Union ; Hon Mr Tilley</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-5-86"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-6-87">has declared himself in its favor and appealed to the people. If</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-7-844"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-8-845">Confederation be rejected in that Province at the polls, will he</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-9-170"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-10-170">retain office ? No, Mr Chairman, I believe he has too much</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-11-459"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-12-459">principle to attempt anything so unconstitutional. Allusion has</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-13-602"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-14-603">also been made to Nova Scotia ; but from what I know of the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-15-945"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-16-945">gentlemen who is leader of the Government there, I think it is</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-17-34"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-18-34">not at all probable that he will shirk the question. It will come</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-19-402"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-20-402">up in the Legislature, and if he is unable to carry it I believe he</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-21-947"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-22-947"> </span></span>

Let me,</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-56-95"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-57-96">then, state that the difference between an hon gentleman, not a</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-58-964"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-59-967">member of this House, and myself, was unconnected with the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-60-628"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-61-628">question of a Union of the Colonies. It was quite a different mat-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-62-817"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-63-817">ter altogether. If the hon member who has introduced this un-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-64-906"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-65-907">pleasant subject would refer to the files of some of the public jour-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-66-284"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-67-284">nals, he would find the reasons which I assigned for resigning my</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-68-949"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-69-950">position as president of the Executive Council and as a member</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-70-195"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-71-195">thereof. The case had nothing to do with a Union of the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-72-891"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-73-891">Colonies. It might have occured in any other circumstances.</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-74-248"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-75-248">It affected myself personally, and also the interests and honor</span></span></p>

I encountered no little</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-163-327"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-164-328">opposition in procuring the appointment of my political opponents ;</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-165-568"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-166-569">but if there be any blame attaching to it, I assume it all. I</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-167-256"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-168-256">believe, however, that there is not a member of this House who</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-169-791"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-170-791">does not appreciate and approve of the motives which influenced</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-171-383"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-172-383">the choice. But Sir, I have recently learned that there are</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-173-671"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-174-672">three great commandments for politicians--of which I was</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-175-470"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-176-470">entirely ignorant when I entered political life. This first of these</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-177-587"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-178-588">is for the politician to take good care of himself and his pocket ;</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-179-103"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-180-103">the second is to crush his enemy ; and the third is to attend to</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-181-12"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-182-13">the good of the country. And, Sir, I fear that the third is some-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-183-808"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-184-808">times wholly forgotten in the zeal to carry out the other two.</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-185-857"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-186-857">(Applause.) Acting on these rules, therefore, it is fair game for</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-187-118"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-188-118">the hon leader of the Opposition to endeavor to trip up the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-189-313"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-190-314">Government on any pretence whatever. I think, however, it</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-191-858"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-192-859">would have been more prudent in him to have deferred bringing</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-193-612"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-194-613">up this question until it came before the House in due form.</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-195-94"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-196-95">The delegates appointed were required to report to the Legis-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-197-308"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-198-309">lature, which I as their chairman am prepared to do ; but at this</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-199-957"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-200-958">stage of the proceedings, until this Report can be laid before the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-201-628"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-202-628">House, it is premature to discuss the subject. At Quebec I</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-203-180"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-204-182">decide ; when I returned here, however, I found the statement</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-205-381"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-206-381">had gone forth--like many more which were untrue--that this</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-207-648"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-208-648">question was to be carried without an appeal to the people. I</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-209-541"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-210-542">immediately wrote a letter to the different newspapers in the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-211-798"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-212-798">Colony stating some of my views on the subject, and assuring the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-213-143"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-214-143">people that the measure could not be sanctioned without an</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-215-9"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-216-9">appeal to them. The hon member has referred to the course</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-217-180"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-218-180">pursued by the Government of Nova Scotia on the question.</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-219-758"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-220-758">They have adopted there the plan which I thought we ought to</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-221-546"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-222-546">follow out in this Colony. I understand it is the intention of the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-223-947"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-224-947">Government of Nova Scotia to submit the Report of the delegates</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-225-21"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-226-22">to the House of Assembly, and if but a majority of that body</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-227-467"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-228-467">were in favour of the scheme, that then there would be an appeal</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-229-822"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-230-822">to the people. I have not consulted with the members of our</span></span>
