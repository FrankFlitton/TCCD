Leaders of the Governments and Oppositions</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-32-767"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-33-767">in the other Colonies united in the adoption of the Report. Nova</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-34-249"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-35-250">Scotia treated it as an open question, and it is in that position</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-36-94"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-37-95">here. When the project of the Legislative Union was proposed, I</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-38-32"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-39-32">was strongly opposed to it, and I am of the same opinion still.</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-40-310"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-41-311">There is a vital difference between a Legislative Union of the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-42-134"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-43-135">Maritime Provinces and a Federal Union of all the North</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-44-824"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-45-824">American Colonies. We would be bound in all our local affairs</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-46-986"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-47-987">by the action of a Parliament constituted under a Legislative</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-48-29"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-49-30">Union, while a Federal connection leaves to us the unfettered</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-50-35"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-51-35">control of all subjects of legislation peculiar to our circumstances.</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-52-428"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-53-429">At the Conference help at Quebec, at which were represented</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-54-966"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-55-966">Upper and Lower Canada, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-56-531"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-57-531">Edward Island and Newfoundland, the vote was taken on the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-58-953"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-59-953">details of the proposed Union, not by the suffrages of individual</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-60-257"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-61-257">members of the Conference, but by each of the Colonies repre-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-62-6"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-63-7">sented. Therefore the assertion that the Report was the work</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-64-91"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-65-92">of the Canadians is untrue ; it was adopted by all the Colonies</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-66-838"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-67-839">who had sent their delegates to take part in the deliberations,</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-68-994"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-69-995">and, consequently, the Maritime Provinces had a majority as</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-70-443"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-71-443">against Upper and Lower Canada of four to two. It is unjust</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-72-465"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-73-465">then to object to the Report as having been got up by the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-74-195"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-75-195">Canadians for their own purposes. Whether the Report meets</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-76-866"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-77-866">popular favor or not, the delegates from the Lower Provinces had</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-78-203"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-79-203">the power to defeat it, had they been opposed to it. Why, Sir,</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-80-582"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-81-582">the very first paragraph in the Report passed unanimously, and</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-82-539"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-83-539">its passage was greeted with three cheers.

It has been said, Mr</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-96-654"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-97-655">Speaker, that a dead lock in the relations of political parties in</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-98-345"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-99-346">Canada induced the proposal for a Confederation of these</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-100-813"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-101-814">Provinces ; but, Sir, the principle of a political Union of British</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-102-175"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-103-176">North America did not see the light for the first time in the year</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-104-92"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-105-92">1864. The correspondence between the late Duke of Kent and</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-106-38"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-107-39">the late Judge Sewell shows that the idea occupied the minds of</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-108-64"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-109-64">men in high station many years ago. In that mine of political</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-110-74"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-111-74">information, the Report of the late Lord Durham, the opinion is</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-112-612"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-113-612">expressed that Union among themselves can alone preserve these</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-114-715"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-115-715">Colonies from absorption into the neighboring republic These</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-1-793"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-2-793">facts show that the idea is not peculiar to the Provinces. In</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-3-150"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-4-151">Nova Scotia and New Brunswick several of their leading public</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-5-975"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-6-976">mens have advanced similar opinions. At the time of the Union</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-7-927"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-8-927">between Upper and Lower Canada, the former Province</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-9-757"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-10-758">obtained as equal share of representation int he United Parlia-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-11-25"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-12-26">ment. With Lower Canada, although the population of Upper</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-13-969"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-14-969">Canada was less than that of Lower Canada, they each sent an</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-15-695"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-16-695">equal number of representatives—65. But the influx of immi-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-17-17"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-18-18">gration into Upper Canada has so far changed her position to the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-19-706"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-20-707">Lower Province, that the former provides two-thirds of the reve-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-21-506"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-22-506">nue, the share of which appropriated to her is in the inverse ratio to</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-23-349"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-24-349">the amount which she contributes. When the Hon George Brown's</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-25-131"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-26-131">party came into power, the idea was broached of dissolving the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-27-281"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-28-282">Union with Lower Canada, and having a general Confederation.</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-29-953"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-30-954">When the opportunity offered by the Conference of the dele-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-31-240"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-32-240">gates of the Maritime Provinces, Canada thought it a favorable</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-33-609"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-34-609">occasion to send delegates to listen to the views of the leading</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-35-954"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-36-954">men of the Lower Colonies, and I may say that in this instance</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-37-607"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-38-607">Canada's difficulty is our opportunity. But, Mr Speaker, in</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-39-582"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-40-583">whatever motives the idea of this Confederation may have had</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-41-55"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-42-56">its origin, the result of the defeat of the project will be, I have no</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-43-521"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-44-521">hesitation in saying, our absorption into the United States.</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-45-300"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-46-301">Already the handwriting is on the wall, and it needs no prophet</span></span></p><p class="ocr_par" id="ui-id-47-650"><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-48-650"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-49-650">to expound its meaning that Union or Republicanism awaits us.</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-53-674"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-54-674">A great outcry has been raised on the subject of the increased</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-55-454"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-56-454">taxation to which we would be subjected if we became united to</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-57-576"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-58-576">our sister Colonies ; but no hon member has yet shwon how</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-59-367"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-60-368">much our situation in that respect would be improved by having</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-61-676"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-62-676">to pay the far higher taxes if we should form part of the United</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-63-770"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-64-770">States. I leave the financial part of the subject to be dealt with</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-65-847"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-66-847">by others, and shall adopt the so-termed "glory argument." I</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-67-585"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-68-586">maintain, Mr Speaker, that the pages of history may be ransacked</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-69-946"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-70-947">in vain for the record of any people who ever rose to a position</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-71-563"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-72-563">among the nations of the earth whose minds were not imbued</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-73-191"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-74-191">with that sentiment, and the decline of those who have receded</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-75-635"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-76-636">from their once high position dates from the time when it began</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-77-997"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-78-997">to lose its influence. Without that element in her national</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-79-191"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-80-191">character where would Great Britain have been in her gigantic</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-81-966"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-82-967">struggle with Napoleon the first ? The hon member for East</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-83-255"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-84-256">Point (Mr Hensley) says that we would be taxed for the con-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-85-233"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-86-233">struction of the Intercolonial Railroad, and that we would receive</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-87-951"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-88-952">no benefits in return for our expenditure. Under any circum-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-89-580"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-90-580">stances we would receive indirect benefit, but I contend that the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-91-853"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-92-854">preservation of monarchical principles to us would be a direct</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-93-94"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-94-95">boon, and the promised military aid of the Mother Country by</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-95-959"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-96-960">her troops which that railway could transport in the winter season</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-97-863"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-98-863">from Halifax to the frontier of Upper Canada, would insure our</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-99-309"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-100-310">protection, for, as it has been truly said, if Canada falls we must</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-101-963"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-102-964">all share her fate. In addition we would have the protection of</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-103-687"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-104-688">her navy on our coasts as long as the navigation continued open.</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-105-973"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-106-974">In the convention at Quebec, it was urged by myself and others</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-107-406"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-108-406">that the principle of the constitution of the United States Senate,</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-109-670"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-110-670">as regards the number of members from each State, should be</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-111-811"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-112-812">applied to the Upper House of the Confederate Legislature. The</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-113-696"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-114-697">proposal was overruled, and since that time I have begun to</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-115-800"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-116-800">think the decision was right. The Conference adopted a medium</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-117-655"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-118-655">course between the two extremes, and if Newfoundland shall</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-119-618"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-120-619">come into the scheme the Maritime Provinces will receive four</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-121-366"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-122-366">additional members. The principle of representation by popula-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-123-675"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-124-675">tion in the lower branch is not a novelty. It was recommended</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-125-973"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-126-974">by the Late Durham as far back as 1837. The duty of</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-127-475"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-128-475">arranging the electoral districts for the first election is to be left</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-129-237"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-130-238">to the respective local Governments. The Conference merely</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-131-119"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-132-120">apportions the number of representatives to the different Colonies.</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-133-925"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-134-925">The hon member for the city (Mr Brecken) said that it</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-135-505"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-136-505">would be time to consider our situation when our position as a</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-137-55"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-138-56">British Colony shall be involved. He labors under a mistake;</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-139-265"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-140-266">the present is the proper time. The crisis will soon arrive, and</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-141-881"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-142-881">the time is at hand when we must assume our full share of our</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-143-740"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-144-740">burdens. Let the old adage be remembered that those who aid</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-145-546"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-146-547">themselves the gods will aid. I am aware of the great satisfaction</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-147-666"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-148-667">experienced by the opponents of Confederation at the result of</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-149-841"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-150-841">the general election in New Brunswick ; but the issue, Union or</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-151-650"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-152-650">no Union was not fairly submitted to the people. Personal</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-153-996"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-154-997">antipathies had much to do in bringing about the results. Parties</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-155-848"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-156-849">took sides on the principle of the old distich—</span></span></p><p class="ocr_par" id="ui-id-50-133"><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-51-133"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-52-133">I do not like thee, Doctor Tell,</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-157-604"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-158-604">The reason why, I cannot tell.</span></span></p><p class="ocr_par" id="ui-id-159-749"><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-160-749"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-161-749">As to Nova Scotia, any action on her part would have been</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-162-523"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-163-523">premature before the result of the New Brunswick elections had</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-164-497"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-165-497">been ascertained. Sir, I believe that the sun will yet rise upon</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-166-798"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-167-799">a Confederation of those Colonies, notwithstanding the jubilant</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-168-13"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-169-13">feelings of the opponents of this great measure at its temporary</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-170-107"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-171-108">failure. Thirty-three representatives of the six North American</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-4-703"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-5-703">Colonies were united on the question last year, and now several</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-6-883"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-7-883">of them, strange to say, oppose it. The Report, in my opinion,</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-8-59"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-9-59">embraces the best features of the constitutions of Great Britain</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-10-323"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-11-323">and of the United States, applicable to our circumstances ; and it</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-12-291"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-13-291">is no small satisfaction to those who support the measure of a</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-14-888"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-15-888">Union, that though it may meet opposition in the Colonies, it has</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-16-15"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-17-15">received approval from the statesmen and press of Great Britain.</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-18-487"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-19-488">One great benefit which would accrue from Union would be the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-20-212"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-21-212">diversion of the tide of immigration from the United States to</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-22-276"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-23-276">these Colonies, where his civil and religious liberties would be</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-24-501"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-25-501">secured to the stranger the moment he landed on our shores. Mr</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-26-244"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-27-244">Speaker, I may say that the Report of the delegates embodies</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-28-580"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-29-580">principles greater in some respects than those on which the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-30-96"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-31-96">Constitution of the United States is based. The chief ruler of</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-32-640"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-33-640">that country is, himself, during his term of office, irresponsible to</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-34-496"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-35-496">the people, and is surrounded by a ministry equally unfettered.</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-36-653"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-37-654">The Constitution of the proposed Union acknowledges only our</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-38-574"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-39-574">gracious Queen and her successors as the chief authority, and the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-40-165"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-41-165">administration of the Confederate Colonies will be conducted by</span></span></p>
