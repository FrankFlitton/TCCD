  of the most zealous and enlightened of the advocates<lb/>
  of Confederation. The hon.and learned gentleman<lb/>
    then proceeded to notice our Island <i>Cabinet</i> disagree-<lb/>
  ment on the Confederation question; and, in doing so,<lb/>
  argued tht the existence of that disagreement evi-<lb/>
  denced no unworthiness or unfitness for his or their<lb/>
  position on the part of any individual member or<lb/>
  members of that Cabinet. The question of Confedera-<lb/>
  tion, on which they differed, being altogether an open<lb/>
  one—a Question which, although it involved the inter-<lb/>
  ests of every class in the Colony, yet, most assuredly<lb/>
  as parties now stand, could not be made a party one<lb/>
  —every member of the Cabinet, as well as every<lb/>
  member of the House, was, he said, perfectly free,<lb/>
  without any regard to political position or party ties,<lb/>
  to argue and vote for or againstit, according to his own<lb/>
  conscientious views of the question. In dwelling upon<lb/>
  the fact of this Cabinet disagreement, the hon. and<lb/>
  learned gentleman adverted to similar divisions which<lb/>
  at different times, had arisen in the Cabinet of Great<lb/>
  Britian; instancing amongst others, that which took<lb/>
  place in the reign of George the Third, when the great<lb/>
  Pitt was Premier; and also the misunderstanding<lb/>
  between King William the Fourth and his prime min-<lb/>
  ister, Lord Melbourne, in consequence of which His<lb/>
  Majesty intimated to his Lordship, although sustained<lb/>
  by a parliamentary majority, that he had no further<lb/>
  need of his services, and was yet obliged afterwards<lb/>
  to recall him. The hon. and learned gentleman's object,<lb/>
  in referring to these historical incidents, was to shew<lb/>
  that such differences might arise and exist between<lb/>
  members of the same Cabinet, and such misunderstand-<lb/>
  ings occur, even between the supreme head of the<lb/>
  Government and his Executive, without their necessi-<lb/>
  tating any just condemnation of either of the disagree-<lb/>
  ing parties; as, in such cases, the disagreement might,<lb/>
  and, perhaps, generally did, arise solely from an adher-<lb/>
  ence, on each side, to the most conscientious convictions,<lb/>
  or the most sincere desire for the preservation or pro-<lb/>
  motion of the public welfare. And, in particularly<lb/>
  addressing some of his observations on that subject to<lb/>
  "his hon. friend, the Leader of the Opposition" (Mr.<lb/>
  Coles), the hon. and learned gentleman took occasion<lb/>
  to observe that the day which had unfortunately seen<lb/>
  honest and hearty opponents in the political arena,<lb/>
  veritable and undisguised enemies in private life, was<lb/>
  happily gone by; and congratulated that hon. gentle-<lb/>
  men and himself that now, however great the hostility<lb/>
  which, on the floor of the Assembly, each might mani-<lb/>
  fest to the public policy and political sentiments of the<lb/>
  other, they could, at all times, meet as true friends<lb/>
  both in the social haunts and in the private walks of<lb/>
  life. In countries in which self-government did not<lb/>
  prevail, political contests seldom failed to provoke the<lb/>
  most rancorous illwill, and to give rise to the most un-<lb/>
  charitable asperities; but where that form of govern-<lb/>
  ment is established its happy operation, in equalizing<lb/>
  both burthens and privileges, and in holding the balance<lb/>
  even bteween contending aspirants for place and power<lb/>
  had a most salutary weight in the repression of jealousy<lb/>
  and ill-will; and its influences, where they had long<lb/>
  been felt, seldom failed to induce the practice of for-<lb/>
  bearance and courtesy in parliamentary debates.—The<lb/>
  hon. and learned gentleman then observed, that, in<lb/>
  giving his support to the Resolutions in amendment,<lb/>
  which had been supmitted by the hon. member for St.<lb/>
  Peter's (Hon. Mr. Whelan,) he did not think it neces-<lb/>
 <cb/>
  sary to dilate upon the Quebec Scheme, or to advert<lb/>
  with any particularity to what had taken place at the<lb/>
  Quebec Conference; for all that he could say upon those<lb/>
  topics he had said in the Session of 1865, and it was<lb/>
  duly recorded in the Parliamentary Reporter of that<lb/>
  year. Indeed he feared he had already trespassed too<lb/>
  far on the time and patience of the House by iteration<lb/>
  of much that he had formerly spoken upon the same<lb/>
  question; but his apology was, that, as he still adhered<lb/>
  to the sentiments respecting Confederation which he<lb/>
  had formerly uttered, he had no choice between such<lb/>
  iteration and his preserving a silence, which in the<lb/>
  position which he occupied, might justly have been<lb/>
  deemed both disrespectful and unwarrantable. He<lb/>
  was certainly very sorry to feel himself obliged to vote<lb/>
  against the Resolutions which had been submitted by<lb/>
  the Hon. the Leader of the Government (Mr. J. C.<lb/>
  Pope); but, at the same time, he could not refrain from<lb/>
  saying he was extremely astonished that, in the middle<lb/>
  of the nineteenth century, a declaration such as that<lb/>
  which they contained could be deliberately submitted<lb/>
  to "the collective wisdom" of the country—a declara-<lb/>
  tion by which, should the House accept it, they would<lb/>
  dare to presume upon an exercise of the divine attri-<lb/>
  butes of prescience and omniscience. He was indeed<lb/>
  sorry to find that hon. members on the Government<lb/>
  side of the House, and on the independent benches,<lb/>
  were, however, prepared to accept and declare any<lb/>
  thing, rather than, in any way, admit the principle of<lb/>
  Confederation. He was himself, however, prepared<lb/>
  to vote for the Resolutions in amendment, submitted<lb/>
  by the hon. member for St. Peter's; and how the Hon.<lb/>
  the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Coles), with any<lb/>
  regard to his reputation for political consistency—not<lb/>
  to say honesty—could do otherwise, he (Hon. Mr. H.)<lb/>
  could not imagine. If, when at Ottawa, he (the Hon.<lb/>
  Mr. Coles) spoke conscientiously, he could not now,<lb/>
  with any shew of consistency, vote for the Resolutions<lb/>
  submitted by the Hon. the Leader of the Government;<lb/>
  nay, as it might justly be said that, at Ottawa, he<lb/>
  spoke with ten-fold more strength than any other of<lb/>
  the Island Delegates, in favour of the Resolutions<lb/>
  adopted at the Quebec Conference, to be consistant,<lb/>
  he ought to oppose the Resolutions now submitted<lb/>
  against Confederation with ten times greater energy<lb/>
  than any other hon. member who is opposed to them.<lb/>
  He like the Hon. Joseph Howe, had declared that the<lb/>
  Confederation of the British American Provinces had<lb/>
  been, if not the cherished dream of his childhood, yet<lb/>
  a cherished conception of his own mind, the realiza-<lb/>
  tion of which he had contemplated for years. How<lb/>
  now then, when its realization certainly seemed more<lb/>
  than a probability, could he, not only abandon the<lb/>
  hopes of it, but actually do all that laid in his power<lb/>
  to prevent it?—Once more, with contemptuous indig-<lb/>
  nation, adverting to, and repelling, the charges of<lb/>
  bribery and corruption, which, on account of his ad-<lb/>
  vocacy of Confederation, had been levelled against<lb/>
  himself, the hon. and learned gentleman took occasion<lb/>
  to say, that there was not a public man in Prince Ed-<lb/>
  ward Island who had devoted himself to the public<lb/>
  service of his country in a manner which exhibited<lb/>
  less consideration of self, than he had done. It could<lb/>
  not be said that he had ever fattened or luxuriated<lb/>
  upon the sweets of office. Long as he had faithfully<lb/>
  adhered to the principles and fortunes of the Conser-<lb/>
  vative party,—alike when in power and out of power,<lb/>
