He should remember that there is no simile</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-12-400"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-13-400">between this Island and the antipodes, and that the spirit</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-14-297"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-15-297">of British Americans cannot be kept down and trodden</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-16-775"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-17-775">upon like that of Europeans. As the Tenant League</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-18-824"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-19-824">was crushed, the people waited patiently till the next</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-20-589"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-21-589">election came round, and then displaced the party that</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-22-791"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-23-791">had trampled upon them. There was a great cause for</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-24-192"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-25-192">the formation of this association, for it would be im-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-26-111"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-27-111">possible to get up such an organization as this without</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-28-265"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-29-265">a reason why. Why did not the Confederate party who</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-30-919"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-31-919">were high in office under the late Government, get up</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-32-849"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-33-849">an association for the purpose of furthering their object?</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-34-23"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-35-23">Simply because that object was unjust and unreasonable.</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-36-608"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-37-608">The Conservatives when in power, could not be mistaken</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-38-682"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-39-682">as to the condition of the country, for even the Spy in his</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-40-735"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-41-735">report showed the stated of the people, and the effects of the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-42-958"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-43-962">rent-paying system. When we reflect that to man was</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-44-809"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-45-809">given dominion over the creatures, and that no man has</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-46-970"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-47-970">a right to claim exclusive right to the lands of any coun-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-48-6"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-49-6">try, is it any wonder that the law was broken in this</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-50-305"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-51-305">instance? The troops were brought here to damage the</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-52-166"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-53-166">character of the people of this Island as much as possible</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-54-407"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-55-407">—to create the impression in the Mother Country that</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-56-393"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-57-393">we were not worthy or capable of governing ourselves;</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-58-23"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-59-23">and thereby to get this Colony forced into Confederation</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-60-113"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-61-113">against the consent of its inhabitants. But I do not</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-62-794"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-63-794">say that all the members of the late Government had</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-64-969"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-65-969">this object in view. Such despotic measures and foul</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-66-834"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-67-835">schemes had never been resorted to, even in unhappy</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-68-848"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-69-848">Ireland on the eve of its union with Great Britain. I</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-70-513"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-71-513">believe the hon. Leader of the Opposition was favor-</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-72-823"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-73-823">able to Confederation because he thought it would be a</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-74-200"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-75-200">benefit to his country; since the people were opposed to</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-76-102"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-77-102">it, he thought it no harm to do evil that good might</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-78-689"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-79-690">come. We know that Brutus said that he killed his</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-80-22"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-81-22">best friend for the good of Rome; but I shall say no</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-82-601"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-83-601">more about the hon. Leader of the Opposition, as he is</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-84-416"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-85-416">not in his place. What had those members of the late</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-86-918"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-87-918">Government who were opposed to Confederation in view;</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-88-464"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-89-464">They must have had some object before them, because</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-90-374"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-91-374">any person who raises his voice in favor of the people</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-92-698"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-93-698">is put down by these hon. members as a political</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-94-320"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-95-320">demagogue, and as one who wishes to make political</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-96-495"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-97-495">capital; or, as the hon. member for Charlottetown calls</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-98-446"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-99-446">it, political dishonesty. If the members of any other</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-100-72"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-101-72">part had acted in the same manner, that hon. member</span></span><span class="ocr_line" id="ui-id-102-954"><span class="ocrx_word" id="ui-id-103-954"> </span></span></p>
