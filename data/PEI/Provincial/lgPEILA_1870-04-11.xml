     protection of the raw material was an 
     <lb/>advantage to any country, and thought<lb/>the opinion expressed by the hon.<lb/>member was as much out of place thn<lb/>as when he said a threatened Fenian<lb/>raid had the effect of turning the election<lb/>in favor of confederation in New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, but yet it was in keeping with the<lb/>sentiment, which placed the distinguished<lb/>gentlemen who came down ehre last<lb/>year from Canada, in juxtaposition with<lb/>swells and pedlers. A pedler was not a<lb/>swell, nor was a swell a pedler, unless<lb/>the hon. member intended using the<lb/>word in the adjective sense, and looked<lb/>upon them as swelled pedlers. But had<lb/>they come down with the $800,000 on<lb/>their backs, and freely used them with the<lb/>government, instead of offering to place<lb/>them in the TReasury for the payment of<lb/>our public lands, he believed less would<lb/>have been said about bribery and more<lb/>about the advantages of a union with<lb/>the Dominion. With respect to the pay<lb break="no"/>ment of the governor's salary, he re<lb break="no"/>garded the demand unfair, and believed<lb/>the legislature would have had right on<lb/>its side if it had refused to pay it. He<lb/>was of opinion the House should have<lb/>resisted it to the last, and in so doing he<lb/>felt public opinion would have sustainted<lb/>the act. But the government failed to<lb/>shew a proper spirit on that occasion,<lb/>and the result was that for all time to<lb/>come they would have to pay £1,400 stg.<lb/>to Lieut. Governor of the colony.<lb/>

            <p>
     Mr. BELL had heard that a play story         
     <lb/>plainly told was best, but some hon.<lb/>members who had spoken on the subject<lb/>of Confederation did not appear to have<lb/>thought so, if we were to judge by the<lb/>wide ranged they had taken on this dis<lb break="no"/>cussion. A great deal had been brought<lb/>up about the unions of Scotland and<lb/>Ireland with England, that was totally<lb/>irrelevant to the subject. Had they re<lb break="no"/>ferred to the Union of Cape Breton<lb/>with Nova Scotia, it would have been<lb/>more to the point. There was no simili<lb break="no"/>tude between the state of Scotland in<lb/>1707 and our present condition. Scot<lb break="no"/>land was filled with feuds among her<lb/>own inhabitants as well as with the<lb/>English, and as a natural consequence<lb/>neither Scotland nor the North of Eng<lb break="no"/>land, which was often over-run by the<lb/>Scotch, was very prosperous. This<lb/>Island was at peace with the whole<lb/>world, and amongst ourselves—we had<lb/>no hostile clans—the people of East Point<lb/>were not fighting with those of West<lb/>

     Cape. We did not want any change in        
     <lb/>our form of Government. The only<lb/>thing we were in want of at the present<lb/>time, was a market for ourproductions<lb/>and wherever we got a market, our In<lb break="no"/>terests would naturally lead<lb/>was it that nearly all of the people of the<lb/>Island were opposed to union with<lb/>Canada? Simply because they were well<lb/>aware that Canada would afford us no<lb/>market for our surplus produce. Neither<lb/>oats nor fish could be sent to Canada,<lb/>and sold for anything like remunerative<lb/>prices. It would also be very incon<lb break="no"/>venient for our representatives to go<lb/>the Parliament at Ottawa in winter,<lb/>when we had no communication with<lb/>the neighboring provinces, except by an<lb/>iceboat. The extremities of any country,<lb/>especially one geographically situated<lb/>like the Dominion, never enjoyed so<lb/>many privileges as the more central<lb/>parts. We would be Prince Edward<lb/>Island under confederation, we would<lb/>be cut off from the rest of the Dominion<lb/>a great part of the year, and would de<lb break="no"/>rive no benefit from a great many of the<lb/>improvements there, while we would<lb/>have to pay our share of the expense.<lb/>If the politicians of Canada were the<lb/>pursest the world ever saw, Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation would not benefit us; but the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of Canada had proved them<lb break="no"/>selves to be anything but pure men—<lb/>they had taken bribes, and they had<lb/>bribed each other—and they were paying<lb/>men high salaries for doing nothing.<lb/>Sir Francis Hincks had been taken into<lb/>the Government and appointed Finance<lb/>Minister, when his maladministrationy of<lb/>his office under the late Government was<lb/>well known. Mr. Galt said of him, that<lb/>he had ruined the country once, and<lb/>would do it again. In the event of<lb/>union we could hardly tell what effect<lb/>the alteration in our tariffs would have,<lb/>for if the Americans opened their market<lb/>to us, we would send our produce there,<lb/>and most probably take in terurn such<lb/>goods from them as we required. The<lb/>Minute of Council set forth in its true<lb/>light our peculiar position, and the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment showed a great deal of sagacity<lb/>and good sense, in asking the British<lb/>Government to settle the land question<lb/>before we would discuss the subject of<lb/>Confederation. if we took the $800,000<lb/>from Canada, our representatives would<lb/>stand in a false position in the Dominion<lb/>Parliament.

     <lb/>
     on every independent representative of 
     <lb/>
     the people in the House to express his 
     <lb/>
    candid opinion on the great and all- 
     <lb break="yes"/>absorbing topic  of confederation. It was 
     <lb/>a question of the greatest importance ; in 
     <lb/>fact the most momentous that had been  
     <lb/>discussed in this House for years ; for on 
     <lb/>its decision depended, in a measure, the 
     <lb/>future prosperity or ruin, the weal or 
     <lb/>woe of the inhabitants of the Island. 
     <lb/>We were now a free and independent 
     <lb/>people —free to make our own laws and 
     <lb/>disburse our own revenues, but were 
     <lb/>we confederated with the Dominion our 
     <lb/>condition would be very different—our 
     <lb/>general laws would be framed almost 
     <lb/>entirely by men who knew very little 
     <lb/>about us, and were unacquainted with 
     <lb/>our circumstances or requirements ; our 
     <lb/>revenue would be disbursed by a gov<lb break="no"/>ernment many hundreds of miles from 
     <lb/>us, and we should be taxed at the dis<lb break="no"/>cretion of that government. He (Mr. 
     <lb/>McL.) would like to see the free and 
     <lb/>glorious constitution of our little Island 
     <lb/>handed down to posterity. Did any 
     <lb/>hon member require proof of the evils of 
     <lb/> confederation? Look' at the once beau<lb break="no"/>tiful and classic land of Greece, which, 
     <lb/>for lack of an independent spirit in her 
     <lb/>people, became enslaved, and that coun<lb break="no"/>try in which was once centred nearly all 
     <lb/>the refinement and literature of the

      world, was now scarcely ever spoken of. 
     <lb/>
    And if the people of this Island did not 
     <lb/>manfully maintain their independence, 
     <lb/>they too would become enslaved. If we<lb/>turned to the great Germanic Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, and there beheld the disastrous 
     <lb/>effects of union, it should be a warning 
     <lb/>to us. One of its effects was the great 
     <lb/>struggle which took place there a few 
     <lb/>years ago, in which hundreds of thou<lb break="no"/>sands of men were arrayed against each 
     <lb/>other in deadly hostility. In the 
     <lb/>United States of America, confederation 
     <lb/>was the cause of the battles which 
     <lb/>covered the country with rain and deso<lb break="no"/>lation, and deluged it with human blood.<lb/>Washington foresaw the difficulties<lb/>which would arise between the different<lb/>sections of the Republic, and in his fare<lb break="no"/>well address prophesied the great strug<lb break="no"/>gle which took place. He (Mr. McL.)<lb/>the jealousy which existed between the 
     <lb/>North and the South. The Southern 
     <lb/>peole were opposed to the bounties paid 
     <lb/>to Northern fishing vessels, and this was 
     <lb/>one great cause of the discontent and 
     <lb/>dissatisfaction which existed. They had 
     <lb/>different interests, and so it was with the 
     <lb/> Dominion—the Interests of the maritime 
     <lb/>provinces were totally different from those 
     <lb/>of Canada, which would give rise to 
     <lb/>continual jealousy and discontent. The 
     <lb/>history of Scotland had been frequently 
     <lb/>referred to during this debate, and the 
     <lb/>hon member for Charlottetown (Mr. 
     <lb/>Bracken) had stigmatized the Scottish 
     <lb/>people as lawless and indolent. If the 
     <lb/>people of Scotland were lawless, it was 
     <lb/>because they were driven to desperation ; 
     <lb/>and as regarded the charge of indolence, 
     <lb/>every person was well aware that the 
     <lb/>Scotch were a thriving, energetic  people, 
     <lb/>and that they always sustained a high 
     <lb/>character in whatever country they hap<lb break="no"/>pened to reside. The learned Leader of 
     <lb/>the Opposition had quoted Knight's 
     <lb/>History of Scotland, a history which 
     <lb/>was well known to be unreliable. Knight 
     <lb/>took his views of Scottish History 
     <lb/>from Define, the author of Robinson Crusoe 
     <lb/>and other such works. Sir Walter Scott's 
     <lb/>history was very different from Knight's. 
     <lb/>It was said that Scotland did not prosper 
     <lb/>before union with England. Perhaps not, 
     <lb/>but neither did she prosper for a considerable 
     <lb/>time after it. There was continual strife be<lb break="no"/>tween the people of Scotland and those of 
     <lb/>England, and between 1707,1745, a period of 
     <lb/>38 years,there were three rebellions, —one in  
     <lb/>1815, another in 1823, and a third in 1845. 
     <lb/>So much had been said about the union of 
     <lb/>
 
            <cb/>
          
          
     Ireland and England, that very little farther 
     <lb/>
     remained to be added, but be (Mr. McL.) 
     <lb/>
     would just remark that when that union 
     <lb/>
     was consummated, it was an understanding 
     <lb/>
     that Ireland was to have a separate ex<lb break="no"/>chequer, but that part of the agreement 
     <lb/>
     was not fulfilled. The public debt of Ire<lb break="no"/>land at that time, was £26,000,000, while 
     <lb/>
     that of England was £420,000,000, and 
     <lb/>
     Ireland had to bear her share of both debts 
     <lb/>
    combined, which was a piece of gross in<lb break="no"/>justice. It had been argued that the Irish 
     <lb/>Parliament was corrupt, but, if so, what 
     <lb/>made it corrupt? English gold. To 
     <lb/>turn to the proposed union of this 
     <lb/>Island with the Dominion of Canada, it 
     <lb/>appeared to him (Mr McL.) that no terms 
     <lb/>which Canada could offer would be an 
     <lb/>equivalent for the loss of our liberties. 
     <lb/>The Dominion government might order us 
     <lb/>what terms they liked, because if they had 
     <lb/>us  in the union, my would then have the 
     <lb/>power of taxing us at their own discretion. 
     <lb/>and could take from us more than we had 
     <lb/>received from them. It had been stated 
     <lb/>that if we joined the Dominion, the pro<lb break="no"/>prietary lands would all be purchased, and 
     <lb/>rent paying, which had been so long a 
     <lb/>curse to the Island, would cease forever ; 
     <lb/>but if those who were freed from from the 
     <lb/>thraldom of rent paying would be obliged, 
     <lb/>in the event of confederation, to pay more 
     <lb/>in taxes than they now paid in rent, it was 
     <lb/>difficult to see how their condition would 
     <lb/>be improved. He (Mr. McL.) would like 
     <lb/>to hear from the hon. leader of the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion, and also from the hon. member for 
     <lb/>Charlottetown, (Mr. Brecken) their rea<lb break="no"/>sons for changing their views on this great 
     <lb/>subject. When men in such high positions 
     <lb/>changed their minds on a great question, 
     <lb/>the public should  know what induced them 
     <lb/>to do so. It appeared from the speeches 
     <lb/>of the Hon. Mr. Haviland, the present 
     <lb/>leader of the Opposition, that in 1864 he 
     <lb/>entertained very different views on the 
     <lb/>question of confederation from what he 
     <lb/>had expressed during this debate. The 
     <lb/>following were some extracts from that 
     <lb/> hon. member's speeches:—

     in favor of the union, that, the event of a

New Brunswick has a large<lb/>funded debt, in comparison to which our public<lb/>liabilities, the fruitful subject of so much grumb<lb break="no"/>ling, are mere matter of moonshine. The pub<lb break="no"/>lic debt of the Island amounts to not more than<lb/>£60,000 or £70,000, and we have the public do<lb break="no"/>main to the credit of the country. Although<lb/>the resolution submitted does not commit this<lb/>House to the expression of any opinion on the<lb/>subject of the union of the colonies, it is but<lb/>right that the delegates, who may be appointed<lb/>as representatives of the Island, at the proposed<lb/>conference, should have their position fortified<lb/>by the avowed sentiments of members of the<lb/>Legis;ature, that they should be able to tell the<lb/>representatives of the sister colonies, what are<lb/>the feelings of those whom they represent. I<lb/>am decidedly of opinion, that we should, as an<lb/>act of common courtesy, assent to the appoint<lb break="no"/>ment of delegates, if for no other purpose than<lb/>that of hearing what propositions may be offer<lb break="no"/>ed by representatives of the other provinces.<lb/>With this view, I shall support the resolution,<lb/>but I entertain very decided objections to the<lb/>proposed union. * *  *  In his speech on the<lb/>union of the lower colonies, the Hon. Mr.<lb/>Tupper, Provincial Secretary of Nova Scotia,<lb/>said that the time had not yet arrived for a<lb/>union with Canada, because of the large debt<lb/>of that colony. "I thank thee, Jew, for reach<lb break="no"/>ing me that word." for the argument deduced<lb/>from it is applicable against our union with<lb/>the other colonies. Canada is burdened with a<lb/>debt of more that sixty millions of dollars, and<lb/>there is an annual deficit in the revenue of a<lb/>million. As to the idea attributed to the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Government, that these colonies are able<lb/>to bear the burden of defending themselves<lb/>against the invasion of a foreign foe, the sooner<lb/>Great Britain awakes from that dilusion the<lb/>better. * * * Our <hi rendition="simple:italic">status</hi>, if united, would, <lb/>I am bound to assume, be adjusted on the basis,<lb/>either of territorial area or numerical ratio of<lb/>population. If the first criterion be adopted,<lb/>we would occupy a very inconsiderable position<lb/>in the united Legislature. If our representa<lb break="no"/>tion is to be regulated by population, the official<lb/>statistics on that point, afford but little prospect<lb/>of Prince Edward Island exercising much in<lb break="no"/>fluence in the halls of the united colonies. * *  *  <lb/>We might expect to recieve the treatment that<lb/>Scotland and Ireland were subjected to whhen<lb/>their separate Legislatures were abolished.<lb/>* * *  At present the money we raise among <lb/>ourselves is spent on the Island, and I ask<lb/>what guarantee have we that, once absorbed<lb/>in the union, we may not have to pass a budget<lb/>framed to meet the railway charges of Nova<lb/>Scotia and New Brunswick? I know not what<lb/>may result from this oventire, but I caution<lb/>hon. members, that if they sell their birthright<lb/>they may expect their country to retrograde<lb/>as Cape Breton has done since her annexation<lb/>to Nova Scotia. We have, at present, the sys<lb break="no"/>tem of self-government and self-taxation, and<lb/>if there be some defects in the practical work<lb break="no"/>ing of our institutions, it is 'better to bear the<lb/>
       
       
            <cb/>
         
         ills we have, than to fly to others we know not<lb/>of'. We have already an independent judiciary,<lb/>and if our professional men and their clients,<lb/>should have to appear in the great Supreme<lb/>Court of Acadia, I do not see what improve<lb break="no"/>ment would be effected by the change. At<lb/>present we enjoy the advantages of the rail<lb break="no"/>ways in the neighboring provinces without the<lb/>burden of the cost, and if we were prevented<lb/>from these advantages, I admit, an argument<lb/>might be drawn in favor of the union, but it<lb/>should also be borne in mind, that the railway<lb/>in New Brunswick derives a large amount of<lb/>income from this Island. * *  *  The hon. <lb/>Col. Secretary told us that our internal com<lb break="no"/>munications would be improved by the increas<lb break="no"/>ed outlay which the revenue of the united col<lb break="no"/>onies could afford, and that capital would flow<lb/>in on us after our separate constitution should<lb/>be merged in the union. As to the first argu<lb break="no"/>ment, my impression is very decidedly opposed<lb/>to it, and I cannot concieve that our identifica<lb break="no"/>tion with other countries deeply involved in<lb/>debt, will have the effect of including men of<lb/>wealth to invest their property in the colony.<lb/>The statistics of the Island, show that, without<lb/>the public lands, which they possess, without<lb/>the Imperial expenditure for naval and mili<lb break="no"/>tary purposes, which had been so abundantly,<lb/>nay, lavishly, disbursed in Nova Scotia and<lb/>New Brunswick, we have thriven and advanced<lb/>in material prosperity, as did the old thirteen<lb/>colonies, by our own unaided resources. The<lb/>very first result of a union with those provin<lb break="no"/>ces would be a uniform tariff; and while we<lb/>hear complaints of our present scale of duties,<lb/>let it be remembered that in the neighbouring<lb/>colonies, the people are taxed far more heavily.<lb/>In view of all these facts, I repeat the question,<lb/>what are we to gain by a union? Consider<lb/>further, Mr. Chairman, the peculiarity which<lb/>would necessarily arise from our insular posi<lb break="no"/>tion. All who hear me, know that our Colon<lb break="no"/>ial Legislatures meet in the winter season; and<lb/>I ask hon. members on either side, if they<lb/>would fancy the idea of crossing the straits of<lb/>Northumberland in January or February, to<lb/>attend to their Legislative duties. Sir, I be<lb break="no"/>lieve this scheme has been devised mpre in the<lb/>interests of the ruling parties in the neighboring<lb/>colonies than in regard for those of the people.<lb/>The Tilleys and Tuppers would fain have a<lb/>wider field for the exercise of their talents, and<lb/>the extension of their sway, but it is our duty<lb/>to protect the rights of those whose reprenta<lb break="no"/>tives we are, aud what public man will not<lb/>hesitate ere he votes that our institutions shall<lb/>become nonentites? We have been told, and<lb/>with truth, that Scotland prospered after, and<lb/>in consequence of her union with England, in<lb/>1707. There might be some cogency in the<lb/>argument, if, before the union, she had pos<lb break="no"/>sessed free institutions; but such was not the<lb/>case. * *  *  The argument that we shall be<lb/>materially benefited by forming a part of a<lb/>country which will count its population by<lb/>millions, finds no acquiscence in my mind,<lb/>when I reflect in what Tell achieved for<lb/>Switzerland against the most powerful nation<lb/>of his time."<lb/>

            <p>Follow this increase on for twenty years<lb/>more, and what would be the state of our<lb/>trade? Add it to our hay, which, together<lb/>with fat cattle, would very soon form a con<lb break="no"/>siderable item, and we would have still<lb/>greater results. Now all this had been<lb/>done with a banking capital of $3 1/4 per head<lb/>of our population, while our neighbors in<lb/>the Dominion had $9 1/2 per head. There<lb/>was scarcely any doubt but the prosperity of<lb/>the Island would go on at a still greater<lb/>ratio.

There was nothing in<lb/>the way of comfort that our people did not<lb/>enjoy; we were not, therefore, in such a<lb/>
       
       
            <cb/>
           
           position that any change must be for the<lb/>better. We had an increasing revenue,<lb/>which it was acknowledged, would double<lb/>itself every twelve years. But what was<lb/>the state of matters in the Dominion? The<lb/>Upper Canadians were asking for a tariff of<lb/>20 per cent, and the opening up of the<lb/>North West. Before all the schemes<lb/>which the Dominion had undertaken were<lb/>completed, he (Mr. H.) believed the tariff<lb/>would be still higher than 20 per cent.<lb/>There had been a great deal of figuring as<lb/>to what this Island would gain or lose were<lb/>we to accept the Better Terms. One set<lb/>of financiers had pronounced that these<lb/>terms would be a gain of £23,000 to the<lb/>Colony. Then we had a Tabular state<lb break="no"/>ment, very ably prepared, but yet inaccu<lb break="no"/>rate, which showed that the Better Terms<lb/>would give some £12,000 to the credit of<lb/>the Colony. In calculations of this kind,<lb/>there must be much about them which<lb/>would be uncertain, but the committee that<lb/>had prepared the report in question had<lb/>blundered sadly bout certain articles, such<lb/>as rum, dry goods, &amp;c., which showed that<lb/>they were not the ablest financiers. He<lb/>(Mr. H.) had endeavored to make a state<lb break="no"/>ment, but he had failed to bring it near<lb/>either of those to which he had referred.<lb/>He would give it briefly, and the House<lb/>and the country might judge of it for<lb/>themselves. The estimates of the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion, as just published, for the fiscal year<lb/>ending June 30, 1871, was $23,915,917,<lb/>from which deduct for the Intercolonial<lb/>Railway $6,000,000, which would leave<lb/>$17,915,917. Our share of this amount,<lb/>namely the 40th part, would amount to<lb/>about £140,000 currency. All that we<lb/>would receive in subsidies, salaries, &amp;c.,<lb/>from the Dominion would be about £90,000,<lb/>thus leaving a loss to the Colony for the<lb/>current year of some £50,000, which would<lb/>go on increasing as the taxation or expenses<lb/>of the Dominion increased. After consid<lb break="no"/>ering these figures the thought no sensible<lb/>person would think of going into confeder<lb break="no"/>ation. He considered it his duty to meet<lb/>a statement of the hon. leader of the Oppo<lb break="no"/>sition with respect to the public accounts,<lb/>when he was attempting to show that the<lb/>finances of the Colony were not in a satis<lb break="no"/>factory state. He said that the returns of<lb/>the Land Office for last year showed a bal<lb break="no"/>ance of £154 on the wrong side of the books.<lb/>This was a very disingenuous way of stating<lb/>the case.

     <lb/>
     £8,636, but of that amount some £5,839

     <lb/>of members of the government, as they did 
     <lb/>not wish to commit themselves, until they 
     <lb/>saw how public opinion would turn. The 
     <lb/>first minute was dated the 7th January, 
     <lb/>some days before the proposals of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion Government were made public, con<lb break="no"/>sequently it could not be said that the, 
     <lb/>Executive waited to see what turn public

     <lb/>members of the government entertained 
     <lb/>the same ideas respecting the better terms 
     <lb/>on the first day they saw them as they did 
     <lb/>now. And he did not see how they could 
     <lb/>arrive at any other opinions. Besides the 
     <lb/>more extended Minute of Council of 4th 
     <lb/>February did not differ in sentiment from 
     <lb/>the short one prepared by a committee of

     young nationality like Canada.</hi> Then, as to the 
     <lb/>
     need of Revenue whence does it arise? Accord<lb break="no"/>ing to the showing of the Government and its 
     <lb/>
     Finance Minister, it, for the most part, is enabled 
     <lb/>
                  to rejoice in a surplus. <hi rendition="simple:italic">But this is not the fact. 
     <lb/>It is a scandalous and most reprehensible perversion 
     <lb/>of fact.</hi> By dragging into the Revenue account 
     <lb/>large sums of money which do not belong to it— 
     <lb/>sums of money which belong to 'capital' ac<lb break="no"/>counts or 'open' accounts—the Government 
     <lb/>show a surplus of revenue over expendi<lb break="no"/>ture. Last year, it appears, our Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had a revenue of over $600,000 
     <lb/>from ' premium and discount !"  But the princi<lb break="no"/>pal part of this large revenue was derived from 
     <lb/>the premium which the Intercolonial Railway 
     <lb/>loan was sold for, which loan and any premium 
     <lb/>derived from its sale, ought to be sacredly de<lb break="no"/>voted to one single object, namely, that for which 
     <lb/>it was obtained.   So with several other items in 
     <lb/>both sides of the account, an account which 
     <lb/>shows that Canada, instead of making money by 
                  <lb/>'premium and discount', is paying the <hi rendition="simple:italic">enormous 
                     <lb/>sum of over</hi> $280,000 <hi rendition="simple:italic">a year to its banker, on this 
     <lb/>side of the water</hi>, for 'managing' the public debt, 
     <lb/>a duty which ought to be performed by the Fin<lb break="no"/>ance Minister and his deputies and subordinates. 
     <lb/> The Government thus leads the people to think 
     <lb/>that no additional taxes are needed, especially as 
     <lb/>the great public works are undertaken out of 
     <lb/>revenue. This causes no little grumbling, and 
     <lb/>allowing to the reprehensible and demoralizing 
     <lb/>financial strategy of the Finance Minister. 
     <lb/>

     "The facts are otherwise. The opening up of 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest, the protection and management 
     <lb/>
     of the Fisheries, the Census, the payment of the 
     <lb/>
     interest on Provincial debts, largely increased by 
     <lb/>
     Railway subsidies and outlays in Canals, and now 
     <lb/>
     constituting the debt of Canada—these and other 
     <lb/>
               expenditures <hi rendition="simple:italic">connected with the material develop<lb break="no"/>ment of the country and the promotion of its best 
     <lb/>
     interests, create a necessity for an increased revenue. 
     <lb/>
     If these facts were frankly admitted, instead of 
     <lb/>
     being concealed and misrepresented, and if all pos<lb break="no"/>sible reductions were made in the general expendi<lb break="no"/>ture, the people would not grumble.</hi> They would 
     <lb/>
     rather give the Government a suitable revenue 
     <lb/>
     than have it pay a quarter of a million of dollars 
     <lb/>
     a year for 'managing' its debt; making forced 
     <lb/>
     loans in several different forms, endangering the 
     <lb/>
     convertibility of  our currency and menacing us

     This view of the Executive with respect to 
     <lb/>
    public works would also bear investigation. 
     <lb/>He might likewise go over the whole of the 
     <lb/>minute of Council in the same way, and 
     <lb/>nothing could be found in it of which the 
     <lb/>government need be ashamed. We had 
     <lb/>been told our voice would not be listened  
     <lb/>to by the British Government, if we re<lb break="no"/>mained out of Union, and the fact that our 
     <lb/>postage to and from the mother country 
     <lb/>had not been lowered, at the time it was 
     <lb/>granted to the Dominion, had been quoted 
     <lb/>as an evidence of this. But when it ap<lb break="no"/>peared that said reduction of postage did 
     <lb/>not apply to the Island, it was brought to 
     <lb/>the notice of the Home authorities, who at 
     <lb/>once agreed to extend it to this Island, and 
     <lb/>ordered that it should go into operation on 
     <lb/>the first of June next. So it seemed that 
     <lb/>our applications were not altogether un<lb break="no"/>heeded in Britain, notwithstanding that we 
     <lb/>were no part of the Dominion. He (Mr.

     the hon. member into figures, as the hon.

     first say that as the hon. member for

     Souris, (Mr. McLean) came from where 
     <lb/>
     the wise men once did, he seemed to

     the wisdom of those who presented

     offerings to the Son of the Highest.

     But as the hon. member was a young

     his position. In saying this, he (Mr. B )

     alluded to the remarks the hon. member

     believed when the better'terms came

     down, the hon. member, Mr. Callbeck, 
     <lb/>
     was enamoured with them. But the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member was correct in what he 
     <lb/>
     told the House; he retured to his cham<lb break="no"/>ber alone to peruse them, and afterwards 
     <lb/>
     thought his first impression was but a 
     <lb/>
     will-o'-the-wisp. But he believed the

     the hon. member was, previous to that,

     a confederate.

     not but think the hon. gentleman had

     ask the hon. leader of the government, 
     <lb/>
     in this House, in what position, as a

     <lb/>

     the entire exclusion of that view of the

     <lb/>
     which the hon. gentleman had so elabor<lb break="no"/>ately drawn the attention of that hon.

     committee. He (Mr. B.) despised the 
     <lb/>
     attempt which had been made to pre<lb break="no"/>judice Scotchmen against him, because 
     <lb/>
     he said that at the time of the union, 
     <lb/>
     Seotchmen, to a great extent, were a 
     <lb/>
     lawless people. All knew that it was 
     <lb/>
     not until 1745, that the administration 
     <lb/>
    of justice could be fairly dispensed in 
     <lb/>that country, and he would say now, 
     <lb/>what he did on a former occasion, that 
     <lb/>Scotchmeu, from that position, soon be<lb break="no"/>came, in every respect, the reverse of 
     <lb/>what they formerly had been, and no 
     <lb/>country in the world, considering its 
     <lb/>area and population, could boast of as 
     <lb/>many men occupying important posi<lb break="no"/>tions in the world, as Scotland could. 
     <lb/>Even the wise man from the East, he 
     <lb/>meant the hon. member for Souris, was 
     <lb/>a Scotchman. But as his hon. colleague 
     <lb/>said, there was noanalogy between the 
     <lb/>
     
     
            <cb/>
         
         
         
     union of Scotland or Ireland, with that 
     <lb/>
     existing between the Provinces of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion. The former was a legisla<lb break="no"/>tive, the latter a federal one ; and hon. 
     <lb/>
     members who reason from the effects of 
     <lb/>
     the one; to show the probable results of 
     <lb/>
     the other, ought to have more fully con<lb break="no"/>sidered the question before they made 
     <lb/>
     the statements they did. If this Island

     went into confederation, and sent proper

     they would find that the island would
