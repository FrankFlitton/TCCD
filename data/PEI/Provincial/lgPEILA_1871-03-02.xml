            <p> [<persName ref="pers:REIL1">Mr. REILLY</persName>.]
     The Americans fished where they pleased, 
     <lb/>
     and in one year the license fees paid here 
     <lb/>
     amounted to no more than £4. We know 
     <lb/>
     that a prominent American politician advis<lb break="no"/>ed his countrymen to come here armed, and 
     <lb/>
     to take the law into their own hands. I 
     <lb/>
     do not blame the Americans, if, desiring to 
     <lb/>
     annex these Colonies, they suppose that we 
     <lb/>
     can be forced into Annexation. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Consul General Potter, years ago, advised 
     <lb/>
     his Government that. if reciprocity were 
     <lb/>
     witheld, these North American Colonies 
     <lb/>
     would be starved into Annexation.

            <p>[<persName ref="pers:BREC1">Hon. ATTY. GENERAL</persName>] I believe that no greater ob<lb break="no"/>stacle to our obtaining from trade is to be<lb/>found, than in the utterance of Annexation<lb/>principles, because the Americans believe<lb/>
           
           
            <cb/>
          
          
     that Annexation will be forced on us, or the 
     <lb/>
    feeling in favor of it will be more extensive<lb break="no"/>ly diffused and intensified the longer they 
     <lb/>continue their present system of excluding 
     <lb/>us from their markets. While the hon. 
     <lb/>member from Cavendish (Mr McNeill) and 
     <lb/>others express sentiments in favor of An<lb break="no"/>nexation, they prevent the Americans con<lb break="no"/>ceding free trade by inducing them to hold 
     <lb/>it out as a lure to Annexation. Such 
     <lb/>sentiments find no response in the bosom of 
     <lb/>our peeple, who have a loyal and intelligent 
     <lb/>preference for their own institutions over 
     <lb/>those of our republican neighbors. The 
     <lb/>hon. member (Mr. McNeill) if he did not 
     <lb/>avow himself an Annexationist, yet went 
     <lb/>very near the line. [...]

            <p>
     I believe 
     <lb/>
     that we shall have free trade with the States 
     <lb/>
     as soon, and no sooner, than the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     of Canada.

     <persName ref="pers:MCNE1">Mr. MCNEILL</persName>—My remarks, to which 
     <lb/>
     the hon. Atty, General has taken excep<lb break="no"/>tion, were not an expression of a desire for an<lb break="no"/>nexation. I am no annexationist; but on 
     <lb/>
     the contrary am willing to live and die 
     <lb/>
     under the old flag. I merely refererred to 
     <lb/>
     changes which in the lapse of time, might 
     <lb/>
     probably take place, and 1 think I have 
     <lb/>
     heard the Hon. Atty. General state as his 
     <lb/>
     opinion that it was doubtful if, in ease of 
     <lb/>
     war with the United States, Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     could protect these Colonies. He stated 
     <lb/>
     that loyalty was now-a-days a question of 
     <lb/>
     the pocket. I have said, and I repeat that 
     <lb/>
     the British Government has treated this Is<lb break="no"/>land unfairly, it gave away the whole area 
     <lb/>
     of the Island and promised bounties to our 
     <lb/>
     fishermen which it afterwards refused to 
     <lb/>
     sanction.
