     <persName ref="pers:POPE2">Hon. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT</persName> [...]
     <lb/>

   A great many 
     <lb/>
     people had been led to believe that a railroad 
     <lb/>
     meant Confederation, and that the present 
     <lb/>
     Government were not to be trusted with its 
     <lb/>
     construction; but those who had been impos<lb break="no"/>ed upon, had been politically duped. He had 
     <lb/>
     only the other day heard a member of the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition say that he looked upon the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General as the man whom he would 
     <lb/>
     like to see leader of the Opposition. He had 
     <lb/>
     invited him to come over to the Government 
     <lb/>
    side ofthe House, and he believed the hon. 
     <lb/>member would yet do so. Although that hon. 
     <lb/>member was at a meeting held at the Link<lb break="no"/>letter Road where the railroad was opposed, 
     <lb/>yet a majority of his constituents would sup<lb break="no"/>port it. The people of the Linkletter Road 
     <lb/>were close to a good shipping place, and that 
     <lb/>was the reason why they were careless about 
     <lb/>the Railroad.
