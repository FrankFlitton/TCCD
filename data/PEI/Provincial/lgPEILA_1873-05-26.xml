            <p>which, the time within which, and the<lb/>laws and provisions under which the<lb/>first election of members to serve in<lb/>the House of Commons of Canada for<lb/>such Electoral Districts shall be held,<lb/>shall be such as the said House of the<lb/>Legislature of the said Colony of<lb/>Prince Edward Island, may specify in<lb/>their said Addresses.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>2nd. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Resolved</hi>, that this House con<lb break="no"/>curs in the above terms and conditions<lb/>of Union ; and that an humble Ad<lb break="no"/>dress be presented to Her Majesty,<lb/>that she will be graciously pleased, by<lb/>and with the advice of Her Most<lb/>Honorable Privy Council, under the<lb/>146th clause of the " British North<lb/>America Act, 1867," to unite Prince<lb/>Edward Island with the Dominion of<lb/>Canada on the terms and conditions<lb/>above set forth.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LAIR2">Mr. D. LAIRD</persName>.—If the influence of<lb/>his honor the Leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment was so great that he could easily<lb/>have negociated the loan of a sum of<lb/>money, from our Island capitalists,<lb/>without going out of the Colony, suffi<lb break="no"/>cient to meet the wants of the country,<lb/>why did he not use his great influence<lb/>to raise those debentures to par, the<lb/>moment he obtained the reins of<lb/>power, and thus have prevented the<lb/>necessity for taking the money out of<lb/>the Treasury to pay that note. If his<lb/>influence with that Bank was as great<lb/>as represented, all he had to do was to<lb/>negociate the sale, at par, of the de<lb break="no"/>bentures deposited in the Maritime<lb/>Bank, to prevent the necessity of tak<lb break="no"/>ing the gold out of the Colony. He<lb/>was in a position to issue an additional<lb/>quantity of Land Damage Debentures,<lb/>which, if his influence was sufficient,<lb/>he could have sold at par, and thus<lb/>have redeemed the note in question.<lb/>But it seems that he has no more in<lb break="no"/>fluence in getting our debentures<lb/>cashed at par than any other person, or<lb/>he would have done so long before this.<lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            The President and Vice President of<lb/>that Bank knew that Confederation<lb/>was certain to become an accomplished<lb/>fact with regard to this Island, and,<lb/>therefore, were quite willing, under<lb/>these circumstances, to take our de<lb break="no"/>bentures at their full value. If the<lb/>late Government had remained in<lb/>power, the gold would never have<lb/>been taken out of the Colony to re<lb break="no"/>deem that note, as the debentures<lb/>lying in the Bank as security, would<lb/>have been sold at par for its payment,<lb/>whenever Confederation became a<lb/>certainty. The hon. Leader of the<lb/>Government endeavors to make out<lb/>that if that note had not been redeem<lb break="no"/>ed in the way it was, the last delega<lb break="no"/>tion would have been thereby placed<lb/>at a disadvantage in obtaining better<lb/>Terms. Now, I maintain that his<lb/>whole argument before the Privy<lb/>Council for better Terms, was based<lb/>on the necessities of the Colony, from<lb/>rotten hemlock down to the repairing<lb/>of the Government House. If the<lb/>statement, so often made by his honor,<lb/>that the Railway was worth what it<lb/>cost, was correct, why did he not re<lb break="no"/>peat it at Ottawa ? If that assertion<lb/>were correct, we should receive the<lb/>$50 per head over and above the Rail<lb break="no"/>way debt. His honor knew, too well,<lb/>that the Dominion Government would<lb/>not be caught by such chaff as that.<lb/>The hon. member for Alberton de<lb break="no"/>clared, in this House, that the Rail<lb break="no"/>way would pay $50,000 per year over<lb/>working expenses, but he never ven<lb break="no"/>tured to put forth that argument at<lb/>Ottawa. The last delegates well<lb/>knew that the statements I made in<lb/>reference to the Railway, before the<lb/>Privy Council, were nearer the truth.<lb/>Hon. Mr. Haythorne and myself pre<lb break="no"/>sented the statement of the Chief En<lb break="no"/>gineer as to the working expenses and<lb/>receipts of the Railway, and said that<lb/>its friends and promoters calculated it<lb/>would be very soon self-sustaining.<lb/>-->

            <!-- IC, 2018-08-17, Commented out below as it precedes Debate Day -->
           <!--We gave the latter statement as the<lb/>opinion of the hon. Leader of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and his friends, and not as<lb/>our own. We did not entertain that<lb/>opinion ourselves, but we let it go for<lb/>what it was worth. In return we<lb/>were laughed at for our pains, and,<lb/>therefore, took good care not to repeat<lb/>the statement again. I never boasted<lb/>of my influence or ability ; but the<lb/>highest compliment has been paid me<lb/>this evening by his honor the Atty.<lb/>General, who says that I can keep<lb/>back Confederation or push it forward,<lb/>just as I please ! It seems that the<lb/>last delegates repeated our arguments<lb/>in reference to the Railway, but they<lb/>were choked off at once by the Privy<lb/>Council. They stated that the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature was not satisfied with the Terms.<lb/>In doing so, they gave ony one side<lb/>of the story, forgetting all about the<lb/>action of the Legislative Council and<lb/>the Opposition in this House. In this<lb/>correspondence we now have it stated<lb/>that the delegates to Quebec went un<lb break="no"/>authorized by the people of this Island.<lb/>This is certainly a great admission after<lb/>all that has been said on that subject.<lb/>The present Government party con<lb break="no"/>demned the late Government because<lb/>they appointed their delegation with<lb break="no"/>out convening the Legislature and<lb/>asking its consent to the action ; yet<lb/>the same men sent the delegation to<lb/>the Quebec Conference without the<lb/>authority of the people ! Scarcely<lb/>had the first delegation to Ottawa left<lb/>the Island, when an indignation meet<lb break="no"/>ing was called by the then Opposition,<lb/>and the resolution which was passed,<lb/>condemning the action of the late Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, was immediately sent to<lb/>Ottawa, for the purpose of thwarting<lb/>the delegates in obtaining fair and<lb/>reasonable terms of Confederation for<lb/>this Colony. They condemned the<lb/>late Government because it sent up<lb/>delegates to ascertain what Terms<lb/>Canada would offer for our acceptance.<lb/>
          

    
            <cb/>
           The hon. member for Charlottetown,<lb/>(Mr. Brecken) forgot his patriotism<lb/>and his duty to his country, and joined<lb/>in a declaration of indignation at the<lb/>conduct of the late Government in<lb/>merely sending up a delegation to<lb/>Ottawa, to ask what Terms they<lb/>would offer this Colony for its entrance<lb/>into the Dominion !<lb/>

     <lb/>had received from the Finance Minis<lb break="no"/>ter a correct copy of the resolution  
     <lb/>passed on the same question, by the 
     <lb/>Dominion Parliament, and as it was 
     <lb/> necessary that the resolution passed by 
     <lb/>this House should be similar in every   
     <lb/>respect, he would ask leave to with<lb break="no"/>draw the resolution now before the

     When the delegates were in Ottawa, a

     Minute of Council was drawn up in 
     <lb/>
     rather a hurry, and the Law Clerk of 
     <lb/>
     the House of Commons found it was 
     <lb/>
     necessary to extend it in certain par<lb break="no"/>ticulars in order to make it sufficiently

     elected by the people to accept them, 
     <lb/>
     and   to carry out Confederation with 
     <lb/>
    the   Dominion ; but as  still better 
     <lb/>Terms had been  obtained by the last 
     <lb/>delegation, he  would support the reso<lb break="no"/>1ution. The Haythorne-Laird  Terms 
     <lb/>had been submitted to the supporters 
     <lb/>of the late  Government, and as he ap<lb break="no"/>proved of them, he ran his election  
     <lb/>upon   them, and his action was endors<lb break="no"/>ed by his constituents. It would, in 
     <lb/>his opinion, have been a breach of 
     <lb/>faith on his part with the Government 
     <lb/>of the Dominion, if, on being elected 
     <lb/>to vote for the Terms first brought 
     <lb/>down, he had voted for the resolution 
     <lb/>asking the  appointment of a second 
     <lb/>delegation for the purpose of seeking  
     <lb/>better Terms. After endorsing the 
     <lb/>Terms then before the country to the 
     <lb/>extent of running an election upon 
     <lb/>them, the present Opposition were 
     <lb/>morally bound to support their adop<lb break="no"/>tion by the Legislature. The last  
     <lb/>delegation had brought fresh Terms, 
     <lb/>and its action had relieved him of the 
     <lb/>moral ties which held him in his for<lb break="no"/>mer position, so that he was now at 
     <lb/>liberty to exercise his judgment and 
     <lb/>vote upon the question as he thought 
     <lb/>proper. The Terms  obtained by 
     <lb/>Messrs. Haythorne and Laird, were, 
     <lb/>he believed, very good, and it was his 
     <lb/>opinion, that no other delegation would, 
     <lb/>at that time, if sent upon that mission, 
     <lb/>have secured better Terms. The last 
     <lb/> delegation had had an advantage over 
     <lb/>the first, and they have also done their  
     <lb/>duty. Both delegations were well en<lb break="no"/>titled to the approbation and thanks of 
     <lb/>that hon. House, as both had done 
     <lb/>their very best for the interests of this 
     <lb/>Island. The first delegation was gen<lb break="no"/>erally thought to have obtained as 
     <lb/>good Terms  as the Dominion could  
     <lb/>afford to allow this Colony, and how 
     <lb/>the extra  sum had been secured he 
     <lb/>could not understand, except that it 
     <lb/>was  through the anxiety of that Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to induce us to enter the 
     <lb/>union. The latter reason may have 
     <lb/>
      
            <cb/>
           
     justified them in giving us an addi<lb break="no"/>tional grant,  which, in his opinion, we 
     <lb/>
     shall find none too large for the neces<lb break="no"/>sities of this Colony. But it is more 
     <lb/>
     probable that the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment intend increasing the allowance 
     <lb/>
     to the other Provinces by a re-adjust<lb break="no"/>ment of their several  debts to the 
     <lb/>
     extent of an additional  $5 per head of 
     <lb/>
     their populations. If so, our gain 
     <lb/>
     from the increased allowance will not 
     <lb/>
     be so large as it would otherwise be.  
     <lb/>
     Be this as it may, he felt justified in 
     <lb/>
     giving the resolution his hearty sup<lb break="no"/>port.<lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCNE1">MR. McNEILL</persName> had previously given 
     <lb/>
     his views upon this great question of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. As both sides of the 
     <lb/>
     House now entertained  similar opinions 
     <lb/>
     on the matter, it could scarcely be 
     <lb/>
     called a party  question. The neces<lb break="no"/>sity for our accepting the Terms now 
     <lb/>
     before us was admitted by every hon. 
     <lb/>
     member of the House, with the ex<lb break="no"/>ception of Mr. Chairman and his hon. 
     <lb/>
     colleague, who were still of opinion 
     <lb/>
     that we could manage our own affairs  
     <lb/>
     better than the Dominion will do it for 
     <lb/>
     us ; but he (Mr. McN.)  believed even 
     <lb/>
     they would see, before the question 
     <lb/>
     was taken,  that the best course we 
     <lb/>
     could pursue, would be to cast in our 
     <lb/>
     lot with the great Dominion. When 
     <lb/>
     the Railway Bill was passed, he be<lb break="no"/>lieved it would land us in Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, but  did not think we should have 
     <lb/>
     to go in quite so soon. He thought 
     <lb/>
     that the money expended in the con<lb break="no"/>struction of the Railroad would supply 
     <lb/>
     sufficient exchange to enable us to 
     <lb/>
     meet the demands upon the Colony, 
     <lb/>
     but his expectations had not been veri<lb break="no"/>fied. The late Government found so 
     <lb/>
     many, and such great  difficulties to 
     <lb/>
     contend with, that they found it neces<lb break="no"/>sary, before matters went too far, 
     <lb/>
     to send up a delegation to Ottawa, 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose  of ascertaining what 
     <lb/>
     Terms the Dominion Government 
     <lb/>
     were willing to  offer us for our accept<lb break="no"/>

        ance. He gave both delegations credit 
     <lb/>for the manner in which they negociat<lb break="no"/>ed with the Canadian Government in 
     <lb/>obtaining the best possible Terms that 
     <lb/>could be secured for this Island. The 
     <lb/>Terms brought down by Messrs. Hay<lb break="no"/>thorne and Laird were considered at 
     <lb/>the time as extremely favorable, con<lb break="no"/>sidering the circumstances of the coun<lb break="no"/>try. The people, to a certain extent, 
     <lb/>had prepared themselves for going 
     <lb/>into Confederation, and the Terms 
     <lb/>were fully as good, or perhaps better 
     <lb/>than they expected. As they now see 
     <lb/>that it is a necessity, they accept the 
     <lb/>situation quietly, but solemnly. As 
     <lb/>regarded himself and his constituents, 
     <lb/>they regretted being placed in such a 
     <lb/>position that it was necessary to give 
     <lb/>up the coastitution of the Colony as a 
     <lb/>separate Province. He, himself, felt 
     <lb/>sorry to think that we were about to 
     <lb/>give tip self-government, after main<lb break="no"/>taining out position as a Colony with 
     <lb/>an independent Legislature, for one 
     <lb/>hundred years. The Island was 
     <lb/>originally separated from Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>through the influence of the proprie<lb break="no"/>tors who wished to get clear of the 
     <lb/>Court of Escheat, then established in 
     <lb/>that Province, but as that Court was 
     <lb/>not now in existence, they wished to 
     <lb/>get us into the Dominion. Perhaps 
     <lb/>the step we are about to take will 
     <lb/>prove a good one after all, and the 
     <lb/>host that can be taken under present 
     <lb/>circumstances. Both delegations had 
     <lb/>done their very best for the Colony, 
     <lb/>but the last one had not shown clearly 
     <lb/>the basis upon which it obtained the 
     <lb/>Terms now before the Committee. If 
     <lb/>the $5 have been obtained upon the 
     <lb/>basis of a readjustment of the debts of 
     <lb/>the several Provinces of the Dominion, 
     <lb/>the additional sum will not prove as 
     <lb/>great a boon as ifobtnincd upon other 
     <lb/>grounds. The hon. junior member for 
     <lb/>Belfast had been accused of saying a 
     <lb/>good many hard things against the 
     <lb/>statesmen of the Dominion; but he (Mr. 
     <lb/>McN.) believed that the latter had 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     also said a good many unpleasant 
     <lb/>
     things against that hon. member. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. jun. member for Belfast had, 
     <lb/>
     probably, never said as much against 
     <lb/>
     the statesmen of the Dominion as the 
     <lb/>
     latter had said against each other, and 
     <lb/>
     it was, therefore, highly probable that 
     <lb/>
    all those ill-feelings would be forgotten 
     <lb/>when this Colony forms a part of the 
     <lb/>great Dominion. He thought the ad<lb break="no"/>ditional Terms had been obtained 
     <lb/>more through the impertunity ofthe 
     <lb/>delegates, than through any particular 
     <lb/>line of argument. In whatever way 
     <lb/>the additional sum has been secured to 
     <lb/>this Colony, we should be glad that it 
     <lb/>has been granted us. One of the most. 
     <lb/>important concessions in the Terms is 
     <lb/>that the Dominion agrees to assume 
     <lb/>our Railway debt, and to work the 
     <lb/>Railway at its own expense. Whether 
     <lb/>we should be obliged to remain in the 
     <lb/>Dominion, if Canada at any time re<lb break="no"/>fused to sustain the Railway and keep 
     <lb/>it in working order, he did not know. 
     <lb/>He thought the Dominion should be 
     <lb/>bound to replace the sleepers when 
     <lb/>required, and to run the Railway. He 
     <lb/>supposed the time was come for us to 
     <lb/>give up our separate Government, and 
     <lb/>that. we should bow to what he hoped 
     <lb/>would ultimately prove to be for our 
     <lb/>benefit. He did not wish to take up 
     <lb/>much of the time o! the House, as it 
     <lb/>was necessary that country members 
     <lb/>should soon return to their homes, but 
     <lb/>he had to state that he gave up our 
     <lb/>separate Government, as a Colony, 
     <lb/>with regret. We were giving up the 
     <lb/>power of taxation, and in return would 
     <lb/>in his opinion, receive little benefit 
     <lb/>from the public works of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion. There was no doubt that we 
     <lb/>would receive a present benefit by ac<lb break="no"/>cepting Confederation; but he believed 
     <lb/>we should be losers in the end. A 
     <lb/>little branch line of Railway had been 
     <lb/>asked for Port Hill, which had not 
     <lb/>been granted, but he hoped before 
     <lb/>long a short branch would be built to 
     <lb/>Rustico. There was no longer any 
     <lb/>

     doubt that the Railway will never be 
     <lb/>
     a paying affair in this little Island, as 
     <lb/>
     we haVe no connection by land with 
     <lb/>
     any othercOuntry. He did not believe 
     <lb/>
     that the road Would ever pay the in<lb break="no"/>terest of the money expended 'in its 
     <lb/>
    construction, and this was the princi<lb break="no"/>pal reason why he would support a 
     <lb/>measure to hand over our little Island 
     <lb/>to the Dominion of Canada. If the 
     <lb/>present offer was not accepted, he be<lb break="no"/>haved we should fare worse than if 
     <lb/>included in the Dominion. One cir<lb break="no"/>cumstance gave him much to hope for. 
     <lb/>We belong to the great continent of 
     <lb/>America, and it was probable that be<lb break="no"/>fore long a uhion would take place be<lb break="no"/>tween the Dominion of Canada and 
     <lb/>the United States ofAmerica, if so, we 
     <lb/>should yet form a part of one of the

     <persName ref="pers:SULL1">Hon. Mr. SULLIVAN</persName> thought he 
     <lb/>
     would have had an opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     making a few remarks before the de<lb break="no"/>bate had arrived at that stage, but was 
     <lb/>
     prevented, owing to the fact that the 
     <lb/>
     time had been so completely occupied. 
     <lb/>
     It was satisfactory to know, that, after 
     <lb/>
     all the discussion and rambling re<lb break="no"/>marks made by hon. members, the 
     <lb/>
     resolution would be almost unanim<lb break="no"/>ously passed by the Committee. Some 
     <lb/>
     eavillipg had been made about the 
     <lb/>
     Terms now before the Committee, and 
     <lb/>
     some hon. members had endeavored to 
     <lb/>
    show that they were little better than 
     <lb/>those brought down by Messrs. Hay<lb break="no"/>thorne and Laird. Certain hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Opposition were not satis<lb break="no"/>fied, because, as they asserted, no basis 
     <lb/>had been shown as to the manner in 
     <lb/>which the Terms had been obtained. 
     <lb/>This was, in his opinion, a matter in 
     <lb/>which the country took little or no in<lb break="no"/>terest, as long as the Terms were fair 
     <lb/>and reasonable, and such as we might 
     <lb/>with confidence accept. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Murray Harbor stated there was 
     <lb/>reason to believe that the additional 
     <lb/>$5 per head was obtained on the basis 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     of a re-arrangement of the assumed 
     <lb/>
     debts of the other Provinces of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion. He (Mr. S.) could not 
     <lb/>
     agree with that hon. member as the 
     <lb/>
     Terms plainly state that it has been 
     <lb/>
     allowed this Colony, in consideration 
     <lb/>
     of the large expenditure authorized by 
     <lb/>
     the Parliament of Canada for the con<lb break="no"/>struction of Railways and Canals, as 
     <lb/>
     well as our isolated and exceptional 
     <lb/>
     condition. We shall receive the sum 
     <lb/>
     of $50 per head till the rearrange<lb break="no"/>ment takes place, which may be some 
     <lb/>years hence. The hon. Leader of the 
     <lb/>Opposition seemed to be dissatisfied 
     <lb/>because the delegates had not shown 
     <lb/>as clearly as he wished, the reasons 
     <lb/>they advanced before. the Privy Coun. 
     <lb/>oil for the additional allowance. The 
     <lb/>former delegates asked for $56 per 
     <lb/>head. and received $45, while the 
     <lb/>latter delegates asked for $51 per head. 
     <lb/>and received $50. If the last delega<lb break="no"/>tion could not show a satisfactory basis 
     <lb/>for their claim of $51 per head, how 
     <lb/>could Messrs. Haythorne and Laird 
     <lb/>show good reason for their claim of 
     <lb/>$58 per head ? I think the Terms 
     <lb/>now before us must satisfy all parties; 
     <lb/>and the people generally will accept 
     <lb/>them as fair and reasonable to this 
     <lb/>Colony. There is nothing left, there<lb break="no"/>fore, to prevent a speedy consumma<lb break="no"/>tion of the union ofthe Island with 
     <lb/>the Dominion of Canada. He (Mr. 
     <lb/>S.) had not, till lately, been in favor 
     <lb/>of Confederation, but he agreed with 
     <lb/>the hon. member for Rustico, that, 
     <lb/>under present circumstances, there was 
     <lb/>no use in our fighting against it. There 
     <lb/>was every reason to believe that we 
     <lb/>should never regret, in the future, of 
     <lb/>having cast in our lot with the great 
     <lb/>Dominion. Both delegations had, 
     <lb/>in his opinion. done their best to ob<lb break="no"/>tain as liberal Terms as possible. A 
     <lb/>good deal of praise was due to the 
     <lb/>hon. junior member for Belfast for his 
     <lb/>long and persistent opposition to Con<lb break="no"/>federation, as it had been the means of 
     <lb/>enabling us to make a better bargain.

     obtained fair and reasonable Terms, 
     <lb/>
     we should be satisfied to accept them 
     <lb/>
     with good grace. Our entrance into 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion would, to a very great 
     <lb/>
     extent, be the means of settling old 
     <lb/>
     party differences and questions which 
     <lb/>
     should, long ago, have been allowed to 
     <lb/>
     die out. If so, Confederation would 
     <lb/>
     prove a great boon to this Colony.

     <persName ref="pers:BEER2">MR. BEER</persName> had canvassed his <choice><sic>dis<lb break="no"/>rict</sic><corr>district</corr></choice> as a Confederate, and had been 
     <lb/>
     returned to that House to support the 
     <lb/>
     Terms brought down from Ottawa by 
     <lb/>
     Messrs. Haythorne and Laird. He 
     <lb/>
     had voted against the resolution to 
     <lb/>
     appoint another delegation, because he 
     <lb/>
     believed that no better Terms than those 
     <lb/>
     then before the country, could be ob<lb break="no"/>tained ; and was still of opinion that 
     <lb/>
     be had good reason for acting as he 
     <lb/>
     did. The wording of that resolution 
     <lb/>
     was such that he could not vote for it, 
     <lb/>
     without violating the principles upon 
     <lb/>
     which he was elected. He could not 
     <lb/>
     promise to ratify whatever Terms the 
     <lb/>
     delegation, appointed by the present 
     <lb/>
     Government chose to negociate. The 
     <lb/>
     last delegates had done well in ob<lb break="no"/>taining an additional sum of $25,000. 
     <lb/>
     He would have been glad to have 
     <lb/>
     seen that amount doubled, but we 
     <lb/>
     should be satisfied with the handsome 
     <lb/>
     sum which had been secured. It was 
     <lb/>
     not probable that any additional con<lb break="no"/>cession would be made to this Colony 
     <lb/>
     for a long time to come, as we had 
     <lb/>
     been liberally dealt with by the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the Dominion. Of all the 
     <lb/>
     Lighthouses, Drill Sheds, Breakwaters, 
     <lb/>&amp;c., mentioned by his honor the 
     <lb/>Leader of the Gorernment, before  
     <lb/>
           

    
            <cb/>
           
     setting out for Ottawa, as public 
     <lb/>
     works for the construction of which we 
     <lb/>
     had a good claim upon the Dominion, 
     <lb/>
     not one was mentioned by the delega:<lb break="no"/>tes in their negociations with the 
     <lb/>
     Privy Council, proving that they did 
     <lb/>
     not base their claims on the omissions 
     <lb/>
     of the former delegates. Before the 
     <lb/>
     last delegation was appointed, it was 
     <lb/>
     rumored that the Government in<lb break="no"/>tended to ask the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to allow us to retain the Rail<lb break="no"/>way, that we might work it ourselves. 
     <lb/>
     He could not support a resolution 
     <lb/>
     which empowered the delegates to 
     <lb/>
     negociate terms upon those grounds, 
     <lb/>
     because he believed the Railway 
     <lb/>
     would prove a losing affair for years 
     <lb/>
     to come. He was well pleased with 
     <lb/>
     the action of the delegates in obtain<lb break="no"/>ing the increased allowance, and would 
     <lb/>
     support the resolution before the Com<lb break="no"/>mittee.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SINC6">MR. SINCLAIR</persName> thought the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Rustico should heartily 
     <lb/>
     support the resolution, because Con<lb break="no"/>federation would be the means of put<lb break="no"/>ting an end to the much vexed Land 
     <lb/>
     Question and Tenant League troubles. 
     <lb/>
     If anything would secure  free lands 
     <lb/>
     for the people of this Colony, it was 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, as the Terms amply 
     <lb/>
     provided for the purchase of the pro<lb break="no"/>prietory estates. He believed that 
     <lb/>
     this Island would improvejn its agri<lb break="no"/>cultural, commercial and fishing opera<lb break="no"/>tions, at a more rapid rate than it ever 
     <lb/>
     had done, and that general prosperity 
     <lb/>
     would be the result. The  Colony 
     <lb/>
     would occupy a better financial posi<lb break="no"/>tion than ever before, as it would be 
     <lb/>
     entirely free from debt, and would re<lb break="no"/>ceive a sufficient Revenue to meet its 
     <lb/>
     requirements for many years to come. 
     <lb/>
    Our prosperity would not be caused 
     <lb/>by the amount we shall receive from 
     <lb/>the Dominion, but on account of our 
     <lb/>being relieved from financial embarass<lb break="no"/>ment, and from our enjoyment of free<lb/>

     and unrestricted intercourse and trade.  
     <lb/>
    with the neighboring Provinces. For 
     <lb/>these, and other reasons, which he 
     <lb/>would not now stop to give, he would 
     <lb/>support the resolution submitted by 
     <lb/>his honor the Leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LEFU2">Hon. Mr. LEFURGY</persName> was proud to 
     <lb/>
     say that  Confederation was at last 
     <lb/>
     about to be carried by an almost unani<lb break="no"/>mous vote of that hon. House.  Even 
     <lb/>
     the two hon. members for Bedeque, 
     <lb/>
     would be hoped, drop their opposition, 
     <lb/>
     and give the measure their hearty 
     <lb/>
     support. In  adopting its present 
     <lb/>
     course, the House of Assembly was, 
     <lb/>
     he believed, carrying out the wishes of 
     <lb/>
     a very large majority of the people of 
     <lb/>
     this  Colony. There were some locali<lb break="no"/>ties, very probably, the people of which 
     <lb/>
     would rather retain their self govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but they would ultimately see 
     <lb/>
     and feel the benefit of unrestricted in<lb break="no"/>tercourse with the Dominion. Can<lb break="no"/>ada was destined to be a great country, 
     <lb/>
     and there was no doubt we should en<lb break="no"/>joy our share of her commerce, and 
     <lb/>
     that our wealth and material prosperity 
     <lb/>
     would increase with hers. He be<lb break="no"/>lieved that the district which he repre<lb break="no"/>sented would bear him out in the 
     <lb/>
     course which he was then pursuing, as 
     <lb/>
     the people now saw that Confederation 
     <lb/>
     would benefit this Colony in every 
     <lb/>
     way. During his canvass at the late 
     <lb/>
     election, he had pledged himself to 
     <lb/>
     endeavor to obtain better Terms than 
     <lb/>
     those then before the country, and he 
     <lb/>
     had now fulfilled his promise to his 
     <lb/>
     constituents. He was glad that [the 
     <lb/>
     delegates had obtained better Terms, 
     <lb/>
     and that the Opposition had heartily 
     <lb/>
     accepted them, although they did, at 
     <lb/>
     first, make some little objection to 
     <lb/>
     them on the ground that the basis upon 
     <lb/>
     which the Terms had been  obtained 
     <lb/>
     was not made quite clear enough by 
     <lb/>
     the hon. members who formed the 
     <lb/>
     delegation . As we had received the 
     <lb/>guarantee that an additional sum would<lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     be conceded to us, it did not make 
     <lb/>
    much difference what arguments had 
     <lb/>been advanced in order to obtain it. 
     <lb/>Including certain sums promised by 
     <lb/>the Dominion Government, for the 
     <lb/>conveyance of mails by inland steam 
     <lb/>communication, the additional amount 
     <lb/>obtained by the last delegation was 
     <lb/>$33,000, which was a very handsome 
     <lb/>sum, and would prevent our being 
     <lb/>forced to resort to local taxation as 
     <lb/>soon as we otherwise would. As this 
     <lb/>was but a small Colony, we should 
     <lb/>endeavor to elect six good men to 
     <lb/>represent our interests in the Do<lb break="no"/>minion House of Commons ; if we did 
     <lb/>this, our affairs would not be neglect<lb break="no"/>ed. We shall go into the Dominion 
     <lb/>with a large number of people ; and he 
     <lb/>believed she would deal liberally with 
     <lb/>us. He would, with much pleasure, 
     <lb/>support the resolution, as he felt confi<lb break="no"/>dent that under Confederation our 
     <lb/>affairs would be conducted in a far 
     <lb/>better and more satisfactory manner 
     <lb/>than ever before, and that all our 
     <lb/>little bickerings and old party differ<lb break="no"/>ences would be forgotten. Some of 
     <lb/>our foremost statesman would be taken 
     <lb/>away from our local Legislature to 
     <lb/>represent as in the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons, and others would take their 
     <lb/>places ; but he hoped and believed all 
     <lb/>would result in a happy and prosper<lb break="no"/>ous career for our littlle Island.

     <persName ref="pers:ROWE1">MR. ROWE</persName> said that the question 
     <lb/>
     now before the Committee was one of 
     <lb/>
     the most important that ever occupied 
     <lb/>
     the attention of the Legislature of this 
     <lb/>
     Colony, as we were now about to re<lb break="no"/>sign the constitution under which we 
     <lb/>
     had lived, and under which the Island 
     <lb/>
     had enjoyed a separate government for 
     <lb/>
     the last one hundred years. He had 
     <lb/>
     to confess that he  approached the  
     <lb/>
     question with mingled feelings of re<lb break="no"/>gret and pleasure. No doubt many

     assist in carrying out that great ques<lb break="no"/>tion of Confederation, expecting, there<lb break="no"/>by, that they would forward their own 
     <lb/>
     personal interests. Others may have 
     <lb/>
     had the interests of the country, gen<lb break="no"/>erally at heart, in assisting to bring 
     <lb/>
     this measure to completion, and, there<lb break="no"/>fore, deserved well of their fellow 
     <lb/>
     Colonists. He had, as was well known, 
     <lb/>
     taken his stand in opposition to Con<lb break="no"/>federation, but he had, in obedience to 
     <lb/>
     the wishes of the people of the Murray 
     <lb/>
     Harbor district, sunk his own <choice><sic>indi<lb break="no"/>dual</sic><corr>individual</corr></choice> opinions in reference to this ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and was prepared to give a will<lb break="no"/>ing support to the resolution. He 
     <lb/>
     believed that his constituents would 
     <lb/>
     not have gone in favor of the measure, 
     <lb/>
     were it not for circumstances over 
     <lb/>
     which they had no control. Indeed, 
     <lb/>
     he had reason to believe that his con<lb break="no"/>stituents regretted the circumstances 
     <lb/>
     which had placed them in their pre<lb break="no"/>sent position, and necessitated their 
     <lb/>
     acceptance of the Terms of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion now offered this Colony. Had it 
     <lb/>
     not been for the introduction of the 
     <lb/>
     Railway Bill, his constituency, and he 
     <lb/>
     believed other constituencies also, would 
     <lb/>
     still have rejected any offer Canada 
     <lb/>
     might make to this Colony to induce 
     <lb/>
     us to unite with her, as the peeple 
     <lb/>
     would have preferred to manage their 
     <lb/>
     own affairs as in times past. But there 
     <lb/>
     is, under our present circumstances, a 
     <lb/>
     necessity for our accepting Terms of 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, in order to escape 
     <lb/>
     financial embarassment. Great credit 
     <lb/>
     was due the former delegates who un<lb break="no"/>dertook to negociate Terms of union 
     <lb/>with Canada, when they saw the in<lb break="no"/>evitable consequences of the Railway 
     <lb/>policy, they must have had a consider<lb break="no"/>able amount of moral courage to have 
     <lb/>faced the danger as they did, know<lb break="no"/>ing that a large number of the 
     <lb/>people  of this Island were averse 
     <lb/>to Confederation. They opened up 
     <lb/>the ground for our receiving fair and  
     <lb/>reasonable Terms at the hands of the 
     <lb/>
           
    
            <cb/>
            
     Dominion Government ; but they did 
     <lb/>
     not cover the whole of it. Another 
     <lb/>
     delegation has been sent to Ottawa, 
     <lb/>
     clothed with greater authority, and 
     <lb/>
     has obtained still further concessions 
     <lb/>
     from the Dominion. Whether the 
     <lb/>
     present Terms are an absolute advance 
     <lb/>
     over the former Terms, time will pro<lb break="no"/>bably reveal ; he hoped they would 
     <lb/>
     prove to be so. In the Minute of 
     <lb/>
     Conference, he found a statement to 
     <lb/>
     the effect that the additional $5 was 
     <lb/>
     obtained " in view of the possibility of 
     <lb/>
     a re-adjustment of the financial arrange<lb break="no"/>ments between Canada and the several 
     <lb/>
     Provinces now embraced in the Do<lb break="no"/>minion." It seemed to him that each of 
     <lb/>
     the other Provinces would also receive 
     <lb/>
     a like amount per head of its population. 
     <lb/>
     The force of the language contained in 
     <lb/>
     the Minute of Conference rested on 
     <lb/>
     the force of the word "possibility." 
     <lb/>
     Who would dare to say that the Do<lb break="no"/>minion Government did not possess 
     <lb/>
    sufficient power to re-adjust the finan<lb break="no"/>cial arrangements with its several 
     <lb/>Provinces, and give the $5 per head 
     <lb/>all round? The extra sum now grant<lb break="no"/>ed this Colony, will be an absolute 
     <lb/>boon, until the other Provinces receive 
     <lb/>a similar amount in addition to their 
     <lb/>present allowances ; but when it is 
     <lb/>granted them, we shall have to con<lb break="no"/>tribute our proportion of the whole, 
     <lb/>and our real gain will then be very 
     <lb/>small indeed. The $2000 granted 
     <lb/>annually for telegraphic communica<lb break="no"/>tion, will be a direct advantage to this 
     <lb/>Colony, and he was willing to accord 
     <lb/>to the last delegation due credit in 
     <lb/>obtaining an additional amount from 
     <lb/>the Dominion whether it amounted to 
     <lb/>$25,000 or $2,000 only.  There was 
     <lb/>every reason to believe that we 
     <lb/>should require every cent of the 
     <lb/>amount we would receive from the 
     <lb/>Deminion. The hon. Leader of the 
     <lb/>Government and the hon. Attorney 
     <lb/>General seemed surprised that the 
     <lb/>Opposition did not accept their view 
     <lb/>

           of the Terms new offered this Colony. 
     <lb/>The first delegation was in a similar 
     <lb/>position, a few weeks ago, in reference 
     <lb/>to the Government. The Opposition 
     <lb/>were willing to accept the words of 
     <lb/>the Canadian Ministry and Lord 
     <lb/>Dufferin, when they said that no better 
     <lb/>Terms could possibly be granted this 
     <lb/>Island. The Government side of the 
     <lb/>House treated the statement in ques<lb break="no"/>tion with apparent disrespect, but they 
     <lb/>now came down and expected the Op<lb break="no"/>position to accept Terms which hear 
     <lb/>an entirely different construction, with<lb break="no"/>out expressing any doubt as to the 
     <lb/>basis upon which the additional allow<lb break="no"/>ance is granted. He most heartily 
     <lb/>accorded all due credit to the last dele<lb break="no"/>gation for the additional amount they 
     <lb/>had secured to this Colony, and would 
     <lb/>most cordially support the resolution 
     <lb/>before the Committee, in the interests 
     <lb/>of his constituents, and of the people of 
     <lb/>the whole Island.

     <persName ref="pers:MACE1">Hon. Mr. McEACHEN</persName> had, like Mr.

     <lb/>
     those who strongly abused the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian Ministry, for the part they had 
     <lb/>
     taken in endeavoring to bring about a 
     <lb/>
     union of this Island with the Do<lb break="no"/>minion. He had always considered

     them men of whom every true Briton

     <lb/>
     honest conviction that we could do for

     ourselves, better in every way, than 
     <lb/>
     Canada could do for us ; but our affairs

     that it was to our interest to accept

     with good grace the Terms now offered

     reason to believe that our interests 
     <lb/>
     would suffer by entering the Dominion,

     to such a degree, as some people im<lb break="no"/>agined. Some hon. members of the

     <lb/>
     accept the improved Terms, because 
     <lb/>
     they could not understand clearly the

     amcunt of money, merely because

     the last delegation, and from the first 
     <lb/>
     believed that they would procure bet<lb break="no"/>ter Terms because they had more

     <lb/>the representation is based on that of 
     <lb/>the province of Quebec, from which 
     <lb/>thousands of people are emigrating 
     <lb/>every year to Manitoba, where land is 
     <lb/>abundant and cheap. The population 
     <lb/>of Quebec will increase at a slower

     electoral districts, the additional mem<lb break="no"/>ber could be given to Queen's County.<lb/>All the arguments used by the dele<lb break="no"/>gates sent from this Island to the<lb/>Quebec Conference, in reference to<lb/>our representation in the House of 
     <lb/>Commons, were to the effect that two<lb/>members should be allowed each<lb/>County. When the hon. Leader of<lb/>the Opposition went up to Ottawa on<lb/>his late mission, he asked that two<lb/>members be allowed as the represen<lb break="no"/>tation of each County. It was pro<lb break="no"/>bable the hon. member still held the<lb/>same opinions in reference to this<lb/>matter, as at that time. There will,<lb/>probably, be two senators appointed<lb/>for Queen's County, and one for each<lb/>of the other Counties, which will, to a<lb/>certain extent, equalize the represen<lb break="no"/>tation. In Montreal East, the popula<lb break="no"/>tion represented by one member is<lb/>seventeen thousand, and in St. John<lb/>County, N. B., fifty-five thousand.<lb/>Representation by population is<lb/>not carried out in detail in the several<lb/>Provinces, although each Province<lb/>returns the number of representatives<lb/>to which its population entitles it.<lb/>There are members in the Dominion<lb/>Parliament who represent only some<lb/>200 or 300 voters, while others repre<lb break="no"/>sent more than 30,000. There is no<lb/>satisfactory way in which an additional<lb/>member can be allotted to any parti<lb break="no"/>cular portion of this Island, except by<lb/>allotting one to Queen's County under<lb/>the proposed arrangement, making<lb/>each County an electoral district,<lb/>which shall return two members.<lb/>Queen's County, will, no doubt, be<lb/>able to return two members who will<lb/>be a match for any other two returned<lb/>by the outlying Counties. The peo<lb break="no"/>ple should take care to return gentle<lb break="no"/>men able to exercise a pretty strong<lb/>influence in the Dominion Parliament,<lb/>in order that their interests may be<lb/>served in the best possible manner.<lb/>The only battle that will be fought by<lb/>

     our representatives in the House of<lb/>Commons will be to obtain, each for<lb/>his own district, as large a share of<lb/>the monies granted for local improve<lb break="no"/>ments, as possible. In our represen<lb break="no"/>tation in the Dominion Parliament,<lb/>there will be no sectional interests,<lb/>and probably no party lines. He<lb/>hoped to see out representatives in the<lb/>House of Commons stand shoulder to<lb/>shoulder for the interests of this Island<lb/>and those of the Maritime Provinces<lb/>as well. If this principle is fully car<lb break="no"/>ried out, we shall secure our share of<lb/>the monies granted for local works.<lb/>The Parliament and people of Canada<lb/>have a large, rich country, full of re<lb break="no"/>sources, and not half developed, and,<lb/>therefore, look upon this Island as a<lb/>very small place, still they earnestly<lb/>desire to have us united with them, as<lb/>we are a thriving people, and possess<lb/>a fertile and prosperous country.<lb/>Numbers of Canadians will find their<lb/>way down here in the summer season,<lb/>as they take a deep interest in our<lb/>little Island, and have always mani<lb break="no"/>fested a disposition to deal liberally<lb/>with us. He was satisfied we should<lb/>have our full share of influence in the<lb/>Dominion Parliament, and that we<lb/>should receive justice at its hands. As<lb/>we would have no local sectional in<lb break="no"/>terests to be represented in the House<lb/>of Commons, he could not see any<lb/>objection to giving each County an<lb/>equal representation, with the under<lb break="no"/>standing that when the increase of<lb/>population entitles this Island to an<lb/>additional representative, he shall be<lb/>allotted to Queen's County.<lb/></p>

If that<lb/>was the grand aim of the Canadians,<lb/>and yet not fully carried out in its<lb/>details, why might not we begin right,<lb/>at once, by dividing the Island into the<lb/>required number of electoral districts ?<lb/>It is unfiar that the people of Queen's<lb/>County should have to bear the heav<lb break="no"/>iest part of the burden of taxation, and<lb/>yet be deprived of the representation<lb/>to which they are entitled. They have<lb/>a good reason to complain of unfair<lb/>treatment, as they had to bear the<lb/>largest share of the Railway burden,<lb/>which was brought upon them by the<lb/>representatives from the outlying<lb/>Counties. They now claim their<lb/>rights in the representation to the Do<lb break="no"/>minion House of Commons, and are<lb/>fully entitled to them. It is the land<lb/>

           lying vacant in Prince County which<lb/>the hon. member for Summerside<lb/>wishes to see represented, or the in<lb break="no"/>dustrious and intelligent people of<lb/>Queen's County ? It seems to be the<lb/>former ! There is no fairer method of<lb/>representation than by population. He<lb/>(Mr. L.) did not boast of the superior<lb/>intelligence and wealth of the people<lb/>of Queen's County, compared with<lb/>those of the outlying Counties, but<lb/>contended that man for man, they were<lb/>as intelligent and as wealthy as the<lb/>people of either Prince County or<lb/>King's County, and, therefore, were,<lb/>on that ground, entitled to representa<lb break="no"/>tion according to their number. They<lb/>had no right to disfranchise, in order to<lb/>give the people of the other two Coun<lb break="no"/>ties a greater representation than they<lb/>were entitled to receive. Hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers who represent large constituen<lb break="no"/>cies are generally of opinion that the<lb/>smaller the constitution, the smaller<lb/>the men, or in other words " the<lb/>smaller the pond the smaller the<lb/>frogs." But we often find the re<lb break="no"/>verse to be the case. A great deal<lb/>had been said about the interests<lb/>of the outlying Counties, but not a<lb/>word about swamping the electors of<lb/>Queen's County, although it was well<lb/>known that the representation of the<lb/>latter was virtually swamped in that<lb/>House by the representatives of the<lb/>other Counties. All that he asked<lb/>for Queen's County was equality, and<lb/>nothing more. The views of her peo<lb break="no"/>ple were as much entitled to respect<lb/>as those of the people of the other<lb/>Counties, and were, therefore, entitled<lb/>to equal representation. The Pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec is divided into sixty-<lb break="yes"/>five electoral divisions, which were in<lb/>existence before the union took place,<lb/>and each division is entitled to return<lb/>one member only to the House of<lb/>Commons.

     would be passed in the same manner,

      hon. Leader of the Opposition in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to this Island. Ontario, it was<lb/>true, owing to its dense population,<lb/>had a member allotted to each Riding,<lb/>into which it was divided, but no por<lb break="no"/>tion of any County had been cut off<lb/>and joined to another detached portion<lb/>of another County. Some members<lb/>of the House of Commons represent<lb/>several thousands of electors, while<lb/>others represent only a few hundreds,<lb/>showing that although the principle of<lb/>representation by population was car<lb break="no"/>ried out with regard to each Province,<lb/>as a whole, it was not carried out with<lb/>regard to the electoral districts. The<lb/>hon. Leader of the Opposition had<lb/>made a statement to him (Mr. Pope)<lb/>to the effect that it would be better to<lb/>divide the Island into electoral dis<lb break="no"/>tricts, according to the Counties, than<lb/>to divide it into sections, irrespective<lb/>of the Counties. But the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber now objected to the division by<lb/>Counties, on the ground that an un<lb break="no"/>popular man might run his election<lb/>with a popular man, and thus secure<lb/>his return to the House of Commons.<lb/>The remedy for this difficulty would<lb/>be in the hands of the electors, who<lb/>would have the power to return the<lb/>men of their own choosing. He (Mr.<lb/>P.) would like to see Queen's County<lb/>with a larger representation than at<lb/>present intended, but as there will be<lb/>no sectional differences in our repre<lb break="no"/>sentation in the Dominion House of<lb/>Commons, the six members chosen<lb/>will represent the whole Island, and<lb/>its interests as a whole will receive<lb/>more attention than those of any par<lb break="no"/>ticular section. Our representatives<lb/>should all stand shoulder to shoulder for<lb/>the general interests of the Island, and<lb/>he could not, therefore, see what good<lb/>would be done by carrying out the<lb/>principles contained in the amendment.<lb/>As we shall be entitled to an addi<lb break="no"/>tional member whenever the popula<lb break="no"/>tion reaches the required number, a<lb/>re-arrangement of the whole plan<lb/>
            

    
            <cb/>
           
     would be required if the amendment     
     <lb/>were carried out. On the other hand,<lb/>if each County is made an electoral<lb/>district, the additional member can be<lb/>given to Queen's County, which will<lb/>then receive its full share of represen<lb break="no"/>tation. In the meantime, this County<lb/>will have a representation of two mem<lb break="no"/>bers in the Senate, while each of the<lb/>other Counties will have but one. As<lb/>the other resolution was passed by a<lb/>unanimous vote of that House, and as<lb/>it was intended to appoint a Com<lb break="no"/>mittee composed of members from<lb/>both sides of the House, to prepare an<lb/>Address to Her Majesty, in conformity<lb/>with the British North America Act,<lb/>he thought it a pity that the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion had brought in an amendment<lb/>which they were well aware they were<lb/>not able to carry, He hoped the hon.<lb/>Leader of the Opposition, who moved<lb/>the amendment, would withdraw it,<lb/>and that every hon. member of the<lb/>Opposition would give the original<lb/>resolution his support, in order that<lb/>there might be a unanimous vote on<lb/>the Address.<lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:HOWL2">Hon. Mr. HOWLAN</persName> said that the        
     <lb/>Province of Quebec was divided into<lb/>sixty-five electoral districts, composed<lb/>of its former electoral divisions, which<lb/>were left as they were. He concluded<lb/>that the representation of that Province<lb/>would not be increased with the in<lb break="no"/>crease of population, as in the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces. Each County in<lb/>Nova Scotia and New Brunswick was<lb/>constituted an electoral district, irres<lb break="no"/>pective of population, with the excep<lb break="no"/>tion of Halifax County in Nova Scotia,<lb/>and the County of St. John in New<lb/>Brunswick, which on account of con<lb break="no"/>taining the cities of Halifax and St.<lb/>John, were entitled to return two<lb/>members each. The only exception<lb/>to the rule of making each County an<lb/>electoral district, was Ontario, which<lb/>was divided into Counties, Ridings of<lb/>Counties, cities and parts of cities and<lb/>towns. As the neighbouring Provinces<lb/>

     had constituted each County an elec<lb break="no"/>tora1 district, we would only be fol<lb break="no"/>lowing their example in  doing the 
     <lb/>
     same with regard to this Island. 
     <lb/>
     Queen's County had always received 
     <lb/>
     the lion's share of the public money. 
     <lb/>
     The old argument that the people  of 
     <lb/>
     that County pay more towards the 
     <lb/>
     construction and maintenance of the 
     <lb/>
     Railway than those of the other 
     <lb/>
     Counties, would not do in the face of 
     <lb/>
     the fact that they had always received 
     <lb/>
     more than their share of the public 
     <lb/>
     money. The people of St. Peters, 
     <lb/>
     Souris, &amp;c., paid pro rata, for the con<lb break="no"/>struction of all the macadamized road 
     <lb/>
     in Qeeen's County ; but what amount 
     <lb/>
     of benefit did they rcceive from it ? 
     <lb/>
     What advantage did remote parts of 
     <lb/>
     the country receive from the large 
     <lb/>
     amount of money expended to main<lb break="no"/>tain steam communication, for many 
     <lb/>
     years past, between Charlottetown and 
     <lb/>
     the neighboring Provinces ? Prince 
     <lb/>
     County paid its share of the cost of 
     <lb/>
     steam communication for many years 
     <lb/>
     before it received the benefits of it. 
     <lb/>
     Whose money was contributed to pay 
     <lb/>
     for the erection of those expensive 
     <lb/>
     public buildings in Charlottetown ? 
     <lb/>
     Why should not the people in distant 
     <lb/>
     parts of the country have macadamized 
     <lb/>
     roads as well as Charlottetown and 
     <lb/>
     adjacent districts ? Those who ad<lb break="no"/>vocated the construction of a Railway 
     <lb/>
     were acting for the best interests of the 
     <lb/>
     people of the whole Island, when they 
     <lb/>
    did so, by making provision for dis<lb break="no"/>tricts, as well as more highly favored 
     <lb/>parts. Why should one hundred acres 
     <lb/>of land, situated at West River, be 
     <lb/>more valuable than an equal area in 
     <lb/>the western part of Prince County, 
     <lb/>where the soil is equally as good ? 
     <lb/>The farmers near Charlottetotvn have 
     <lb/>hitherto had a grand monopoly of our 
     <lb/>market, and it is now high time that 
     <lb/>those of more distant parts should share 
     <lb/>in the benefits of a ready market for 
     <lb/>their produce. A good deal has been 
     <lb/>said about the correspondence between 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     the last delegation and the Finance 
     <lb/>
    Minister of the Dominion. The for<lb break="no"/>mer delegation were so wise in their 
     <lb/>own eyes, that they thought the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of this Island did not want to see 
     <lb/>their correspondence, and the conse<lb break="no"/>quence is that there is not a line of it 
     <lb/>before the House. The last delegates 
     <lb/>placed their correspondence upon the 
     <lb/>table of the  House, and were not 
     <lb/>ashamed of it, in any respect. What 
     <lb/>the School Question had to do with the 
     <lb/>matter now before the Committee, be 
     <lb/>was at a loss to understand. When 
     <lb/>the hon. junior member for Belfast 
     <lb/>stated that he had no denominational 
     <lb/>influence at his back to carry his elec<lb break="no"/>tion, he stated what every gentleman 
     <lb/>within the sound of his voice knew to 
     <lb/>be false, and what he himself knew to 
     <lb/>be untrue. That hon. member, during 
     <lb/>his canvass, declared that the hon. 
     <lb/>Col. Gray was not to be trusted on the 
     <lb/>School Question, because he had stated 
     <lb/>at a public examination at St. Dun<lb break="no"/>stan's College, that if he had a son, he 
     <lb/>would entrust that institution with his 
     <lb/>education. For that reason alone, 
     <lb/>twelve hundred Protestants were be<lb break="no"/>sought to keep that hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>out of Parliament. He (Mr. H.) be<lb break="no"/>lieved that the public mind was diseas<lb break="no"/>ed on that unfortunate School Ques<lb break="no"/>tion. When in Ottawa, he heard the 
     <lb/>hon. Hilliard Cameron, Grand Master 
     <lb/>of the Orange Lodges in the Dominion, 
     <lb/>speak in the House of Commons in 
     <lb/>favor of denominational schools, now 
     <lb/>established in Ontario, and receiving 
     <lb/>State aid. When a division took place 
     <lb/>in the House of Commons, in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the education question, almost 
     <lb/>the whole Protestant majority voted in 
     <lb/>favor of denominational education. It 
     <lb/>is a most extraordinary fact that the 
     <lb/>Protestantism of the Upper Provinces 
     <lb/>differs from the Protestantism of this 
     <lb/>Island in reference to this great ques<lb break="no"/>tion of education. The hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>Cameron said that there was not a 
     <lb/>single Protestant in Ontario, who 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="1873-05-26_Page_212"

     would seek to Fon the Catholics of de<lb break="no"/>nominational schools. Although the<lb/>Catholics of Ontario had enjoyed their<lb/>separate school system for fifteen years,<lb/>not a Protestant in the Province<lb/>sought to deprive them of it. The<lb/>only conclusion he could arrive at, was<lb/>that the public mind in this country<lb/>was diseased upon the School Question,<lb/>at the present time. Because Mr.<lb/>Hensley's Government in 1869 ex<lb break="no"/>tended the rites of hospitality to two<lb/>Canadian statesmen who visited this<lb/>Island, they were denounced by the<lb/>editor of the Patriotas Confederates ;<lb/>and the ministers of the Dominion<lb/>Government were abused and declared<lb/>to be " swells and pedlars." Four<lb/>years have passed away, and every<lb/>hon. member in the House is now in<lb/>favor of Confederation ! He (Mr. H.)<lb/>had no doubt but that the public mind<lb/>would undergo a similar change in<lb/>reference to the School Question, with<lb break="no"/>in the new few years. The time, he<lb/>believed, was not far distant, when that<lb/>question would not be used as a shuttle<lb break="no"/>cock by politicians, and when justice<lb/>would be done the Catholic minority<lb/>of this Island. He had been denounc<lb break="no"/>ed throughout the length and breadth<lb/>of the country, because he had, while<lb/>a member of the old Liberal Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, asked that His Lordship Bishop<lb/>McIntyre, be granted a proportionate<lb/>share of the public school funds, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the number of children<lb/>taught in his schools. If he had then<lb/>committed a sin, he was still a sin<lb break="no"/>ner in every respect, in reference<lb/>to that matter. He hoped and be<lb break="no"/>lieved the day would soon arrive when<lb/>Col. Gray would not be afraid to enter<lb/>a Catholic school, and express himself<lb/>frankly in reference to its management<lb/>and the good it was doing among the<lb/>youths of this Colony. If he (Mr. H.)<lb/>went into the new Methodist School,<lb/>and pronounced his opinion upon the<lb/>work it was performing, would that<lb/>
     
          
            <cb/>
           
     make him a Methodist ? By no      
     <lb/>means. Yet that was all that Col.<lb/>Gray did with reference to St. Dun<lb break="no"/>stan's College ; he did not express an<lb/>opinion in favor of Roman Catholicism.<lb/>He (Mr. H.) could not understand<lb/>why hon. members of that House could<lb/>not speak about farming, fishing, and<lb/>the arts and sciences, without flying<lb/>off at a tangent and getting alarmed on<lb/>the School Question. Such conduct<lb/>could only be compared to that of the<lb/>turkey cock, when he sees red flannel<lb/>–he makes off at full speed. It must<lb/>be a source of pleasure to the hon.<lb/>Col. Gray, when he reflects on the fact<lb/>that he lost his election through fear<lb/>lessly expressing his honest convictions<lb/>in reference to the denominational<lb/>school system.<lb/>

The hon.<lb/>member's remarks were impertinent<lb/>in the highest degrees but he [Mr.<lb/>L.] dared him to prove that his lan<lb break="no"/>guage had been impertinent in the<lb/>slightest degree. The first hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber who had, that evening, referred to<lb/>the School Question, was the hon,<lb/>Atty, General, who declared he would<lb/>tell him [Mr. L] a little about his<lb/>canvas in the Belfast district.

What he [Mr. L.] did state,<lb/>was, that if he found that gentleman's<lb/>conduct at variance with his profes<lb break="no"/>sions, he had a right to show it up<lb/>before the public man.

     <lb/>
     had it not been for the closing remarks 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. Leader of the Opposition, 
     <lb/>
     he would not have spoken.  He had 
     <lb/>
     hoped that all side issues would have 
     <lb/>
     been kept out ofthe debate, and that 
     <lb/>
     hon members on both sides of the 
     <lb/>
     House would have confined themselves 
     <lb/>
     to the important question before them, 
     <lb/>
     but it appeared that to the very last 
     <lb/>
     moment of the existence of our sepa<lb break="no"/>rate Legislature, hon. members were 
     <lb/>
     determined to drag into their debates 
     <lb/>
     questions that had nothing whatever 
     <lb/>
     to do with the sutbject before them. 
     <lb/>
     Anti-Confederation and Escheat had 
     <lb/>
     gone to the tomb of all the capulets, 
     <lb/>
     but the School Question had taken 
     <lb/>
     their place. He had heard an hon. 
     <lb/>
     member state, a few days since, that 
     <lb/>our Legislature had now been in ex<lb break="no"/>istence a century, and that when he<lb/>reflected on the change that was about<lb/>to take place, he did not know<lb/>whether to weep over the past or to<lb/>laugh for joy at the grand prospects of<lb/>the future of our little Colony. A<lb/>great deal had been said about the<lb/>iron rod, but he thought that the<lb/>greatest iron rod ever held over hon.<lb/>members of that House, was the iron<lb/>rod of the Opposition ! What did the<lb/>hon. Leader of the Opposition mean<lb/>by stating that if the House of As<lb break="no"/>
           
            <cb/>
               
          sembly did not give the Opposition<lb/>their rights, another House would do 
     <lb/>
     so? He (Mr. H.) never would con<lb break="no"/>sent that the  Legislative Council 
     <lb/>
     should dictate to the people how they 
     <lb/>
     shall be representedd in the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons. It seemed as if 
     <lb/>
     there had been 'a grand caucus of the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition, at which it had been de<lb break="no"/>cided that if their amendment could 
     <lb/>
     not be carried in the House of As<lb break="no"/>sembly, they would bring the question 
     <lb/>
     to a final issue in the Upper Branch, 
     <lb/>
     and throw out the Address to Her 
     <lb/>
     Majesty, altogether, unless the elec<lb break="no"/>toral districts are constituted accord<lb break="no"/>ing to the views of the minority ! 
     <lb/>
     But the threat would fall harmless. 
     <lb/>
     Let their Lordships—the Conscript 
     <lb/>
     Fathers as they are styled—imperil 
     <lb/>
     the Colony when she is on the verge 
     <lb/>
     of bankruptcy, and they will have to 
     <lb/>
     bear the responsibility of their political 
     <lb/>
     act. Matters had surely come too 
     <lb/>
     pretty pass in this Colony, when the 
     <lb/>
     minority in the House of Assembly 
     <lb/>
     threatened the majority that if they 
     <lb/>
     did not accede to their wishes, the 
     <lb/>
     Upper Branch of the Legislature 
     <lb/>
     would do so. They wanted an irres<lb break="no"/>ponsible body of Councillors to dictate 
     <lb/>
     to the people's Branch of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture, but such threats fell harmlessly 
     <lb/>
    upon the majority of the House of 
     <lb/>Assembly, which had the right to say 
     <lb/>how this Island should be divided into 
     <lb/>electoral districts for representation in 
     <lb/>the Dominion House of Commons.<lb/>
            </p>
  
            <p>
     
     <persName ref="pers:LAIR2">MR. LAIRD</persName> had held no threats 
     <lb/>
     over the majority of the House of As<lb break="no"/>sembly, but he had stated that although 
     <lb/>
     for the time being the Liberal Party 
     <lb/>
     were in a minority in the House of 
     <lb/>
     Assembly, they were not in a minority 
     <lb/>
     everywhere in the Legislature, and 
     <lb/>
     that the principles held by the Oppo<lb break="no"/>sition were not those of a minority in 
     <lb/>
     the other end of the building. Itwas 
     <lb/>
     not long since the hon. Col. Secretary 
     <lb/>
     was glad to have himself wrapped in 
     <lb/>
     " swaddling clothes," as he delights to

     style matters in the Upper end. It 
     <lb/>
     was not in the power of the Gover<lb break="no"/>ment to force this measure through the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature, and to make it the law of 
     <lb/>
     the land, contrary to the wishes of the 
     <lb/>
     people, as they did the Railway Bill. 
     <lb/>
     The Opposition were not disposed to 
     <lb/>
     be so obedient as to be  frightened by 
     <lb/>
     the iron rod of the Government into 
     <lb/>
     allowing the measure brought down 
     <lb/>
     by the latter to pass without a protest. 
     <lb/>
    He believed that if the present Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment were to appeal to the country 
     <lb/>at that moment,  they would not be 
     <lb/>able to bring back a majority to that 
     <lb/>House. It was in vain for the hon. 
     <lb/>Col. Secretary to say he would put 
     <lb/>the Upper Branch at defiance, as he 
     <lb/>could not carry the measure, now be<lb break="no"/>fore the Committee, into effect, with<lb break="no"/>out its assistance. The hon. member 
     <lb/>had, at last, confessed that the country 
     <lb/>was on the verge  of bankruptcy. 
     <lb/>What an argument to employ for the 
     <lb/>purpose of forcing the Opposition to 
     <lb/>vote for the measure before the Com<lb break="no"/>mittee ! The Government had, at 
     <lb/>last, to confess that they had brought 
     <lb/>the country to the verge of bankruptcy 
     <lb/>by their Railway policy!

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI3">Mr. L. H. DAVIES</persName> did not wonder<lb/>that the hon.Leader of the Opposition<lb/>could not sit silent after the imperti<lb break="no"/>nent remarks of certain gentleman on<lb/>the other side of the House. He<lb/>could understand the remarks of his<lb/>honor the Leader of the Government,<lb/>when he expressed the hope that the<lb/>measure would be passed unanimously,<lb/>but he, was surprised at the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for St. Peters accusing the Oppo<lb/>sition of impertinence. It was very<lb/>easy for his honor the Col. Secretary<lb/>to tell the Opposition that he would<lb/>carry the resolution in spite of them,<lb/>but it would have looked more manly<lb/>if he had spoken to the question, as<lb/>one of a number, instead of acting in<lb/>such a dictatorial manner. The hon.<lb/>members of the Opposition felt taht<lb/>they were right in pursuing the course<lb/>
     
           
            <cb/>
          
     they had taken. As the delegation      
     <lb/>appointed by the late Government,<lb/>had, in their negociations with the<lb/>Government of the Dominion, obtained<lb/>Terms which the Opposition were<lb/>elected to support, the latter would<lb/>have been false to their principles, if<lb/>they had swallowed them and voted<lb/>blindly for a resolution appoiting<lb/>another delegation, and promising to<lb/>ratify whatever Terms the latter might<lb/>bring down from Ottawa. He was<lb/>sorry that insults had also been offered<lb/>to the Upper Branch of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture, during the debate. It was not,<lb/>to say the least, good policy, to tell the<lb/>Legislative Council that the House of<lb/>Assembly could pass the measure and<lb/>cause it to become the law of the land,<lb/>in spite of them.<lb/>
            </p>

   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCNE1">Mr. MCNEILL</persName> said that if each 
     <lb/>
     County were constituted an electoral  
     <lb/>
     district, Queen's County would not 
     <lb/>
     receive a fair representation in the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion House of Commons,although 
     <lb/>
     her people would compare favorably 
     <lb/>
     in numbers and intelligence, with those 
     <lb/>
     of the other two Counties united. The  
     <lb/>
     Island should be divided in such a 
     <lb/>
     manner as to give representation ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the population, to each dis<lb break="no"/>trict, and the very best men should be 
     <lb/>
     chosen to represent our people in the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion Parliament. A hard battle 
     <lb/>
     had been fought in Canada for the 
     <lb/>
     principle of representation by popula<lb break="no"/>tion, although it had not been carried 
     <lb/>
     out there in its details, as it should 
     <lb/>
     have been. The country should be  
     <lb/>
     divided into six districts, in order that 
     <lb/>
     each might be represented by one 
     <lb/>
     member only. This question should 
     <lb/>
     not be made a party measure, but 
     <lb/>
     should be discussed on its merits. 
     <lb/>
     Queen's County had never had her 
     <lb/>
     fair proportion of representation in 
     <lb/>
     that House, but a good opportunity 
     <lb/>
     now offered to give her a due share of

     hon. member for Rustice had been a 
     <lb/>representative of Queen's County for<lb/>several years, and yet had never been<lb/>a supporter of a Government in favor<lb/>of bringing down a measure to have<lb/>the country represented according to<lb/>population. The hon. member for<lb/>New London had been a Leader of a<lb/>Government before now, but he [Mr.<lb/>H.] never was aware, till the pre<lb break="no"/>sent time, that he was in favor of repre<lb break="no"/>sentation by population. He had<lb/>never heard the party to which those<lb/>hon. members belonged, agitate for<lb/>this princple till to-day.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SINC6">Mr. SINCLAIR</persName> said that if argument 
     <lb/>proved anything at all, the Opposition<lb/>had so far had the best of it; and he<lb/>believed the people, generally, would<lb/>approve the amendment before the<lb/>Committee. The question of repre<lb break="no"/>sentation had never before been before<lb/>the House since he had a seat in it.<lb/>He had often thought that Queen's<lb/>County had not had her fair share of<lb/>representation in that House, but had<lb/>never been so thoroughly convinced<lb/>of the fact till now. If ever the iron<lb/>rod had been threatened, it was on<lb/>that evening by the hon. Colonial<lb/>Secretary, who declared that whether<lb/>the Opposition wished the Island to be<lb/>divided according to Counties or not,<lb/>the measure submitted by the hon.<lb/>Leader of the Government would be<lb break="no"/>come the law of the land. To put off<lb/>Queen's County with only two repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives, while she has double the<lb/>population and wealth of each of<lb/>the other Counties, is unjust, un<lb break="no"/>reasonable, and countrary to the spirit of<lb/>the British North America Act.<lb/>Throughout the whole of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion, the principle of having only<lb/>one representative for each district,<lb/>was carried out so fully, that there is<lb/>not a single electoral district in the<lb/>whole country that has two represen<lb break="no"/>tatives in the House of Commons.<lb/>The Opposition had advanced the clear<lb break="no"/>est proofs and arguments to show the<lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     correctness of the principle they had 
     <lb/>laid down, but the question might just<lb/>as well be decided at once, as the<lb/>Government seemed determined to<lb/>carry their resolution.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CALL1">MR. CALLBECK</persName> had failed to per<lb break="no"/>ceive any argument from the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment side of the House to prove the<lb/>principle they had laid down to be a<lb/>sound one. Some hon. members of<lb/>the Government, had, as members of<lb/>our Banking Institutions, advocated<lb/>strongly against the very princple for<lb/>which they were now contending. As<lb/>Queen's County represented double<lb/>the wealth and population of each of<lb/>the other Counties, it was very<lb/>unjust that she should be deprived of<lb/>a proportional share of representation<lb/>in the Dominion House of Commons.<lb/>Never had so good an opportunity been<lb/>offered to secure justice to Queen's<lb/>County, as the present one. Repre<lb break="no"/>sentation by population was the only<lb/>just and equitable mode of settling the<lb/>question. If a large vote was all that<lb/>was wanted by the Government, they<lb/>could easily secure it by constituting<lb/>the whole Island one district, and let<lb break="no"/>ting the six members run for it.<lb/>When two representatives were allot<lb break="no"/>ted each district, the interests of the<lb/>minority were sunk altogether. The<lb/>principle of allotting one member to<lb/>each electoral district, was undoubtedly<lb/>the correct one, and should be adopted<lb/>in the present case. The plan pro<lb break="no"/>posed by the hon. Leader of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment was unfair and unreasonable,<lb/>and would deprive the people of<lb/>Queen's County of their just share<lb/>of representation. The general rule<lb/>observed throughout the Dominion<lb/>was to allow one member for each<lb/>district, and there was no reason why<lb/>it should not be carried out on this<lb/>Island. Neither precedent nor justice<lb/>would bear out the Government in<lb/>their present course. Some regard<lb/>should be had for the wishes of the<lb/>majority, as it was not a party ques<lb break="no"/>

     following:

     expenditure authorized by the Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada for the construction of 
     <lb/>
     Railways and Canals, and in view of

     <lb/>
     dollars per head of its population. as

     <lb/>
     having incurred debts equal to the sum

     half-yearly payments, in advance, from

     5. That, as the Government of 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island holds no lands 
     <lb/>
     from the Crown, and consequently en<lb break="no"/>joys no revenue from that source for 
     <lb/>'the construction and maintenance of 
     <lb/>local works, the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment shall pay by half-yearly instal<lb break="no"/>ments, in advance, to the Government 
     <lb/> of Prince Edward Island, Forty-five 
     <lb/>thousand dollars ($45,000) per-anunm,

     <lb/>hundred thousand dollars, (800,000), 
     <lb/>which the Dominion Government may 
     <lb/>advance to the Prince Edward Island 
     <lb/>Government, for the purchase of lands 
     <lb/>now held by large proprietors. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     6. That, in consideration of the 
     <lb/>
     transfer to the Parliament of Canada 
     <lb/>
     of the powers of taxation, the following 
     <lb/>
     sums shall be paid yearly by Canada 
     <lb/>

     dollars ($30,000), and an annual grant

     <lb/>
     half-yearly payments  in advance ; 
     <lb/>
     such grant of eighty cents per head to 
     <lb/>
     be augmented in proportion to the in<lb break="no"/>crease of population of the Island, as 
     <lb/>
     may be shewn by each subsequent 
     <lb/>
     decennial Census, until the population 
     <lb/>
     amounts to Four Hundred Thousand, 
     <lb/>
     at which rate such a grant shall there  
     <lb/>
     after remain, it being understood that

That the Union shall take place<lb/>on such day as Her Majesty may<lb/>direct by Order in Council, or Ad<lb break="no"/>dresses to that effect, from the Houses<lb/>of the Parliament of Canada, and of<lb/>the Legislature of the Colony of Prince<lb/>Edward Island, under the one hundred<lb/>and forty-sixth section of the "British<lb/>North America Act, 1867," and that<lb/>the Electoral Districts for which, the<lb/>time within which, and the laws and<lb/>provisions under which the first elec<lb break="no"/>tion of members to serve in the House<lb/>of Commons of Canada, for such Elec<lb break="no"/>toral Districts shall be held, shall be<lb/>such as the said Houses of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature of the said Colony of Prince<lb/>Edward Island may specify in their<lb/>said Addresses.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>2nd. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Resolved</hi>, That this House<lb/>concurs in the above terms of Union ;<lb/>and that an humble Address be pre<lb break="no"/>sented to Her Majesty, praying that<lb/>she will be graciously pleased, by and<lb/>with the advice of Her Most Honor<lb break="no"/>able Privy Council, under the 146th<lb/>clause of the " British North America<lb/>Act, 1867," to unite Prince Edward<lb/>Island with the Dominion of Canada<lb/>on the terms and conditions set forth.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LAIR2">MR. LAIRD</persName> said, Mr. Speaker, in<lb/>moving the amendments which have<lb/>been lost in Committee, I did so be<lb break="no"/>cause I thought such division of the<lb/>Island into electoral divisions for re<lb break="no"/>presentation in the Dominion, was due<lb/>to Queen's County, and did so from a<lb/>deep sense of what I considered to be<lb/>my duty, and not for the sake of oppo<lb break="no"/>sition or appearance. But as the<lb/>main resolutions have been reported<lb/>agreed to, I shall now, for the same<lb/>reason, press the same ammendments<lb/>upon the attention of this honorable<lb/>House. I refrain from doing so be<lb break="no"/>cause, since we are about agreeing to<lb/>accept of Confederation, it is very de<lb break="no"/>sirable we should vote unanimously on<lb/>the resolutions. I hope, therefore,<lb/>that the hon. members for Bedeque<lb/>will reconsider the matter. I can<lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
            assure you, Sir, I ask them in all sin<lb break="no"/>cerity to do so. Confederation has<lb/>become a necessity ; of this the hon.<lb/>members trust themselves feel satisfied,<lb/>therefore, it is the more desirable that<lb/>the representatives of the people<lb/>should all as one man record their vote<lb/>for the resolutions.<lb/>
            </p>
            
            <!-- Not sure about Mr. Howard below -->
            
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOWA1">MR. HOWARD</persName>.—Sir, the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber gives good advice, but I would<lb/>like him to put in practice what he<lb/>professes. His present advice does not<lb/>agree with many others which he<lb/>has given, nor am I prepared to say<lb/>that the one which he has given is<lb/>good. I opposed a union with the<lb/>Dominion of Canada from the first ;<lb/>and firmly believe we are taking a<lb/>step which will injure our fair little<lb/>Island. Indeed, I am surprised that<lb/>the hon. member should undertake to<lb/>advise me as to the course I should<lb/>pursue, or how I should vote. I am<lb/>responsible to the men who sent me<lb/>here, and if I wanted advice, they, and<lb/>not the hon. member, are the men I<lb/>would go to for it.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HOLL1">MR. HOLLAND</persName>.—It was not my in<lb break="no"/>tention to address you Sir, at this<lb/>advanced hour of the night, but as the<lb/>hon. member, the Leader of the Op<lb break="no"/>position, has thought proper to make<lb/>special reference to my hon. colleague<lb/>and myself, I feel that it is my duty to<lb/>do so. I assume the hon. members<lb/>imagine that as I voted for sending<lb/>the late delegates to Ottawa, I should<lb/>now support the present resolution.<lb/>But when I voted on that occasion I<lb/>had to choose between two evils ; and<lb/>the result has proved the wisdom of<lb/>the vote I then gave. I had reason to<lb/>believe that the delegates would obtain<lb/>better Terms for this Island than the<lb/>former had arranged, and their success<lb/>shows that this House did right when<lb/>it decided to send them up. It shows<lb/>also that so far, in obtaining Terms,<lb/>nothing has been lost by delay, and<lb/>that if we were to delay the matter a<lb/>
           
          
           <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw> <fw type="num">221</fw>
            
          
     few years longer, we would be gainers 
     <lb/>by so doing. The hon. member, Mr.<lb/>Laird, wishes my hon. colleague and<lb/>myself to fall in line, and act, as he<lb/>seems to imagine, a consistent part.<lb/>But, Sir, if there is an hon. member in<lb/>this House who has been really in<lb break="no"/>consistent as a public man, that mem<lb break="no"/>ber is himself. Before, therefore, he<lb/>undertakes to instruct others about<lb/>consistency, he should first put in<lb/>practice what he preaches. He should<lb/>recollect that the many advices of a<lb/>quite contrary nature, which he has<lb/>so often given, renders his present ad<lb break="no"/>vice of little value, and entitled to<lb/>scarcely any respect. Indeed, I would<lb/>feel myself humiliated were I to follow<lb/>the hon. member as my political leader,<lb/>or recognize him as my adviser. He<lb/>ought to remember that he told the<lb/>people, at one time, that Confederation<lb/>would cause each family to be taxed<lb/>to the tune of £40 a year. Now the<lb/>hon. member has seen fit to change<lb/>his tune, and thinks others should vac<lb break="no"/>cilate also. I ran my election on the<lb/>anti-Confederate ticket, the people<lb/>have not relieved me from that pledge,<lb/>and I can assure the hon. member I<lb/>am not going to violate any promise I<lb/>made to my constituents.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The hon. Mr. Pope moved, seconded<lb/>by Mr. Laird, that the first and second<lb/>of the said resolutions be agreed to.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The third resolution was then again<lb/>read, and is as follows :—<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>3rd. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Resolved</hi>, That the Electoral<lb/>Districts for which the first election of<lb/>members to serve in the House of<lb/>Commons of the Dominion of Canada,<lb/>shall be as follow :—<lb/>

            <p>That Prince County shall constitute<lb/>one District, and return two members.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>That Queen's County shall consti<lb break="no"/>tute one District, and return two<lb/>members.<lb/>

     5. That, as the Government of

     <lb/>

            <p>

     transfer to the Parliament  of Canada 
     <lb/>

     sums shall be paid yearly by Canada

     <lb/>
     Returns of 1871, viz., 94,021, both by

     <lb/>
     such grant of eighty cents per head to

     <lb/>
     may be shewn by each subsequent

     <lb/>
     the year 1861, the Island shall be

     represented in the House of Commons 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, by six members. The 
     <lb/>
     representation to be re-adjusted from

     And the House of Assembly of Prince

     14. That the Provisions in the

     " British North America Act, 1867 " 
     <lb/>
     shall, except those parts thereof which 
     <lb/>

     applicable to, and only to effect one,

     and not the whole of the Provinces

            way and to the same extent as they<lb/>apply to the other Provinces of the<lb/>Dominion, and as if the Colony of<lb/>Prince Edward Island had been one<lb/>of the Provinces originally united by<lb/>the said Act.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>15. That the Union shall take place<lb/>on such day as Her Majesty may<lb/>direct by Order in Council, or Ad<lb break="no"/>dresses to that effect, from the Houses<lb/>of the Parliament of Canada, and of<lb/>the Legislature of the Colony of Prince<lb/>Edward Island, under the one hundred<lb/>and forty-sixth section of the "British<lb/>North America Act, 1867," and that<lb/>the Electoral Districts for which, the<lb/>time within which, and the laws and<lb/>provisions under which the first elec<lb break="no"/>tion of members to serve in the House<lb/>of Commons of Canada, for such Elec<lb break="no"/>toral Districts shall be held, shall be<lb/>such as the said Houses of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature of the said Colony of Prince<lb/>Edward Island may specify in their<lb/>said Addresses.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>And we further humbly pray that<lb/>all laws which, at the date of the Order<lb/>in Council by which the said Island of<lb/>Prince Edward shall be admitted into<lb/>the Dominion of Canada, relating to<lb/>the qualification of any person to be<lb/>elected to sit or vote as a member of<lb/>the House of Assembly of the said<lb/>Island, and relating to the qualifica<lb break="no"/>tions or disqualifications of voters, and<lb/>to the oaths to be taken by voters, and<lb/>to Returning Officers and Poll Clerks,<lb/>and their powers and duties, and re<lb break="no"/>lating to Polling Divisions within the<lb/>said Island, and relating to the pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings at Elections, and to the<lb/>period during which such Elections<lb/>may be continued, and relating to the<lb/>trial of controverted Elections, and the<lb/>proceedings incident thereto, and re<lb break="no"/>lating to the vacating of seats of mem<lb break="no"/>bers, and to the execution of New<lb/>Writs in case of any seat being vacated<lb/>otherwise than by a dissolution, and to<lb/>all other matters connected with or<lb/>incidental to elections of members to<lb/>
            
            <cb/>

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:POPE2">Hon. Mr. POPE</persName>, said, Mr. Speaker,<lb/>I rise to move that the Address be<lb/>agreed to. In doing so, I will embrace<lb/>the opportunity to say, that for several<lb/>years I have been of the opinion that<lb/>our interests would be greatly pro<lb break="no"/>moted by a Union with the Dominion<lb/>of Canada. Nor can I now but feel,<lb/>that a high honor has been conferred<lb/>upon me, in being the agent, as it were,<lb/>through whom, with my associates, the<lb/>measure is to be completed, while the<lb/>Leader of the Opposition was the<lb/>mover in the question that is now be<lb break="no"/>fore us. While saying this, it is due<lb/>to my hon. friend, the hon. member for<lb/>Georgetown (Mr. Haviland) to say<lb/>that in this matter he has been the<lb/>most consistent. At first I was not<lb/>satisfied with the Quebec Terms.<lb/>But when I found that the Dominion<lb/>Government was prepared to deal<lb/>fairly with us, I became a Confederate<lb/>in principle at once ; but never felt<lb/>disposed to urge the quesiton upon<lb/>the country, believing as I did, that<lb/>if the measure should, at any time,<lb/>be carried against the will of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple, it would be an unfortunate day for<lb/>this Colony. No valid reason has <lb/>been shown by my old colleague, the<lb/>senior member for Bedeque, why he<lb/>and his colleague should continue to<lb/>oppose the measure. Bedeque is my<lb/>native district, in the welfare of its<lb/>people I have ever felt the liveliest<lb/>interest. They are in independent<lb/>circumstances, and perhaps the most<lb/>intelligent of any district in the Island.<lb/>Some of them believe in Confederation,<lb/>others do not ; while not a few regard<lb/>it as a necessity. I rejoice myself,<lb/>that I, as a native of that district, will<lb/>soon see this Island a part of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion, of the benefits of which Union,<lb/>
        
            <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw> <fw type="num">225</fw>
            
            Bedeque will participate, perhaps more<lb/>largely than any other part of the<lb/>Island. Such being my convictions, I<lb/>would be glad if any hon. friends the<lb/>representatives of that district, saw<lb/>their way clear to support the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion. I, therefore, move that the Ad<lb break="no"/>dress be agreed to. I feel pleased that<lb/>an all but unanimous vote will be taken<lb/>on this important question, and sorry<lb/>that even one vote should appear upon<lb/>our Records against it. (Applause.)<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LAIR2">Mr. LAIRD</persName>.—I have much pleasure<lb/>in seconding the resolution of the hon.<lb/>member the Leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. I am happy to think that when<lb/>we are about entering the Dominion,<lb/>that we are likely to do so almost una<lb break="no"/>nimously. I thought, some few years<lb/>ago, that such would not be the case.<lb/>But now we shall have notheing to<lb/>complain of. The people are willing,<lb/>and this House all but unanimous.<lb/>(Hear.) We go in willingly. Not so <lb/>in Nova Scotia. That Province was<lb/>forced in against the wish of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple, and as a result, it has been the<lb/>source of much discontent and dissatis<lb break="no"/>faction. They said they were not <lb/>consulted, and that they were treated<lb/>as if they had no right to have a voice<lb/>in the matter. Such relfections cannot<lb/>be cast upon the public men of this<lb/>Colony. The late election was con<lb break="no"/>ducted principally with a view to as<lb break="no"/>certain the mind of the people upon<lb/>this question. It would have been<lb/>more agreeable to some, to have car<lb break="no"/>ried the measure without an appeal to<lb/>the people, but I always contended for<lb/>the reverse, and said, though I should<lb/>stand alone, and never again occupy a<lb/>seat in this House, I felt it my solemn<lb/>duty to test the question at the polls.<lb/>As a party, we were defeated, yet,<lb/>nevertheless, the question has been<lb/>sustained. In this House we are al<lb break="no"/>most one in voting upon it, and I can<lb break="no"/>not but regard it as a happy era in the<lb/>history of this Island, that such is the<lb/>case. The whole question in all its<lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
            aspects has been fairly and freely dis<lb break="no"/>cussed. No advantage in any way<lb/>has been taken of the people. We<lb/>are now going into union with Canada<lb/>at their desire, and with their free con<lb break="no"/>sent and concurrence. And even<lb/>though the step we are now taking,<lb/>should not prove advantageous to the<lb/>interests of the people of this Island,<lb/>they cannot throw any blame upon the<lb/>Legislature for what it is now doing.<lb/>But I fear no such results. On the<lb/>contrary, as one, who for a long time<lb/>opposed the measure, I rejoice that<lb/>when we are entering, we do so under<lb/>circumstances so satisfactory, and full<lb/>of hope and promise. The Quebec<lb/>Scheme did not contain Terms that<lb/>were just to this Island. Those of<lb/>1869 were not such as we should have<lb/>accepted ; they were not such as would<lb/>have justified this Colony in surrend<lb break="no"/>ering up its constitution for. I am<lb/>therefore, happy to see that the late<lb/>delegates, in their correspondence with<lb/>the Committee of the Privy Council<lb/>did set some value upon our independ<lb break="no"/>ent position. I am free now to admit<lb/>that I do not fear any bad results from<lb/>Confederation. The people in the<lb/>other Provinces are as much afraid of<lb/>taxation as we are. No increase of<lb/>taxation can be levied upon us, but<lb/>what must also be imposed upon them,<lb/>therefore, in that respect we have<lb/>nothing to fear. When at the time of<lb/>the Quebec Conference we heard so<lb/>much about the debt of old Canada, I<lb/>felt there was very just grounds for<lb/>apprehension and doubt. At that<lb/>time, old Canada was, on their public<lb/>securities, borrowing money at a dis<lb break="no"/>count of 7 1/2 per cent. while Nova<lb/>Scotia paper went at par. But I am<lb/>happy and glad to find that the history<lb/>of old Canada in this respect, has not<lb/>been repeated in that of the New Do<lb break="no"/>minion. That taxation is actually de<lb break="no"/>creasing, though the numbers of their<lb/>public works are constantly increasing,<lb/>and extending in magnitude and num<lb break="no"/>ber from the Atlantic to the Pacific.<lb/>

     I rejoice, therefore, to see a prospect 
     <lb/>
     so bright before us, and of uniting with 
     <lb/>
     such a good, great and glorious coun<lb break="no"/>try, and as the learned Atty. General

     once said that the same sun and rain

     what brightened and watered our little

     Island, so I hope and trust that the

     <persName ref="pers:HAVI1">Hon. Mr. HAVILAND</persName>.— I cannot, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker. sit and give a silent vote 
     <lb/>
     on the very important question now 
     <lb/>
     before this hon. House. We have to<lb break="no"/>night decided that we shall not longer 
     <lb/>
     continue to be a separate Colony. 
     <lb/>
     For my part, I am not a Confederate 
     <lb/>
     from circumstances of necessity, but 
     <lb/>
     from a long and sincere conviction that 
     <lb/>
     it will be for the general and perma<lb break="no"/>nent interests of this Island. I have 
     <lb/>
     been such from the date of the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     Conference, up to the present time. I 
     <lb/>
     saw that Cofederation, under the 
     <lb/>
     time honored old flag, was to prove a 
     <lb/>
     glorious success ; and firmly believe 
     <lb/>
     that our destinies would have been 
     <lb/>
     more prosperous if we had entered in 
     <lb/>
     1864. But, because I then gave ut<lb break="no"/>terance to the conscientious convic<lb break="no"/>tions of my mind, I was looked upon 
     <lb/>
     as a traitor, and many thought I ought 
     <lb/>
     to have been hung up upon the nearest 
     <lb/>
     tree as a warning to public men. Yet, 
     <lb/>
     notwithstanding, I have never swerved 
     <lb/>
     from these principles. But while re<lb break="no"/>taining these opinions, I was never an 
     <lb/>
     advocate of the policy that was prac<lb break="no"/>ticed in Nova Scotia. To give a man 
     <lb/>
     a boon, unless it is appreciated, does 
     <lb/>
     him more harm than And so it 
     <lb/>
     would have been here if Confederation 
     <lb/>
     had been forced upon an unwilling 
     <lb/>
     people. But, now that an appeal has 
     <lb/>
    been made to our people, and the re<lb break="no"/>sult shown in the vote this night given, 
     <lb/>we may reasonably conclude that our 
     <lb/>people appreciate the advantage of 
     <lb/>union with Canada; and that the action 
     <lb/>
            

    
            <cb/>
           
     of this House tongiht will be fraught 
     <lb/>
     with much good to Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island; and so far from realizing the 
     <lb/>
     evils dreaded by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Bedeque (Mr. Howalt) it will be 
     <lb/>
     found that Confederation will confer 
     <lb/>
     blessings upon this Colony. No doubt 
     <lb/>
     it is a question that effects our inter<lb break="no"/>ests for all time, but while this is the 
     <lb/>
     case. instead of cancelling our rights, 
     <lb/>
     as the hon. member seems to suppose, 
     <lb/>
     we are enlarging them, and by the 
     <lb/>
     vote this night given, have taken the 
     <lb/>
     first step to extend our privileges and 
     <lb/>
     increase our influence; so that in fact, 
     <lb/>
     our rights are only being enlarged. 
     <lb/>
     Although our population is but 100,<lb break="no"/>000, or thereahouts, yet we are enter<lb break="no"/>ing on terms which secures to us the 
     <lb/>
     advantages of a Colony much larger 
     <lb/>
     and more populous. Our peeple will 
     <lb/>
     become a portion of the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     which extends from the blue waters of 
     <lb/>
     the Atlantic, to the shores of the 
     <lb/>
     bright and Sparkling Pacific Ocean. 
     <lb/>
     Do you call that selling our rights? 
     <lb/>
     No. Is it putting your hand in a vice 
     <lb/>
     from which you cannot extricate it? 
     <lb/>
     Nothing of the kind. We are, and 
     <lb/>
     shall be, but enlarging and adding to 
     <lb/>
     our more expanding rights and privi<lb break="no"/>leges ass people. For disposing of all 
     <lb/>
     matters of ordinary interest, we shall 
     <lb/>
     still have our Local Legislature; and 
     <lb/>
     as for taxation, I believe we shall have 
     <lb/>
     nothing to fear from that scare crow 
     <lb/>
     which has been raised to frighten the 
     <lb/>
     timid. I believe that even the men 
     <lb/>
     who supported the ice-bound resolution. 
     <lb/>
     do not now dread that huge bugbear. 
     <lb/>
     It is also a matter for the most entire 
     <lb/>
     satisfaction, that the question should 
     <lb/>
     be carried as it has been to-night. To 
     <lb/>
     think that the. resolution. should be 
     <lb/>
     proposed by the Leader of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and seconded by the Leader 
     <lb/>
     of the Opposition, is certainly a fact 
     <lb/>
     which cannot fail to be gratifying to 
     <lb/>
     every true friend of this Colony. We 
     <lb/>
     need not be afraid of our future des<lb break="no"/>tinies. We may be proud that we 
     <lb/>are to form part of a Dominion that<lb/>

     has a form of Government so superior<lb/>to that of the United States. There 
     <lb/>
     they have. no responrible Government. 
     <lb/>
     The President, during his term of 
     <lb/>
     office, is literally invested with de<lb break="no"/>spotic powers. He is to all intents as 
     <lb/>
     much of a despot, for the term of four 
     <lb/>
     years, as any man can be. These are 
     <lb/>
     facts which cannot be contradicted. 
     <lb/>
     No matter what he may do, the people 
     <lb/>
     have, no constitutional means of getting 
     <lb/>
     rid of him untilhis term of office ex<lb break="no"/>pires. But under our glorious consti<lb break="no"/>tution, the representatives of the people, 
     <lb/>
     when Parliament is assembled, can in 
     <lb/>
     one moment make or unmake a minis<lb break="no"/>try. Long, long, therefore, may the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion continue to grow and pros<lb break="no"/>per. Why, Sir, in the commerce of 
     <lb/>
     the world, the Dominion occupies no 
     <lb/>
     mean place, and to-day as rivals of the 
     <lb/>
     United States, her commerce is fully 
     <lb/>
     one-third that of the Great Republic. 
     <lb/>
     When such is the case now, what may 
     <lb/>
     we not hope and expect the future to 
     <lb/>
     be? We have no grounds then for 
     <lb/>
     misapprehension or doubt.

     <persName ref="pers:SINC6">MR. P. SINCLAIR</persName>.—Sir, it would 
     <lb/>
     not be proper for me to give a silent 
     <lb/>
     vote on the present occasion. Per<lb break="no"/>haps I had as much to do in bringing 
     <lb/>
     about what we have agreed upon, and 
     <lb/>
     in what has called forth this Address, 
     <lb/>
     as any one here. I believe, if the late 
     <lb/>
     Government had not pursued the 
     <lb/>
     course it did, we would be called upon 
     <lb/>
     to levy an increase of taxation upon our 
     <lb/>
     people, which would create much dis<lb break="no"/>content. In reviewing the past, I 
     <lb/>
     cannot but regard all the changes, 
     <lb/>
     which has taken place amongst, us 
     <lb/>
     within the past few years, as so many 
     <lb/>
     waves upon the sea, each one of which 
     <lb/>
     had a tendency to land this Colony 
     <lb/>
     into the haven of Confederation. We 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     have had different Governments, yet<lb/>each contributed tis share in working 
     <lb/>
     onward in one certain course, and now 
     <lb/>
     we are about dropping anchor in ,the 
     <lb/>
     harbor of the Dominion at the proper 
     <lb/>
     time. Figure aside. Had we not 
     <lb/>
     taken this course we would nowbe 
     <lb/>
    levying a tax ,of fifteen shillings upon 
     <lb/>every member of each family in the 
     <lb/>Island. Now I ask the hon. members 
     <lb/>from Bedeque whether the course 
     <lb/>now taken, or the one proposed by 
     <lb/>them, is likely to give the most satis<lb break="no"/>faction? I find no fault with them. 
     <lb/>They have a right to act as they feel 
     <lb/>duty demands. But representing a 
     <lb/>district as intelligent as Bedeque, they 
     <lb/>should have shown better reasons than 
     <lb/>they did, or have voted with the ma<lb break="no"/>jority. Any hon. member, who will 
     <lb/>look fairly into the whole question, 
     <lb/>cannot fail to arrive at such a conclu<lb break="no"/>sion. In going into Confederation, we 
     <lb/>will have as much freedom as we 
     <lb/>now enjoy. We are but entering Into 
     <lb/>partnership with one of more influ<lb break="no"/>ence and skill than we possess. For 
     <lb/>some years to come we will not re<lb break="no"/>quire to increase our taxes, and sup<lb break="no"/>posing that in the course of seven or 
     <lb/>eight years we will require to raise 
     <lb/>$50,000, it will only amount to half 
     <lb/>a dollar a head. In the meantime see 
     <lb/>what an amount of commercial free<lb break="no"/>dom we shall enjoy. The manufac<lb break="no"/>tures of Canada, which now pays 
     <lb/>duty of 15 per cent, will come in free. 
     <lb/>We will receive more than we give. 
     <lb/>We are uniting with a country that 
     <lb/>will manufacture all that we require. 
     <lb/>No argument which has been advanced 
     <lb/>in opposition to the course taken, 
     <lb/>meets the case. We leave the local 
     <lb/>Parliament in the possession of all its 
     <lb/>rights to deal with local questions. 
     <lb/>When the question is viewed from all 
     <lb/>sides fairly, it will be seen that we 
     <lb/>have taken the proper course. I have 
     <lb/>seriously considered the question, and 
     <lb/>am happy to see that we are so unani<lb break="no"/>mous in this matter of union with Can<lb break="no"/>ada- I do also most sincerely hope

            <p><persName ref="pers:BREC1">Hon. Mr. BRECKEN</persName>.—Mr. Speaker,<lb/>I congratulate you, Sir, and this hon.<lb/>House, on the happy and satisfactory<lb/>manner in which this important ques<lb break="no"/>tion is being discussed and dealt with.<lb/>I fully agree with the able and prac<lb break="no"/>tical remarks of the hon. members who<lb/>have preceded me. I believe, when<lb/>we duly consider, that the manufac<lb break="no"/>turers of Canada will fully keep pace<lb/>with the growing wants of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion. When we further think of the<lb/>amount of manufactured goods which<lb/>are annually imported hither, I think it<lb/>will be seen that we are going to get<lb/>more than we will give in return. I <lb/>feel happy that I am in accord with<lb/>the Leader of the Opposition now on<lb/>this question. I have been a Con<lb break="no"/>federate for some time ; although a few<lb/>years ago I believed it to be a ques<lb break="no"/>tion of Imperial, rather than one of<lb/>Colonial policy. I felt that in the<lb/>great and important public works of<lb/>Canada, if I had a vote I would have<lb/>cheerfully recorded it in their favor,<lb/>believing, yes, knowing as I do, how<lb/>rapidly they will contribute towards<lb/>opening up the resources of that great<lb/>country. I feel glad now too, that I<lb/>recorded a vote in favor of our own<lb/>Railway, and also for Confederation.<lb/>Union with Canada will bind us more<lb/>closely to the Mother Country, while<lb/>I am sure it will add to our prosperity<lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     as a people. I am also sure, Sir, we 
     <lb/>are all glad to hear that in some re<lb break="no"/>spects she is going soon to rival the<lb/>United States. The United States is<lb/>perhaps the greatest country in the<lb/>world. But they have forty millions<lb/>of people, while Canada has but four<lb/>or five millions. Yet, notwithstanding,<lb/>in trade, commerce and manufactures,<lb/>the latter country, in proportion to its<lb/>population and existence, is vastly<lb/>ahead of the United States. Every<lb/>British subject should be a hearty<lb/>Confederate. To be that now, is<lb/>simply to be a loyal subject. Per<lb break="no"/>haps it is as well that we have been<lb/>allowed our own way and time of<lb/>joining with Canada. We have not<lb/>married in haste. No doubt the hon.<lb/>member the Leader of the Opposition<lb/>has rendered good service in opposing<lb/>the measure so long, and perhaps his<lb/>position and the influences he brought<lb/>to bear, has, more than anything else,<lb/>contributed to the result now achieved.<lb/>I thank him for going off to Canada ;<lb/>congratulate him for pulling down his<lb/>anti-Confederate flag ; and am glad he<lb/>now sees in the public men of Canada,<lb/>sufficient to admire to induce him to<lb/>vote to cast in his lot with them. The<lb/>conversion of the hon. member has<lb/>been slow, but I doubt not it is sincere.<lb/>(Laughter.) He did more when he<lb/>went to Canada as a delegate, than<lb/>when he went on with the Branch Lines<lb/>to hasten on Confederation. I again<lb/>thank him for the good services he has<lb/>rendered in helping to make us a part<lb/>and parcel of Canada. (Applause.)<lb/>
            </p>

Nor do I think we shall have<lb/>any cause to regret the decision at<lb/>which we have so happily arrived ; or<lb/>to fear that any unpleasant conse<lb break="no"/>quences will result therefrom.

           not be hindered because of a union<lb/>with Canada. On the contrary, I<lb/>firmly believe that we shall soon make<lb/>greater strides in that direction than<lb/>we ever did. And Sir, after all, the<lb/>change is not very great. In the Do<lb break="no"/>minion, as British subjects, we shall<lb/>rejoice to have responsible Govern<lb break="no"/>ment ever carried out in its purity.<lb/>We shall then be represented by the<lb/>ablest and best men which this Colony<lb/>can send to the Canadian Parliament.<lb/>I am of the opinion that the country<lb/>will be satisfied that the best thing has<lb/>been done for this Colony which their<lb/>representatives had in their power to<lb/>do. And of what we have this night<lb/>done of our union with Canada, I<lb/>think we shall never be ashamed.<lb/>The Opposition fought the battle<lb/>bravely, and yielded when it was<lb/>graceful in them to do so. For my<lb/>part I am quite willing to accord to<lb/>the Leader of the Opposition credit<lb/>for having very materially aided in<lb/>bringing about that unanimity on this<lb/>question, which we have this night<lb/>witnessed. No doubt a great deal is<lb/>due to him. I am glad to see the<lb/>Opposition laying aside their fears,<lb/>when our interest and destiny are<lb/>uniting with those of the people of<lb/>Canada. In the future I hope we<lb/>shall unite our energies for the com<lb break="no"/>mon good, and forget the angry dis<lb break="no"/>cussions which we have had, and those<lb/>acrimonious feelings which they gave<lb/>rise to.

            <p><persName ref="pers:DAVI3">Mr. L. H.

I have not been a Confederate<lb/>for many months, but that is no reason<lb/>why I should not unite in indulging in<lb/>the good hopes and bright prospects<lb/>which seem to loom up before hon.<lb/>members. Still, I do not think we<lb/>are entering a political El Dorado, where<lb/>everything will be happy and glorious.<lb/>I see that in the Dominion this year<lb/>
          
           
            <cb/>
           
     many elements which forbid the hope 
     <lb/>that such bright and glowing pros<lb break="no"/>pects are before us. So far the Do<lb break="no"/>minion has been guided by men of no<lb/>mean political order. As a result, their<lb/>country, finances and credit, is year<lb/>after year improving, and to-day they<lb/>are fast building up a vast and wide<lb break="no"/>spread Empire. The change we are<lb/>making will be found one that will not<lb/>affect us greatly. This is the one<lb/>hundredth year of our Parliamentary<lb/>history as a separate Colony, and Sir,<lb/>when I look up at the portraits of so<lb/>many of those who have occupied the<lb/>Speaker's chair within that time, some<lb/>of whom are still living, and others<lb/>who are not, I incline to believe if<lb/>they were all here to-night, and had a<lb/>voice in this Assembly, they would<lb/>only be too happy to record a vote with<lb/>us to-night. I will be glad, Sir, to<lb/>see not only the hon. member the<lb/>Leader of the Opposition, and all who<lb/>support him, doing so too, but I would<lb/>be happy also to see the hon. members<lb/>for Bedeque casting in their vote also.<lb/>We have had a time when differences<lb/>of opinion were called for, and these<lb/>brought forth quite enough of angry<lb/>discussion ; but on this occasion I see<lb/>no reason why we should not vote as<lb/>one man. (Hear.) Considering our <lb/>position as a Colony in the past, I find<lb/>that our prospecity has increased at a<lb/>ratio which will compare favorably<lb/>with any part of Canada. That each<lb/>seven years marks an increase in our<lb/>wealth, which reflects credit upon our<lb/>Island. Our people have, under the<lb/>free system of education we possess,<lb/>sent forth many of their sons to occupy<lb/>places of honor in the world, and have<lb/>embraced and improved at home the<lb/>advantages it confers, as much as they<lb/>have in any part of Canada. We have<lb/>a better class of farming people, and a<lb/>better informed people than they have<lb/>in many parts of the Dominion.

     our advantage. And while I look 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     years of the past, I rejoice to know

    that I can look forward to an equally

     (Laugter.) But Sir, I do not think

     we are justified in hearkening to such 
     <lb/>
     sudden converts to Confederation. 
     <lb/>
     [Hear.] Let us take a common sense 
     <lb/>
     view of the subject. In the United

     States they have a population of forty 
     <lb/>
     millions, and I maintain we are but a

     unit when placed beside that that great

     country. Hon. members have said 
     <lb/>
     that we will be under the old flag. I 
     <lb/>
     would like to know if we are not under 
     <lb/>
     it now? Are we not already under 
     <lb/>
     the protection and connected with the 
     <lb/>
     the greatest nation in the world? I 
     <lb/>
     am not one of those who feel dissatis<lb break="no"/>fied with this connection, nor with the 
     <lb/>
     protection Great Britain extends to us. 
     <lb/>
     This great Dominion of which we hear 
     <lb/>
     so much, will, before long, be separated 
     <lb/>
     from Great Britain and thrown upon 
     <lb/>
     its own resources, and I see nothing 
     <lb/>
     pleasing to such a prospect. Why in 
     <lb/>
     the event of such a result, the proba<lb break="no"/>bility is that it will fall into the hands 
     <lb/>
     of the United States. The greater the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion becomes, the less disposed 
     <lb/>
     it will be to submit to the dictation of 
     <lb/>
     the Home country. Her statesmen 
     <lb/>
     will want to chalk out acourse of their 
     <lb/>
     own. Our young may be called out 
     <lb/>
     to fight against those who have been 
     <lb/>
     our friends; and as regards our trade, 
     <lb/>
     we have no market in the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     for what our country produces. We 
     <lb/>
     will, in the Dominion, even as now a 
     <lb/>
     have to look to some other place for a 
     <lb/>
     remunerative market for what we will 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     have to sell. I believe the day will<lb/>come when we will have to pay a<lb/>higher duty, than we would if we<lb/>should now resolve to retain our con<lb break="no"/>stitution, and continue to paddle our<lb/>
     own canoe. I know, Mr. Speaker 
     <lb/>
     that in this House, I occupy about the 
     <lb/>
     same position that our representatives 
     <lb/>
     will to the Dominion Parliament. 
     <lb/>
     They will be left out and have their 
     <lb/>
     news treated in the same way as mine 
     <lb/>
     are here. I maintain it is the privilege 
     <lb/>
     and duty of every hon. member to 
     <lb/>
     assert his rights and state his views. 
     <lb/>
     That I have done, and believe I have 
     <lb/>
     been much more consistent in doing so 
     <lb/>
     than the hon. member the Leader of 
     <lb/>
     the Opposition has been. Will the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member tell us that he will go up 
     <lb/>
     and be at the nod and beck of the 
     <lb/>
     leading men of Canada? If he goes 
     <lb/>
     up there he will, no doubt, watch 
     <lb/>
     which way the majority will go, and 
     <lb/>
     govern himself accordingly. I, for 
     <lb/>
     one, believe in a men taking a stand 
     <lb/>
     for himself, and not watching how 
     <lb/>
     others go, and then following their 
     <lb/>
     shadows. But such is the position of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member, and such also will 
     <lb/>
     be the position of those whom we may 
     <lb/>
     send to Ottawa. Two votes here, is a 
     <lb/>
     larger minority than six will be in the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion House of Commons. I 
     <lb/>
    have for several years represented a 
     <lb/>district, which, for wealth and intelli<lb break="no"/>gence, is second to none, save Charlotte<lb break="no"/>town, in the Islmd. The electors 
     <lb/>decided against Confederation, and I 
     <lb/>would look upon myself as a traitor, 
     <lb/>were I to vote against my promise to 
     <lb/>them.<lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:POPE2">Hon. Mr. POPE</persName>.—Sir, I would like 
     <lb/>
     to see my hon. friend supporting the 
     <lb/>
     motion on the present occasion. Both 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. members should be satisfied 
     <lb/>
     in having continued their opposition 
     <lb/>
     to the present moment. They can 
     <lb/>
     effect nothing by opposing the Ad<lb break="no"/>dress, but should remember, that in 
     <lb/>
     view of what has already been so 
     <lb/>
     unanimously agreed to, it is disrespect<lb break="no"/>

     ful to oppose the motion that an Ad<lb break="no"/>dress be presented to the Queen's 
     <lb/>
     Representative. I hope they will 
     <lb/>
     reconsider the matter, and not vote 
     <lb/>
     against the Address. I am pleased, 
     <lb/>
    Mr. Speaker, to see the good feeling 
     <lb/>that is existing when a vote so im: 
     <lb/>portant is about to be recorded on our 
     <lb/>journals. The fact is, whatever our 
     <lb/>former or present differences have 
     <lb/>been, or are, we are all too patriotic to 
     <lb/>record our vote otherwise than for the 
     <lb/>Address, rejoicing, as we all do, in the 
     <lb/>bright future which looms up before 
     <lb/>us. [Applause]

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOLL1">MR. HOLLAND</persName>.— Sir, most heartily 
     <lb/>do I congratulate the Government in<lb/>
     
     the success of their delegates in ob<lb break="no"/>taining better Terms. Still I am not 
     <lb/>
     satisfied that it is my duty to support 
     <lb/>
     the motion. We have heard several 
     <lb/>
    speeches, but no reason has been pro<lb break="no"/>duced, save the glory argument, to 
     <lb/>show why we should support Con<lb break="no"/>federation. I would like to see it 
     <lb/>shown from historical facts which can 
     <lb/>be relied on as correct, that the union 
     <lb/>of a small isolated Colony like ours, 
     <lb/>with a great and large country, has 
     <lb/>been of advantage to the former. 
     <lb/>History, on the contrary, abundantly 
     <lb/>proves, that whenever a small country 
     <lb/>becomes united to a larger, its pros<lb break="no"/>perity ceases to increase proportionate 
     <lb/>with that of the larger country. Such 
     <lb/>has been the case in the union of Scot<lb break="no"/>land and Ireland with England. The 
     <lb/>smaller country has to hear her full 
     <lb/>proportion of the burdens, but seldom 
     <lb/>participates in the general advantages. 
     <lb/>The Leader of the Opposition pre<lb break="no"/>sumes to advise my hon. colleague and 
     <lb/>myself, and sat we had better now 
     <lb/>submit. I have often noticed that 
     <lb/>when the leader of a flock of sheep 
     <lb/>runs, the sheep follow; but I can as<lb break="no"/>sure the hon. member I have no idea 
     <lb/>of following so erratic a guide as he is. 
     <lb/>What is the situation of affairs now in 
     <lb/>New Brunswick? That Province is 
     <lb/>almost ready to take up arms. I saw 
     <lb/>
            

    
            <cb/>
            
     a man from thence, who said, be ex<lb break="no"/>erted himself to the utmost to carry 
     <lb/>
     Confederation in that Province, but 
     <lb/>
     that if he had the same duty to dis<lb break="no"/>charge again, he would rather cut off 
     <lb/>
     his arm than exert it in favor of a 
     <lb/>
     union with Canada. Here the educa<lb break="no"/>tion question has been resorted to as 
     <lb/>
     a lever to push us in; in that Pro<lb break="no"/>vince the Fenian raid was used as a 
     <lb/>
     means to frighten the people into an 
     <lb/>
     acceptance of union with the Dominion. 
     <lb/>
     That the late Government party made 
     <lb/>
     use of the School Question to accom<lb break="no"/>plish similiar results, cannot be suc<lb break="no"/>cessfully denied, and were it not for 
     <lb/>
     that question, a much larger vote 
     <lb/>
     would have been recorded against 
     <lb/>
     Confederation. I have no hesitation 
     <lb/>
     in saying this. The Leader of the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition tells us that we are, by 
     <lb/>
     going into the Dominion, only enlarg<lb break="no"/>ing and adding to our rights and privi<lb break="no"/>leges. I see matters in a different 
     <lb/>
     light. We are simply giving up to 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion the greatest privileges 
     <lb/>
     any people ever possessed. We enjoy 
     <lb/>
     the sole right of making our own laws, 
     <lb/>
     of taxing ourselves as we see fit, and 
     <lb/>
     spending these when collected, as he 
     <lb/>
     may deem proper; and all these bless<lb break="no"/>ings and privileges we are surrender<lb break="no"/>ing simply for the glory of becoming a 
     <lb/>
     part of a great country. Yet the 
     <lb/>
     greatness of Canada is more in the 
     <lb/>
     extent of her territory, than in any<lb break="no"/>thing else. The greater portion of her 
     <lb/>
     wide domain is yet a wilderness. True 
     <lb/>
     her public works are in excess of those 
     <lb/>
     of any other country, according to her 
     <lb/>
     pepulation, and her debt will soon be 
     <lb/>
     in the same proportion. Yet hon. 
     <lb/>
     members speak as if we were going 
     <lb/>
     into Paradise. But what are the 
     <lb/>
     facts? We export more and import 
     <lb/>
     more, according to our population, 
     <lb/>
     than any part of the Dominion. This 
     <lb/>
     is an incontrovertible fact. We send 
     <lb/>
     more children to school, and mail more 
     <lb/>
     letters, in proportion to the number of 
     <lb/>
     our people, than in any part of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     The Leader of the Opposition took the

           trouble to say the same sun shone and<lb/>the same rain fell on Canada as here,<lb/>but the hon. member ought to know<lb/>that they fall also upon the Hottentots<lb/>in Africa and the people of Asia as<lb/>well. In the district my hon. col<lb break="no"/>league and myself represent, there are<lb/>men of wealth and intelligence, who<lb/>look upon Confederation with great<lb/>suspicion. Some are in favor of it,<lb/>but not many. Have our resources<lb/>been tried ? They have not. No <lb/>effort has been made in any shape or<lb/>form, but an effort for terms of union.<lb/>Yet I hope and trust that the hopes<lb/>and expectations indulged in, may be<lb/>fully realized. We were told about<lb/>the factories of the Dominion, but not<lb/>one word has been said about our own.<lb/>The 15 per cent tariff, which operated<lb/>as a protection, will be removed ; and<lb/>if they can manufacture goods in the<lb/>other Provinces cheaper than we can<lb/>here, our factories will go down. We<lb/>have sold our noble little ship. She now<lb/>stands stripped of all the glory with<lb/>which for one hundred years she was<lb/>adorned. If we were not ice-bound,<lb/>our circumstances might be different,<lb/>and our little barque might long con<lb break="no"/>tinue to float. But such being our<lb/>fate, I hope that in the future our<lb/>prospects and successes may improve,<lb/>and that no devious course may mark<lb/>the career of those who may lead our<lb/>destinies.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LEFU2">Hon. Mr. LEFURGY</persName>.—Mr. Speaker,<lb/>for my part I have, for the last ten<lb/>years, looked upon this question with<lb/>favor. In running my election, I have<lb/>had it brought up against me, but now,<lb/>I am happy to be able to say that my<lb/>hon. colleague and myself can vote for<lb/>this question, with the full consent of<lb/>our constituents. The hon. member<lb/>who last addressed you, Sir, said that<lb/>when a small country united with a<lb/>larger, it never obtained its rights. I<lb/>believe the reverse to be the fact. If<lb/>you look to the United States, such<lb/>will not be found to be the case. Nor<lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     would that country or its people to-day   
     <lb/>be as great and prosperous as they are,<lb/>had they not united as they did ? Our<lb/>country is small enough, nor is it by<lb/>retaining our isolation, but by merging<lb/>our interests with a larger country,<lb/>that our prosperity is to be enhanced.<lb/>I know many of our people believe<lb/>that we will be better off by entering<lb/>the Dominion ; while some think our<lb/>best course is to remain as we are.<lb/>But I believe, before ten years roll<lb/>round, it will be seen that we have<lb/>this night acted wisely for the inter<lb break="no"/>ests of this Colony. In future the<lb/>politics of this country will be carried<lb/>on differently to what they have been.<lb/>I believe in proportion to our popula<lb break="no"/>tion,that we have more men among<lb/>us, in proportion to our number, who<lb/>can take their stand in the Dominion<lb/>Parliament, in a creditable manner,<lb/>than they have in any Province of<lb/>Canada. When I know that such is<lb/>the case, I have no fears that our in<lb break="no"/>terests will be overlooked. I am sorry<lb/>that the junior member for Bedeque<lb/>cannot unite with us on this occasion.<lb/>But I believe that before twelve<lb/>months go round both he and his con<lb break="no"/>stituents will not be of the opinion<lb/>they are now. Knowing, Mr. Speaker,<lb/>that at this hour of the morning you<lb/>must be tired, I shall not further tress<lb break="no"/>pass on your time.<lb/>
