     between Prince Edward Island and

     <lb/>

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI3">Mr. L. H. DAVIES</persName> thought it a 
     <lb/>
     monstrous proposition that Charlotte<lb break="no"/>town is only to have one or two trips 
     <lb/>
     per week, by Steamboat, allowed it 
     <lb/>
     instead of the present arrangement, or 
     <lb/>
     a more progressive one still. But 
     <lb/>
     be supposed that this question would 
     <lb/>
     be more fully discussed when the Bill 
     <lb/>
     was brought down. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SINC6">Mr. SINCLAIR</persName> asked whether it was 
     <lb/>
     not going too far to enter into a new 
     <lb/>
     engagement for ten years with the 
     <lb/>
    present contractor, when the Dominion 
     <lb/>had engaged to provide for the con<lb break="no"/>veyance of our mails to the other 
     <lb/>Provinces. He thought that to do so 
     <lb/>would be taking too much upon our<lb break="no"/>selves under present circumstances. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI2">Hon. COL. SECRETARY</persName> said that in 
     <lb/>
     passing the resolution before them, 
     <lb/>
     the Committee did not pledge itself in 
     <lb/>
     any way, or make any engagement 
     <lb/>
     that would be binding. No Bill im<lb break="no"/>posing a tax upon the subject could 
     <lb/>
     be introduced unless it originates with 
     <lb/>
     a Committee of the whole House. 
     <lb/>
     The proper time to take objection to 
     <lb/>
     the principles and provisions of the 
     <lb/>
     Bill, will be when the Bill itself comes 
     <lb/>
     down. The question for present con<lb break="no"/>sideration is whether the House is in 
     <lb/>
     favor of increased steam communica<lb break="no"/>tion with the other Provinces, and 
     <lb/>
     whether a new contract should be 
     <lb/>
     entered into for that purpose. As re<lb break="no"/>gards the necessity for increased steam 
     <lb/>
     communication between this Island 
     <lb/>
     and the other Provinces when the 
     <lb/>
     Railway is opened up throughout the 
     <lb/>
     whole length. there can be little doubt. 
     <lb/>
     It is, on the other hand, far better to 
     <lb/>
     enter into acontract with capitalists 
     <lb/>
     amongst ourselves, who own substan<lb break="no"/>tial and commodious Boats, which 
     <lb/>
     have given every satisfaction, and thus 
     <lb/>
     have the money expended amongst us, 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     than to trust to outsiders, who would 
     <lb/>
     spend the money elsewhere. The ad<lb break="no"/>vantage of having a Steam Naviga<lb break="no"/>tion Company located amongst our<lb break="no"/>selves, owning such Boats as the 
     <lb/>
               <hi rendition="simple:italic">Princess of Wales</hi>, <hi rendition="simple:italic">Heather Belle</hi> and 
     <lb/>
               <hi rendition="simple:italic">St. Lawrence</hi>, when free trade opens 
     <lb/>
     with the Dominion, will be apparent 
     <lb/>
     to the commonest observer. Free 
     <lb/>
     trade with Canada will be a great ad<lb break="no"/>vantage to the Company, and will 
     <lb/>
     enable them to afford greater facilities 
     <lb/>
     to the travelling public, and for the 
     <lb/>
     conveyance of freight, than they have 
     <lb/>
     ever yet been able to supply. The 
     <lb/>
     question in reference to the number of 
     <lb/>
     trips to be made between the several 
     <lb/>
     ports is a matterto be settled when 
     <lb/>
     the House goes into Committee on the 
     <lb/>
     Bill itself. It will be more satisfac<lb break="no"/>tory to enter into a contract with a 
     <lb/>
     local Company, owning local Boats, 
     <lb/>
     and thus have the profits of the enter 
     <lb/>
     prise spent among ourselves, and the 
     <lb/>
     Boats officered, from the Captain down 
     <lb/>
     to the firemen. from our own people, 
     <lb/>
     than to have Boats employed belong<lb break="no"/>ing to any of the other Provinces. All 
     <lb/>
     those matters would, he hoped, receive 
     <lb/>
     the due consideration of that hon. 
     <lb/>
     Committee. As to whether ten years 
     <lb/>
     was too long a time tor which to enter 
     <lb/>
     into a contract with a Company, or 
     <lb/>
     not, it would be time enough to con<lb break="no"/>sider when the Bill came before the 
     <lb/>
     House in Committee.

     <lb/>
     carried. The Speaker then took the

     <persName ref="pers:LAIR2">Mr. LAIRD</persName> said he had some ob<lb break="no"/>jection to the Bill. Judges have good 
     <lb/>
     salaries, and should not be allowed to 
     <lb/>
     do business as agents or otherwise in 
     <lb/>
     matters which can be done by others.

     If they have friends who wish to have 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     them set in the capacity of Attorneys 
     <lb/>
     for them, they cannot suppose this 
     <lb/>
     House will sanction any measure of 
     <lb/>
     this nature. Judges should, as far as 
     <lb/>
     possible, keep clear from acting as 
     <lb/>
     agents for any parties. Nor could he 
     <lb/>
     think any injustice would be done to 
     <lb/>
     them by refusing to pass this Bill. In 
     <lb/>
     so far as be (Mr. L.) understood the 
     <lb/>
     Bill, he was opposed to the principle 
     <lb/>
     it contained. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:POPE2">Hon. Mr. POPE</persName> did also feel op<lb break="no"/>posed to the Bill. Their salaries 
     <lb/>
     should be sufiicient to maintain them 
     <lb/>
     in the high position they occupy, 
     <lb/>
     without having to come down from 
     <lb/>
     that height to act as agents or Attor<lb break="no"/>neys for any one. When we enter 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion, the probability is, their 
     <lb/>
     salaries will be increased, when they 
     <lb/>
     will be enabled to live as becomes 
     <lb/>
     their high station in society, without 
     <lb/>
     having to resort to an occupation which 
     <lb/>
     Judges should not engage in. He 
     <lb/>
     considered it the duty of the House to 
     <lb/>
     set their faces against all such mea<lb break="no"/>sures. It was all very well for them 
     <lb/>
     to say they only intended to act for 
     <lb/>
     relatives; but in passing such a Bill 
     <lb/>
     we would be endorsing a principle 
     <lb/>
     which would be susceptible of great 
     <lb/>
     abuse, and calculated to dishonor the 
     <lb/>
     Bench. This House will take the 
     <lb/>
     wisest course, if it sets its face against 
     <lb/>
     this and all like measures. To keep 
     <lb/>
     our Judges clear of all such transac<lb break="no"/>tion, in so far as legislation can do so, 
     <lb/>
     was the clear duty of the House.

     a sound one; yet it is fair to state,

     that by all the principles known to
