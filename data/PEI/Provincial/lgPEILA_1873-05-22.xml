     This question of Confederation is the 
     <lb/>
     most important matter ever taken into 
     <lb/>
     consideration by a Committee of the 
     <lb/>
     House of Assembly of this Colony. 
     <lb/>
     The Government considered the Terms 
     <lb/>brought down from Ottawa by Messrs. 
     <lb/>Haythorne and Laird, were such that 
     <lb/>if accepted, the Colony would be 
     <lb/>forced to resort immediately to local 
     <lb/>taxation in order to meet its yearly 
     <lb/>requirements ; and, therefore, felt it to 
     <lb/>be their duty to appoint another dele<lb break="no"/>gation for the purpose of obtaining 
     <lb/>better Terms, if possible. This Island 
     <lb/>occupies an entirely different position 
     <lb/>from that of any of the other Colonies, 
     <lb/>as the latter have many great sources 
     <lb/>of revenue which we have not. On<lb break="no"/>tario derives a revenue from her Crown 
     <lb/>lands, amounting to a million dollars 
     <lb/>per year ; New Brunswick has her 
     <lb/>Crown lands and forests, and Nova 
     <lb/>Scotia lands and mines. Although 
     <lb/>this Province is the most fertile and 
     <lb/>productive in British America, it is 
     <lb/>dependent upon the products of its soil 
     <lb/>and fisheries, and has no Crown lands 
     <lb/>or forests as sources of revenue, as 
     <lb/>have the other Provinces. Owing to 
     <lb/>our isolated position, we could not ex<lb break="no"/>pect to successfully carry on manufac<lb break="no"/>turing Operations or anything of that 
     <lb/>kind, while the other Provinces are 
     <lb/>not cut off from each other during half 
     <lb/>the year, and have four millions of 
     <lb/>customers for their manufactured 
     <lb/>.goods. I, therefore, looked upon this 
     <lb/>Island as occupying an exceptional 
     <lb/>position, and in giving up the power 
     <lb/>of self government and taxation, I felt 
     <lb/>that we should receive a sum sufficient 
     <lb/>to enable us to meet our requirements, 
     <lb/>as we have hitherto done. Although 
     <lb/>we had a Railway from one end of the 
     <lb/>Island to the other, it was only fair 
     <lb/>that Canada should take it off our 
     <lb/>hands and keep it running. The 
     <lb/>Government were told that the Terms  
     <lb/>brought down by Messrs. Haythorne 
     <lb/>and Laird were liberal, generous, and 
     <lb/>the best that could be obtained ; but 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     we did not consider they would supply 
     <lb/>
     the wants of the Colony. The House 
     <lb/>
     then authorized the appointment of 
     <lb/>
     another delegation to proceed to Otta<lb break="no"/>wa, and endeavor, if possible, to ob<lb break="no"/>tain better Terms which would meet 
     <lb/>
     our requirements, and, at the same 
     <lb/>
     time, be just, reasonable and fair. 
     <lb/>
     Messrs. Haviland, Howlan and myself 
     <lb/>
     were appointed on that delegation, and 
     <lb/>
     proceeded on our mission. On our 
     <lb/>
     arrival at Ottawa, we had a good deal 
     <lb/>
     to contend with. We had been pre<lb break="no"/>ceded by the Leaders of the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion in both Branches of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture, who composed the former dele<lb break="no"/>gation, and who, I believe, did all they 
     <lb/>
     could to obtain the most liberal Terms. 
     <lb/>
     On their return they had declared that 
     <lb/>
     no better Terms would be granted. 
     <lb/>
     And we had also heard a great deal 
     <lb/>
     about the Governor General's tele<lb break="no"/>gram which had been sent down here ; 
     <lb/>
     but we know that telegrams of that 
     <lb/>
     kind are sometimes asked for by the 
     <lb/>
     ministry of the day, and paid no atten<lb break="no"/>tion to it. Representations bad pre<lb break="no"/>ceded us from this Island to the effect  
     <lb/>
     that the great bulk of the people were 
     <lb/>
     satisfied with the Terms already offer<lb break="no"/>ed, and that I had stated that if I could 
     <lb/>
     not obtain better Terms, I would ac<lb break="no"/>cept the Terms brought down by the 
     <lb/>
     former delegates. Some of our friends 
     <lb/>
     and well wishers had written to Otta<lb break="no"/>wa, stating that they considered the 
     <lb/>
     Terms already obtained just and 
     <lb/>
     liberal, and that they were satisfactory 
     <lb/>
     to the people generally. We stated in 
     <lb/>
     plain terms that what we wanted was 
     <lb/>
     a sufficient amount to carry on our 
     <lb/>
     local Government, and meet the usual 
     <lb/>
     wants of the Colony, without being 
     <lb/>
     compelled, immediately after entering 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, to resort to local taxa<lb break="no"/>tion. Our idea was that the manner 
     <lb/>
     in which we presented our claims 
     <lb/>
     would enable the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to judge for themselves, and they 
     <lb/>
     could then provide for them as they 
     <lb/>
     thought fit. I wrote a note to the [...]
