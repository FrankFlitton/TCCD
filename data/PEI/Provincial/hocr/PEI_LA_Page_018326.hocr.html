               late government, and see if their con- 
               <br />
               duct was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con&gt;istent</span> with their profes- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sions,</span> and whether they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sacrificed</span> the 
               <br />
               interests of the country or their own, 
               <br />
               for the purpose of keeping thetnsolves’ 
               <br />
               in power. In passing the Railway 
               <br />
               Bill I considered it a necessity. They 
               <br />
               are the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">best</span> and cheapest modes of 
               <br />
               transport we can have, and when we 
               <br />
               take into account that according to our 
               <br />
               population, we produce more than 
               <br />
               they do in any similar portion of terri- 
               <br />
               tory in British North America, why 
               <br />
               should we not have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">those</span> facilities of 
               <br />
               which other peOple avail themselves? 
               <br />
               and I am still convinced when we shall 
               <br />
               have the road in operation we will 
               <br />
               wonder how we did so long without

               <br />
               always felt the late government had 
               <br />
               no just reason for doing so. During 
               <br />
               the session of 1871 the one tion was 
               <br />
               introduced because we felt it was only 
               <br />
               a question of time. I was then lead 
               <br />
               to pr0pose it, because of the prosperous 
               <br />
               state of the country for the two previ- 
               <br />
               ous years, and felt if economy and 
               <br />
               ordinary prudence were observed. we 
               <br />
               could do so. On the 19th <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of‘June</span> 
               <br />
               when the measure was before the

               <br />
               stance combined to admonish us to

               <br />
               necessity of this, I knew the country 
               <br />
               required we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span> do so. Yet in the 
               <br />
               face of all reasonable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">retnonstrance,.</span> 
               <br />
               they introduced and carried the branch

               the hon. member for New London

               ing any provision for interest at all. 
               <br />
               I told them at the time that it would 
               <br />
               be attended with bad results, and that 
               <br />
               it might be the means of injuring the

               provision for paying the interest. 
               <br />
               Was it possible for the government to 
               <br />
               take a more effectual way to destroy 
               <br />
               the public credit of the colony? But
