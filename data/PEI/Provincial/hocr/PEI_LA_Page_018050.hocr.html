               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mention</span> that Hon. Mr. Gray of New Brunswick, in one of 
               <br />
               his speeches after his return from Canada, stated that all 
               <br />
               the delegates at the Conference had signed the Report, 
               <br />
               and would be bound in honor to support it. This, I 
               <br />
               thought, was going too far, so I wrote a letter to the 
               <br />
               newspapers here contradicting the statement, and showing 
               <br />
               ' garded myself. And, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fSir,</span> ve been informed during this debate that two 
               <br />
               others of the delegates from this Island have not signed the 
               <br />
               document. The absence of their signatures, however, is 
               <br />
               little consequence, as they have agreed to the 
               <br />
               Report, one of .them having broadly declared that its 
               <br />
               principles are just and liberal to Prince Edward Island. 
               <br />
               It was understood that the proceedings at the Conference 
               <br />
               should be secret; but they have been alluded to by 
               <br />
               delegates at other places, therefore there can be very little 
               <br />
               impropriety in referring to them in this discussion. I 
               <br />
               may also mention here that when the proposition in favor 
               <br />
               was ﬁrstmade at the Charlottetown Conference, 
               <br />

               make these explanations, for it may be 
               <br />
               necessary in the course of my remarks to refer to the 
               <br />
               proceedings at the Conference in self vindication. Only 
               <br />
               two of us, I believe, who were delegates to Quebec,object 
               <br />
               to the terms of the Report. For this Opposition we have 
               <br />
               been charged as being almost traitors. Indeed it has 
               <br />
               been afﬁrmed that Anti-unionists are guilty of combining
