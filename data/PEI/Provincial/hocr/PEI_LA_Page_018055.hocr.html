               <br />
               under the Land Purchase Act. This money, however, forms 
               <br />
               no part of our lriCal revenues ; it is all required to make up the

               <br />

               <br />
               is different; their public lands are Crown lands, the sale of 
               <br />
               which brings in a large revenue, that will be wholly available 
               <br />

               Provinces are to receive 80 cents per head for their local wants 
               <br />
               as well as this Island, and that New Brunswick is guaranteed a 
               <br />
               subsidy besides, they are tolerably well provided for. But 
               <br />
               Canada will fare still better. ller local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revenues</span> in 1863,88 
               <br />
               given by Hon. Mr. Galt, ‘were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$l.297,043;</span> and the allowance 
               <br />
               of80 cents per head of her <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population</span> would yield her about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$2,-</span> 
               <br />
               000,000, which will just be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$2,000,000</span> more than she now 
               <br />
               expends out of the public funds for local purposes. This Island 
               <br />
               hitherto has almost solely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">relied</span> on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'her</span> customs’ revenue, and 
               <br />
               therefore it is that with the small per capita allowance of 80 
               <br />
               cents, we would be unable to carry on the local government 
               <br />
               without resortiiigto direct taxation. We are even prevented from 
               <br />
               levying an export duty on our produce, whilethis privilege is 
               <br />
               allowed Nova Scolia and New Brunswick on certain articles. 
               <br />
               Taking all these points into consideration, I think it is clear that 
               <br />
               the Report before us is not such a; should be adopted by this 
               <br />
               House. To enter such a Confederation as is here proposed 
               <br />
               would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">evidently“</span> prove ruinous to the Colony. Ifa change is 
               <br />
               thought <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">desirable,</span> I consider it would be more for our advantage 
               <br />
               to have a representation in the British Parliament, and to 
               <br />
               pay a per centage to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Imperial</span> Government out <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of‘our</span>

               revenue for airy purpose they may think proper. I believe 
               <br />
               that one representative there would secure for us a greater share 
               <br />
               of justice than we are ever likely to receive from a federal
