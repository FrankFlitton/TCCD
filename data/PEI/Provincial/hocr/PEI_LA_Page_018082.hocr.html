               <br />
               what I said last Session, I Will be brief in any further re- 
               <br />
               marks which I have to make touching the subject. As <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">res.</span> 
               <br />
               pects the Resolutimis which have been submitted by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon.</span> 
               <br />
               the Leader of the Government. I will now merely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">observe</span> 
               <br />
               that. had I been consulted concerning them, I would have 
               <br />
               advised the striking out of the middle one, and the reten- 
               <br />
               tion of only the ﬁrst and last. I know not what pressure 
               <br />
               has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">brought</span> to bear upon the Government , but I be- 
               <br />
               lieve some has, and the effect has been the bringing down 
               <br />
               of the Resolutions in their present form. As they stand. 
               <br />
               however, I will vote for them. I certainly was once, I 
               <br />
               must confess, in favor of a Federal Union of these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces,</span> 
               <br />
               because I was of opinion that. it would give as greater weight 
               <br />
               at the Colonial Ofﬁce, Where the inﬂuence of the large pro- 
               <br />
               prietors had always prevailed ageinst us to the hinderanae
