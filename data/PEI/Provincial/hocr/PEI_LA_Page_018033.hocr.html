               <br />
               and twenty—three thousand dollars, while, if the Canada 
               <br />
               Tariff and system had been in force in Nova <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scotia,</span> this 
               <br />
               sum would have been only three hundred and ninety

               dollars as the people of Nova Scotia paid under their 
               <br />
               present Tariff. To make this apparent, I need only 
               <br />
               mention that in the year 1863, the people of Canada con- 
               <br />
               sumed three millions seven hundred and sixty—seven 
               <br />
               thousand nine hundred and seventy—nine gallons of 
               <br />
               liquors, upon which they paid a duty of only three pence 
               <br />
               three far-things of our currency per gallon; that they also 
               <br />
               consumed eight millions sixty thousand one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hundred-and</span> 
               <br />
               forty-nine pounds of manufactured tobacco, on which 
               <br />
               theydid not pay one single farthing of duty. Yet, if we 
               <br />
               look at the newspapers in this Island, we will see how it 
               <br />
               has been paraded that the Canada <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Tariffon</span> manufactured 
               <br />
               tobacco is thirty per cent. Yes, but our people had it 
               <br />
               not explained to them that this duty is only levied on 
               <br />
               foreign manufactured tobacco ; the eight millions were 
               <br />
               manufactured in Canada, and we could have imported it, 
               <br />
               if in Confederation, duty free. i

               <br />
               ruin them, then lwill admit that their ideas of union and 
               <br />
               those which I entertain are widely dissimilar. It was 
               <br />
               onlv a short time since that I was under the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">impression.</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that,</span> under the tariff of Canada, Tea and Sugar would be 
               <br />
               a triﬂe dearer than we now have them in Charlottetown, 
               <br />
               because these are some thousand miles further for the place 
               <br />
               of transit of these articles, butI ﬁnd I was mistaken, and 
               <br />
               that they can be sold as low under the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariff</span> of Canada 
               <br />
               as under our own; hence I maintain, if the people were 
               <br />
               truthfully informed, that they would see that it is clear 
               <br />
               as the sun at noonday, that if we become the consumers, 
               <br />
               duty free, of the various manufactures of four millions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 
               <br />
               people, possessing abundance of water-power, raw mater— 
               <br />
               ial and steadily increasing markets, the great bulk of the- 
               <br />
               population of this Island could dispense <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with;</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con—«</span> 
               <br />
               sumption of dutiable articles, with the exception of tea, 
               <br />
               sugar, and molasses, the prices of which, I have shown, 
               <br />
               are not higher under the Canadian than our own tariﬁ. 
               <br />
               We should ﬁnd also that, instead of the Revenue annually 
               <br />
               required to be raised being doubled, under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation,</span> 
               <br />
               as the opponents of the measure scruple not to assert, it 
               <br />
               would not be one half of its present amount, and each 
               <br />
               year would witness its diminution proportionately to the 
               <br />
               increase of our population. The existing tariffs of all the 
               <br />
               Provinces would, this year, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Give</span> a surplus of nearly one 
               <br />
               million over their aggregate expenditure, and it has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> 
               <br />
               clearly shown that the elevation of the lowest to the level 
               <br />
               of the highest would produce more money than the requi- 
               <br />
               rements of the public service demand; and, therefore, 
               <br />
               it has been clearly understood that, should We go into 
               <br />
               Confederation, it will be prOpcsed to reduce the present 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Tariff</span> of Canada to a medium standard with those of the 
               <br />
               other Provinces. A country starting, as it were, into life, 
               <br />
               with a surplus of a million, commences with happy 
               <br />
               auguries for the future. This sum would pay the interest 
               <br />
               of a loan of twenty—ﬁve millions, and we know that the 
               <br />
               Home Government would guarantee this atfour per cent. 
               <br />
               It would pay for the Intercolonial Railroad,Canals where- 
               <br />
               ever-needed, and provide amply for the public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">defences;-</span> 
               <br />
               and, while mentioning the defences, I may remark that, 
               <br />
               not only would the people ofthis Island save severalpounds 
               <br />
               per head, yearly, by the importation‘of so many articles, 
               <br />
               duty free, but they would save the expense of arms and 
               <br />
               material, and of annual - maintenance of the militia. 
               <br />
               Speaker, we may rest assured that, in Confederation, 
               <br />
               out <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of‘</span> Confederation, the people of Great Britain will 
               <br />
               hat they will not, in future, pay more towards
