               <br />
               it is noticeable that a good deal of 
               <br />
               repetition has been uttered in what 
               <br />
               has already been said. Some hon. 
               <br />
               members say they have, against their 
               <br />

               this respect it is as much against. their

               <br />
               other hon. members seem to think it 
               <br />
               is wholly due to the action of the late

               The hon. member for Souris, with 
               <br />
               respect to building the branch lines, 
               <br />
               said he laid a trap for the Government. 
               <br />
               How this was done is best known to 
               <br />
               the hon. member himself. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ido</span> know,

               however, that the branch lines formed 
               <br />
               a part of the Railway Act, and by it 
               <br />
               they had to be carried into eﬁ‘ect, as 
               <br />
               much as the building of the main line,
