               <br />
               our little Island should have not only 
               <br />
               had her credit damaged, but her name

               disgraced by such shameful conduct,

               They say when they came into power, 
               <br />
               they found an empty Treasury. The 
               <br />
               statement is not correct. There were 
               <br />
               but $15,000 aﬂoat in Warrants when 
               <br />
               we went out of ofﬁce, now we find 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">5116.000</span> are out. We left in 
               <br />
               the Treasury and Banks about 31,400 
               <br />
               in cash more than we found there 
               <br />
               when coming into power again. This 
               <br />
               money they should have- retained for 
               <br />
               the purpose of paying land damage 
               <br />
               claims. Instead of doing that, they 
               <br />
               paid it out for other purposes. Why, 
               <br />
               they could not in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all'they</span> did, have 
               <br />
               taken any more effectual way for ruin-

               <br />
               Let such a state of aﬂairs become 
               <br />
               known at home, and our paper would

               <br />
               now is to build up our public credit. 
               <br />
               There is nothing so hard to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">restore</span> as

               care not to do anything which might 
               <br />
               bring about such a result. The Con-

               for raising the interest accruing upon 
               <br />

               <br />
               to-day. This cry took the people by 
               <br />
               surprise. They believed if Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion was carried on the terms secured 
               <br />

               judices it gave rise to, some of the 
               <br />
               strongest Anti-Confederate districts in 
               <br />
               the Island voted for Confederation. 
               <br />
               ButI maintain if the matter was in-
