               That the late Government party made

               that question,. a much larger vote 
               <br />
               would have been recorded against 
               <br />
               Confederation. I have no hesitation 
               <br />
               in saying this. The Leader of the 
               <br />
               Opposition tells us that we are, by 
               <br />
               going into the Dominion, only enlarg- 
               <br />
               ing and adding to our rights and privi~ 
               <br />
               leges. I see matters in a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> 
               <br />
               light. We are simply giving <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">up,to</span> 
               <br />
               the Dominion the greatest privileges 
               <br />
               any people ever possessed. We enjoy 
               <br />
               the sole right of making our own laws, 
               <br />
               of taxing ourselves as we see ﬁt, and 
               <br />
               spending these when collected, as he 
               <br />
               may deem proper; and all these bless- 
               <br />
               iugs and privileges we are surrender- 
               <br />
               ing simply for the glory of becoming a 
               <br />
               part of a great country. Yet the 
               <br />
               greatness of Canada is more in the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extent,</span> of her territory, than in any- 
               <br />
               thing else. The greater portion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of‘her</span> 
               <br />
               wide domain is yet a wilderness.‘ True 
               <br />
               her public works are in excess of those 
               <br />
               of any other country, according to her 
               <br />
               pepulation, and her debt will soon be 
               <br />
               in the same proportion. Yet hon. 
               <br />
               members speak as if we were going 
               <br />
               ' to Paradise. But what are the

               more, according to our population, 
               <br />
               than any part of the Dominion. This 
               <br />
               is an incontrovertible fact. We send 
               <br />
               more children to school, and mail more 
               <br />
               letters, in proportion to the number of 
               <br />
               our people, than in any part of Canada.
