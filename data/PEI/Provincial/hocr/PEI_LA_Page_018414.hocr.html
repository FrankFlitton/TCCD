               <br />
               salaries will be increased, when they 
               <br />
               will be enabled to live as becomes

               their high station in society, without 
               <br />
               having to resort to an occupation which 
               <br />
               Judges should not engage in. He 
               <br />
               considered it the duty of the House to 
               <br />
               set their faces against all such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mea~</span> 
               <br />
               sures. It was all very well for them 
               <br />
               to say they only intended to act for 
               <br />
               relatives; but in passing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">such\a</span> Bill 
               <br />
               we would be endorsing a principle 
               <br />
               which would be susceptible of great 
               <br />
               abuse, and calculated to dishonor the 
               <br />
               Bench. This House will take the 
               <br />
               wisest course, if it sets its face against 
               <br />
               this and all like measures. To keep 
               <br />
               our Judges clear of all such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">transac~</span> 
               <br />
               tion, in so far as legislation can do so, 
               <br />
               was the clear duty of the House.
