               pursued by the Colonial Secretary last year was such that

               prepared to vote against the Resolutions; but, as I believe

               that ninety-nine out of every hundred of the peopleare 
               <br />
               against Confederation, I think we, as their representatives, 
               <br />
               are bound to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">represent</span> or express their views, even though 
               <br />
               the matter has not been submitted to them at an election, 
               <br />
               And as to the Government not being composed of members 
               <br />
               who are all favorable to the Quebec <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scheme,</span> if so. the Lead-

               er of the Opposition would support the Government. and 
               <br />
               we Would have no OppositiOn at all. Now, there are two 
               <br />
               or three points in that Scheme which I particularly object 
               <br />
               to. though I do not intend to go into the details. Itepte- 
               <br />
               sentation by population is not fair as regards this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country-</span>

               fereut interests as there are in a country like this.-' 
               <br />
               Therefore, I do not believe in it as a principle. It is not

               London would have more representatives than Scotland-
