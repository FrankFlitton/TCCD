               about it. The hon. gentlemen who 
               <br />
               were willing to accept the Quebec

               have no just reason for refusmg the

               reasonable terms offered now for our 
               <br />
               acceptance. No doubt; the hon. mem-

               ber, the Leader of the Government, 
               <br />

               believe the hon. member Will insist
