               <br />
               proceed with the calculation of expenses. The Confederated 
               <br />
               Provinces would set out with a debt of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$25</span> per head : fortiﬁca-

               tions will add at least $5 per head more, and gunboats and 
               <br />
               other naval armaments probably an equal sum. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Then</span> there is the 
               <br />
               Intercolonial railway, which will cost at least <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$15,000,000,</span> and 
               <br />
               add a further debt of $5 per head of the population. The 
               <br />
               enlargement ofthe Canals is another project, requiring a draft on 
               <br />
               the ﬁnances, which is to he proceeded with as soon as practicable. 
               <br />
               This work will add not less than other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$5</span> per head to the 
               <br />
               general debt, and what with the opening up of the North West 
               <br />
               Territory, and other expenses which I have not enumerated, 
               <br />
               will run up the debt to 
               <br />
               the Confederate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinm's.</span> We have been informed during this 
               <br />
               debate that the debt of the United States now amounts to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$125</span> 
               <br />
               per head of her people. But this debt was caused by a pro— 
               <br />
               tracted war. Our debt of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$60</span> per head would be incurred 
               <br />
               during peace; and should war break out with the States, even 
               <br />
               for a short time. our would soon be equal to theirs. I 
               <br />
               believe that a few hundred pounds Spent on a friendly delegation 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Washington</span> would save millions of dollars. and do much 
               <br />
               more to preserve peace between the two countries than all the 
               <br />
               fortiﬁcations which could be built. All these expenses to which 
               <br />
               I have referred, a large portion of which will have to be borne 
               <br />
               by the General Government should Union take place, shew 
               <br />
               clearly that our taxation under Confederation must be very 
               <br />
               heavy indeed. But some say that the people of this Island are 
               <br />
               too lightly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tawed.</span> I admit that were the money spent among 
               <br />
               themselves in local improvements, perhaps they would not 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under</span> by a little higher taxation ; but when the money is to be 
               <br />
               taken away and spent in other Provinces, it quite alters the 
               <br />
               case. This [louse has just voted £50,000 to aid tenants in 
               <br />
               purchasing their farms ; Sir, we would be acting more wisely to 
               <br />
               vote £150,000 for this purpose than to enter the Union. The 
               <br />
               £50,000 which we have voted this year would be nearly the 
               <br />
               amount we would lose every year under Confederation. In 
               <br />
               Canada they have stamp duties and other taxes which we in 
               <br />
               this Island know nothing about; and once united with that 
               <br />
               country they would send down their collectors to gather up the 
               <br />
               money and carry it off. Talk of our young men rising to 
               <br />
               judgeships, and to be premiers in Canada ; why, Sir, they have 
               <br />
               far too many hangers on of their own, for our_ youth ever to 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               shipping trade upon those mighty lakes. Again, look at the

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               much so. In some places rich alluvial deposit is‘ found to

               you that while in ten years the wheat crop increased in the

               Europe, while some places have yielded the almost incredible
