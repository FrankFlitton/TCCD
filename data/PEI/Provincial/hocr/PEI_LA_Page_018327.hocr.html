               had to be let on the 30th of December,

               yet no Contractor saw the road. We

               surface road than the trunk ”line. 
               <br />
               They accused us of overlooking ‘the

               tender“ of O‘Brien and others, and

               they allowed Mr. Schrieber to alter

               in the matter they have shown that

               the men we let the mainline to were

               branches, it would be impossible to 
               <br />
               ﬂoat them in the market. Well, what 
               <br />
               were they to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do‘?</span> The time had ex- 
               <br />
               pired. The contract had .to be let. 
               <br />
               They found themselves wholly in the 
               <br />
               power of the Contractors whose offer 
               <br />
               they had accepted. One of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">theistipu-</span>

               lations of the contract for the main 
               <br />
               line was, that ten per cent of all 
               <br />
               moneys as they became due and were 
               <br />
               to be paid to the Contractor should be 
               <br />
               retained as a guarantee on the part of 
               <br />
               their securities, that the conditions of 
               <br />
               the contract would be faithfully ful- 
               <br />
               ﬁlled. Hence ten dollars out of every 
               <br />
               one hundred was retained and held 
               <br />
               back as security. The Contractors 
               <br />
               ﬁnding the government in this dilemma, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offered</span> to sign the contract provided 
               <br />
               they would pay over to them the ten 
               <br />
               per cent. thus retained. This they 
               <br />
               did. Now I contend we have no se- 
               <br />
               curity on the main line at all, but the 
               <br />
               character of the men who have the

               <br />
               selves in. Had they done no more, 
               <br />
               this in itself was sufﬁcient to condemn 
               <br />
               them. But in every not. since, and in 
               <br />
               ways which none but themselves 
               <br />
               would have thought of, they resorted 
               <br />
               to those means best suited to destroy 
               <br />

               <br />
               saw that trade was falling oil“, that our

               shipments would fall below the aver-

               to Kensington, at his reqnest, added a

               good deal to its length, anti the same 
               <br />
               was the case in bringing it to other 
               <br />
               points, in order that the country at

               large might‘he more generally accom—

               modated. The Engineers told them

               plainly that the line could not be 
               <br />
               shortened more than ﬁve miles. and 
               <br />
               not then for the rate per mile allowed 
               <br />
               by the Act. Then again, the amount 
               <br />
               paid for land damages was far in ex- 
               <br />
               cess <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> what was fair, and the modes

               resorted to for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disposing</span> of Debentures

               <br />
               I do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hesitate</span> to say, that in many 
               <br />
               cases, the amount paid for land dam- 
               <br />
               ages was one hundred per cent. more 
               <br />
               than it should have been. Then in 
               <br />
               the. manner they hawked about the 
               <br />
               land damage <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Debentures,</span> they injured 
               <br />
               the credit of the colony and the inter- 
               <br />
               ests of the Centractors at the same 
               <br />
               time. The Contractors made an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or:-</span>

               ing of their Debentures. This was 
               <br />
               simply a legitimate Bank transaction. 
               <br />
               Now, surely it was due to these men

               to maintain the credit. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the colony.
