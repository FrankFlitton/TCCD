               hon. Mr. Haythorne is as silent as the

               grave. They created an excitement

               in the country against Mr. Pope's 
               <br />
               Government, Burpee and Schrieber 
               <br />
               and the Engineers, which was worse

               than a ﬁre, for a ﬁre can only destroy 
               <br />

               dence, may again restore, but when 
               <br />
               you succeed in robbing any man or 
               <br />
               body of men of their public character, 
               <br />
               it may not, in all cases, be in the 
               <br />
               power of the injured party to recover 
               <br />
               it again. Last year the Patriot 
               <br />
               searched diligently for telegrams, and 
               <br />
               in reference thereto made statements 
               <br />
               which were not correct. But Sir, 
               <br />
               these of the Pope Government were 
               <br />
               but a triﬂe compared with those of 
               <br />
               the late party. I might begin with 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst public man in the Colony who 
               <br />
               voted for the Railroad, and end with 
               <br />
               the loudest in its favor, hon. H. Bell.

               and show up the inconsistency of their 
               <br />
               conduct as public men. But it would 
               <br />
               be but an expose of weak and mis- 
               <br />
               directed political conduct which failed

               able <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to"do.</span> The hon. member for 
               <br />
               New London made an able effort this 
               <br />
               morning, and one which I believe will 
               <br />
               have its effect upon those hon. mem- 
               <br />
               bers who make those charges. That 
               <br />
               hon. member showed clearly that the 
               <br />
               expenditure for the past year, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">notwith‘</span> 
               <br />
               standing the heavy demands upon the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Treasury,</span> did not exceed the Revenue. 
               <br />
               “ But," says the hon. member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Tig‘</span> 
               <br />
               nish, “ the late Government called in 
               <br />
               all the Warrants and issued a 10 
               <br />
               more.” That hon. member knows tha 
               <br />
               the Coalition Government called it 
               <br />
               the Warrants when they were in 
               <br />
               power, and paid them off with thn 
               <br />
               money they obtained for Railway <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pur6</span> 
               <br />
               poses. The hon member says that i‘ 
               <br />
               is true the Coalition carried the Railt 
               <br />
               way Bill, but the late Governmen' 
               <br />
               came in and carried the Branch Billt 
               <br />
               which was the last straw that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">broke:</span> 
               <br />
               the camel’s back, and that they are, 
               <br />
               therefore, responsible for the whole.
