               Ms. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Howa'r'r.</span> — Mr. Chairman, 
               <br />
               there are two Resolutions now before 
               <br />
               this hon. Committee, and I may table 
               <br />
               a third when the proper time arrives. 
               <br />
               The matter is important, and time 
               <br />
               should be taken to consider what we 
               <br />
               are doing. I have listened attentively 
               <br />
               to the arguments on both sides, and 
               <br />
               can Only notice that one side blames 
               <br />
               the other for the difﬁculties which 
               <br />
               have come upon the country; hold~ 
               <br />
               ing it up as a misfortune that such 
               <br />
               and such should have occurred. If, 
               <br />
               however, as so many seem to argue, 
               <br />
               Confederation is to be such a beneﬁt 
               <br />
               to us, then I cannot see why hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen should not be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rejoicing,</span> in- 
               <br />
               stead of mourning over Our position. 
               <br />
               If we are going into a partnership so 
               <br />
               desirable. there is surely no cause for 
               <br />
               complaining. But in so far as I can 
               <br />
               see, there has been nothing, as yet, 
               <br />
               brought forward to show that we are 
               <br />
               going to receive an equivalent for what 
               <br />
               we are going to give up. Suppose 
               <br />
               we do go in, it is clear that a large 
               <br />
               amount will soon be required for local 
               <br />
               purposes, which can only be had by 
               <br />
               local taxation. Can the general Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment exist without 8. Revenue? 
               <br />
               We know it cannot. If, as some hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman has said, the Revenue of the 
               <br />
               Dominion is increasing, so also is taxa- 
               <br />
               tion. and of necessity they must be re- 
               <br />
               ceiving more from the Provinces than 
               <br />
               they return. Whatever the cost of the 
               <br />
               Dominion Government may be, or for 
               <br />
               whatever purpose we will be required, 
               <br />
               if we go in, in all time coming to pay 
               <br />
               the one-fortieth part of it. I contend, 
               <br />
               therefore, that a little more time 
               <br />
               should be taken before we rush into 
               <br />
               an arrangement so important. The 
               <br />
               probability is, that by delaying the 
               <br />
               matter a while longer, we will get a 
               <br />
               little more money, although for my 
               <br />
               part I refuse to enter in on any terms. 
               <br />
               If, however, hon. members are deter- 
               <br />
               mined to unite on some terms, they 
               <br />

               will do well to look carefully into the 
               <br />
               amount proposed to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be.</span> allowed by the 
               <br />
               Dominion for our Railway. It is set 
               <br />
               at three and one quarter millions Of 
               <br />
               dollars. But supposing it should, as I 
               <br />
               believe it will, cost more than that 
               <br />
               amount, We should have to make up 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference.</span> On this matter there 
               <br />
               should be a distinct'understanding, so 
               <br />
               there may be no difﬁculty about it in 
               <br />
               the future. I am only speaking in case 
               <br />
               Confederation should be decided upon, 
               <br />
               so that if we do go in,the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arrange</span> 
               <br />
               ment should be such that we would 
               <br />
               have fair play, and a fair race with the 
               <br />
               other Provinces. It will be one of 
               <br />
               those bargains which a dissolution 
               <br />
               cannot break. It will be binding for 
               <br />
               all time to come. I cannot, therefore, 
               <br />
               in view of the Opinions expressed on 
               <br />
               both sides, but express my belief that 
               <br />
               the course pointed out by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Leader 
               <br />
               of the Government is the proper one 
               <br />
               to pursue. Hon. members on the 
               <br />
               opposite side speak as if we were go- 
               <br />
               ing up on a begging excursion. For 
               <br />
               my part I look at the whole question 
               <br />
               from ﬁrst to last as a begging one. 
               <br />
               The late Government assumed the 
               <br />
               position of paupers from the ﬁrst. 
               <br />
               They have placed us in such a position 
               <br />
               that we cannot now say we will go in 
               <br />
               of our own free choice. Make the 
               <br />
               best you can of it, you <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.will</span> go in as 
               <br />
               paupers. I believe in a few years, 
               <br />
               with care and prudence, we would 
               <br />
               surmount our difﬁculties. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sIn</span> the other 
               <br />
               Provinces they are taxed $40 on every 
               <br />
               £1000 of property they own. The 
               <br />
               Dominion Government have got them- 
               <br />
               selves in that position, that they can- 
               <br />
               not help themselves. In the Do- 
               <br />
               minion new Railways will be spring- 
               <br />
               ing up in all directions, and these will 
               <br />
               lead to increased taxation. In addi- 
               <br />
               tion to our burden, in Confederation, 
               <br />
               we will have to shoulder our propor- 
               <br />
               tion of the burden of Canada also, yet 
               <br />
               I approve more of the course proposed 
               <br />
               to be taken by his honor the Leader 
               <br />

               <br />
               son advanced to justify the basis Of the 
               <br />
               resolution before this hon. committee. 
               <br />
               His honor the Leader of the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment has not set forth any cause for 
               <br />
               leading the committee to suppose that 
               <br />
               any additional allowance will be oou~ 
               <br />
               ceded over those already brought 
               <br />
               down. When they go to the Ministry 
               <br />
               ll. Ottawa,with demands for the Light- 
               <br />
               house on Summerside wharf, and other 
               <br />
               similar works, they will be given to 
               <br />
               understand that the general Govern- 
               <br />
               ment does not, and will not, grant. 
               <br />
               allowances to any Provinces for such 
               <br />
               works. But I believe. Sir, that the 
               <br />
               hon. member must have some other 
               <br />
               object in view in going up. We have 
               <br />
               a right to know, Mr. Chairman, if the 
               <br />
               Government are going to accept the 
               <br />
               basis of $45 ahead, and to allow the 
               <br />
               general Government to have the Rail- 
               <br />
               way as Dominica property? Or do 
               <br />
               the members on the Government side 
               <br />
               of this committee concur in agreeing to 
               <br />
               take the road and work it ourselves? 
               <br />
               Ifso it will give the Government the 
               <br />
               power of expending the interest Of 
               <br />
               nearly $5,000,000. To me it does 
               <br />
               appear as if the intention of the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment is to secure all the patronage 
               <br />
               they can for their friends, and for that 
               <br />
               purpose may agree to keep the Rail-

               <br />
               Island. It would. no doubt, give our 
               <br />
               Government here a large amount of 
               <br />
               money to expend annually, but in the 
               <br />
               end, the road, as a public work, will 
               <br />
               become a failure. It will annually 
               <br />
               depreciate in value, and becomes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">buer-</span> 
               <br />
               den upon the Colony. Lord Dufferin’s 
               <br />
               telegraphic despatch distinctly states 
               <br />
               that better Terms will not be agreed 
               <br />
               to. I believe the Government are 
               <br />
               perfectly satisﬁed the Terms are just 
               <br />
               and honorable. NO one here ever 
               <br />
               supposed the Canadian Government 
               <br />
               intended to take the road oﬁ‘ our hands. 
               <br />
               As matters now stand we will have 
               <br />
               the Railway with all its advan- 
               <br />
               tages, and yet it will not cost us any- 
               <br />
               thing, as the Terms brought down 
               <br />
               provides that it shall belong to the 
               <br />
               General Government. They have 
               <br />
               not shown that the Terms offered are 
               <br />
               unfair, or that the basis upon which 
               <br />
               they rest is money. I know the hon. 
               <br />
               member, the Leader of the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, is not a man who would go up 
               <br />
               to beg. But he can go up there and 
               <br />
               make proposals without doing that. 
               <br />
               I am inclined to think that he wishes 
               <br />
               to take the Railway off the hands of 
               <br />
               the Dominion Government. At one 
               <br />
               time, I believe, the hon. member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offer</span> 
               <br />
               ed to take the road and work it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">him~</span> 
               <br />
               self. And as there would be nothing 
               <br />
               unconstitutional in his asking to have 
               <br />
               it retained as a local work, this com- 
               <br />
               mittee should be very careful and not 
               <br />
               hastily bind itself to support such 
               <br />
               Terms as the delegates may thus agree 
               <br />
               to. For if the hon. member and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘the</span> 
               <br />
               delegates <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whp</span> - may go up should 
               <br />
               make an arrangement of that kind, it 
               <br />
               would entail eternal ruin upon this 
               <br />
               Island. It would give them an in- 
               <br />
               terest at ﬁrst in what they would make 
               <br />
               on the ﬁrst cost of the road. But at 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pyesent</span> the work is suspended, because 
               <br />
               the Debentures are worthless in the
