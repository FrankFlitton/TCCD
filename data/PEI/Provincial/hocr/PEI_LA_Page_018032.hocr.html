               I would observe, it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">must</span> be very obvious to those who choose 
               <br />
               to understand, that if the people of Upper Canada have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">np</span>

               <br />
               next point I would remark upon is our share in the Repre- 
               <br />
               sentation in the General <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Parliament,</span> and the complaints 
               <br />
               of the objectors that we have too few members. When 
               <br />
               the revolted Provinces ordained and established their 
               <br />
               Constitution, it was provided that Representatives from 
               <br />
               any State might be sent- to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Parliament</span> in the proportion 
               <br />
               of one member to every thirty thousand of the population. 
               <br />
               The State of Delaware, large and inﬂuential, as well as 
               <br />
               that of Rhode Island, somewhat similar in extent to this 
               <br />
               Colony, did not think it against the interests of their 
               <br />
               people to enter their Union with one member each; this 
               <br />
               Island is invited to enter the proposed Confederation with 
               <br />
               ﬁve. We are also told that our four members in the 
               <br />
               Council will be no protection to our interests; and that the 
               <br />
               custom obtaining in the United States is far better. Now 
               <br />
               let us take this view of the question, and follow the 
               <br />
               United States’ system. Vancouver, Columbia, Red River, 
               <br />
               Upper Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfound- 
               <br />
               land and Prince Edward Island, each sends two members 
               <br />
               to the Upper Chamber; If a question arose <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affecting</span> our 
               <br />
               sectional rights, interests and privileges, do we imagine 
               <br />
               that our two members could carry the point against the 
               <br />
               other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sixteen?</span> But, I would ask, has a case over occurred 
               <br />
               in which such injustice was attempted or even hinted at, 
               <br />
               as the opponents of Confederation are so grievously afraid 
               <br />
               of? At the time of the Revolution, the white population 
               <br />
               of the whole thirteen States was less than that of Canada 
               <br />
               at this time. The population of Canada is now consider- 
               <br />
               ably more than thirty times that of this Island, and if we 
               <br />
               are to follow the plan of the United States to mete out 
               <br />
               even-handed justice, we must ﬁrst portion out Canada 
               <br />
               into thirteen sections, approximating to what the United 
               <br />
               States were at the time of their Union, not what they now 
               <br />
               are. But. I would ask, is it necessary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thatwe</span> should _go 
               <br />
               into this Confederation with our hearts and mindsﬁlled With 
               <br />
               suspicions? Is it a foregone conclusion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> us that all 
               <br />
               the other Provinces will unite to do injustice to one 
               <br />
               particular section of their common country? Yet we 
               <br />
               have all these dark surmisings, and much more freely 
               <br />

               importations of 1863 would have paid a duty of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">£41,963</span> ; 
               <br />
               they, under the Canada Tariff, had they been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">imported</span> from 
               <br />
               places beyond the limits of Confederation, would have been 
               <br />
               chargeable with £69,792. The opponents of Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion will, doubtless, exclaim, ‘ Here is conclusive evidence 
               <br />
               that were we to enter the Confederation we should 
               <br />
               annually lose thereby to the extent of£27,829. I submit, 
               <br />
               with deference to these gentlemen, that it is evidence of 
               <br />
               no such thing.’ ” Here we have language so plain that it 
               <br />
               is sad to see with what a reckless disregard of truth we 
               <br />
               have had it paraded in the columns of some of our Island 
               <br />
               newspapers “ the advocates of Union admit a loss of 
               <br />
               £27,000.” That this misstatement was made for a. pur— 
               <br />
               pose can scarcely be doubted; for it has been the great 
               <br />
               capital upon which the opponents have traded to frighten 
               <br />
               and intimidate our people. I ask, what conﬁdence can 
               <br />
               the people place in statements so unblushingly made by 
               <br />
               those from whom they ought to expect truthful informa- 
               <br />
               tion on such an important <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">point"!</span> but I acquit those 
               <br />
               gentlemen who, at the public meetings, repeated this 
               <br />
               misstatement. I have no doubt they were led into the 
               <br />
               error from reading it in those of our Island newspapers, 
               <br />
               which have not hesitated to misquote the Hon Col Secre- 
               <br />
               tary. That the hon gentleman’s statement was perfectly 
               <br />
               correct I will show as I proceed. I believe that many of 
               <br />
               our people do not rightly comprehend the meaning or hear- 
               <br />
               ing of the term Tariff. Some of them fancy that a. Tariﬁis 
               <br />
               a direct tax, somewhat like our land tax, and quite as 
               <br />
               objectionable. Others again proclaim that if we go into 
               <br />
               the Union and the Tariff be increased ﬁve per ccnt._, we 
               <br />
               must necessarily pay one-twentieth more for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the'articles</span> 
               <br />
               of ordinary consumption than we now do. [Will show 
               <br />
               the fallacy of this. We are not a rich people, but those 
               <br />
               among us who can afford to purchase <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cxpenswe</span> articles of 
               <br />
               foreign manufacture, such as English carriages, harness, 
               <br />
               saddlery,silks,vclvets,jcwe1ry, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">broadcloths,</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">GXPBPEWB</span> 
               <br />
               wines, surely they should not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">object</span> to pay one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Shilling</span> 
               <br />
               in the pound more for these articles than they now do. 
               <br />
               But it is the bulk of the people With Whose interests I 
               <br />
               would deal, and I maintain that, under the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canadian</span> 
               <br />
               Tariff, we can have the articles of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ordinary</span> consumptlcn
