               <br />
               We are disposed to deal with the

               question wholly and entirely upon its

               <br />
               this side of the House, we have waited 
               <br />
               to hear reasons advanced which might 
               <br />
               induce us to support the motion, but 
               <br />
               as yet no arguments have been brought 
               <br />
               forward that are of any value. They 
               <br />
               have utterly failed‘to open up a single 
               <br />
               one that is sufﬁcient to induce one 
               <br />
               member on this side to vote for the 
               <br />
               motion. The hon. member said he 
               <br />
               wished a delegation to go up sup- 
               <br />
               ported by a strong resolution of this 
               <br />
               House. Well I suppose he would like 
               <br />
               to have all the credit of bringing about 
               <br />
               Confederation. Unless he has grounds 
               <br />
               upon which to found an argument, and 
               <br />
               reason to suppose he will succeed in 
               <br />
               arranging better Terms of union, I 
               <br />
               hold it unworthy of the hon. member 
               <br />
               to think of having this House ad- 
               <br />
               journed for any such a purpose. To 
               <br />
               ask this House to adjourn in order that 
               <br />
               the'Leader of the Government may, 
               <br />
               in this matter, be placed in a higher 
               <br />
               position than he now occupies, when no 
               <br />
               advantage is to accrue to the country <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> 
               <br />
               by the act. is simply wrong. In 
               <br />
               looking at this question, we have to 
               <br />
               consider the cause which has forced 
               <br />
               us into our present position. Was it 
               <br />
               brought about by the Railway or 
               <br />
               otherwise? Whatever answer may 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">beagiven</span> to the question, it is agreed by 
               <br />
               all that Confederation must be carried, 
               <br />
               or the business of the country cannot 
               <br />
               be carried on. Hence Confederation 
               <br />
               appeals now, not to our party feelings, 
               <br />
               but to our patriotism. Although they 
               <br />
               claim to have on their side the whole 
               <br />

               late Government was expended for 
               <br />
               legitimate purposes. If there ever 
               <br />
               was a Dashaway policy inaugurated 
               <br />
               by any Government, it was when the 
               <br />
               Railway Bill was introduced. Not 
               <br />
               the Branch Bill of the late party, but 
               <br />
               the Dashaway Bill of the Govern— 
               <br />
               ment now in power. Were it not to 
               <br />
               me as clear as noonday that our duty 
               <br />
               is to accept of Confederation, and that 
               <br />
               there is no prospect of obtaining better 
               <br />
               Terms, I would not for a moment op— 
               <br />
               pose the motion of the hon. member. 
               <br />
               But believing as I do, that full justice 
               <br />
               has been done by the Privy Council 
               <br />
               of the Dominion of Canada in the 
               <br />
               Terms agreed to, I will not, by my 
               <br />
               vote, attempt to take any advantage of 
               <br />
               the Canadian Ministry. If the Terms 
               <br />
               are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fainand</span> honest in every particular,

               then our duty is to accept them. 
               <br />
               am surprised that hon. members on

               the Government side of this hon-

               We have been contending with sha-
