               they could not obtain the Terms they 
               <br />
               asked for, on the grounds they took, 
               <br />
               they asked for them in connection with 
               <br />
               our lands. We claimed that we 
               <br />
               should receive full compensation for 
               <br />
               the loss of our Crown lands. Ontario 
               <br />
               received a revenue of a million of 
               <br />
               dollars per year from her Crown lands, 
               <br />
               and it would be unfair that we sh0uld 
               <br />
               suffer on account of the granting away 
               <br />
               of our lands. Under this head we 
               <br />
               gained <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$5000,</span> although we received 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$15,000</span> per year less than the amount 
               <br />
               we claimed. In the claims put in by 
               <br />
               the last delegation we find them talk 
               <br />
               about rotten hemlock wood in our 
               <br />
               bridges and wharves. There was 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nothingmvery</span> powerful in that line of 
               <br />
               argument. The hon. Leader of the 
               <br />
               Government stated in this House, be- 
               <br />
               fore the last delegation were appointed, 
               <br />
               that unless we received <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$70,000</span> per 
               <br />
               year in addition to the Terms obtained 
               <br />
               by the late Government, the Colony 
               <br />
               could not work its way in Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion without resorting to immediate 
               <br />
               local taxation; but the Terms “they 
               <br />
               have obtained come far short of that 
               <br />

               amount, and according to his own 
               <br />
               argument, we shall still be compelled 
               <br />
               to resort to direct local taxation, im-

               if we accepted the Terms he has 
               <br />
               brought down. The last delegates 
               <br />
               asked $51 per head of our pOpulation, 
               <br />
               but obtained only $50 per head, which 
               <br />
               shows they were not all powerful with 
               <br />
               the Dominion authorities. I wonder 
               <br />
               how the Government are going to keep 
               <br />
               up a system of mail communication by 
               <br />
               inland steamers? Unless they send 
               <br />
               the mails regularly by those steamers, 
               <br />
               they cannot secure the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">5510.000</span> pro- 
               <br />
               mised them for that purpose. The 
               <br />
               country was assured that they had 
               <br />
               obtained <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$33,000</span> in addition to the 
               <br />
               Terms brought down by the former 
               <br />
               delegates, but that amount has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dwindl~</span> 
               <br />
               ed down to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$25,500.</span> However, I am 
               <br />
               ‘glad that the delegates have gone up 
               <br />
               to Ottawa, and that the Terms now be- 
               <br />
               fore us have been obtained, as Confed- 
               <br />
               eration will now be Supported by both 
               <br />
               political parties, with the exception of 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">no~Terms</span> men. I do not think 
               <br />
               any person could ﬁnd fault with the 
               <br />
               Opposition for opposing the sending 
               <br />
               of the last delegation to Ottawa, as 
               <br />
               they had no reason for expecting any 
               <br />
               additional concessions from the Do- 
               <br />
               minion immediately after the return of 
               <br />
               the former delegates from Canada, and 
               <br />
               as they had been elected by the people 
               <br />
               at the late election to accept the Terms 
               <br />
               then before the country. But as bet- 
               <br />
               Terms have actually been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">secured,‘</span> the 
               <br />
               country should be satisﬁed with the 
               <br />
               result of the last delegation. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eons</span> 
               <br />
               sider that the Opposition would have 
               <br />
               been guilty ofa derelictiou of duty, if, 
               <br />
               after having been returned to support 
               <br />
               the acceptance of the Terms secured 
               <br />
               by the late Government, they had not 
               <br />
               opposed sending another delegation. 
               <br />
               By following the course we then took, 
               <br />
               we were doing our duty tol our own 
               <br />
               constituents as well as to the Dominion 
               <br />
               Government. I sent no telegram to
