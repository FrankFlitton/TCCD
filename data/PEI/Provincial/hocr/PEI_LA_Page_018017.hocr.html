               <br />
               It was the duty of the Government, instead of acting as they have 
               <br />
               done, to have aimed at leading public opinion, and then taken 
               <br />
               the case to the polls. It is avery’easy course for a Government 
               <br />
               to pursue, merely to slip along without advancing their views on 
               <br />
               questions of the greatest importance to the country. There is 
               <br />
               another subject occupying a share of public attention—a Union 
               <br />
               of a different description to that under consideration, which has 
               <br />
               been passed over in silence in His <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">itcellency’s</span> speech. I 
               <br />
               allude <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to‘the</span> Tenant Union, and I am partly disposed to censure 
               <br />
               the Government for not declaring their sentiments in reference to 
               <br />
               this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">organization,</span> as its principles may have to be tested at the 
               <br />
               next general election. But i I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘will</span> not enter into that 
               <br />
               subject now. The Government of New Brusnvvick have 
               <br />
               taken decided action on the question of Union ; Hon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr‘Tilley</span> 
               <br />
               has declared himself in its favor and appealed to the people. If 
               <br />
               Confederation be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rejected</span> in that Province at the polls, will he 
               <br />
               retain ofﬁce? No, Mr Chairman, I believe he has too much 
               <br />
               principle to attempt anything so unconstitutional. , Allusion has 
               <br />
               also been made to Nova Scotia ; but from what I know of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> who is leader of the Government there, I think it is 
               <br />
               not at all probable that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">haxwill</span> shirk the question. It will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">came</span> 
               <br />
               up in the Legislature, and if he is unable to carry it I believe he 
               <br />
               will appeal to the people. Several members ofthe Government 
               <br />
               ofthis Island have expressed sentiments at public meetings ad- 
               <br />
               verse to the proposed Union. but as the Hon Col Secretary and 
               <br />
               the Hon Solicitor General are in favor of the measure, I suppose 
               <br />
               their colleagues have refrained from expressing an opinion in the 
               <br />
               Address lest these gentlemen should be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offended.</span> But they are 
               <br />
               not so carefulabout wounding the feelings ofsome of their friends.
