               Hon Mr LONGWORTH thought that there was no departure 
               <br />
               on the part of the Government from the Resolution of the 
               <br />
               House last Session relative to the importation of Stock. It 
               <br />
               was then the almost unanimous opinion of hon members that 
               <br />
               the old Clydesdale breed were preferable to any other for the 
               <br />
               agriculturalinterests ofthis Colony. Some thousands of pounds 
               <br />
               were realized by our farmers from the sale of that description 
               <br />
               ofhorses; the breed ofthe old Columbus and thehorses recently 
               <br />
               imported were selected from preciseiy the same Clydesdale 
               <br />
               Stock. He, too, was of opinion that it would be better had 
               <br />
               a thorough bred—or to use the ordinary. expression, a Blood 
               <br />
               Horse—been selected; but the Government had a speciﬁc 
               <br />
               duty to perform under the Resolution of last Session, to 
               <br />
               which they had adhered He also expressed his regret that 
               <br />
               the Model Farm system of breeding Stock had been abandoned; 
               <br />
               and hoped that sufﬁcient experience had been acquired to 
               <br />
               convince all parties interested of the advantages which would 
               <br />
               result from the resuscitation of the Model or Stock Farm. 
               <br />
               The hon member observed that though he was not a practical 
               <br />
               agriculturist to any great extent, yet he was fully persuaded 
               <br />
               from his own experience, and the little attention he had 
               <br />
               given to the raising of Stock, that a local Institution, con- 
               <br />
               ducted upon theModel Farm principle, would prove highly 
               <br />
               advantageous, and be a great saving to the country. It was 
               <br />
               a bad system to be importing that which could be proﬁtably 
               <br />
               produced at one half the cost, and of equal value, on the 
               <br />
               Island. The hon member said he was sorry to admit that the 
               <br />
               agricultural interests of the Colony had not received that 
               <br />
               encouragement essential to its prosperity; and he hoped some
