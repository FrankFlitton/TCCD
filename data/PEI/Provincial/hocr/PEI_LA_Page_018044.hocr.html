               <br />
               would ask is there anything now to prevent people from 
               <br />

               engaged in ﬁsheries at Gaspc state that though he received 
               <br />
               a bounty of 25 per cent he would not come to prosecute 
               <br />
               them in this Colony. We are further told that if we do 
               <br />
               not enter the proposed Union we will be like dormicc. 
               <br />
               But, Sir, would We then have any greater scope for our
