               (Hon. Mr. Breckcn) said, yesterday, that the British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern~</span>

               thing I can say will not prevent it. He, at the same time, 
               <br />
               admitted that we would be a. great deal stronger if we were 
               <br />

               opinion. I would be satisﬁed to remain as we are, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">if</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the]</span>

               <br />
               great question <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> us to consider will be, whether we will go

               with them or remain as we are? I want to leave it an open 
               <br />
               question; and, for that reason,I willsupport the amendment 
               <br />
               introduced by the hon. member from St. Peter’s (Mr. Whe- 
               <br />
               lan). Many <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">things</span> have been said about bribery—that those 
               <br />
               in iavor of Confederation are bribed: as well might we say 
               <br />
               that those against it are bribed. I believe that those in the 
               <br />
               other Provinces who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have'tbe</span> most means are against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Com</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> 
               <br />
               federation, and why would not they be as likely to use bri— 
               <br />
               bery as those who are in favor of it. I consider the conduct 
               <br />
               of the hon. member. the Leader of the Opposition. to be as 
               <br />
               inconsistent-as that of any member of this House; and, in 
               <br />
               fact,I believe it is getting like the land question. I did 
               <br />
               not think, when the Conference was held at Quebec that 
               <br />
               this question would be settled in such a short time. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">We,</span>

               stitution. And then it is said we will show our loyalty by
