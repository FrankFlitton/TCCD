               would be ruinous to the Colony. He

               of the Leader of the Government. 
               <br />
               He, however, had no wish to throw

               any unnecessary obstacles in the way, 
               <br />

               <br />
               it is not my intention to trouble you 
               <br />
               with any lengthy remarks, as I ex-

               <br />
               his honor the Speaker was in the

               <br />
               what I said on that occasion. In the 
               <br />
               resolution and amendment before us 
               <br />
               there are, however, phases of thought 
               <br />
               which I shall brieﬂy notice. I regret 
               <br />
               that the Leader on the independent 
               <br />
               benches of this committee, has not seen 
               <br />
               fit to table the resolution he' says he is 
               <br />
               going to submit. As the hon. gentle~ 
               <br />

               <br />
               Terms man, I should like to see his 
               <br />
               resolution and hear the arguments by 
               <br />
               which he intends to support it. I am 
               <br />
               glad that. to some extent, this debate 
               <br />

               hon. friend from New London, respect-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.ing</span> that letter of his, should have been 
               <br />
               received as ample, to prevent the 
               <br />
               tirade of language it called forth last 
               <br />
               night, when reference was made to 
               <br />
               that incident. His honor the Leader 
               <br />
               of the Government said he had no 
               <br />
               reapect for anything which might be 
               <br />
               said by the hon. member for Murray 
               <br />
               Harbor. I can assure the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentle</span> 
               <br />
               man I have just as much contempt for 
               <br />
               his opinions. But, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,Mr.</span> Chairman, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> 
               <br />
               I said before, this is a,qnestion which 
               <br />
               lifts itself above that which is partizan 
               <br />
               or personal. When I reﬂect that our 
               <br />
               local constitution will soon cease, that 
               <br />
               whether we look to the past, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pre~</span> 
               <br />
               sent or the future, there is undoubtedly 
               <br />
               much in the question before us to call 
               <br />
               for earnest attention and due consider-- 
               <br />
               ation. If the hon. gentlemen who 
               <br />
               purpose going up as delegates, and 
               <br />
               who ask to be supported by such a 
               <br />
               resolution, carry it, and fail in securing 
               <br />
               even as good Terms as those already 
               <br />
               offered, we would then regret that our 
               <br />
               indiscretion led us to adOpt such a 
               <br />
               course. But if we agree to bestow 
               <br />
               the power on the delegates which this 
               <br />
               resolution asks, we will be bound to 
               <br />
               accept them, even though they might 
               <br />
               be as good as those now offered. In-

               allowed the contractors unnecessarily

               to lengthen the road, for their own

               that point the Engineers give a de—

               <br />
               in these words to show that they did 
               <br />
               right? Do they not prove the cor- 
               <br />
               rectness of the charges which we pre- 
               <br />
               fcrred against them for the way in 
               <br />
               which they let the contract? They say 
               <br />
               it was the “ cause of the difference ” 
               <br />
               which arose, and if they are willing to 
               <br />
               take that as a justiﬁcation of their 
               <br />
               conduct, then all 1 have to say is may 
               <br />
               God help them. The hon. member 
               <br />
               did not reply to the able arguments of 
               <br />
               my hon. friend the Leader of the Op~

               tion out upon its merits, the hon. mem-

               ber descended to abuse. He says the

               <br />
               contend the late Government did right 
               <br />
               in the course they pursued. There 
               <br />
               are times and occasions when all the

               information in the posseSsion of a 
               <br />
               Government, should not be made pub~ 
               <br />
               lic. Had the Terms entered into by 
               <br />
               the delegates been made known when 
               <br />
               concluded, the Opposition ,might have 
               <br />
               used them as a means for overthrowing 
               <br />
               the present minority at Ottawa. At 
               <br />
               the meeting held at Centerville, last

               <br />
               would be a good Speculation to rent 
               <br />
               the Railway. If he entertains the 
               <br />
               same views still, be, when he goes up 
               <br />
               to Ottawa, may conclude to take the

               local work. The hon. Leader of the 
               <br />
               Opposition very wisely enquired what 
               <br />
               they intended to do in that matter, but 
               <br />
               received no reply. I look upon the 
               <br />
               resolution as containing a principle 
               <br />
               which should not be conceded. I am 
               <br />
               astonished that the hon member 
               <br />
               for Tryon should think of supporting 
               <br />
               it. I am surprised to think the hon.

               member should for a moment think of 
               <br />

               <br />
               against the pledge given to his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cons</span> 
               <br />
               stitnents? I believe notwithstanding 
               <br />
               the pledge of the hon. member, he 
               <br />
               will hold on to the Government so 
               <br />
               long as in doing so he can clear the 
               <br />
               tails of his own skirts. I ask the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman if he would be willing to 
               <br />
               take the Railway and run it as a local 
               <br />
               work at a loss of $50,000 a year? I 
               <br />
               did expect his honor the Leader of the
