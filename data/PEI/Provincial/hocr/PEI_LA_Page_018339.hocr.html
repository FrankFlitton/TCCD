               which do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agree.</span> For instance.

               the hon. member, the Leader of the 
               <br />
               Opposition said yesterday, quite poet- _ 
               <br />
               tively. that the late Government was 
               <br />
               defeated in consequence of their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Con~</span> 
               <br />
               federation policy, while the hon. 
               <br />
               member for New London said it was 
               <br />
               the School Question. Now WblCh of 
               <br />
               these two statements are correct? 
               <br />
               Upon which can the country place <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">res</span> 
               <br />
               liauce? The hon. member for New 
               <br />
               London referred also to the alteration 
               <br />
               ofthe Railway Station at Summer- 
               <br />
               side, and said the change was rendered 
               <br />
               necessary in order that the bulk of 
               <br />
               country people might be better ac- 
               <br />
               commodated than they couldbe, had 
               <br />
               no change been made. He said also, 
               <br />
               that not one-fourth of the people, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1n«</span> 
               <br />
               tereated in the site of the station, were 
               <br />
               in favor of removing it from where it 
               <br />
               now is. Well time will tell. The 
               <br />
               people are moving in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matteron</span> 
               <br />
               both sides, and when the petition 
               <br />
               comes in, I think it will be seen that 
               <br />
               the body of the people will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.bein</span> favor 
               <br />
               of removing it from where it 18 at pre~ 
               <br />
               sent. The hon. member asserted 
               <br />
               further, that when a few of the bust- 
               <br />
               ness men of Summerside last year 
               <br />
               wished to retain the Station where It 
               <br />
               had been formerly placed, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there.werc</span> 
               <br />
               very few who supported them in the 
               <br />
               movement. In connection With that I 
               <br />
               remember an incident which also oc- 
               <br />
               curred the same time. Mr. Robert 
               <br />
               Holman, who, in all probability, knew 
               <br />
               the intentions of the Government in 
               <br />
               the matter, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offered</span> some lots of land 
               <br />
               for sale, near to or immediately op-

               <br />
               ter. When Mr. O’Brien’s Tender for 
               <br />
               the main line was before Mr. Popes 
               <br />
               Government, notwithstanding the time 
               <br />
               allowed, many of the party supporting 
               <br />
               the late Government went so far as to 
               <br />
               argue that the Legislature should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> 
               <br />
               been called together to consider, if 
               <br />
               not his. at least the Tender of Mr. 
               <br />
               Walker. But when the same men 
               <br />
               were in power they did not give Mr. 
               <br />
               McNeilI and some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">others'who</span> had 
               <br />
               sent in Tenders an opportunity to alter

               the extent of one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">minute</span> of time. 
               <br />
               Surely they might have given Mr. 
               <br />
               McNeill at least one hour to amend 
               <br />

               <br />
               They did not do so, but havmg allow-

               they opened the last Tender; and, in
