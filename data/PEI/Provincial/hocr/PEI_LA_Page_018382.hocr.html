               have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">beer’willing</span> that the Terms

               <br />
               Ieminent visited this Island, the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment declared, in a Minute of 
               <br />
               Council, that the Terms would be 
               <br />
               favorably considered if supplemented 
               <br />
               by a Railway. He was one of those, 
               <br />
               who, at that time favored this view of 
               <br />
               the matter, believing as he did that 
               <br />
               Confederation would, on Terms just to 
               <br />
               this Island, ultimately prove beneﬁcial 
               <br />
               to this Colony. Yet the Opposition 
               <br />
               have the hardihood to charge Mr. 
               <br />
               Pope’s Government with passing the 
               <br />
               Railway Bill for the purpose of bring- 
               <br />
               ing this Island into Confederation, 
               <br />
               than 'which nothing can be further from 
               <br />

               the‘ junior member for Belfast, as an 
               <br />
               anti-Confederate, he stood head and 
               <br />
               shoulders above any other man in the 
               <br />
               Colony, and when he undertook'the 
               <br />
               mission'to Ottawa, as a delegate, he 
               <br />
               reméved every objection which the 
               <br />
               anti-Confederate party on the Island 
               <br />

               from choice. Well, how <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">faﬁhat</span> is so,

               after all that the late Government did

               independence. He should have 
               <br />
               thought of the time when he published 
               <br />
               to the world that he saw, in our union 
               <br />
               with Canada, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subjugation</span> of our

               independence. When every family

               was to be taxed, and when burdens so

               the hon. member has seen that he was

               anada as a loyal Confederate. He 
               <br />
               was afraid his loyalty pointed more to 
               <br />
               the political larder of the Dominion

               <br />
               in the course ofhis remarks, was severe 
               <br />
               upon the hon. member for Alber’wn, 
               <br />
               because he had, at one time, been an 
               <br />
               anti-Confederate. The hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">member</span>

               should not, therefore, have gone up as

               <br />
               timate and consistent, but such could
