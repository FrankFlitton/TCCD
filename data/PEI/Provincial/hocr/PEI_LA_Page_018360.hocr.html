               do not hesitate to say that the hon.

               jun. member for Belfast and his friends 
               <br />
               owe their seats in this House to the

               <br />
               a very few years, to fall far short of

               The hon. member credits the Dominion

               with our miscellaneous items ; but he 
               <br />
               will ﬁnd that under our Government 
               <br />
               we shall always have a list of items not

               enumerated in the Terms, which must 
               <br />

               ed to show that that statement con-

               tained in his letter did not refer to the 
               <br />
               late Government, and that the portion

               Now, I have a copy of that letter in

               I know that the published portion was

               <br />
               and run the Government while it will,” 
               <br />
               we must come to the conclusion that 
               <br />
               he has committed one of the most dis-

               honorable acts of which a man can be 
               <br />
               guilty. The very men who charged 
               <br />
               the members of the Coalition Govern- 
               <br />
               ment with being dishonest and corrupt, 
               <br />
               adopted the dishonest dash away policy. 
               <br />
               If ever there were dishonest and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">un~</span> 
               <br />
               principled men entrusted with the 
               <br />
               reins of power, it was during the last 
               <br />
               twelve months. Their policy was to 
               <br />
               “dash away, levy taxation, and to 
               <br />
               blame their political opponents for the 
               <br />
               results of their actions.” Such con-

               duct was surely beneath any right 
               <br />
