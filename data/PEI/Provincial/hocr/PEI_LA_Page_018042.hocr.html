               Island asked for a few thousand pounds to buy up her 
               <br />
               proprietary lands, itwould not be granted. A proposition 
               <br />
               to this effect was made by one of our delegates, and I

               believe none <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> them can tell who seconded the motion. 
               <br />
               There was certainly something wrong here. I am of 
               <br />
               opinion that had our delegates advocated the interests of 
               <br />
               the Island as well as Mr Tilley did those of New 
               <br />
               Brunswick, we would have received a grant for the 
               <br />
               purchase of our lands. They would have some show of 
               <br />
               argument in favor of this Colony entering the Union, 
               <br />
               could they come down to this House and tell us that the 
               <br />
               long vexed Land Question was to be at last set at rest. 
               <br />
               Instead of procuring a sum for this purpose they have not 
               <br />
               obtained a single farthing. ls the settlement of our land 
               <br />
               question not as important to us as the railway to Pictou 
               <br />
               for Nova Scotia, Western extension for New Brunswick, or 
               <br />
               $ 150,000 a year to Newfoundland? We have the best of 
               <br />
               authority for supposing that had the application for a. 
               <br />
               grant to buy up the proprietors’ lands of this Island been 
               <br />
               unanimously supported by our delegates, it would have 
               <br />
               been acceded to. That authority is the Hon George

               said respecting the allowance to New Brunswick, “It 
               <br />
               was absurd to oppose the adoption of a scheme such as 
               <br />
               this for such a paltry sum.” 1 now come to what we are 
               <br />
               to receive under Contederation,as laid dowu in the 63d and 
               <br />
               64th clauses of the Report. I, however, can scarcely call 
               <br />
               it receiving, for in this case we are to pay the difference to 
               <br />
               boot. The Hon Colonial Secretary says this Report is just 
               <br />
               and liberal to Prince Edward Island. Is it justice to

               require us to pay some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">£20,000</span> more than we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">receive!</span> 
               <br />
               If this be justice, it is such as I will never accede to. We 
               <br />
               are to give up a large and increasing revenue to the

               <br />
               We are to get 80 cents per head of our present population, 
               <br />
               and the interest of £632,812, being the proportxou of debt 
               <br />
               in our favor, in all amounting to about £50,000. We 
               <br />
               have been told that a part of this £632,812 may be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taken</span> 
               <br />
               to buy up proprietary lands ; but the Report says pothing 
               <br />
               of the kind; it only states that we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shall‘bo</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">entitled</span> to 
               <br />
               receive the interest at 5 per cent. Besides,‘i_t the principal 
               <br />
               was taken to purchase lands, the amount of interest which 
               <br />
               would then be received would be less, and our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">local</span> 
               <br />
               revenue diminished to that extent, consequently than 
               <br />
               would be no gain. With respect to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">allowance</span> of 80
