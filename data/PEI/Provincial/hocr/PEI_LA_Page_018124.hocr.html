               ' of the tenantry. There is one act of the Conservative 
               <br />
               party which I would like to notice—that is the bringing 
               <br />
               of the troops here. I feel pretty sensitive on this subject ; 
               <br />
               it is not a. very pleasant thing for a.whoIe country to be 
               <br />
               branded as rebels. The Government of the day should 
               <br />
               have advised the people of the dangerous course they were 
               <br />
               pursuing. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Irdo</span> believe, and always have believed, that 
               <br />
               some of the members of the Government, then in power, 
               <br />
               had no other end in view than to bring the Island into- 
               <br />
               Confederation. One prominent member of the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment laid his schemes for that purpose, and he thought- 
               <br />
               that by stigmatising us as rebels, the Home Government 
               <br />
               would be induced to force us into Confederation. The 
               <br />
               present party must, however, have the credit of getting the 
               <br />
               charges for the pay of the troops remitted. There is, also, 
               <br />
               a great deal of talk about the Land Purchase Act. The 
               <br />
               fact of the matter is, that this Act is not what it is said <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> 
               <br />
               to_ be. If, when this Act ﬁrst came into operation, the loan 
               <br />
               Bill had been passed, it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mightﬁhave</span> been diﬂ'erent; but the
