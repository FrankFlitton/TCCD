               <br />
               will be conceded us. In making his

               calculation, I do not believe the hon. 
               <br />
               Leader of the Opposition took into 
               <br />
               account the Excise Duties of the Do- 
               <br />

               included in his ﬁgures giving nine or 
               <br />
               ten per cent as the Dominion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariff.</span> 
               <br />
               We know that their Excise Duties are 
               <br />
               very heavy, and helps very largely in 
               <br />
               making up a Revenue. There would 
               <br />
               be no difﬁculty in raising monc 
               <br />

               <br />
               demands upon us, if we could but get 
               <br />
               our securities in a good sound ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               position. I would not be afraid to 
               <br />
               face even the latter difﬁculty, but 
               <br />

               <br />
               should like to see our Railway a suc-

               fair and reasonable Terms, without

               has been largely increased during the 
               <br />
               last few years, and that the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces have been in a great mea- 
               <br />
               sure the cause of it. If the latter was 
               <br />
               a fact, we should have seen this great 
               <br />
               increase immediately after the union 
               <br />
               was etfected, but this was not the case. 
               <br />
               Three years elapsed without any re-_ 
               <br />
               markable change in this respect, but 
               <br />
               as time rolled on, the people became 
               <br />
               more settled and satisﬁed with their 
               <br />
               lot, trade began to fall into its proper 
               <br />
               channels, and the Revenue began to 
               <br />
               increase rapidly. Quebec contributes 
               <br />
               as much to their Revenue as any of 
               <br />
               the Lower Provinces. The great 
               <br />
               Dominion is now being consolidated, 
               <br />
               and trade _is ﬂourishing accordingly. 
               <br />
               The taxation, even now, in this Colony, 
               <br />
               is $4.20 per head, whereas in the 
               <br />
               Dominion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘it</span> is only $4.09 per head.

               the taxation is about the same in both 
               <br />
               cases. The hon. Leader of the Gov-

               ernment says that we could remain
