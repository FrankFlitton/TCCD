               <br />
               as nine—tenths of the lands of the Colony were leased at

               that rate. Tenants, however, on other estates who could 
               <br />
               agree with their landlords to purchase the reversionary

               The machinery of the Bill would be found very efﬁcient 
               <br />
               for the objectit contemplated. No tenant was under any 
               <br />

               <br />
               he obtained satisfactory terms from his landlord; and if 
               <br />
               he agreed as to terms, and had means in his possession to 
               <br />
               pay more than half the purchase money, he might borrow 
               <br />
               from the Government just such amount as he required. 
               <br />
               Application was to be made to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.CO'mmISSIODBI'.</span> of

               <br />
               ments of the Bill, would refer it to the Crown Law otiicers. 
               <br />
               to make enquiries as to whether the applicant was a.

               application, and if everything should prove satisfactory, 
               <br />
               the Tenant would then pay half of the purchase money to

               <br />
               of the land. The Commissioner would then make out a 
               <br />
               deed to the Tenant almost in the same form as the con- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               having thus given a briel outline of the leading features 
               <br />
               of the Bill, expressed the belief that if it were passed into 
               <br />
               law it would be found to he one of the best measures ever

               <br />
               Opposition. Under the operation of these two Acts, 
               <br />
               should the Bill unier consideration become law, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon,</span> 
               <br />
               members might expect that in a few years the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro-</span> 
               <br />
               prietors‘ lands would be all bought up. It was to be

               hoped that it would prove a panacea for the ills of the 
               <br />
               tenant-ry. They would obtain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">more‘beneﬁt</span> by sending

               measures such as the one now proposed, than by joining 
               <br />
               the Tenant League. if We might judge of the principles 
               <br />
               of that Body. by the wild and seditious articles published 
               <br />
               in its organ, Ross’s Weekly. The principles advanced in 
               <br />
               that paper, if persisted in, were such as would end in a 
               <br />
               rebellion. The ’l‘enantry were greatly deceived if they 
               <br />
               imagined that they could obtain redress <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> their 
               <br />
               grievances by combining to resist the payment of route. 
               <br />
               They might depend upon it that all the power which 
               <br />
               Queen Victoria could command, would be exerted to 
               <br />
               maintain the laws in their integrity. Did they suppose 
               <br />
               that they would be allowed to ride rough shod over 
               <br />
               the principles of British law and the rights of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">property?</span>
