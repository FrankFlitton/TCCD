               the late government let the Branch 
               <br />

               <br />
               Mr. Finlay McNeil], which was much 
               <br />
               lower than any they received, and over 
               <br />
               several others never consulting any of

               than the Trunk Line: but it appeared 
               <br />
               they were privileged by the late gov-

               the Trunk Line as the work proceeded, 
               <br />
               instead of only ninety per cent accord- 
               <br />
               ing to the original contract. This was 
               <br />
               nothing less than a compromise. The 
               <br />
               hon. junior member for Belfast con- 
               <br />
               sidered that the Branch contract was 
               <br />
               let at a cheaper rate than the trunk 
               <br />
               line. I differ from him, and can show 
               <br />
               that the Branch Line is by far the 
               <br />
               higher contract when the nature of 
               <br />
               the country, &amp;c., is considered. Not—

               <br />
               members of the late government 
               <br />
               against their predecessors, in reference 
               <br />
               to letting the trunk contract to an 
               <br />
               alleged Ring, they themselves let the
