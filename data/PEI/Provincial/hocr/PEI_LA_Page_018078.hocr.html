               ourselves,and if we have conducted the business ofthe <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colony,</span> 
               <br />
               properly for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁl'teen</span> years, it does not appear reasonable to 
               <br />
               suppose that the British Government will now deprive us <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> 
               <br />
               our Constitution. I do not think the people of this Island 
               <br />
               are so much afraid of Confederation; but they object to 
               <br />

               <br />
               the other Colonies as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Iihodc</span> island does to the rest of the

               tion in the United States Senate as New York. Rhode 
               <br />
               Island is the smallest part of the American Union, and i 
               <br />
               suppose we would remain for a long time the smallest part 
               <br />
               of British America; still, we have shown a disposition to 
               <br />
               do what we can to defend ourselves, and have thereby 
               <br />
               shown that we are not disloyal, but We wish to letit be 
               <br />
               seen that Confederation is not as applicable to us as to
