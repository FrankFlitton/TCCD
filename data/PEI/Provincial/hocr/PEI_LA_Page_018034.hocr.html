               <br />
               We know that the feeling in England has been,‘until very 
               <br />
               lately, most strongly excited against us, but since this 
               <br />
               question of Confederation has been agitated a more kindly 
               <br />
               spirit has been evoked, because, in Confederation, the 
               <br />
               Mother Country sees at length aroused a disposition here— 
               <br />
               tofore dormant, an awakening to a sense of the duty we 
               <br />
               owe to ourselves and our posterity, and a determina— 
               <br />
               tion on our part to unite as one people against the 
               <br />
               coming storm : and in this case they have promised to 
               <br />
               stand by us, but I know very little of the people of Eng- 
               <br />
               land, if we do not, before many weeks, hear that the late 
               <br />
               action of the people of New Brunswick has revived all the 
               <br />
               old distrust. If we are not, now, true to ourselves, in 
               <br />
               this great crisis, We may rest assured that England will 
               <br />
               notsend a man to help us in our hour of need. We will 
               <br />

               all I had ever said in favor of Union and joined the cry 
               <br />
               against it; but then I would have lost what I value for 
               <br />
               more highly than popular applause—selfrespect. The 
               <br />
               various details embodied in the Report of the Delegates 
               <br />
               speak for themselves. Hon members need not to be 
               <br />
               told that delegates from six Provinces, each repre- 
               <br />
               senting a diversity of interests, could only by mutual 
               <br />
               concessions obtain such a united whole as we could all 
               <br />
               agree in supporting and submitting to the people. That 
               <br />
               we had arrived at such a result I never for one moment 
               <br />
               doubted until my return here from Canada. Taken as a 
               <br />
               whole, I cannot come to any other conclusion than this, 
               <br />
               that the principles'here set forth are well calculated to 
               <br />
               establish and consolidate a great nationality, and to be 
               <br />
               the means of elevating British America to a. height of 
               <br />
               wealth, grandeur and prosperity, such as we can never 
               <br />
               in any other way attain to. And as far as this Island is 
               <br />
               concerned, as Confederation will bring prosperity to 
               <br />
               Halifax and St John, whose rise will be ours, as it will 
               <br />
               bring us an inﬂux of capital to develop the mines of 
               <br />
               wealth we possess in our ﬁsheries; as it will build up 
               <br />
               harbors where needed for the interest of that trade; as it 
               <br />
               will give us manufaetories in our own midst with constant 
               <br />
               employ to our youth of both sexes, summer and winter; 
               <br />
               the means of banishing the discontent of thetenantry: 
               <br />
               a Government elected by four millions of people, which 
               <br />
               will be as formidable in its strength as ours ever has 
               <br />
               been impotent in its weakness; a Revenue amply suf- 
               <br />
               ﬁcient for our local wants as heretofore; and instead of a 
               <br />
               LegislativeUnion, such as deprived Ireland other separate 
               <br />
               Parliament, we are secured all the advantage of having 
               <br />
               our own Island Parliament for the management of our 
               <br />
               local affairs. Also the further representation of nine 
               <br />
               members in a General Parliament, and nine gentlemen 
               <br />
               should be able to represent this Island as efﬁcientlyas four 
               <br />
               times that number. Also the hearty support of England 
               <br />
               with her ﬂeet and army. And as all this can be obtained 
               <br />
               without any increase of taxation, but, on the contrary, 
               <br />
               with a great decrease in the amountnow paid by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bulk</span> 
               <br />
               of our people. Although the subject of Confederation has 
               <br />
               been made unpopular, because neither explained nor 
               <br />
               understood, yet I am glad to place on record my earnest 
               <br />
               and hearty advocacy of it, leaving my action to be judged 
               <br />
               by reﬂecting minds at a future day; being assured that 
               <br />
               neither you, Mr Speaker, nor any other hen member will do 
               <br />
               me the injustice to suppose that the few observations 1 have 
               <br />
               deemed it my duty to make on this momentous question, 
               <br />
               will be construed into anything approaching a desire to 
               <br />
               inﬂuence any hon member in the vote he may new record; 
               <br />
               because, Mr Speaker. both yourself and hon members are 
               <br />
               aware what an overwhelming majority have made up their 
               <br />
               minds to oppose it. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Igantthen,</span> but be fully conscious 
               <br />
               how futile would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">such};</span> desire on my part, or on that 
               <br />
               of any of the advocatespt' Confederation, at this juncture. 
               <br />
               i will not, therefore, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anymore,</span> but conclude by borrowing
