               the Bill had not been brought in when 
               <br />

               Among the arguments brought for-

               ward the School Question was refer- 
               <br />
               red to. It was not put as a question 
               <br />
               before the people at the late election, 
               <br />
               and, therefore, is only used now for 
               <br />
               the purpose of making political capital 
               <br />
               out of it. It is a question, though, 
               <br />
               which will have to be settled yet, and 
               <br />
               that he thought could easily be done 
               <br />
               by a slight alteration in the Act, which 
               <br />
               would set the question at rest to the 
               <br />
               great advantage of the country. He 
               <br />
               was present last evening at an exami- 
               <br />
               nation in the school taught in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">St.</span> 
               <br />
               Patrick’s Hall, and thought it highly 
               <br />
               creditable to the teachers in that 
               <br />
               school. He saw a boy there from his 
               <br />
               own neighborhood, who acquitted him-_ 
               <br />
               self admirably. The privileges of 
               <br />
               education should be general, and not 
               <br />

               not to be thrown out against the 
               <br />
