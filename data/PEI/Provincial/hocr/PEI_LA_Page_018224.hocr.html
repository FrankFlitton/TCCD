               <br />
               very sure about the amount—indeed he did 
               <br />
               not know whether the Canadian statesmen 
               <br />

               <br />
               If the government here were to act in that

               the statesmen of a couiitry did not know 
               <br />
               what its debt was. Coafederation was a

               very pretty word, but the thirteen colOnies
