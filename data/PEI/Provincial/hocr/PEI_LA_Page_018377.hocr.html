               very great service to us as a Colony.

               The people of the Dominion take a

               the hon. member for Georgetown

               matter contained in the message from 
               <br />
               His Honor the Lieutenant Governor. 
               <br />
               I thought he would certainly have 
               <br />
               given some explanation of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro~</span> 
               <br />

               <br />
               give a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">silent</span> vote upon the question. 
               <br />
               However, we may hear from him 
               <br />
               when the House goes into Committee. 
               <br />
               It is surprising that the hon. member 
               <br />
               would append his name to the state~ 
               <br />
               ment made to the Privy COuncil of the 
               <br />
               Dominion, that the people of this 
               <br />
               Island were dissatisﬁed with the Terms 
               <br />
               then before them, and wished so much 
               <br />
               more in addition, and also, that those 
               <br />
               Terms were not just and equitable. 
               <br />
               The hon. member voted for Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation on the basis of the Quebec 
               <br />
               Scheme, and when the Haythorne- 
               <br />
               Laird Terms came down, he declared 
               <br />
               in public, that they were just 'and 
               <br />
               liberal to the peOple of this Colony, 
               <br />
               but in this communication to the Privy 
               <br />
               C‘ouncil,he states that those Terms 
               <br />
               were not just and equitable. Perhaps 
               <br />
               he thinks we should endeavor to ob- 
               <br />
               tain all we can. Well, I will agree 
               <br />
               with him in that, and am very glad 
               <br />
               he has got better Terms. The hon.

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Leader’of</span> the Government has given
