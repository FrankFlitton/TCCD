               <br />
               from a long and sincere conviction that

               been such from the date of the Quebec

               Conference, up to the present time. I 
               <br />
               saw that Gmfederation, under the 
               <br />

               <br />
               Lions of my mind, I was looked upon 
               <br />
               as a traitor, and many thought I ought 
               <br />
               to have been hung up upon the nearest 
               <br />
               tree ass warning to public men. Yet, 
               <br />
               notwithstanding, I have never swerved 
               <br />
               from these principles. But while re— 
               <br />
               taining these opinions, I was never an 
               <br />
               advocate of the policy that was prac- 
               <br />

               it is a question that effects our inter-

               as the hon. member seems to suppose, 
               <br />
               we are enlarging them, and by the 
               <br />
               vote this night given, have taken the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst step to extend our privileges and

               increase our inﬂuence; so that in fact, 
               <br />
               our rights are only being enlarged. 
               <br />
               Although our population is but 100,- 
               <br />
               000, or thereahouts, yet we are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enter</span>

               ing on terms which secures to us the 
               <br />
               advantages of a Colony much larger 
               <br />
               and more populous. Our peeple will 
               <br />
               become a portion of the Dominion

               <br />
               Do you call that selling our rights? 
               <br />
               No. Is it putting your hand in a vice 
               <br />
               from which you cannot extricate it? 
               <br />
               Nothing of the kind. We are, and

               nothing to fear from that scare crow
