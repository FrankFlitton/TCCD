               clear that the Terms obtained by the 
               <br />
               late delegates were all arranged for, 
               <br />
               and completed for presentation to the 
               <br />
               Dominion Government, before they 
               <br />
               started at all; but a great snow storm 
               <br />
               took place, and some members of their 
               <br />
               Government did not sign it till the 
               <br />
               11th of January. It appears the dele-

               gates got more from the Dominion 
               <br />
               Government than they asked for, 
               <br />
               when they received this great boon of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$5000,</span> and that the Colony paid <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$856</span> 
               <br />
               for their services in procuring that 
               <br />
               paltry amount, according to the hon. 
               <br />
               member’s own admission. We had a 
               <br />
               long eulogy on the services of the late 
               <br />
               Collector, Mr. Currie. Immediately 
               <br />
               after the present ofﬁcer was appointed, 
               <br />
               the Government had to put a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentle»</span> 
               <br />
               man in that ofﬁce to put the books in 
               <br />
               order, and make up the Accounts, as 
               <br />
               the latter were found to be far behind. 
               <br />
               The Coalition appointed a committee 
               <br />
               to investigate, and they proved that 
               <br />
               there was smuggling going on, but 
               <br />
               Mr. Currie, instead of seizing the 
               <br />
               smuggle-d goods when he found them, 
               <br />
               said to the owners, “just give us a 
               <br />
               bond and we shall say nothing about 
               <br />
               it.” It is a notorious fact that because 
               <br />
               a man in Prince County let some salt 
               <br />
               water get into a cask of liquor, he had 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$35</span> knocked <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">off</span> the duty! And yet 
               <br />
               we are now told that the late Collec- 
               <br />
               tor gave a great check to smuggling! 
               <br />
               The hon. member is terribly afraid 
               <br />
               that Messrs. Pope and Howlan will go 
               <br />
               up to Ottawa and get all the ofﬁces, 
               <br />
               and that the country will be ruined l

               few years ago, he would much rather

               'the circumstances of the Colony have 
               <br />
