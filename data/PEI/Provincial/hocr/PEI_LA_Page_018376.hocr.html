               ceded by the Leaders of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Opposi‘</span> 
               <br />
               tion in both Branches of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legisla~</span> 
               <br />
               ture, who composed the former delta- 
               <br />
               gation, and who, I believe, did all they 
               <br />
               could to obtain the most liberal Terms. 
               <br />
               On their return they had declared that 
               <br />
               no better Terms would be granted. 
               <br />
               And we had also heard a great deal 
               <br />
               about the Governor General’s tele- 
               <br />
               gram which had been sent down here; 
               <br />
               but we know that telegrams of that 
               <br />
               kind are sometimes asked for by the 
               <br />
               ministry of the day, and paid no atten- 
               <br />
               tion to it. Representations bad <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pre-</span> 
               <br />
               ceded us from this Island to the effect - 
               <br />
               that the great bulk of the people were 
               <br />
               satisﬁed with the Terms already offer- 
               <br />
               ed, and thatIhad stated that if I could 
               <br />
               not obtain better Terms, I would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ac~</span> 
               <br />
               cept the Terms brought down by the 
               <br />
               former delegates. Some of our friends 
               <br />
               and well wishers had written to Otta- 
               <br />
               wa, stating that they considered the 
               <br />
               Terms already obtained just and 
               <br />
               liberal, and that they were satisfactory 
               <br />
               to the people generally. We stated in 
               <br />
               plain terms that what we wanted was 
               <br />
               a sufﬁcient amount to carry on our 
               <br />
               local Government, and meet the usual 
               <br />
               wants of the Colony, without being 
               <br />
               compelled, immediately after entering 
               <br />
               Confederation, to resort to local taxa- 
               <br />
               tion. Our idea was that the manner 
               <br />
               in which we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">presented</span> our claims 
               <br />
               would enable the Dominion Govern- 
               <br />
               ment to judge for themselves, and they 
               <br />
               could then provide for them as they 
               <br />
               thought ﬁt. I wrote a note to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
