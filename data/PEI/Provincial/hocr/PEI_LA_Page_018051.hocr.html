               In fact it seems to be passive in regard to the Union

               He has taken exception to the provision with respect to 
               <br />
               the prerogative of pardon, and to the principle of having 
               <br />
               a ﬁxed number of nominated life members in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legis-‘</span> 
               <br />
               lative Council. To the latter principle I made strong 
               <br />
               objections at the Conference, and fortunately for me 1 
               <br />

               <br />
               Colonial Minister's lespatch was received. My reason 
               <br />
               for opposing such a provision was that as the members of 
               <br />
               the Legislative Council were to be nominated from the 
               <br />
               existing Councils in the different Provinces, a. number of 
               <br />
               them would be old men, who had been obstructives. and 
               <br />
               might remain so all their lives, consequently a dead-leek 
               <br />
               would probably soon occur 
               <br />
               the Legislature, in which case an appeal would have to 
               <br />
               be made to the Imperial Government to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">settle</span> the dispute. 
               <br />
               They have had quite enough of disputes in Canada 
               <br />
               already. In that Province, Sir, the parliament buildings 
               <br />
               have been burned, and the Stars and Stripes thrown out 
               <br />
               to the winds. Such proceedings, Sir, have never been 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$264,000.</span> In the case of Upper Canada, 80 cents a head was

               <br />
               to draw a distinctidn between one part of the country and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arm-,-</span> 
               <br />
               ther. But it was not‘intcn‘ded to hold out any inducement to future 
               <br />
               extravagance to local Gavcrnments, but it was hoped that by 
               <br />
               the operation of natural causes such a check would be put upon 
               <br />
               expenditures as would bring them down to the lowest point, or 
               <br />
               at least prevent them from becoming lavish. Therefore the 
               <br />
               subsidy proposed to be given to local legislatures was ﬁxed, not 
               <br />
               at an increasing rate ' according to population, but at the rate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">V</span> 
               <br />
               which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">existed</span> at the census of 1861. By this means, as the 
               <br />
               population increased, the subsidy would not increase with it. 
               <br />
               Upper and LowerCénada <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Would</span> thus get within a fraction of

               Now, Sir, this is the opinion of the Finance Minister of 
               <br />
               Canada, who may be considered as good authority in 
               <br />
               regard to the contemplated working of the Quebec 
               <br />
               scheme; and he urged it in an address to his own 
               <br />
               constituents at Sherbrooke, as a reason why they should 
               <br />
               gladly accept that scheme. Here we may see the pitiable 
               <br />
               condition to which this Island would be reduced under 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation,"—-</span> our revenues taken away, scarcely 
               <br />
               enough allowed us to work the machinery of the local 
               <br />
               government, and should more money be required when 
               <br />
               our population increased, it would have to be raised by 
               <br />
               direct taxation. The people of this Colony were battling 
               <br />
               four years to gain responsible government, and since 
               <br />
               obtained, I believe it has given general <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfac-2</span> 
               <br />
               tion. But, Sir, were we to adopt this Report, it 
               <br />
               would deprive us of our constitution and leave us no 
               <br />
               corresponding beneﬁt in return. It is urged that as a 
               <br />
               compensation for our less we would become part of a 
               <br />
               great union that in time w0uld form a mighty nation. 
               <br />
               But I ask what greater natiOnality can we enjoy than that 
               <br />
               with which it is our pride and privilege at present to be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">connected?</span> What greater tin can wave over us than the 
               <br />
               time-honored banner of Old <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">%nglandl</span> I do not think 
               <br />
               that Great Britain wishes to throw us off; on the contrary 
               <br />
               I believe that her statesmen see that the separation of 
               <br />
               the Colonies from the parent state would cause trouble. 
               <br />
               Sir, I look upon this talk about the Mother Country 
               <br />
               casting us off from her apron strings, and this shakin of 
               <br />
               the stars and stripes in our face, as only stories inten ed 
               <br />
               to frighten <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thectimid.</span> Let us remain true to the Mother 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Country</span> and she <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will,</span> stand by us. Separate as we are 
               <br />
               from the other Colonies, our hands are just as strong and 
               <br />
               Our hearts as willing to aid in the defence of the Empire, 
               <br />
               as they could be under any scheme of political union
