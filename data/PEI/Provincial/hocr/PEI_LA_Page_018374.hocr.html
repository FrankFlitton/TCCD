               party matter. For my part it was my

               most sincere and earnest desire that 
               <br />
               Confederation should have been dis-

               <br />
               own merits. When I was away they. 
               <br />
               had so much to say about me, that the 
               <br />
               grander and sublimer aspects of the 
               <br />
               question were entirely lost sight of. 
               <br />
               No doubt, Sir, it is a matter for regret 
               <br />
               that Confederation, pure and simple, 
               <br />
               was not considered wholly upon its
