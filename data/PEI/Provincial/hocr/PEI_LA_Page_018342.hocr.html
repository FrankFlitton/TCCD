               <br />
               they bungled .all they undertook. 
               <br />
               Then as regards locating <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«the</span> line, 
               <br />
               Mr. Pope’s Government ran the line, 
               <br />
               but the contractors had to pay for it; 
               <br />
               but Mr. Haythorne’s Government 
               <br />
               located the branch lines at the ex- 
               <br />
               pense of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cou'ntry,which</span> was a large 
               <br />
               item of cost in favor ofthe contractors. 
               <br />
               Well, why did they-thus act? Last 
               <br />
               year they 'were heaven—born Engi- 
               <br />
               neers, and were not going to have any 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Crooks"</span> in the line. But now when 
               <br />
               the result of their engineering has 
               <br />
               been tested, it appears there is more 
               <br />
               curvature on the branches than there 
               <br />
               is on the main line. It is admitted 
               <br />
               all round that they could not have got 
               <br />
               into Souris without curves, but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lest</span> 
               <br />
               year the same hon. member maintained 
               <br />
               that it was possible to get to Summer- 
               <br />
               side without departing from a straight 
               <br />
               line, or one nearly so. The country 
               <br />
               was quite level when <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,Mr.</span> Pope was 
               <br />
               in_ power, but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">became</span> wonderfully 
               <br />
               rough when the hon. member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Bob</span> 
               <br />
               fast took chargeol the ship of State. 
               <br />
               The hon. member, the Leader of the 
               <br />
               Opposition, taunts this side because 
               <br />
               some of us having ran our election 
               <br />
               against Confederation, are now in 
               <br />
               lavor ofit. Does the hon. member 
               <br />
               forget that when he ran his election in 
               <br />
               Belfast, he told the people he was
