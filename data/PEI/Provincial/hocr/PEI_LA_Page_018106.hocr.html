               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rogucry</span> and deception; but I have lived that opinion

               <br />
               has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dt</span> no te—night, I am almost forced to the conclusion 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> my early impressions were correct. Now, if 
               <br />
               he was honest in voting for the “no terms” 
               <br />
               resolutions, it ought to be a matter of indifference to 
               <br />
               him how early in the summer the elections were held. 
               <br />
               If consistency had characterized the actions of the late 
               <br />
               Government, delay in the case was unnecessary. The 
               <br />
               attempt to justify putting off the Elections, on account 
               <br />
               of the general tenor of the resolutions on Confederation 
               <br />
               passed last Session, is, I think, without force, when we 
               <br />
               consider that the “ no terms ” portion of them is their 
               <br />
               most prominent feature,—so much so, that they receive 
               <br />
               their designation from it, and will continue to do so, 
               <br />
               while the Journals of this House remain in existence. 
               <br />
               The hon. member for Charlottetown has also twitted 
               <br />
               the members of the Government about the "composite” 
               <br />
               material of which it is formed. Be that as it may, I 
               <br />
               think their opinions are more in harmony with each 
               <br />
               other, and their actions characterized by greater 
               <br />
               unanimity, than were those of the late Government. 
               <br />
               One member of that “ happy family”——the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Murray Harbor (Mr. Henderson)—was kicked 
               <br />
               (pardon the expression) out of that honorable body. 
               <br />
               And the operation appears to have had a beneﬁcial 
               <br />
               effect upon him, judging from his present conduct, 
               <br />
               following, as he does, closely to, and ﬁrmly supporting, 
               <br />
               the present hon. Leader of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Opposition, who

               member, I did not distinctly bear, but its drift I Can

               easily understand ; and believe that, if it may be taken 
               <br />
               as a true index to his forthcoming speeches, he may 
               <br />

               muttering on his seat, while Iam speaking; but, I 
               <br />
               must tell that hon. member that it would be much 
               <br />
               more gentlemanly for him to stand up and reply tome

               Mr. MCLENNAN.—This discursive debate, Mr. 
               <br />
               Chairman, is a perfect Waste of time. I am one of 
               <br />
               those who approve of the action of the late Govern- 
               <br />
               ment in reference to the General Election. Hon. 
               <br />
               members have brought into this discussion matters not 
               <br />
               before this hon. Committee. In the paragraph under 
               <br />
               consideration, there is not one word that has any 
               <br />
               reference to Confederation. It is a waste of time to be 
               <br />
               referring now to many of the subjects which have been 
               <br />
               dragged into this debate. There will be ample oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity to do so when these questions come up, in 
               <br />
               proper form, before the House.

               Mr. PROWSE.—Mr. Chair an: I feel it to be my 
               <br />
               duty to tell the hon. member for Belfast (Mr. Davies) 
               <br />
               that, when he undertakes to charge this side of the 
               <br />
               House as being the Confederate side, he is stating 
               <br />
               what is incorrect. There are, Sir, on this side of the 
               <br />
               House, men as strongly anti-Confederate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> can be 
               <br />
               be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.found</span> anywhere. Why, Sir, the conduct of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">majority,</span> with respect to the elections for the City of 
               <br />
               Charlottetown, cannot be defended. The hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man charges us with changing our opinions on Con- 
               <br />
               federation, because we have a Confederate for our 
               <br />
               Leader; and yet he and his party were willing and 
               <br />
               anxious to put that same gentleman into the Speaker’s 
               <br />
               Chair. I am sure, if a Confederate was placed in that 
               <br />
               honorable position by this House, it would be regarded 
               <br />
               by the public as a tendency towards Confederation, 
               <br />
               much more than the act of the Opposition, in choosing 
               <br />
               him to be their Leader. I need not say one word with 
               <br />
               respect to the hon. member giving his own vote for a 
               <br />
               strong Confederate, after what has been said by others 
               <br />
               on that act of his. The Government side of this House 
               <br />
               is made up of old Liberals, Tenant-Leaguers, Confed- 
               <br />
               erates, and Conservatives; and on this side, there are 
               <br />
               men who are strongly opposed to Confederation. 
               <br />
               With respect to the question, why the late Government 
               <br />
               did not cause the Elections to take place earlier, I may 
               <br />
               say that, if they felt that any danger was to come out 
               <br />
               of hasty steps, they were doing a. good service in 
               <br />
               acting as they did. And, Sir, I believe, there was a 
               <br />
               time when a Legislature, only nine months old, was 
               <br />
               dissolved, and a new Election held. Had the dissolu- 
               <br />
               tion of the late Assembly taken <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">101309</span> at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> usual 
               <br />
               time, there was mason to apprehend that the same 
               <br />
               would have again occurred. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">If.</span> that was the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reason;</span> 
               <br />
               I consider it a perfectly satisfactory one, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬂ”</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1d</span>
