            <!--<p>
     I was never kicked out of a Temper<lb break="no"/>ance Society, as he was, for violating<lb/>an honorable and sacred pledge. No<lb/>truthful charge can be made against<lb/>me of being guilty of falsehood and<lb/>slander, of which he has been convict<lb break="no"/>ed again and again. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for New London thought he made<lb/>a telling speech, and asked how the<lb/>country was going to stand the drain<lb/>from it to pay the interest on the Rail<lb break="no"/>way debt. I answer that £100,000<lb/>sterling have been expended in this<lb/>country in the construction of the<lb/>Railway, of which the merchants have<lb/>received the benefit ; and of that<lb/>amount only some £800 have been<lb/>transmitted to London to pay the in<lb break="no"/>terest on the Debentures. The con<lb break="no"/>struction of the Steamer Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward drained more than three times<lb/>the amount of the whole Railway tax<lb/>from the Island, in sterling exchange.<lb/>Had it not been for the construction<lb/>of the Railway, every Bank on the<lb/>Island would, at one time, have ceased<lb/>to do business, as was the case with<lb/>many in the other Provinces, and<lb/>there would have been a commercial<lb/>panic. After the Railway is com<lb break="no"/>pleted, if the trade and exports of the<lb/>Colony do not increase considerably,<lb/>there might be some difficulty in pro<lb break="no"/>curing exchange, but while the con<lb break="no"/>struction of the Railway is in progress,<lb/>there can be no difficulty in that re<lb break="no"/>spect, so that the remarks of the hon.<lb/>member do not apply. There would<lb/>be no difficulty in raising money suffi<lb break="no"/>cient to pay the interest on the Rail<lb break="no"/>way debt as well as all other demands,<lb/>but it is not so easy to restore the<lb/>credit of the country after it has been<lb/>injured by the hawking of the Deben<lb break="no"/>tures by the late Colonial Secretary.<lb/>I showed clearly, last night, in my<lb/>remarks, that even admitting that the<lb/>miscellaneous items will be borne by<lb/>the Dominion, the present Terms<lb/>would still be some $70,000 short of<lb/>meeting the requirements of the coun<lb break="no"/>try. Now, I believe that the states<lb break="no"/><cb/>men of Canada are liberal enough not 
     <lb/>to ask us to place ourselves in a ruin<lb break="no"/>ous position, in which we would be<lb/>compelled to resort to local taxation,<lb/>immediately after accepting Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, and becoming a portion of the<lb/>Dominion. It would be far better,<lb/>and more conducive to their interests,<lb/>as well as our own, to give us suffici<lb break="no"/>ent to make our people contented,<lb/>prosperous, and happy. I do not in<lb break="no"/>tend to go over the whole ground<lb/>again ; but I believe we shall have no<lb/>difficulty in obtaining better Terms,<lb/>and that this is a sore spot to the hon.<lb/>members of the Opposition. I am not<lb/>the man who would undertake to go<lb/>on a begging expedition ; when I go<lb/>to ask better Terms I shall go fortified<lb/>by a resolution from this House,—I<lb/>have no intention of sneaking off to<lb/>Ottawa without the knowledge of the<lb/>people, as some before me have done.<lb/>After the last delegation started, a<lb/>prominent member of the late Govern<lb break="no"/>ment declared at a public meeting, in<lb/>this city, that they were gone "to fend<lb/>off" Confederation, while in reality<lb/>they were gone to seek terms of union.<lb/>The only man outside the Government<lb/>to be trusted with the secrets of their<lb/>scheme was "dear Mr. Lawson." I<lb/>give the hon. member credit for a good<lb/>deal of shrewdness and clear-headed<lb break="no"/>ness, but I wish I could give him credit<lb/>for more fair dealing and less conspir<lb break="no"/>acy. Before those delegates left for<lb/>Ottawa, it was circulated in St. John,<lb/>N B., paper that there was to be a<lb/>race between Laird for Confederation,<lb/>and Pope for the grants for this Island.<lb/>This precious bit of news was sent<lb/>there in the same way as the despatch<lb/>of the Governor General was suggest<lb break="no"/>ed from this Island. When I make<lb/>this statement, I wish no reflection to<lb/>be cast on the Governor General as<lb/>he was not to blame in any way.<lb/>

            me to Mr. Lawson, in order that I<lb/>might publish it. The manner in<lb/>which that letter was obtained, and<lb/>used, was the most contemptible I<lb/>ever heard of. Instead of stating in<lb/>that letter that the late Government<lb/>had determined to dash away, levy<lb/>taxation, &amp;c., as represented by his<lb/>honor, I said that there were men in<lb/>the country who entertained different<lb/>views from my own, and would dash<lb/>away, levy taxation, &amp;c. I also stated<lb/>that the trade that would result from<lb/>a union with Canada, would be greatly<lb/>in favor of this Colony, and that a large<lb/>quantity of goods from the Dominion<lb/>would come in here duty free. The<lb/>hon. Leader of the Government has<lb/>produced a mere garbled extract from<lb/>that letter. I deny that $61,000 have<lb/>been expended this year by the Board<lb/>of Works. Nothing injured the credit<lb/>of this Colony more than the action of<lb/>the Coalition Government in using the<lb/>money, raised by the Railway tariff,<lb/>for general purposes. Their action<lb/>was contrary to law, and detrimental<lb/>to the best interests of the country.<lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:HOWA1">MR. HOWATT</persName>.— Mr. Chairman, 
     <lb/>
     there are two Resolutions now before 
     <lb/>
     this hon. Committee, and I may table 
     <lb/>
     a third when the proper time arrives. 
     <lb/>
     The matter is important, and time 
     <lb/>
     should be taken to consider what we 
     <lb/>
     are doing. I have listened attentively 
     <lb/>
     to the arguments on both sides, and 
     <lb/>
     can only notice that one side blames 
     <lb/>
     the other for the difficulties which 
     <lb/>
     have come upon the country; hold<lb break="no"/>ing it up as a misfortune that such 
     <lb/>
     and such should have occurred. If, 
     <lb/>
     however, as so many seem to argue, 
     <lb/>
     Confederation is to be such a benefit 
     <lb/>
     to us, then I cannot see why hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen should not be rejoicing, in<lb break="no"/>stead of mourning over our position. 
     <lb/>
     If we are going into a partnership so 
     <lb/>
     desirable. there is surely no cause for 
     <lb/>
     complaining. But in so far as I can 
     <lb/>
     see, there has been nothing, as yet, 
     <lb/>
     brought forward to show that we are 
     <lb/>
     going to receive an equivalent for what 
     <lb/>
     we are going to give up. Suppose 
     <lb/>
     we do go in, it is clear that a large 
     <lb/>
     amount will soon be required for local 
     <lb/>
     purposes, which can only be had by 
     <lb/>
     local taxation. Can the general Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment exist without a Revenue? 
     <lb/>
     We know it cannot. If, as some hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman has said, the Revenue of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion is increasing, so also is taxa<lb break="no"/>tion, and of necessity they must be re<lb break="no"/>ceiving more from the Provinces than 
     <lb/>
     they return. Whatever the cost of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion Government may be, or for 
     <lb/>
     whatever purpose we will be required, 
     <lb/>
     if we go in, in all time coming to pay 
     <lb/>
     the one-fortieth part of it. I contend, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, that a little more time 
     <lb/>
     should be taken before we rush into 
     <lb/>
     an arrangement so important. The 
     <lb/>
     probability is, that by delaying the 
     <lb/>
     matter a while longer, we will get a 
     <lb/>
     little more money, although for my 
     <lb/>
     part I refuse to enter in on any terms. 
     <lb/>
     If, however, hon. members are deter<lb break="no"/>mined to unite on some terms, they 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     will do well to look carefully into the 
     <lb/>
     amount proposed to be allowed by the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion for our Railway. It is set 
     <lb/>
     at three and one quarter millions of 
     <lb/>
     dollars. But supposing it should, as I 
     <lb/>
     believe it will, cost more than that 
     <lb/>
     amount, we should have to make up 
     <lb/>
     the difference. On this matter there 
     <lb/>
     should be a distinct understanding, so 
     <lb/>
     there may be no difficulty about it in 
     <lb/>
     the future. I am only speaking in case 
     <lb/>
     Confederation should be decided upon, 
     <lb/>
     so that if we do go in, the arrange 
     <lb/>
     ment should be such that we would 
     <lb/>
     have fair play, and a fair race with the 
     <lb/>
     other Provinces. It will be one of 
     <lb/>
     those bargains which a dissolution 
     <lb/>
     cannot break. It will be binding for 
     <lb/>
     all time to come. I cannot, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     in view of the opinions expressed on 
     <lb/>
     both sides, but express my belief that 
     <lb/>
     the course pointed out by the Leader 
     <lb/>
     of the Government is the proper one 
     <lb/>
     to pursue. Hon. members on the 
     <lb/>
     opposite side speak as if we were go<lb break="no"/>ing up on a begging excursion. For 
     <lb/>
     my part I look at the whole question 
     <lb/>
     from first to last as a begging one. 
     <lb/>
     The late Government assumed the 
     <lb/>
     position of paupers from the first. 
     <lb/>
     They have placed us in such a position 
     <lb/>
     that we cannot now say we will go in 
     <lb/>
     of our own free choice. Make the 
     <lb/>
     best you can of it, you will go in as 
     <lb/>
     paupers. I believe in a few years, 
     <lb/>
     with care and prudence, we would 
     <lb/>
     surmount our difficulties. In the other 
     <lb/>
     Provinces they are taxed $40 on every 
     <lb/>
     £1000 of property they own. The 
     <lb/>
     Dominion Government have got them<lb break="no"/>selves in that position, that they can<lb break="no"/>not help themselves. In the Do<lb break="no"/>minion new Railways will be spring<lb break="no"/>ing up in all directions, and these will 
     <lb/>
     lead to increased taxation. In addi<lb break="no"/>tion to our burden, in Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     we will have to shoulder our propor<lb break="no"/>tion of the burden of Canada also, yet 
     <lb/>
     I approve more of the course proposed 
     <lb/>
     to be taken by his honor the Leader 
     <lb/>
     of the Government than that proposed 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DAVI2">Hon. B. DAVIES</persName>—Sir, they pur<lb break="no"/>pose sending up a new delegation, 
     <lb/>
    because they say the Laird-Haythorne 
     <lb/>Terms are not sufficient. Now I think 
     <lb/>it has been clearly shown that the 
     <lb/>reverse is the fact. The Dominion 
     <lb/>takes the Railway off our hands, and in 
     <lb/>that matter we are relieved by these 
     <lb/>Terms, from the duty of making pro<lb break="no"/>vision for the working of our road. If 
     <lb/>we do not go into Confederation, we 
     <lb/>have to make immediate provision for 
     <lb/>the Railway which cannot be less than 
     <lb/>$200,000. I have not heard one rea<lb break="no"/>son advanced to justify the basis Of the 
     <lb/>resolution before this hon. committee. 
     <lb/>His honor the Leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment has not set forth any cause for 
     <lb/>leading the committee to suppose that 
     <lb/>any additional allowance will be con<lb break="no"/>ceded over those already brought 
     <lb/>down. When they go to the Ministry 
     <lb/>at Ottawa,with demands for the Light<lb break="no"/>house on Summerside wharf, and other 
     <lb/>similar works, they will be given to 
     <lb/>understand that the general Govern<lb break="no"/>ment does not, and will not, grant. 
     <lb/>allowances to any Provinces for such 
     <lb/>works. But I believe. Sir, that the 
     <lb/>hon. member must have some other 
     <lb/>object in view in going up. We have 
     <lb/>a right to know, Mr. Chairman, if the 
     <lb/>Government are going to accept the 
     <lb/>basis of $45 ahead, and to allow the 
     <lb/>general Government to have the Rail<lb break="no"/>way as Dominica property? Or do 
     <lb/>the members on the Government side 
     <lb/>of this committee concur in agreeing to 
     <lb/>take the road and work it ourselves? 
     <lb/>If so it will give the Government the 
     <lb/>power of expending the interest Of 
     <lb/>nearly $5,000,000. To me it does 
     <lb/>appear as if the intention of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment is to secure all the patronage 
     <lb/>they can for their friends, and for that 
     <lb/>purpose may agree to keep the Rail<lb break="no"/>roadas a local work. If such a line 
     <lb/>of policy should be adopted, it will, I 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     am persuaded, be attended with bad 
     <lb/>
     results to the general interests of the 
     <lb/>
     Island. It would. no doubt, give our 
     <lb/>
     Government here a large amount of 
     <lb/>
     money to expend annually, but in the 
     <lb/>
     end, the road, as a public work, will 
     <lb/>
     become a failure. It will annually 
     <lb/>
     depreciate in value, and becomes bur<lb break="no"/>den upon the Colony. Lord Dufferin's 
     <lb/>
     telegraphic despatch distinctly states 
     <lb/>
     that better Terms will not be agreed 
     <lb/>
     to. I believe the Government are 
     <lb/>
     perfectly satisfied the Terms are just 
     <lb/>
     and honorable. No one here ever 
     <lb/>
     supposed the Canadian Government 
     <lb/>
     intended to take the road off our hands. 
     <lb/>
     As matters now stand we will have 
     <lb/>
     the Railway with all its advan<lb break="no"/>tages, and yet it will not cost us any<lb break="no"/>thing, as the Terms brought down 
     <lb/>
     provides that it shall belong to the 
     <lb/>
     General Government. They have 
     <lb/>
     not shown that the Terms offered are 
     <lb/>
     unfair, or that the basis upon which 
     <lb/>
     they rest is money. I know the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member, the Leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, is not a man who would go up 
     <lb/>
     to beg. But he can go up there and 
     <lb/>
     make proposals without doing that. 
     <lb/>
     I am inclined to think that he wishes 
     <lb/>
     to take the Railway off the hands of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion Government. At one 
     <lb/>
     time, I believe, the hon. member offer 
     <lb/>
     ed to take the road and work it him<lb break="no"/>self. And as there would be nothing 
     <lb/>
     unconstitutional in his asking to have 
     <lb/>
     it retained as a local work, this com<lb break="no"/>mittee should be very careful and not 
     <lb/>
     hastily bind itself to support such 
     <lb/>
     Terms as the delegates may thus agree 
     <lb/>
     to. For if the hon. member and the 
     <lb/>
     delegates who may go up should 
     <lb/>
     make an arrangement of that kind, it 
     <lb/>
     would entail eternal ruin upon this 
     <lb/>
     Island. It would give them an in<lb break="no"/>terest at first in what they would make 
     <lb/>
     on the first cost of the road. But at 
     <lb/>
     present the work is suspended, because 
     <lb/>
     the Debentures are worthless in the 
     <lb/>
     money market at home, but the mo<lb break="no"/>ment we accept the Terms. they will

     sell at par. But, if it is to become 
     <lb/>
     local works they will be worth little or 
     <lb/>
     nothing. They would not yield £80 
     <lb/>
     on the £100, and if so we would never 
     <lb/>
     see a branch line extended to Souris 
     <lb/>
     or Tinguish. Indeed, I doubt if the 
     <lb/>
     road would extend further west than 
     <lb/>
     Summerside. I feel, therefore, that 
     <lb/>
     I have a right to ask if such is their 
     <lb/>
     intentions? This side of the House 
     <lb/>
     never attempted to deviate from any 
     <lb/>
     promise made to the eastern members, 
     <lb/>
     nor can I see that they had any just 
     <lb/>
     reason for leaving us when we acted 
     <lb/>
     in such good faith toward them. If 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member could show any 
     <lb/>
     sound reason why we should support 
     <lb/>
     the Resolution, we might. perhaps be 
     <lb/>
     induced to do so. The basis of the 
     <lb/>
     Resolution is money. It is drawn up 
     <lb/>
     also in a manner which will prevent 
     <lb/>
     hon. "members on this side from sup<lb break="no"/>porting it. For my part I do not feel 
     <lb/>
     that I can vote for it, or that my duty 
     <lb/>
     towards my constituents requires that 
     <lb/>
     I should. The amendment is much 
     <lb/>
     more correctly drawn up, and as it 
     <lb/>
     more fully meets with my approval, it 
     <lb/>
     shall have my support.

     <persName ref="pers:LEFU2">Hon. Mr. LEFURGY</persName>.—A good deal 
     <lb/>
     has been said by the hon. members on 
     <lb/>
     both sides of the House in reference 
     <lb/>
     to the proposed delegation to Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and I think the sooner we come to 
     <lb/>
     an understanding on the matter, 
     <lb/>
     the better, as there is no time to 
     <lb/>
     lose. both sides of the House seem 
     <lb/>
     pretty well satisfied that Confederation 
     <lb/>
     must be brought about, and I think 
     <lb/>
     we should confine ourselves to the 
     <lb/>
     question as to whether a delegation 
     <lb/>
     should be appointed or not. For my 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     own part I could not vote for the pre<lb break="no"/>sent Terms without having made an 
     <lb/>
     effort to do better, but if we satisfac<lb break="no"/>torily ascertain that better Terms can<lb break="no"/>not be procured, I will be willing to 
     <lb/>
     accept the offer  we now have. View<lb break="no"/>ing the matter in this way, I think it 
     <lb/>
     will be almost useless for the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion to oppose the sending of another 
     <lb/>
     delegation. The Government is per<lb break="no"/>fectly agreed in reference to Confed<lb break="no"/>eration, that it shall be carried. If 
     <lb/>
     better Terms can be procured, it will 
     <lb/>
     be all the better for the Opposition and 
     <lb/>
     their constituents, and they cannot find 
     <lb/>
     fault. We can lose nothing by follow<lb break="no"/>ing the course we propose. Some<lb break="no"/>thing has been said about a letter sent 
     <lb/>
               to Mr. Lawson, of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Summerside 
     <lb/>
     Progress</hi>, by Mr. P. Sinclair. It was 
     <lb/>
     brought to my notice that a report was 
     <lb/>
     in circulation that somebody had picked 
     <lb/>
     up the letter and sent it to me, and 
     <lb/>
     that I then forwarded it to the Editor 
     <lb/>
               of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Argus</hi>, Now, I denied this in 
     <lb/>
     presence of Mr. Lawson, and said that 
     <lb/>
     I never saw the letter, with which 
     <lb/>
     statement he was perfectly satisfied. 
     <lb/>
     If it had been brought tome, I would 
     <lb/>
     have recommended its being sent back 
     <lb/>
     to the owner, but I knew nothing 
     <lb/>
     about it. Messrs. Pope, Howlan and 
     <lb/>
     myself, have been blamed for bringing 
     <lb/>
     all this trouble upon the country, by 
     <lb/>introducing the Railway Bill; but I<lb/>think that instead of being censured<lb/>for our conduct, we deserve a con<lb break="no"/>siderable amount of credit. The hon.<lb/>Leader of the Opposition was elected<lb/>as an anti-Confederate, but when he<lb/>found himself in a critical situation,<lb/>and unable to carry on the business of<lb/>the country, he turned round, and<lb/>sought Terms at Ottawa for admission<lb/>into the Dominion. He obtained, in<lb/>his own opinion, as good Terms as<lb/>could be got, and now boastfully states<lb/>that to seek better Terms would be<lb/>perfect nonsense. it is much better<lb/>to ask for better Terms before going<lb/>into Confederation than afterwards,<lb/>

     for I believe we shall soon enough find 
     <lb/>
     out that the amount we receive from 
     <lb/>
     Canada will prove insufficient for our 
     <lb/>
     wants. Out of little things great 
     <lb/>
     things grow. If we obtain only a few 
     <lb/>
    trifling amounts, to which we are en<lb break="no"/>titled, they will, in the aggregate amount 
     <lb/>to something, and will prevent the 
     <lb/>necessity of levying so much by local 
     <lb/>taxation. The hon. junior member 
     <lb/>for Belfast has pictured the Dominion 
     <lb/>as one of the greatest and grandest 
     <lb/>countries in the world. I looked upon 
     <lb/>a union with that country, years ago, 
     <lb/>inthe same light in which he now 
     <lb/>sees it, and, therefore, I was a few 
     <lb/>years ahead of him. If the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion join with the Government in sup<lb break="no"/>porting the Resolution, I would not 
     <lb/>object to the appointment of one of 
     <lb/>their number on the delegation. We 
     <lb/>have a right to expect the assistance 
     <lb/>ol the Opposition in a matter which so 
     <lb/>deeply affects the best interests of the 
     <lb/>country, and I hope we shall have it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:STEW2">MR. STEWART</persName>.— I acknowledge 
     <lb/>there is a good deal of truth in the 
     <lb/>remark of the hon. member for Sum<lb break="no"/>merside, that a good deal of time is 
     <lb/>lost by hon. members of this House, in 
     <lb/>making long speeches, instead of nar<lb break="no"/>rowing them down and furthering the 
     <lb/>real business of the country. The 
     <lb/>subject has been thoroughly discussed, 
     <lb/>and the only question for us now to 
     <lb/>consider is whether the proposed dele<lb break="no"/>gationis necessary or not. For my 
     <lb/>own part I do not intend to interfere 
     <lb/>with the legitimate business of this 
     <lb/>House by offering a factions opposition 
     <lb/>to the course, which, it is evident, the 
     <lb/>Government intend to pursue in this 
     <lb/>matter; because it I did so, I would 
     <lb/>not be serving the interests of my con<lb break="no"/>stitnents, nor acting in a manner cal<lb break="no"/>culated to forwardthe real interests of 
     <lb/>the country. It was the duty of the 
     <lb/>Government, when the Opposition 
     <lb/>showed the Terms before us to be just, 
     <lb/>equitable and liberal to this Colony, 
     <lb/>to state in plain terms what they in<lb break="no"/><cb/>tend to ask in addition to the present 
     <lb/>
     offer, and also upon what grounds they 
     <lb/>
     intend to base their arguments in favor 
     <lb/>
     of additional concessions. If we give 
     <lb/>
     them full liberty to change the whole 
     <lb/>
     constitution of the country without 
     <lb/>
    knowing what claims they intend to 
     <lb/>make, we may place ourselves in a 
     <lb/>false position before our constituents 
     <lb/>and before the world, and, therefore, 
     <lb/>would pursue a very unwise course, in 
     <lb/>so doing. If the Government feel 
     <lb/>bound to send another delegation, 
     <lb/>the sooner they do so the better, 
     <lb/>as the business of the country de<lb break="no"/>mands an immediate settlement of 
     <lb/>this question of Confederation. If $25,<lb break="no"/>000 in gold be withdrawn from our 
     <lb/>Banks for the purpose of paying off 
     <lb/>the amount we borrowed from a New 
     <lb/>Brunswick Bank, it may be the means 
     <lb/>of injuring our trade to a certain ex<lb break="no"/>tent by hampering the Banks. I heard 
     <lb/>it reported that we were offered a re<lb break="no"/>newal of half the amount of that note; 
     <lb/>but I understand it to mean another 
     <lb/>delegation to Canada. We have been 
     <lb/>assured that if additional concessions 
     <lb/>cannot be obtained, the Government 
     <lb/>will accept the present Terms. I am 
     <lb/>not satisfied with the statements made 
     <lb/>by his honor the Leader of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment in reference to the claims he 
     <lb/>intends to make from the Dominion 
     <lb/>Government. If hon. members on the 
     <lb/>other side of the House can produce 
     <lb/>figures to substantiate their position, 
     <lb/>and to show how this Colony would 
     <lb/>lose by accepting the Terms now offer<lb break="no"/>ed, they should do so. I have figured 
     <lb/>up the expenditure ofthis Island under 
     <lb/>Confederation, and compared it with 
     <lb/>the present offer, and I make outa 
     <lb/>surplus of Revenue of $13,000. We 
     <lb/>have no right to make unjust demands 
     <lb/>from the Dominion, as the Terms we 
     <lb/>procure must be submitted to their 
     <lb/>Legislature, and receive its approval, 
     <lb/>before a union takes place. As we 
     <lb/>are cut off from the other Provinces 
     <lb/>six months in the year, our mail ser<lb break="no"/>

            vice, which is, at present, poorly sus<lb break="no"/>tained, should be taken into considera<lb break="no"/>tion, and ample provision made for<lb/>regular communication with the Do<lb break="no"/>minion, during all seasons of the year.<lb/>I believe the Canadian Government<lb/>will attend to this matte, as our in<lb break="no"/>terests will be theirs, and theirs ours.<lb/>I hope the hon. Leader of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment will be able to show that he<lb/>can obtain better Terms, and also how<lb/>it can be done. I shall bow to superior<lb/>wisdom in reference to this matter, and<lb/>do not believe the people will blame<lb/>me fore the manner in which I have<lb/>acted, and the part I have taken. I<lb/>throw the cloak of charity over the<lb/>errors of public men ; they, no doubt,<lb/>sometimes do what is wrong, but if a<lb/>man is true to his fellow men in pri<lb break="no"/>vate life, he can be relied upon in<lb/>public life. I cannot see what good is<lb/>accomplished by the violent attacks<lb/>of one hon. member of this House upon<lb/>another, in reference to old matters<lb/>which should be allowed to die out,<lb/>and, therefore, hope such uncalled for<lb/>debates will cease. I cannot vote for<lb/>the resolution brought down by the<lb/>hon. Leader of the Government, be<lb break="no"/>cause I believe we shall receive a suffi<lb break="no"/>cient Revenue, under the Terms now<lb/>offered by the Dominion, to meet all<lb/>necessary expenditure, and because I<lb/>believe the sending up another delega<lb break="no"/>tion would only cause unnecessary de<lb break="no"/>lay, without reaping a corresponding<lb/>benefit. The sooner Confederation is<lb/>an accomplished fact, the better for the<lb/>trade and prospects of the country. I<lb/>am aware that the Government can<lb/>carry the resolution. If they are de<lb break="no"/>termined to do so, it would not be wise<lb/>or prudent for the Opposition to cause<lb/>unnecessary delay in the matter. They<lb/>must take the responsibility of their<lb/>action, and we, of the Opposition,<lb/>must do the same in reference to ours.<lb/>I oppose them honestly, because I be<lb break="no"/>lieve we now have Terms which we<lb/>should at once accept for the best in<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
               
            terests of the country, and because        
     <lb/>delays are dangerous. I ran my elec<lb break="no"/>tion on the present Terms, and found<lb/>that the people were satisfied with<lb/>them. The hon. Leader of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment has not shown that they will<lb/>be insufficient for the wants of the<lb/>country. I confess that I am a mere<lb/>novice in reference to the financial<lb/>position of the Colony, while he is a<lb/>man who understands our position,<lb/>and, as a native of the Island, his in<lb break="no"/>terests are interwoven with its best<lb/>interests. I cannot say that he adopts<lb/>his present course from false motives,<lb/>as it is often difficult to ascertain the<lb/>real cause of individual action.<lb/>Throwing aside all these matters,<lb/>however, I am bound to support the<lb/>adopting of the present Terms, and<lb/>cannot vote for the resolution, because<lb/>I believe we cannot get better Terms.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:POPE2">Hon.

           Ottawa, for that purpose. The hon.<lb/>junior member for New London said<lb/>that he had made a calculation, and<lb/>found that under the present Terms<lb/>we should have a surplus of Revenue<lb/>over expenditure of $18,000 annually.<lb/>Even admitting that we should have a<lb/>surplus this year, we know that our<lb/>wants have increased at a greater rate<lb/>than our Revenue, and that we should<lb/>probably, in the second year, get $13,<lb break="no"/>000 behind hand. At the end of ten<lb/>years we would, in all probability be<lb/>$13,000 in debt, instead of having a<lb/>surplus. The hon. junior member for<lb/>Belfast puts down $54,000 as the<lb/>annual expenditure of the Board of<lb/>Works. Now the fact is, that $61,<lb break="no"/>000 have been expended by that Board<lb/>during the present year alone, although<lb/>some trifling part of the words con<lb break="no"/>tracted for are not yet finished. We<lb/>know that of our bridges are<lb/>built of hemlock timber, and that<lb/>many of them are getting decayed and<lb/>are tumbling down. In the course of<lb/>very few years they will all require to<lb/>be rebuilt. Taking the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber's estimate, we find that already<lb/>there are $7000 expended this year<lb/>beyond the amount he sets down, and<lb/>we may, therefore, come to the con<lb break="no"/>clusion that we should require at least<lb/>$54,000 as the annual expenditure of<lb/>the Board of Works, we shall find that<lb/>at the end of ten years we should be<lb/>$200,000 behind, and would have to<lb/>resort to local taxation to meet it.<lb/>Will any hon. member tell me that<lb/>$50,000 is sufficient for the building of<lb/>wharves and bridges, in view of the<lb/>fact that the price of labor and lumber<lb/>is advancing ? Stone must, eventually,<lb/>take the place of wood in the construc<lb break="no"/>tion of bridges, and its cost will, of<lb/>course, be many times greater. I do<lb/>not mean to say that we would, under<lb/>the present Terms, be actually $70,<lb break="no"/>000 a year behind the expenditure ;<lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     but if we maintain both branches of 
     <lb/>
     the Legislature, as we now do, and  
     <lb/>
     expend in the same proportion of in<lb break="no"/>crease, annually, on public works, we  
     <lb/>
     would find that our expenditure would 
     <lb/>
     exceed the Revenue to that extent. 
     <lb/>
     But retrenchment might be made in 
     <lb/>
     several items of our present expendi<lb break="no"/>ture ; for instance, one branch of the  
     <lb/>
     legislature would then be quite suffi<lb break="no"/>cient, and the number of members  
     <lb/>
     composing the House  of Assembly 
     <lb/>
     might be materially lessened. So also  
     <lb/>
     in the different public offices.  But if 
     <lb/>
     the expenditure of the Dashaways is 
     <lb/>
      to be taken as a standard, the Rev<lb break="no"/>enue, under Confederation, would be a  
     <lb/>
     long way behind the outlay. We re<lb break="no"/>quire the best possible Terms that can 
     <lb/>
     be obtained, to meet the peculiarities 
     <lb/>
     of our position, and to meet our re<lb break="no"/>quirements for some years to come. 
     <lb/>
     If a unanimous vote were carried in 
     <lb/>
     this House, the position of the dele<lb break="no"/>gates would be greatly strengthened, 
     <lb/>
     and it would hasten the consummation 
     <lb/>
     of the union so much desired by the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition. In all sincerity, my sole 
     <lb/>
     object is to obtain Confederation on  
     <lb/>
     the most favorable Terms, so that we 
     <lb/>
     may not, after the union is completed, 
     <lb/>
     be discontented, and forced to resort to 
     <lb/>
     immediate local taxation to relieve the 
     <lb/>
     pressing wants of the country. Under 
     <lb/>
     Contederation, we shall find that our 
     <lb/>
     expenditure will increase year after 
     <lb/>
     year, while our Revenue will remain 
     <lb/>
     stationary. If we can obtain $5000 
     <lb/>
     for one Lighthouse, and so much more 
     <lb/>
     for another and another, we are fairly 
     <lb/>
     and honestly entitled to it, and should 
     <lb/>
     endeavor to obtain it. If the Do<lb break="no"/>minion Government have under esti<lb break="no"/>mated the cost of the great public 
     <lb/>
     works they are about to undertake, we 
     <lb/>
     are entitled to receive the one-fortieth 
     <lb/>
     part of the extra cost; but, according 
     <lb/>
     to the present Terms we should not 
     <lb/>
     receive one cent of that sum. We 
     <lb/>
     shall receive our share of the grants for ' 
     <lb/>
     the deepening of certain harbors, in 
     <lb/>

     proportion to the sums expended in the 
     <lb/>
     wer Provincess for a similar purpose. 
     <lb/>
     It should be stipulated in the Terms 
     <lb/>
     we receive, that we shall receive our 
     <lb/>
     fair proportion of all sums expended 
     <lb/>
     in the Dominion for public works. I 
     <lb/>
     would be very sorry to make any 
     <lb/>
     claim on the Dominion for what is 
     <lb/>
     unjust and unfair. My desire is to 
     <lb/>
     see Confederation brought about on 
     <lb/>
     fair and equitable Terms, so that we 
     <lb/>
     may never have to regret the step we 
     <lb/>
     are about to take. My interests are 
     <lb/>
     bound up with those of this country, 
     <lb/>
     and I feel that in forwarding its best 
     <lb/>
     interests I am forwarding my own as 
     <lb/>
     well as those of the people generally. 
     <lb/>
     I would be sorry to return from this 
     <lb/>
     delegation without having accomplish<lb break="no"/>ed something to improve our position ; 
     <lb/>
     but I feel confident that better Terms 
     <lb/>
     will be conceded us. In making his 
     <lb/>
     calculation, I do not believe the hon. 
     <lb/>
     Leader of the Opposition took into 
     <lb/>
     account the Excise Duties of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion at all. Those duties are not 
     <lb/>
     included in his figures giving nine or 
     <lb/>
     ten per cent as the Dominion tariff. 
     <lb/>
     We know that their Excise Duties are 
     <lb/>
     very heavy, and helps very largely in 
     <lb/>
     making up a Revenue. There would 
     <lb/>
     be no difficulty in raising money 
     <lb/>
     enough, if we remain out of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion, to pay our way and meet all 
     <lb/>
     demands upon us, if we could but get 
     <lb/>
     our securities in a good sound financial 
     <lb/>
     position. I would not be afraid to 
     <lb/>
     face even the latter difficulty, but 
     <lb/>
     there is no need to run the risk of plac<lb break="no"/>ing our Banking institutions and the coun<lb break="no"/>try generally, in a bad financial posi<lb break="no"/>tion; if reasonable Terms are offered 
     <lb/>
     by Canada, it will be to our interest, 
     <lb/>
     for many reasons, to accept them. I 
     <lb/>
     should like to see our Railway a suc<lb break="no"/>cess, and to see our people avail them<lb break="no"/>selves of its advantages. Our people 
     <lb/>
     should not be placed in a worse posi<lb break="no"/>tion than those of the other Provinces, 
     <lb/>
     and, therefore, we should receive more 
     <lb/>
     iberal Terms than those now offered. 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     The Government are quite prepared 
     <lb/>
     to accept Confederation at the earliest 
     <lb/>
     possible period, on fair and equitable 
     <lb/>
     Terms, as they believe it would con. 
     <lb/>
     duce to the interests of the people of 
     <lb/>
     this Colony, although many of their 
     <lb/>
     supporters believed at first that our 
     <lb/>
     resources would be quite sufficient to 
     <lb/>
     meet all demands, and would rather 
     <lb/>
     remain out of Confederation. As they 
     <lb/>
     did not know the state of our public 
     <lb/>
     securities in the London money mar<lb break="no"/>ket, one could scarcely wonder that 
     <lb/>
     they were opposed to Confederation 
     <lb/>
     till they ascertained our true position. 
     <lb/>
     But they are now prepared to accept 
     <lb/>
     fair and reasonable Terms, without 
     <lb/>
     loss of time. If the Opposition do not 
     <lb/>
     feel themselves in a position to support 
     <lb/>
     the resolution, I hope they will not 
     <lb/>
     give it a factions opposition.

     <lb/>
     of the Government wishes to carry his 
     <lb/>
     resolution without delay or opposition. 
     <lb/>
     Times have changed with him, Sir, 
     <lb/>
     for it is only one year ago, since he 
     <lb/>
     carried out his factions opposition, to 
     <lb/>
     every act of the late Government, one 
     <lb/>
     month longer than was at all neces<lb break="no"/>sary or usual. I can assure him that 
     <lb/>
     although we do not offer a factions 
     <lb/>
     opposition, we claim the right, and 
     <lb/>
     will speak fully and freely on this 
     <lb/>
     question. This is an important period 
     <lb/>
     in the history of this Colony, and we 
     <lb/>
     intend to enjoy the privilege of ex<lb break="no"/>pressing our opinion on a matter so 
     <lb/>
     deeply affecting our interests. Has it 
     <lb/>
     come to this, that. those who have been 
     <lb/>
     pronounced imbeciles by the present 
     <lb/>
     Government and their supporters, 
     <lb/>
     should now be asked to allow their 
     <lb/>
     resolution to pass without further op<lb break="no"/>position? Is this side, or even a 
     <lb/>
     majority of this hon. House, going to 
     <lb/>
     authorize the hon. Leader of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to do as he pleases? No 
     <lb/>
     matter what Terms the new delegates 
     <lb/>
     may agree to, the resolution states 
     <lb/>
     that we have full confidence in them,

     <lb/>
   
          
     and will ratify the Terms. That is a 
     <lb/>
     pledge which we would not be justified 
     <lb/>
     in giving any delegation, and the hon. 
     <lb/>
     Leader of the Government has a great 
     <lb/>
     deal of assurance to come down to this 
     <lb/>
     House and ask us to pass such a reso<lb break="no"/>lution. If the delegates take this 
     <lb/>
     document with them to Ottawa, the 
     <lb/>
     members of the Dominion Government 
     <lb/>
     will surely think we are an egregious 
     <lb/>
     set of fools in promising to ratify what<lb break="no"/>ever Terms those hon. members may 
     <lb/>
     happen to bring down. It is beneath 
     <lb/>
     the dignity of this hon. House to give 
     <lb/>
     pledges in regard to the future; our 
     <lb/>
     business merely requires a present 
     <lb/>
     opinion on the matters brought before 
     <lb/>
     us. The hon. Leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment says that the Dominion Revenue 
     <lb/>
     has been largely increased during the 
     <lb/>
     last few years, and that the Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces have been in a great mea<lb break="no"/>sure the cause of it. If the latter was 
     <lb/>
     a fact, we should have seen this great 
     <lb/>
     increase immediately after the union 
     <lb/>
     was etfected, but this was not the case. 
     <lb/>
     Three years elapsed without any re<lb break="no"/>markable change in this respect, but 
     <lb/>
     as time rolled on, the people became 
     <lb/>
     more settled and satisfied with their 
     <lb/>
     lot, trade began to fall into its proper 
     <lb/>
     channels, and the Revenue began to 
     <lb/>
     increase rapidly. Quebec contributes 
     <lb/>
     as much to their Revenue as any of 
     <lb/>
     the Lower Provinces. The great 
     <lb/>
     Dominion is now being consolidated, 
     <lb/>
     and trade is flourishing accordingly. 
     <lb/>
     The taxation, even now, in this Colony, 
     <lb/>
     is $4.20 per head, whereas in the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion it is only $4.09 per head. 
     <lb/>
     Deduct the cent coinage from last 
     <lb/>
     year's Revenue, and we shall find that 
     <lb/>
     the taxation is about the same in both 
     <lb/>
     cases. The hon. Leader of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment says that we could remain 
     <lb/>
     out of Confederation and still manage 
     <lb/>
     our own affairs. He also admits that 
     <lb/>we could suspend the Railway works.<lb/>
    If we remain out of the union, the 
     <lb/>Railway must be stopped. Well, if 
     <lb/>he will stop the construction of the 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     Railway, except that portion between 
     <lb/>
     Charlottetown and Summerside, I care 
     <lb/>
     very little whether he accepts Con<lb break="no"/>federation or not. But his honor goes 
     <lb/>
     on to show that if Confederation is 
     <lb/>
    not accepted, there will be no sale for 
     <lb/>the Railway Debentures. Sometimes 
     <lb/>the truth will come out in a side wind. 
     <lb/>No additional tax, no 2 1/2 per cent to 
     <lb/>meet the interest on the Railway debt 
     <lb/>is now mentioned. We must stop the 
     <lb/>Railway works, and remain out of the 
     <lb/>Dominion, if we cannot get Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion on better Terms. That is en<lb break="no"/>couraging for the Branch Railways! 
     <lb/>I am sure the hon. member for East 
     <lb/>Point was astonished at the declara<lb break="no"/>tion of his Leader! It will be the 
     <lb/>safest plan for hon. members on the 
     <lb/>other side of the House to accept the 
     <lb/>present Terms, as it is the only sure 
     <lb/>way to ensure the construction of the 
     <lb/>branch lines. If we have been ex<lb break="no"/>travagant and have spent more than 
     <lb/>we should have done, we alone should 
     <lb/>suffer for our rashness. We have no 
     <lb/>right to press unjust claims upon the 
     <lb/>Government of the Dominion to make 
     <lb/>good what we have extravagantly 
     <lb/>spent. The hon. Leader of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment tries to make out that some<lb break="no"/>thing has been omitted from the cal<lb break="no"/>culations of the late delegation, in their 
     <lb/>negocintions with the Dominion Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. I do not believe the Finance 
     <lb/>Minister of Canada is going to recon<lb break="no"/>sider his position, and re-arrange his 
     <lb/>Budget Speech to please him, Sir. 
     <lb/>He states that the Bay Verte Canal 
     <lb/>will cost double five millions of dollars 
     <lb/>before it is completed, and that we do 
     <lb/>not know anything at all about it! 
     <lb/>The debt of Canada is also to be 
     <lb/>swelled up to a hundred millions of 
     <lb/>dollars ! Are these the arguments he 
     <lb/>intends to use when he goes upon the 
     <lb/>delegation ? If so, I wish them joy of 
     <lb/>their success. The delegation is going<lb/>to ask payment for certain Lighthouses 
     <lb/>and Breakwaters, although they can<lb break="no"/>not show that the other Provxnces

     received anything for similar public 
     <lb/>
     works. If a new principle is laid 
     <lb/>
     down by the Dominion Government 
     <lb/>
     for our benefit, they will have to mete 
     <lb/>
     out equal measure to all  the other  
     <lb/>
     Provinces of the union ; but they will 
     <lb/>
     not pay for  every paltry Lighthouse 
     <lb/>
     and Breakwater, and a thousand other 
     <lb/>
     little matters for which the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment are going to claim payment. 
     <lb/>
     The resolution should show in what 
     <lb/>
     respect this Colony has been over<lb break="no"/>looked in the present Terms, but this 
     <lb/>
     it does not do. If the Government 
     <lb/>
     had stated in the resolution what they 
     <lb/>
     intend to ask for, the Opposition might 
     <lb/>
     be prepared to support it, but they 
     <lb/>
     have laid down nothing. I believe 
     <lb/>
     that this delegation is more for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of carrying out their own 
     <lb/>
     particular policy in reference to the 
     <lb/>
     selection of offices, than for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of obtaining better  Terms. Be<lb break="no"/>fore the Treaty of Washington was 
     <lb/>
     settled, the Government of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion were anxious to have us in<lb break="no"/>cluded in Confederation, as they wish<lb break="no"/>ed to have control of our fisheries, but 
     <lb/>
     since the Treaty, they care very little 
     <lb/>
     whether we are in or out. There 
     <lb/>
     was also a good deal of smuggling from 
     <lb/>
     this Island to the Dominion, some 
     <lb/>
     years ago, and this was another reason 
     <lb/>
     why they wished to have us in Con<lb break="no"/>federation. I am sorry to say our 
     <lb/>
     officers at that time did not try to 
     <lb/>
     crush out that sort of thing, and that 
     <lb/>
     no efficient check was given to it. But 
     <lb/>
     the tables are now turned the other 
     <lb/>
     way, as the tariff of this Island will 
     <lb/>
     soon be higher than that of Canada, if 
     <lb/>
     we remain out of the union. As re<lb break="no"/>gards either our fisheries or tariff, 
     <lb/>
     they care very little whether we go in 
     <lb/>
     or stay out ; but they would like to 
     <lb/>
     see the outline of the Dominion round<lb break="no"/>ed up. These delegates are now go<lb break="no"/>ing  up to Ottawa to threaten that 
     <lb/>Government that if they do not give<lb/>us better Terms, we shall remain out<lb/>of Confederation. It is my opinion<lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
      that if every hon. member of this 
     <lb/>
     House saw the whole burden that will 
     <lb/>
     fall upon us, when the Railway is 
     <lb/>
    completed, there is not one that would  
     <lb/>not shrink from remaining out of the<lb/>Dominion shapes the interest and 
     <lb/>debt.  If, in  future years, we wish to 
     <lb/>improve our Educational system, and 
     <lb/>raise the qualification and  salaries of 
     <lb/>our Teachers, we can increase our 
     <lb/>local taxation for that purpose.  The 
     <lb/>hon. Leader of the Government pub<lb break="no"/>lished a statement in the newspapers, 
     <lb/>a few weeks ago, to the effect that the 
     <lb/>present Terms are not as good as the 
     <lb/>Better Terms of 1869. I differ widely 
     <lb/> from him on that point, and have no 
     <lb/>confidence in his  management. I 
     <lb/>could not endorse his resolution, as I 
     <lb/>do not know what he intends to ask 
     <lb/>for, and I could not promise him that I 
     <lb/>will give my unqualified ratification to 
     <lb/>Terms I have never heard. He asks 
     <lb/>too much from us.

     receptacle of all the falsehoods and 
     <lb/>
     filth of this Island, and that no depend<lb break="no"/>ence can be put upon any statements 
     <lb/>
     it contains. I am quite willing to 
     <lb/>
     compare my Washington delegation 
     <lb/>
     with his Ottawa delegation. I went, 
     <lb/>
     at that time, as far as Boston, on pri<lb break="no"/>vate business, and paid my expenses 
     <lb/>thus far from my own pocket. The 
     <lb/>Leader of the then Government asked 
     <lb/>me to go on to Washington, and I did 
     <lb/>so. The Report I made out at New 
     <lb/>York was made after the Bill, to which 
     <lb/>it had  reference, had passed through 
     <lb/>Congress, and, therefore, I could not 
     <lb/>have committed an error in that way. 
     <lb/>I was then asked to go to Montreal on 
     <lb/>business connected with the Telegraph<lb/>lines. I went, and obtained what I<lb/>asked for. For this delegation I re<lb break="no"/>

     <lb/>
            
   
     ceived my personal expenses, and that 
     <lb/>
    was all. But the Laird-Haythorne 
     <lb/>delegation cost the country $856 ! 
     <lb/>And what did they obtain for this 
     <lb/>expenditure? The hon. member did 
     <lb/>not do a single thing that was not 
     <lb/>already done for him in the Council 
     <lb/>Chamber before he started on his mis<lb break="no"/>sion ! In my hand I hold the Minute 
     <lb/>of Council, dated Jan. 2nd, 1873, con<lb break="no"/>taining the identical Terms he brought 
     <lb/>down from Ottawa, and yet he has the  
     <lb/> unblushing effrontery to state on the 
     <lb/>floor of this House, that the Terms 
     <lb/>were obtained by himself, and that 
     <lb/>they cannot be surpassed ! After con<lb break="no"/>siderable search, this Minute was 
     <lb/>found, although one after another of 
     <lb/>those hon. members, who were mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the late Government, declared 
     <lb/>there was no such document ! The 
     <lb/>late Government decided, before those 
     <lb/>delegates left at all, to go for Confed<lb break="no"/>eration. We hear the hon. member 
     <lb/>state that he debated with Mr. Tilley, 
     <lb/>the Dominion Finance Minister, in 
     <lb/>endeavoring to obtain liberal Terms 
     <lb/>for this Colony ! He did nothing of 
     <lb/>the kind, Sir ! At the bottom of this 
     <lb/>minute it is stated that certain sugges<lb break="no"/>tions were still under consideration ; 
     <lb/>but he knew well that such was not 
     <lb/>the case. When hon. E. Palmer stated 
     <lb/>at a public meeting in Charlottetown, 
     <lb/>that the delegates went to "fend off" 
     <lb/>Confederation, the hon. James Muir<lb break="no"/>head stated at Summerside that the 
     <lb/> late Government  had agreed to carry 
     <lb/>it out.  There is nothing to show to 
     <lb/>this House that the delegates asked 
     <lb/>for any Terms they did not obtain. 
     <lb/>The late Government might as well 
     <lb/>have sent up to Ottawa a sealed en<lb break="no"/>velope containing the Terms they 
     <lb/>wished, as to send up that delegation, 
     <lb/>for what was asked for was all granted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAIR2">MR. LAIRD</persName>.—We obtained $5,000 
     <lb/>
    annually, in addition to the Terms con<lb break="no"/>tained in that Minute of Council, for 
     <lb/> our lands. 
     <lb/>

            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOWL2">Hon. Mr. HOWLAN</persName>.—Well, that 
     <lb/>
     was a great performance? The late 
     <lb/>
     Government might as well have sent  
     <lb/>
     two boys, as, according to his own  
     <lb/>
     showing, he got only $5,000 per year ! 
     <lb/>
     The hon. Mr. Haythorne  has always 
     <lb/>
     been a Confederate, while it is well 
     <lb/>
     known that the hon. junior member for 
     <lb/>
    Belfast was an extreme anti-Confed<lb break="no"/>erate, and had been vilifying and 
     <lb/>abusing for years, on account of his 
     <lb/>opinions, the man who now became 
     <lb/>his co-delegate. Then look at the 
     <lb/>composition of this Minute of Council ! 
     <lb/>Talk about English Grammar ! It 
     <lb/>would be a fit subject for ridicule for 
     <lb/>the boys of any Grammar School. It 
     <lb/>is now clearly to be seen that the 
     <lb/>Terms were agreed upon in the corres<lb break="no"/>pondence between His Honor the 
     <lb/>Lieut. Governor, and the Governor 
     <lb/>General of Canada. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber says he saw Confederation loom<lb break="no"/>ing in the distance since last August. 
     <lb/>Perhaps there are other papers which 
     <lb/>we may yet get hold of, which will 
     <lb/>throw still more light on his perfidious 
     <lb/>dealings. The hon. members of the 
     <lb/>Opposition have told us over and over 
     <lb/>again that the country will not be able 
     <lb/>to meet the demands upon it out of 
     <lb/>Confederation, but we have here a 
     <lb/>document—a Minute of Council—of 
     <lb/>their own, stating that the Colony can 
     <lb/>pay all its liabilities !  The whole 
     <lb/>burden of their song has lately been 
     <lb/>about Exchange ; but it was a second<lb break="no"/>ary matter at that time, as this Min<lb break="no"/>ute does not contain a word about it. 
     <lb/>The only business the hon. member 
     <lb/>ever had control of, was that of the 
     <lb/>Charlottetown Woollen Factory, which 
     <lb/>suffered terribly under his mismanage<lb break="no"/>ment. A man who could carry on a  
     <lb/>Factory, and lose $1,400 a year, and  
     <lb/>at the close show on the books a profit  
     <lb/>of $2,700, must surely be an extraor<lb break="no"/>dinary individual ! At the bottom of 
     <lb/>this Minute of Council, they state that 
     <lb/>the Terms are " still under considera<lb break="no"/>tion." They must not be published 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="1873-05-01_Page_140"

     for the information of the people, be<lb break="no"/>cause they are alleged to be under 
     <lb/>
     consideration ! The hon. member well 
     <lb/>
     knows they were not under considera<lb break="no"/>tion ; yet he comes in here and loudly 
     <lb/>
     complains because the present Govern<lb break="no"/>ment will not tell him what they are 
     <lb/>
     going to ask in addition to the present 
     <lb/>
     Terms ? He is convicted in all those 
     <lb/>
     matters by his own statements, which 
     <lb/>
     bear witness against him. It is now 
     <lb/>
     clear that the Terms obtained by the 
     <lb/>
     late delegates were all arranged for, 
     <lb/>
     and completed for presentation to the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion Government, before they 
     <lb/>
     started at all ; but a great snow storm 
     <lb/>
     took place, and some members of their 
     <lb/>
     Government did not sign it till the 
     <lb/>
     11th of January. It appears the dele<lb break="no"/>gates got more from the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     Government than they asked for, 
     <lb/>
     when they received this great boon of 
     <lb/>
     $5000, and that the Colony paid $856 
     <lb/>
     for their services in procuring that 
     <lb/>
     paltry amount, according to the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member's own admission. We had a 
     <lb/>
     long eulogy on the services of the late 
     <lb/>
     Collector, Mr. Currie. Immediately 
     <lb/>
     after the present officer was appointed, 
     <lb/>
     the Government had to put a gentle<lb break="no"/>man in that office to put the books in 
     <lb/>
     order, and make up the Accounts, as 
     <lb/>
     the latter were found to be far behind. 
     <lb/>
     The Coalition appointed a committee 
     <lb/>
     to investigate, and they proved that 
     <lb/>
     there was smuggling going on, but 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Currie, instead of seizing the 
     <lb/>
     smuggled goods when he found them, 
     <lb/>
     said to the owners, "just give us a 
     <lb/>
     bond and we shall say nothing about 
     <lb/>
     it." It is a notorious fact that because 
     <lb/>
     a man in Prince County let some salt 
     <lb/>
     water get into a cask of liquor, he had 
     <lb/>
     $35 knocked off the duty! And yet 
     <lb/>
     we are now told that the late Collec<lb break="no"/>tor gave a great check to smuggling! 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member is terribly afraid 
     <lb/>
     that Messrs. Pope and Howlan will go 
     <lb/>
     up to Ottawa and get all the offices, 
     <lb/>
     and that the country will be ruined ! 
     <lb/>
     I never had a public office in my life ; 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     but I dare say that if we go up, we 
     <lb/>
     shall break up his little game of ob<lb break="no"/>taining office for himself and his 
     <lb/>
     friends. We were condemned by the 
     <lb/>
     late Government, and refused a com<lb break="no"/>mittee of investigation ; but who has 
     <lb/>
     the country now condemned ? It has 
     <lb/>
     Condemned the late Government and 
     <lb/>
     their Terms with them. We have 
     <lb/>
     been told by the Opposition that if 
     <lb/>
     another delegation receives a conces<lb break="no"/>sion of $1000 per year more from the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, the country should not ac<lb break="no"/>cept it. This is a specimen of their 
     <lb/>
     honesty and patriotism. When the 
     <lb/>
     hon. junior member for Belfast paid 
     <lb/>
     his first visit to Canada, he saw nothing 
     <lb/>
     worth looking at but some onions—all 
     <lb/>
     the rest was not worth mentioning. 
     <lb/>
     But he now sees everything in a new 
     <lb/>
     light—everything there appears great, 
     <lb/>
     grand, and good, to this would-be-<lb break="yes"/>financier ! We have no municipal or 
     <lb/>
     parochial taxes in this Colony, and 
     <lb/>
     though we should get the best Terms 
     <lb/>
     that can be got, we shall be taxed 
     <lb/>
     more heavily when we enter Confed<lb break="no"/>eration. He (Mr. Laird) took up the 
     <lb/>
     Budget Speech of hon. Mr. Tilley, and 
     <lb/>
     knew as much about it after he had 
     <lb/>
     got through it, as when he commenced 
     <lb/>
     to read it. When he states that our 
     <lb/>
     taxes are about equal to those of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, he says what he knows to 
     <lb/>
     be false. A new idea has entered his 
     <lb/>
     brain, and that is, to stop the Rail<lb break="no"/>way at Summerside ! He once went 
     <lb/>
     to the polls crying, "No Railway, stop 
     <lb/>
     the Railway," but hen be secured his 
     <lb/>
     election, he voted for building the 
     <lb/>
     branches ! He boasts of having ob<lb break="no"/>tained $22 per head more than any of 
     <lb/>
     the other Provinces. We know that 
     <lb/>
     when the other Provinces entered 
     <lb/>
     Confederation, no  Pacific Railway or 
     <lb/>
     any of the other great works, now 
     <lb/>
     proposed, was then thought of, and, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, their allowance per head 
     <lb/>
     could not be as great as if they were 
     <lb/>
     only now entering. No man can tell 
     <lb/>
     what may take place within the next 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
            
   
     few years to increase the Dominion 
     <lb/>
    debt to an enormous extent. A war, 
     <lb/>for instance, or some enormous expen<lb break="no"/>diture for some particular purpose, 
     <lb/>would greatly change, the present con<lb break="no"/>dition of matters. No man can look  
     <lb/>into the vista of the future and say 
     <lb/>what they will spend on public works 
     <lb/>during the next fifteen years. It is 
     <lb/>only a farce on his part, where he 
     <lb/>attempts to do so. I am surprised at 
     <lb/>the want of prudence and  knowledge 
     <lb/>of our Colonial affairs which charac<lb break="no"/>terizes the present minority. If we 
     <lb/>go to Ottawa on our risk, we shall 
     <lb/>convict them of short-sightedness, 
     <lb/>which will place them in a ridiculous 
     <lb/>position before the country. Suppose 
     <lb/>we can bring $4000 for $5000 per 
     <lb/>year, in addition to the present Terms, 
     <lb/>will not the people thank us for ob<lb break="no"/>taining it, and saving them from so 
     <lb/>much local taxation ? We have not, 
     <lb/>in the present Terms, sufficient to 
     <lb/>carry on the business of the country, 
     <lb/>and as this will be our last opportunity 
     <lb/>to obtain still better Terms, we shall 
     <lb/>be censured by the people if we do 
     <lb/>not improve it. The hon. Junior mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Belfast has got so rich from 
     <lb/>the Queen's printership, that a thou<lb break="no"/>sand or two dollars are nothing at all 
     <lb/>in his sight, and our little Lighthouses, 
     <lb/>Breakwaters and Drill Sheds, are, in 
     <lb/>his estimation, not worth mentioning. 
     <lb/>Everything down here is only a two 
     <lb/>penny halfpenny affair in his eyes, 
     <lb/>According to his calculations when 
     <lb/>they spend more than they receive in 
     <lb/>the Dominion, all they have to do is 
     <lb/>to charge it to "Capital Account." 
     <lb/>That is surely a splendid way to get 
     <lb/>clear of debt!   He says that the In<lb break="no"/>tercolonial Railway cost $20,000,000, 
     <lb/>that so much was spent, and that ten 
     <lb/>millions were carried over and charged 
     <lb/>to Capital Account.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCNE1">MR. McNEILL</persName> said it was not right 
     <lb/>
    to keep the people in suspense respect<lb break="no"/>ing what the intention of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment is. It appeared to him they had 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
         
     no objections to the Laird-Haythorne 
     <lb/>
     Terms, the only real objection being 
     <lb/>
     that they did not originate with his 
     <lb/>
     honor, the Leader of the Government 
     <lb/>
     himself. He did hope the Govern-, 
     <lb/>
     ment would have brought down a 
     <lb/>
     resolution which he could have sup<lb break="no"/>ported. He felt, however, that a 
     <lb/>
     healthy opposition was of much ser<lb break="no"/>vice to a country, as it kept a Govern<lb break="no"/>ment up more closely to the line of 
     <lb/>
     duty it should follow. Arguments 
     <lb/>
     were brought forward to show that the 
     <lb/>
     Terms offered are not sufficient. He 
     <lb/>
     is willing to admit that if our situation 
     <lb/>
     as a Colony was the same as it was a 
     <lb/>
     few years ago, he would much rather 
     <lb/>
     not unite with the Dominion. But 
     <lb/>
     the circumstances of the Colony have 
     <lb/>
     so changed, that it is unreasonable to 
     <lb/>
     expect that better Terms can be had. 
     <lb/>
     If, however, he took a wrong view of 
     <lb/>
     the matter, and by the vote he feels it 
     <lb/>
     his duty to record in the matter, 
     <lb/>
     should thereby do an injustice to his 
     <lb/>
     constituents, he would be sorry. It 
     <lb/>
     might be possible that the cost of the 
     <lb/>
     public works of Canada were under 
     <lb/>
     valued, and if so it would form the 
     <lb/>
     basis of a good argument in favor of 
     <lb/>
     better Terms ; and if so, no doubt the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion will deal justly with us. 
     <lb/>
     But up to the present moment the 
     <lb/>
     Government have not shown any 
     <lb/>
     reason why further coacessions should 
     <lb/>
     be made. If the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Bedeque will bring forward a resolu<lb break="no"/>tion, based upon arguments which will 
     <lb/>
     show that we can raise sufficient of  
     <lb/>
     Revenue to meet the demands of the 
     <lb/>
     Colony, he (Mr. McNeill) may yet 
     <lb/>
     support it. There can only be a cer<lb break="no"/>tain amount of duty raised from our 
     <lb/>
     Imports. We would next have to 
     <lb/>
     levy an increased tax upon real estate. 
     <lb/>
     If the hon. member is prepared to go 
     <lb/>
     to his constituents with such a pro<lb break="no"/>position, then he is right, but for his 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. McNeill) part, he could not ob<lb break="no"/>tain the consent of his constituents for 
     <lb/>
     levying such a tax. The resolution is
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="1873-05-01_Page_142"

     not such an one as he expected would 
     <lb/>
     have been tabled. But he did hope 
     <lb/>
     his honor would have brought forward 
     <lb/>
     one in favor of a branch line of Rail<lb break="no"/>road to Rustico. Instead of that he 
     <lb/>
     came forward with arguments in favor 
     <lb/>
     of pay for Drill Sheds, Barracks, and 
     <lb/>
     Lighthouses. Well, if we can get any 
     <lb/>
     allowance for these he would be glad. 
     <lb/>
     It would be always so much. If, how<lb break="no"/>ever, we give the delegates the power 
     <lb/>
     they ask for, we will, by that resolu<lb break="no"/>tion, be bound to support whatever 
     <lb/>
     Terms they may agree to, and if they 
     <lb/>
     take the Railway as a local work, it 
     <lb/>
     would be ruinous to the Colony. He 
     <lb/>
     would not say there is any disposition 
     <lb/>
     on the part of the Government to do 
     <lb/>
     anything of the kind. He knew his 
     <lb/>
     constituents had a horror of the Rail<lb break="no"/>road, and will not support any resolu<lb break="no"/>tion which empowers the delegates to 
     <lb/>
     agree to such Terms as they please, 
     <lb/>
     and then be bound to support them as 
     <lb/>
     those will who vote for the resolution 
     <lb/>
     of the Leader of the Government. 
     <lb/>
     He, however, had no wish to throw 
     <lb/>
     any unnecessary obstacles in the way, 
     <lb/>
     believing as he did, that the sooner 
     <lb/>
     the matter is settled the better.

     it is not my intention to trouble you 
     <lb/>
     with any lengthy remarks, as I ex<lb break="no"/>pressed my views pretty freely when 
     <lb/>
     his honor the Speaker was in the 
     <lb/>
     chair, and, therefore, shall not repeat 
     <lb/>
     what I said on that occasion. In the 
     <lb/>
     resolution and amendment before us 
     <lb/>
     there are, however, phases of thought 
     <lb/>
     which I shall briefly notice. I regret 
     <lb/>
     that the Leader on the independent 
     <lb/>
     benches of this committee, has not seen 
     <lb/>
     fit to table the resolution he says he is 
     <lb/>
     going to submit. As the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man professes to be an out and out no 
     <lb/>
     Terms man, I should like to see his 
     <lb/>
     resolution and hear the arguments by 
     <lb/>
     which he intends to support it. I am 
     <lb/>
     glad that, to some extent, this debate 
     <lb/>
     has been carried on with some defer<lb break="no"/>
          
            <cb/>
      
      ence to that decorum which is due to 
     <lb/>
     the position we occupy here, and, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, regret the impropriety of 
     <lb/>
     some remarks indulged in here last 
     <lb/>
     night. The explanations made by my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from New London, respect<lb break="no"/>ing that letter of his, should have been 
     <lb/>
     received as ample, to prevent the 
     <lb/>
     tirade of language it called forth last 
     <lb/>
     night, when reference was made to 
     <lb/>
     that incident. His honor the Leader 
     <lb/>
     of the Government said he had no 
     <lb/>
     respect for anything which might be 
     <lb/>
     said by the hon. member for Murray 
     <lb/>
     Harbor. I can assure the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man I have just as much contempt for 
     <lb/>
     his opinions. But, Mr. Chairman, as 
     <lb/>
     I said before, this is a question which 
     <lb/>
     lifts itself above that which is partizan 
     <lb/>
     or personal. When I reflect that our 
     <lb/>
     local constitution will soon cease, that 
     <lb/>
     whether we look to the past, the pre<lb break="no"/>sent or the future, there is undoubtedly 
     <lb/>
     much in the question before us to call 
     <lb/>
     for earnest attention and due consider<lb break="no"/>ation. If the hon. gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     purpose going up as delegates, and 
     <lb/>
     who ask to be supported by such a 
     <lb/>
     resolution, carry it, and fail in securing 
     <lb/>
     even as good Terms as those already 
     <lb/>
     offered, we would then regret that our 
     <lb/>
     indiscretion led us to adopt such a 
     <lb/>
     course. But if we agree to bestow 
     <lb/>
     the power on the delegates which this 
     <lb/>
     resolution asks, we will be bound to 
     <lb/>
     accept them, even though they might 
     <lb/>
     be as good as those now offered. In<lb break="no"/>stead, however, of the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     supporting his resolution with argu<lb break="no"/>ments bearing upon the important 
     <lb/>
     interests involved, he attempts to sneer 
     <lb/>
     at what he was pleased to call the 
     <lb/>
     dash away policy of the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for New London, and although the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member denied the correctness of 
     <lb/>
     the construction put upon his words, 
     <lb/>
     showing that it had no connection with 
     <lb/>
     the context, and demanded that his 
     <lb/>
     letter be produced, or the construction 
     <lb/>
     put upon it be withdrawn, yet neither 
     <lb/>
     was done. When so reasonable and 
     <lb/>
           
          
            
      <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw> <fw type="num">143</fw> 
     <lb/>
            
   
          
     just a demand was made, and not com<lb break="no"/>plied with, it was very unfair and un<lb break="no"/>gentlemanly to insist upon the inter<lb break="no"/>pretation put upon the words of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member. I find that great credit 
     <lb/>
     is claimed for the certificate of charac<lb break="no"/>ter given to the Government which 
     <lb/>carried the Railway Bill, in the Re<lb break="no"/>port of the inspecting Engineers. The 
     <lb/>hon. member claims that the charges 
     <lb/>made against that Government are 
     <lb/>not ratified by the Report. I think 
     <lb/>the charges made against them are 
     <lb/>ratified. They were charged with 
     <lb/>letting the contract in an unbusiness 
     <lb/>like manner, and in a way which 
     <lb/>allowed the contractors unnecessarily 
     <lb/>to lengthen the road, for their own 
     <lb/>benefit, at the expense of the country. 
     <lb/>And the difference arose as to the loss 
     <lb/>which the country would really sus<lb break="no"/>tain by this omission of attention to 
     <lb/>the interests of the people on the part 
     <lb/>of the Government when letting the 
     <lb/>contract for the main line. Now on 
     <lb/>that point the Engineers give a de<lb break="no"/>cided answer. They say :— "The 
     <lb/>manner of letting the contract, viz., at 
     <lb/>a certain price per mile, instead of at a 
     <lb/>fixed price between given points, and 
     <lb/>over a staked out line, we think is the 
     <lb/>cause of the differences which have 
     <lb/>arisen between the Government, the 
     <lb/>Government Engineer, and the con<lb break="no"/>tractors." Now, I ask what is there 
     <lb/>in these words to show that they did 
     <lb/>right ? Do they not prove the cor<lb break="no"/>rectness of the charges which we pre<lb break="no"/>ferred against them for the way in 
     <lb/>which they let the contract? They say 
     <lb/>it was the " cause of the difference " 
     <lb/>which arose, and if they are willing to 
     <lb/>take that as a justification of their 
     <lb/>conduct, then all I have to say is may 
     <lb/>God help them. The hon. member 
     <lb/>did not reply to the able arguments of 
     <lb/>my hon. friend the Leader of the Op<lb break="no"/>position. Instead of arguing the ques<lb break="no"/>tion out upon its merits, the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber descended to abuse. He says the 
     <lb/>House should have been called to 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
         
     meet, and the situation of the Colony 
     <lb/>
     considered before delegates were sent 
     <lb/>
     to Canada ; and that the Terms, upon 
     <lb/>
     which the Colony would consent to 
     <lb/>
     enter into Confederation should 
     <lb/>
     have been first submitted to the House. 
     <lb/>
     But what is the hon. member now 
     <lb/>
     doing? He brings forward a resolu<lb break="no"/>tion which asks for extension powers, 
     <lb/>
     while he refuses to say what Terms 
     <lb/>
     they intend to look for themselves. I 
     <lb/>
     contend the late Government did right 
     <lb/>
     in the course they pursued. There 
     <lb/>
     are times and occasions when all the 
     <lb/>
     information in the possession of a 
     <lb/>
     Government, should not be made pub<lb break="no"/>lic. Had the Terms entered into by 
     <lb/>
     the delegates been made known when 
     <lb/>
     concluded, the Opposition might have 
     <lb/>
     used them as a means for overthrowing 
     <lb/>
     the present minority at Ottawa. At 
     <lb/>
     the meeting held at Centerville, last 
     <lb/>
     year, the hon. member thought it 
     <lb/>
     would be a good speculation to rent 
     <lb/>
     the Railway. If he entertains the 
     <lb/>
     same views still, he, when he goes up 
     <lb/>
     to Ottawa, may conclude to take the 
     <lb/>
    road and work it for ourselves as a 
     <lb/>local work. The hon. Leader of the 
     <lb/>Opposition very wisely enquired what 
     <lb/>they intended to do in that matter, but 
     <lb/>received no reply. I look upon the 
     <lb/>resolution as containing a principle 
     <lb/>which should not be conceded. I am 
     <lb/>astonished that the hon member 
     <lb/>for Tryon should think of supporting 
     <lb/>it. I am surprised to think the hon. 
     <lb/>member should for a moment think of 
     <lb/>supporting it. Will he do so and go 
     <lb/>against the pledge given to his con<lb break="no"/>stituents ? I believe notwithstanding 
     <lb/>the pledge of the hon. member, he 
     <lb/>will hold on to the Government so 
     <lb/>long as in doing so he can clear the 
     <lb/>tails of his own skirts. I ask the hon. 
     <lb/>gentleman if he would be willing to 
     <lb/>take the Railway and run it as a local 
     <lb/>work at a loss of $50,000 a year ? I 
     <lb/>did expect his honor the Leader of the 
     <lb/>Government when he came down with 
     <lb/>his resolution would have told us what 
     <lb/>

     the Terms are which he is going to    
     <lb/>demand of Canada. But on the con<lb break="no"/>trary, he treats the committee as if we<lb/>were little school boys, and unworthy<lb/>of having such information communi<lb break="no"/>cated to us. If the hon. member from<lb/>Bedeque will keep clear of the<lb/>troubled waters before him, he will<lb/>not think of voting for that resolution.<lb/>I know if we go into Confederation<lb/>we will not realize as large an amount<lb/>of impost duty as we do now.

     Showing that had we been in Con<lb break="no"/>federation in 1871, we would have re<lb break="no"/>ceived $50,622 less than we did.<lb/>Perhaps the senior member for<lb/>Bedeque has not duly looked into this<lb/>phase of of the subject. I believe the<lb/>time is not far distant when our im<lb break="no"/>portations from the Dominion will be<lb/>three times what it is at the present<lb/>time. It is encouraging that notwith<lb break="no"/>standing the outlay of money in Can<lb break="no"/>ada, for the building and extension of<lb/>canals, the Intercolonial Railroad, and<lb/>other important and costly public<lb/>works, taken in connection with the<lb/>fact that they were put to the expense<lb/>of repelling, within the past few years.<lb/>two invasions, yet her heneral taxa<lb break="no"/>tion has not increased more than about<lb/>one dollar a head above the increase<lb/> <lb/>True, large public works are yet in<lb/>the course of construction, while the<lb/>Pacific Railroad and other public<lb/>works have not been commenced.<lb/>Still I do not think we should look<lb/>upon those vast undertakings with any<lb/>alarm or dread. The population of<lb/>Canada will go on increasing.

I believe my hon. friend, the<lb/>junior member of New London, did<lb/>not overstrain the argument when he<lb/>said that in looking forward ten years<lb/>he saw that magnificant country peo<lb break="no"/>pled with agriculturists, artizans, and<lb/>laborers, to an extent now little<lb/>thought of. Yes, when its resources<lb/>become fully developed, it will become<lb/>a great and powerful country. it is<lb/>now but arising, as it were, to take<lb/>possession of her vast, rich and various<lb/>resources, and were I to enlarge to a<lb/>greater extent in depicting her future,<lb/>I feel I would still not overestimate<lb/>what will yet be realized. It is true,<lb/>

          some years ago I apposed Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. I did so then because we were<lb/>not laboring under a heavy debt. Then<lb/>I saw that our farmers were getting<lb/>rich, and our trade doubling itself<lb/>every seven years. I saw a prosperity<lb/>among our people which a few years<lb/>ago would have been regarded as<lb/>fabulous. But, Sir, when I saw that<lb/>fine picture married and blotted by a<lb/>measure which imposed a burden so<lb/>much heavier than this Island could<lb/>bear, or our people support, I thought<lb/>it became every man to do what in<lb/>him lay, to present such a measure<lb/>being thrust upon the country. But<lb/>it was carried, and the result is that<lb/>our only escape lay in a union with<lb/>Canada. In all honesty and candor I<lb/>call upon the hon. member for Bedeque<lb/>to show how they propose raising an<lb/>increased Revenue of $200,000 ? for<lb/>if their proposition is feasible, I may<lb/>be yet induced to support it. As re<lb break="no"/>gards the hon member, the Leader of<lb/>the Government, I find in looking over<lb/>the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Parliamentary Reporter</hi> for 1871,<lb/>that hon. Mr. Pope is reported to have<lb/>said : " He had carefully considered<lb/>the question, and firmly believed that<lb/>not more than £12,000 would be, in<lb/>any one year, drawn from the Colony<lb/>for interest ; the balance would re<lb break="no"/>main in the country, and that instead<lb/>of draining the resources of the Colony,<lb/>it would make money more plenty, and<lb/>give an impetus to the trade of the<lb/>Colony never before experienced ; so<lb/>that he thought the hon. member for<lb/>New London, with all his acknow<lb break="no"/>ledged ability and shrewdness, would<lb/>yet find that his calculations were not<lb/>reliable." I do not know whether the<lb/>hon. gentleman had given due consid<lb break="no"/>eration to the subject, but it does ap<lb break="no"/>pear that his arguments carried the<lb/>House along with him at that time,<lb/>therefore it was that they should now<lb/>look at his arguments with a good<lb/>deal of suspicion. I say, Sir, his<lb/>honor the Leader of the Government<lb/>drew a fine picture of the state of the<lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     Colony then. According to his theory 
     <lb/>half of the capital for the construction<lb/>of the road would be obtained here, so<lb/>that but half of the interest of the debt<lb/>would be drawn off the Island. But<lb/>when I find that instead of $40,000<lb/>being required to pay the interest due<lb/>abroad, we have to send away $130,<lb break="no"/>000, so that the prosperity anticipated<lb/>by the hon. gentleman has not been<lb/>realized, therefore we have no right to<lb/>expect that we can attain to it now.<lb/>If we remain out of Confederation our<lb/>tariff will have to be raised much<lb/>higher. It is much higher now than<lb/>it is in the Dominion. The average<lb/>duty in Canada is not more than 10<lb/>per cent, while ours is 12 per cent. I<lb/>may state that I believe every gentle<lb break="no"/>man on this hon. committee regards it<lb/>the duty of every man here to vote for<lb/>for the present Terms, therefore, when<lb/>we are called upon to give our assent<lb/>to a resolution in favor of sending up<lb/>another delegation to ask for better<lb/>Terms, we should have some data<lb/>given, upon which to found a claim for<lb/>better Terms, or otherwise we will<lb/>but stulify ourselves if we vote for it.<lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:HOWA1">MR.

Therefore, I prefer<lb/>that the delegates to up and see if<lb/>better Terms can be had. If it does<lb/>no more, it will keep us our that much<lb/>longer.

     man has drawn of Canada? He has put 
     <lb/>
     his arguments forward in very glowing 
     <lb/>
     language, and arrayed the Dominion in 
     <lb/>
     fine colors. I agree with him that in 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion they raise much of their 
     <lb/>
     Revenue through their municipal insti<lb break="no"/>tutions, and if we unite with them we 
     <lb/>
     shall have to resort to the same means 
     <lb/>
     of raising the funds we will require 
     <lb/>
     for local purposes. Therefore, I can<lb break="no"/>not see any difference between increas<lb break="no"/>ing our taxation now under our present 
     <lb/>
     form of constitution, and resorting to 
     <lb/>
     direct taxation when we have handed 
     <lb/>
     the power we now possess over to the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Government. And how are 
     <lb/>
     we to know what the tariff of Canada 
     <lb/>
     will be in the future ? Will any one 
     <lb/>
     for a moment suppose the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the Dominion can exist and 
     <lb/>
     do the business of the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     of Canada without a Revenue ? Why 
     <lb/>
     they are building Railroads and other 
     <lb/>
     expensive works, which will be a drag 
     <lb/>
     upon their Government for many a 
     <lb/>
     day, and for these we undoubtedly 
     <lb/>
     will have to be taxed. I, for one, do 
     <lb/>
     not believe we are justified in going so 
     <lb/>
     hastily into this matter. I understand 
     <lb/>
     the resolution and also the amendment. 
     <lb/>
     I would like to spend my days under 
     <lb/>
     the constitution we have, but if it has 
     <lb/>
     come to this that we have no alterna<lb break="no"/>tive but union with Canada, then by 
     <lb/>
     all means let us try and obtain Terms 
     <lb/>
     which will enable us to get along with<lb break="no"/>out having to resort to local taxation. 
     <lb/>
     If they no not obtain better Terms in 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick, I believe the whole 
     <lb/>
     thing will yet burst up. The con<lb break="no"/>tractors would only be too glad to give 
     <lb/>
     up the branches, if asked to do so, and 
     <lb/>
     we could meet, with due care and 
     <lb/>
     management, the liabilities of the 
     <lb/>
     main line. I ran my election on the 
     <lb/>
     anti-Confederate ticket, without any 
     <lb/>
     side issues. I said that I respected 
     <lb/>
     the late Government, but that their 
     <lb/>
     action on the question of Corfedera<lb break="no"/>tion had separated me from them, and 
     <lb/>
     that when I came here I would have 
     <lb/>
    to oppose them.

     Why, Sir, I am perfectly astonished to 
     <lb/>
     think the hon. gentleman, the Leader 
     <lb/>
     of the Opposition, should come forward 
     <lb/>
     here and attempt to twit any hon. 
     <lb/>
     member of the committee with incon<lb break="no"/>sistency, for if there is a public man 
     <lb/>
     in this Colony who has turned more 
     <lb/>
     political somersaults than another, it 
     <lb/>
     is the hon. member for Belfast. I 
     <lb/>
     fully concur in the opinion of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     colleague, and believe it is admitted 
     <lb/>
     by men of as much financial ability as 
     <lb/>
     any in this Colony, that we might, if 
     <lb/>
     so disposed, succeed in meeting our 
     <lb/>
     liabilities, while retaining our present 
     <lb/>
     form of Government. I believe if we 
     <lb/>
     issued small Debentures, for ten years, 
     <lb/>
     at seven and a half per cent, that quite 
     <lb/>
     a number of them would be taken up 
     <lb/>
     by the wealthy farmers and other men 
     <lb/>
     of means in this Island. I am per<lb break="no"/>suaded many of them could, in this 
     <lb/>
     way, easily be disposed of to men of 
     <lb/>
     limited capital, who would readily in<lb break="no"/>vest their money in such Government 
     <lb/>
     securities. Such a mode of raising 
     <lb/>
     money for the immediate require<lb break="no"/>ments of the country would have been 
     <lb/>
     much more successful, and honorable, 
     <lb/>
     than that of sending the Colonial 
     <lb/>
     Secretary to Halifax to bring down 
     <lb/>
     the credit of the Colony in the man<lb break="no"/>ner he did, by attempting to sell our 
     <lb/>
     Debentures in that market. When I 
     <lb/>
     contrast the arguments of the junior 
     <lb/>
     member for Belfast with those he 
     <lb/>
     used in 1867, shortly after the Colo<lb break="no"/>nies became united, I feel surprised. 
     <lb/>
               In the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Patriot</hi> of the 19th of Septem<lb break="no"/>ber, 1867, he says: " In this Colony 
     <lb/>
     we have as yet the right to regulate 
     <lb/>
     our own taxes, and the privilige of 
     <lb/>
    appropriating these taxes for our bene<lb break="no"/>fit. The two sister Provinces. have  
     <lb/>lost these priceless blessings. Nova 
     <lb/>Scotia and New Brunswick can hence<lb break="no"/>forth be taxed by a Canadian majority, 
     <lb/>obtained it may be, through the most  
     <lb/>shameless bribery and  corruption.  
     <lb/>The levying and appropriation of the  
     <lb/>taxes are as important to the well 
     <lb/>
           
            
          <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw> <fw type="num"> 147</fw>
           
     being of a country as liberty of speech 
     <lb/>
     and freedom of the press." The hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman has told us also in his paper, 
     <lb/>
     that if we went into the Dominion our 
     <lb/>
     taxes would run up to £40 a family. 
     <lb/>
     Quoting also from his paper of the 
     <lb/>
     14th September, 1867, he says that in 
     <lb/>
     the matter of taxation "the weaker 
     <lb/>
     party must go to the wall," adding, 
     <lb/>
               " The Toronto <hi rendition="simple:italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>, a 
     <lb/>
     ministerial paper, in a recent issue said : 
     <lb/>
    'If Confederation does nothing else  
     <lb/>for us, it will at all events give us 
     <lb/>another governing body, with the 
     <lb/>power of imposing taxes, and yet we 
     <lb/>believe that if there was one thing 
     <lb/>more than another that Ontario could 
     <lb/>at the present moment dispense with, 
     <lb/>it is an addition to the taxing power. 
     <lb/>For, in the country, as it is, we have  
     <lb/>federal legislation and local legislation, 
     <lb/>and County Councillors, and Township 
     <lb/>Councillors, and School Trustees, all 
     <lb/>taxing or about taxing us at the same 
     <lb/>time, and in the cities we have the 
     <lb/>City Council, who is equal in taxing 
     <lb/>ability to County Councillors and 
     <lb/>Township Councillors together. We 
     <lb/>have thus five taxing powers.' " He 
     <lb/>then goes on to say that if we went 
     <lb/>into the Dominion, " taxation must in<lb break="no"/>crease. In Canada, where the peo<lb break="no"/>ple pay to the Government 25s. per 
     <lb/>head over and above large sums taken 
     <lb/>out of their pockets by Councillors and 
     <lb/>School Trustees, what would be the 
     <lb/>fate of Prince Edward Island, where 
     <lb/>there are no County and Township 
     <lb/>taxes, and where the whole public 
     <lb/>service is but 15s. or 16s. a head ? 
     <lb/>To this Colony Confederation means 
     <lb/>increasing our taxes two fold without 
     <lb/>any corresponding advantage." How 
     <lb/>comes it now that the hon. member 
     <lb/>has changed his views so suddenly ? 
     <lb/>Perhaps he has been bribed in order 
     <lb/>that he might attain a position among 
     <lb/>the Canadian swells and pedlars 
     <lb/>(order.) Surrendering the power of 
     <lb/>levying our own taxes to others, with  
     <lb/>absolute power to levy as much upon 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     us as they chose, is an important 
     <lb/>
     consideration. We may probably ob<lb break="no"/>tain as much as for the present may 
     <lb/>
     meet our local wants, but we have no 
     <lb/>
     idea of what will be imposed upon us 
     <lb/>
     in the future. By uniting with the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion we will become responsible  
     <lb/>
     in the future for one million dollars 
     <lb/>
     more than we owe at present. There 
     <lb/>
     is no country in the world where, in 
     <lb/>
     proportion to its population, they build 
     <lb/>
     so many costly public works as they 
     <lb/>
     do in Canada. The Ministry are 
     <lb/>
     forced into these in order to enable 
     <lb/>
     them to keep in power. We have the 
     <lb/>
     authority of Judge Wilmot for saying 
     <lb/>
     that Confederation in New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
     was brought about by means of a 
     <lb/>
     Fenian raid. I expect they took some 
     <lb/>
     important lessons from the junior 
     <lb/>
     member for Belfast before they set out 
     <lb/>
     on their expedition. (Laughter.) 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick is now dissatisfied 
     <lb/>
     with her condition, and is seeking for 
     <lb/>
     better Terms. This I look upon as a 
     <lb/>
     deplorable condition for any people to 
     <lb/>
     be in, after having, by their own act, 
     <lb/>
     deprived themselves of the important 
     <lb/>
     power and privilege of self govern<lb break="no"/>ment. The hon. gentlemen of the 
     <lb/>
     Opposition are fond of referring to the 
     <lb/>
     members who, as they say, occupy the 
     <lb/>
     independent benches. But Sir, we 
     <lb/>
     have taken our stand on this question, 
     <lb/>
     and shall hold to it. It does appear to 
     <lb/>
     me, however, that the whole of the 
     <lb/>
    Opposition feel that their seats may  
     <lb/>now be looked upon as holding those 
     <lb/>who occupy the penitential benches. 
     <lb/>They are anxious that I should bring 
     <lb/>down my Budget. The junior mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Belfast, and the learned mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Murray Harbor were anxious 
     <lb/>to see it. They would rather refer to 
     <lb/>almost anything than another delega<lb break="no"/>tion to Ottawa, so well convinced 
     <lb/>are they that if it succeeds in getting 
     <lb/>a few thousand dollars more that it 
     <lb/>would be their political death. Hence 
     <lb/>they have Spoken against time. If 
     <lb/>the arguments of the junior member

     for Belfast were good in 1867, it be<lb break="no"/>comes him to show why the same 
     <lb/>
     reasoning does not afford ground for a 
     <lb/>
     good argument in 1873? The late 
     <lb/>
     Government fought their way to power 
     <lb/>
     by a skillful use of the weapons of 
     <lb/>
     deflection. The edge of their arms 
     <lb/>
     have become somewhat blunted, and 
     <lb/>
     having had a taste of the sweets of 
     <lb/>
     office, and the political loaves and 
     <lb/>
     fishes upon which they regaled them<lb break="no"/>selves during the past year, they would 
     <lb/>
     resort to any means to retain them. 
     <lb/>
     Had they, when they came into power, 
     <lb/>
     said to the eastern members that they 
     <lb/>
     could not sustain the proposition for 
     <lb/>
     building the branch lines, and if by so 
     <lb/>
     doing found themselves in a minority, 
     <lb/>
     an appeal to the people would have 
     <lb/>
     placed them in a better position than 
     <lb/>
     they ever did, or are likely to occupy.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOWA1">MR. HOWATT</persName>.—The learned mem<lb break="no"/>ber from Murray Harbor wished to 
     <lb/>
     know if the members on the independ<lb break="no"/>ent benches would vote for the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion, and expressed the Opinion that if 
     <lb/>
     we did we would not understand what 
     <lb/>
     we were doing? But the learned 
     <lb/>
     gentleman is himself in that position, 
     <lb/>
     for he cannot tell what the tariff of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion will be in a few years, or 
     <lb/>
     even next year, After Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     got in, every exertion possible to use 
     <lb/>
     to get out again, was resorted to, but 
     <lb/>
     in vain. Why should the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man wish to drive us in so hastily? 
     <lb/>
     He would like to know positively what 
     <lb/>
     the actual debt of the Dominion is ; 
     <lb/>
     also, whether the debt of our Railway 
     <lb/>
     will be higher than it has been placed 
     <lb/>
     at? He understood the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     was only bound to assume three and a 
     <lb/>
     quarter millions as our Railway debt. 
     <lb/>
     This is a question which should be 
     <lb/>
     fairly considered. We may say we 
     <lb/>
     will not have to tax ourselves unless 
     <lb/>
     we chose, but if driven into that posi<lb break="no"/>tion, we might not be able to help our<lb break="no"/>selves. It is the duty of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to reject the Terms brought down. 
     <lb/>We do not know what another year 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
          
     may do for us. It is ruinous to jump 
     <lb/>
     so rashly into a position from which 
     <lb/>
     we can never retrieve ourselves. He 
     <lb/>
     would sooner go in for the dash away 
     <lb/>
     policy. Yes, let us tax ourselves, and 
     <lb/>
     pay our debts like honest men. We 
     <lb/>
     should not go begging at the door of 
     <lb/>
     Canada as if this was an Island of 
     <lb/>
     paupers. He was willing that the 
     <lb/>
     farmers should bear their full share of 
     <lb/>
     the burden. Charlottetown should 
     <lb/>
     also pay in proportion to its wealth, for 
     <lb/>
     he did not believe in taxing, the coun<lb break="no"/>try while the town went soot free. 
     <lb/>
     There had been too much of that al<lb break="no"/>ready, besides it was the town which 
     <lb/>
     brought this trouble upon us. He felt 
     <lb/>
     confident if we were all willing, that a 
     <lb/>
     tax, not overburdensome, might be im<lb break="no"/>posed which would enable us to retain 
     <lb/>
     our constitution and work out our own 
     <lb/>
     destiny. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAIR2">MR. LAIRD</persName> thought the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers on the independent benches were 
     <lb/>
     exceedingly anxious to keep some of 
     <lb/>
     the Opposition on the penitential 
     <lb/>
     benches. (Laughter.) Indeed he 
     <lb/>
     thought there had been quite recently 
     <lb/>
     an acquisition to their number, and 
     <lb/>
     that there were three independent 
     <lb/>
     members, although one might be claim<lb break="no"/>ed as belonging to the sleeping 
     <lb/>
     benches. (Laughter.) No doubt 
     <lb/>
     many would take it as a blessing if 
     <lb/>
     the number of the latter class was 
     <lb/>
     larger. He wished merely to correct 
     <lb/>
     some errors which the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     had fallen into.  He  thinks the Do<lb break="no"/>minion, on account of our Railway 
     <lb/>
     debt, have but to assume three and a 
     <lb/>
     quarter millions. This is a mistake. 
     <lb/>
     The words are, they are to assume the 
     <lb/>
     whole of that debt. If the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man will look at the Terms they read 
     <lb/>
    thus : "The Railways under contract 
     <lb/>and in course of construction for the 
     <lb/>Island Government, shall be the pro<lb break="no"/>perty of Canada." This it will be 
     <lb/>seen covers the whole cost of the main 
     <lb/>line and branches. A good deal has 
     <lb/>been said about the delegation now go<lb break="no"/>
           
           
            <fw type="dateline">1873</fw> <fw type="running">PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER.</fw> <fw type="num">149</fw> 
     <lb/>
            
   
         
     
     ing up to Ottawa. Well, what are they  
     <lb/>going up for ? One hon. gentleman<lb/>wants a branch line to Rustico. He<lb/>agreed in that opinion. Another<lb/>
     
     
     thinks there should be a branch to 
     <lb/>
     Belfast, as their Queen's Printer is 
     <lb/>
     taking Rustico in charge, he would not 
     <lb/>
     object. Perhaps, the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     from that place will support the reso<lb break="no"/>lution if they agree to that. If they 
     <lb/>
     were asked to promise a branch to 
     <lb/>
    Belfast they would probably not com<lb break="no"/>ply. Yet they. in this resolution, ask 
     <lb/>this committee for its unqualified sup<lb break="no"/>port in a matter conferring upon the 
     <lb/>delegation extraordinary powers,which 
     <lb/>every member sppporting the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion will be called upon to affirm on 
     <lb/>their return. It is clear the junior 
     <lb/>member for Bedeque has been study<lb break="no"/>ing the Patriot. If he studied it more 
     <lb/>it would not do him the least harm. 
     <lb/>Even now it helps him along with his 
     <lb/>speech. That five horse power he 
     <lb/>there discovered, has helped him along<lb/>wonderfully. No argument whatever 
     <lb/>has been brought forward to show that 
     <lb/>it is other than an act of folly, to send 
     <lb/>up another delegation to ask for better 
     <lb/>Terms. By the Terms offered we 
     <lb/>can carry on the Government, and 
     <lb/>manage to carry on the local Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the Colony without having to 
     <lb/>resort to Municipal or County taxation. 
     <lb/>In Ontario and the other Provinces, 
     <lb/>they have to tax, themselves for edu<lb break="no"/>cation. He (Mr. L.) had long been 
     <lb/>an admirer of the system of education 
     <lb/>in Ontario. In every respect it is<lb/>highly creditable to them. From the 
     <lb/>small common Day School, up to the 
     <lb/>finest Seminaries and Colleges, their 
     <lb/>system is excellent ; and nearly all the 
     <lb/>money required for keeping these in<lb break="no"/>stitutions in operation is borne by the 
     <lb/>local institutions of the country. No<lb break="no"/>thing can be more creditable to their<lb/>patriotism and intelligence than the<lb/>manner in which they give attention<lb/>to these matters. He had been through<lb/>them and saw a detailed statement of<lb/>
           
   
      
            <cb/>
          
     the items which formed matter for 
     <lb/>
    levying a school tax. When these are 
     <lb/>all known, the cost is estimated, and a 
     <lb/>tax levied upon the  inhabitants to raise 
     <lb/>the amount required. For years to 
     <lb/>come we will not require to resort to 
     <lb/>direct taxation for these purposes. 
     <lb/>The day, however, may arrive when 
     <lb/>our Grammar Schools may become 
     <lb/>small Academies, but by that time he 
     <lb/>hoped the people would gradually be<lb break="no"/>come willing and able to bear the 
     <lb/>increased tax which their support will 
     <lb/>require. If, however, we do not go in 
     <lb/>we will require to levy a tax of at 
     <lb/>least ten shillings a head for every 
     <lb/>man, woman and child, in the Colony.

     <lb/>
     since we are brought into the posi<lb break="no"/>tion we are, saw no other alternative. 
     <lb/>
     At the same time, he would like to 
     <lb/>
     see the Island get as good Terms as 
     <lb/>
     possible, and would support the reso<lb break="no"/>lution were it not that the latter part 
     <lb/>
     of it bound these who voted for it to 
     <lb/>
     vote also for such Terms as the dele<lb break="no"/>gates may agree to. Before he would 
     <lb/>
     bind himself to anything of the kind he 
     <lb/>
     would like first to see the Terms. He 
     <lb/>
     thought the last four lines in the reso<lb break="no"/>lution had no right there ; the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion as a whole was such as he could

     vote for it will be bound to support

     such Terms as the delegates may bring

     they may be to the Colony. At the

     against the interests of the Colony.

     But under all the circumstances he

     thought it better to let the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment know that if they do not succeed

     in bringing better Terms  down, he 
     <lb/>
      would be at liberty to vote against

     <persName ref="pers:YEO2">Mr.  JAMES YEO</persName> said he was re<lb break="no"/>turned to support the Terms brought 
     <lb/>
     down by Mr. Laird.  The Terms were 
     <lb/>
     honestly and fairly laid before the 
     <lb/>
     people. As they are asking that an<lb break="no"/>other delegation be sent to Ottawa, 
     <lb/>
     before he (Mr. Yeo) would support 
     <lb/>
      any such a resolution, he would just 
     <lb/>
     like to know what the Terms are 
     <lb/>
     which they expect to receive, and who 
     <lb/>
     the delegates are that are to be ap<lb break="no"/>pointed ? The hon.  member for 
     <lb/>Alberton should not find fault with<lb/>
     
     the late Government for building the 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
         
     Branch   Lines. He took good care  
     <lb/>
      when he was in   power to have the 
     <lb/>
     line brought to his   own door, and ought 
     <lb/>
     not to object  to other people obtaining 
     <lb/>
        the same privileges. Something had  
     <lb/>
     been said about his opposing Captain   
     <lb/>
      Richards. His  opinion was, that if 
     <lb/>
     Capt. Richards, when  in the House, 
     <lb/>
        had not stuck so close to the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for  Alberton, he would have 
     <lb/>
     been a representative  of the second 
     <lb/>
     Electoral District of Prince County 
     <lb/>
     yet. He could not understand how a 
     <lb/>
     gentleman could, on the public platform, 
     <lb/>
     make statements which he would a few 
     <lb/>
     days  afterwards as publicly go against. 
     <lb/>
     Such would not be the man he would 
     <lb/>
     send up as a delegate to seek for bet<lb break="no"/>ter Terms. Much had been said about 
     <lb/>
     the School Question. It was very 
     <lb/>
     strange that three years ago that hon. 
     <lb/>
     member should have  come out so 
     <lb/>
     strongly in favor of that question, and 
     <lb/>
     shortly afterwards signed a written 
     <lb/>
     document pledging himself not to 
     <lb/>
     agitate that measure for four years. I 
     <lb/>
     do not blame him for not pressing that 
     <lb/>
     question, but if he had been elected to 
     <lb/>
     carry out any certain line of policy, he 
     <lb/>
     would keep his promise. There are 
     <lb/>
     twelve Catholic members now on the 
     <lb/>
     side of the House the  hon. member 
     <lb/>
      sits on, why does he not now move in 
     <lb/>
     his favorite scheme when he has so 
     <lb/>
     many to support his  views ?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HOWL2">Hon. Mr.  HOWLAN</persName>.—Had no in<lb break="no"/>tention to speak, but as the speech of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member was all  about him, he 
     <lb/>
     supposed he must  reply. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman, when the Railway Bill 
     <lb/>
     was passing through the House, was 
     <lb/>
     one of the strongest Railway men in 
     <lb/>
       the country. When a strong anti-<lb break="yes"/>Railway party came into power, he 
     <lb/>ran with, and  supported them. He 
     <lb/> (Mr. H.) did not refer to   the hon. 
     <lb/>member this  Session, but his vindic<lb break="no"/>tiveness was such that he could not 
     <lb/>get  up   and address the hon. committee 
     <lb/>  without uttering a tirade of abuse 
     <lb/>against him. The hon. member said<lb/>that he (Mr. H.) placed the Railway<lb/>

     Station at  his own door, and now that 
     <lb/>
     he had twelve Catholic supporters in 
     <lb/>
     the House, he ought to move on the 
     <lb/>
     School Question. Catholic members 
     <lb/>
     understand the hon. member quite 
     <lb/>
     well. He did happen to say that if 
     <lb/>
     Capt. Richards had been here at the  
     <lb/>
     last  general election he would have 
     <lb/>
     been returned. He thought so still. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member thinks he could not 
     <lb/>
     have been beaten. But his father, 
     <lb/>
     who was a better man than the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member is, on one occasion lost an 
     <lb/>
     election.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:YEO1">Mr. JOHN YEO</persName> thought the speeches 
     <lb/>
     of the two last hon. gentlemen were 
     <lb/>
     quite out of place. He had himself 
     <lb/>
     been returned as a Confederate. He 
     <lb/>
     told the people he was very anxious 
     <lb/>
     to keep out of Confederation if it could 
     <lb/>
     be done, and asked to be, and had 
     <lb/>
     been, returned unpledged. He said he 
     <lb/>
     thought the Terms were pretty good, 
     <lb/>
     but  if better can be had it was desir<lb break="no"/>able, and, therefore, felt it to be his duty 
     <lb/>
     to lend his aid to obtain better Terms 
     <lb/>
     if they can be had. He had looked into 
     <lb/>
     the matter for himself, and was of the 
     <lb/>
     opinion that by the Terms brought 
     <lb/>
     down, it would be found that they 
     <lb/>
     would fall at least £12,000 short of 
     <lb/>
     what would be required for local pur<lb break="no"/>poses. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL5">Mr. McLEAN</persName> said when the Rail<lb break="no"/>way measure was inaugurated, he was 
     <lb/>
      convinced from his knowledge of the 
     <lb/>
    inability of the people of this country   
     <lb/>to pay the burden it would impose, that 
     <lb/>his duty was to oppose the Bill. He 
     <lb/>regarded it in  the first instance as a 
     <lb/>gigantic measure, which would involve 
     <lb/>the country to an extent that would 
     <lb/> embarrass the Government in difficul<lb break="no"/>ties from which it would be impossible 
     <lb/>to be relieved. Shortly after the Bill 
     <lb/>   was passed, a meeting was held in his 
     <lb/>district, when the opinion seemed to 
     <lb/>be that if we had the money within   
     <lb/>ourselves, so that the interest on the 
     <lb/>cost of the work might not be drawn 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
     out of the Colony, the undertaking  
     <lb/>
     would not be  so objectionable.  This 
     <lb/>
     he knew we had not, and that as a 
     <lb/>
     result the money would be drawn out 
     <lb/>
     of the country. He must say that 
     <lb/>
     while he sat in the late Government. 
     <lb/>
     they acted in as straight forward a  
     <lb/>
     manner as men could, nor did he think 
     <lb/>
     they did anything to injure the finances 
     <lb/>
     of the Colony. But it is not easy for 
     <lb/>
     any Government to carry on the busi<lb break="no"/>ness of the country without making 
     <lb/>
     some blunders. He believed if it were 
     <lb/>
     not for the efforts of him and others 
     <lb/>
     who acted with him last year, Souris 
     <lb/>
     and Tignish would not have branch 
     <lb/>
     lines of the Railroad at all. And if 
     <lb/>
     the Bill had not been brought in when 
     <lb/>
     it was, the people in those two places 
     <lb/>
     would have failed to secure this boon. 
     <lb/>
     Among the arguments brought for<lb break="no"/>ward the School Question was refer<lb break="no"/>red to. It was not put as a question 
     <lb/>
     before the people at the late election, 
     <lb/>
     and, therefore, is only used now for 
     <lb/>
     the purpose of making political capital 
     <lb/>
     out of it. It is a question, though, 
     <lb/>
     which will have to be settled yet, and 
     <lb/>
     that he thought could easily be done 
     <lb/>
     by a slight alteration in the Act, which 
     <lb/>
     would set the question at rest to the 
     <lb/>
     great advantage of the country. He 
     <lb/>
     was present last evening at an exami<lb break="no"/>nation in the school taught in St.  
     <lb/>
     Patrick's Hall, and thought it highly 
     <lb/>
     creditable to the teachers in that 
     <lb/>
     school. He saw a boy there from his 
     <lb/>
     own neighborhood, who acquitted him<lb break="no"/>self admirably. The privileges of 
     <lb/>
     education should be general, and not 
     <lb/>
     confined to the rich. Taunts ought 
     <lb/>
     not to be thrown out against the 
     <lb/>
     Catholics, as though they had been  
     <lb/>
     pledged against Confederation, unless 
     <lb/>
     the School Question was settled ac<lb break="no"/>cording to their wish. It was, how<lb break="no"/>ever, a question which should not be 
     <lb/>
     trifled with. For his part he came 
     <lb/>
      here to do the best he could to promote 
     <lb/>
     the general interests of his constitu<lb break="no"/>ents. They are beginning to see that

          they who look best after their general<lb/>interests are best entitled to have their<lb/>support. He would, some time ago<lb/>have been unwilling to support the<lb/>resolution before them, but seeing<lb/>what the state of the Colony is, would<lb/>now feel it his duty to vote for it.<lb/>

Reference has been made to<lb/>the Railroad ; all I have to say is that<lb/>the vote I gave then, I gave heartily,<lb/>and from the firm conviction that it<lb/>would be promotive of the best in<lb break="no"/>terests of the country. It is not worth<lb/>our while now to enquire what led to<lb/>the present difficulty, but I am per<lb break="no"/>suaded the uppermost idea in the mind<lb/>of those who originated and voted for<lb/>the Railway Bill, was the general good<lb/>of the country, and in voting for this<lb/>resolution I am sure it will prove to<lb/>be for the best interests, not only of my<lb/>constituents, but of the country at<lb/>large.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BREC1">Hon. Mr. BRECKEN</persName>.—Mr. Speaker,<lb/>having been a few days outside of the<lb/>bar of this hon. House, and thereby<lb/>having had an opportunity of listening<lb/>to the debate, I now feel constrained<lb/>to express the hope that henceforth<lb/>our discussions may be more than ever<lb/>distinguished by calmness and forbear<lb break="no"/>ance. We have reached that period<lb/>in our history when we may well<lb/>pause, and review the past. We have<lb/>passed through an ordeal.

The School Question, for<lb/>instance, was dragged into the discus<lb break="no"/>sion. For my part I could not see<lb/>why it should have been referred to at<lb/>all. I am willing to forget and for<lb break="no"/>give, and to put my feet upon the<lb/>many calumnies and unjust reproaches<lb/>which were cast upon us ; and I be<lb break="no"/>lieve, now that Mr. Pope's Govern<lb break="no"/>ment has been allowed by Providence,<lb/>again to attain to power to show to the<lb/>people of this Island and the neighbour<lb break="no"/>ing Provinces, that the charges made<lb/>against that Government were untrue.<lb/>To show that notwithstanding all the<lb/>-->
