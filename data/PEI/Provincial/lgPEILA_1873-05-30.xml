     resolve itself into a Committee of the

     <lb/>
     that it was the intention of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to submit a measure to in<lb break="no"/>crease the duty on several articles im<lb break="no"/>ported into the Island, for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     assimilating our tariff to that of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion. An undue advantage had been 
     <lb/>
     taken of our low tariff by certain parties 
     <lb/>
     in shipping large quantities of liquors to 
     <lb/>
     this Island for the purpose of re-ship<lb break="no"/>ping them to the Dominion, duty free,

     expect us to deal justly and fairly with 
     <lb/>
     them in reference to this matter. As 
     <lb/>
     Canada has dealt very liberally with

     us, it was only fair that Rum, &amp;c.,

           of the Dominion. It had been stated<lb/>in some of the Halifax newspapers,<lb/>that if any Rum were re-shipped to<lb/>the other Provinces, from this Island,<lb/>after the union, it would have to pay<lb/>the difference between their duty and<lb/>ours. But the proposed arrangement<lb/>would, in his opinion, be more satis<lb break="no"/>factory to both parties.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:POPE2">Hon. LEADER OF THE GOVERN<lb break="no"/>MENT</persName> said that if, in addition to the<lb/>$25,000, we received the difference or<lb/>increase of duty, the whole would<lb/>amount to over $100,000, which would<lb/>make a vast difference for all time to<lb/>come, as the amount is a large one.<lb/>All this had been gained by not adopt<lb break="no"/>ing the course recommended by the<lb/>Opposition while passing the Revenue<lb/>Bill, &amp;c. The Government had not<lb/>made up their minds to go into Con<lb break="no"/>federation, if better Terms had not<lb/>been secured. After passing the Ad<lb break="no"/>dress to Her Majesty to unite this<lb/>Colony to the Dominion, the tariff of<lb/>this Island should not be allowed to<lb/>remain in such a way as to lessen the<lb/>revenue of Canada for the remaining<lb/>month. It was, he believed, the in<lb break="no"/>tention of the Dominion Government<lb/>to protect themselves by compelling all<lb/>who re-shipped liquors from this Island<lb/>after the union, to pay the difference<lb/>between our present duty and theirs.<lb/>It was a rather difficult matter to make<lb/>an arrangement that would not injure<lb/>some individuals, but the equalizing of<lb/>the duty on certain articles to that of<lb/>the Dominion, would prevent loss to<lb/>the Dominion Revenue.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SINC6">MR. SINCLAIR</persName> thought the hon.<lb/>Leader of the Government had shown<lb/>good reason why this change in the<lb/>duties upon certain articles should be<lb/>made. Merchants were re-shipping<lb/>boots and shoes to the Dominion, and<lb/>intended, after the union, to bring them<lb/>back here duty free. We should,<lb/>therefore, look after our own interests,<lb/>while the Dominion looked after its<lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
            own. In order to do this, it would be<lb/>necessary to pass a resolution to pro<lb break="no"/>tect our interests, as they had done in<lb/>reference to theirs. The Dominion<lb/>Government was losing its Revenue<lb/>by the way in which ours at present<lb/>stood, and it was only fair and just<lb/>that matters should be put right in<lb/>order that both parties should be pro<lb break="no"/>tected. He saw that about forty<lb/>mowing machines had been re-shipped<lb/>to the Dominion in order that they<lb/>might be brought back, after the union,<lb/>duty free. This should be prevented<lb/>by some means or other. If the Do<lb break="no"/>minion Parliament were so sensitive<lb/>to their interests, we should act in a<lb/>similar manner, and prevent the re<lb break="no"/>shipment of goods, upon which no duty<lb/>had been paid.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:DAVI3">MR. L. H. DAVIES</persName> said that when<lb/>the Revenue Bill was submitted, the<lb/>same amendment as that now proposed<lb/>by the hon. Leader of the Government<lb/>was submitted by the Opposition, but<lb/>it was voted down by the Government,<lb/>who informed the House that the Bill<lb/>would remain as then passed, till the<lb/>Island entered the Dominion. Mer<lb break="no"/>chants, generally, had acted under that<lb/>impression, and were now importing a<lb/>large quantity of goods, on the under<lb break="no"/>standing that no amendment would be<lb/>made in the Revenue Bill till the<lb/>first of July next. The amendment<lb/>would have been perfectly fair if made<lb/>when the Bill was passed ; but under<lb/>present circumstances, it was unfair to<lb/>those now importing goods. The gain<lb/>to the Revenue of this Island, by our<lb/>not raising the duties equal to those of<lb/>the Dominion till now, cannot be re<lb break="no"/>cognized as a legitimate one.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>On motion, the House resolved itself<lb/>into a Committee of Ways and Means.<lb/>

     reference to the necessity of protecting 
     <lb/>our own interests, were correct, and to<lb/>the point. The matter was well<lb/>worthy of the consideration of the<lb/>House, but it was not easy to provide<lb/>the necessary remedy, without injuring<lb/>somebody's interests. It was to the<lb/>interests of the Dominion to protect<lb/>her own manufactures, and she had<lb/>done so. The article of Sugar, for<lb/>instance, was one of them. He be<lb break="no"/>lieved that large quantities of goods<lb/>had been imported into this Island by<lb/>speculators, who did not belong to this<lb/>Island, and if they had to pay the dif<lb break="no"/>ference of duty when they re-ship to<lb/>the other Provinces, there will be no<lb/>money lost by our people. Our Trea<lb break="no"/>sury would receive forty cents per<lb/>gallon of the duties on liquors, and the<lb/>Dominion would receive the other<lb/>forty. He would move the following<lb/>resolution :‚Äî<lb/>

           Opposition when the Revenue Bill<lb/>was passed, the clearer he saw it to be<lb/>the correct one. They understood<lb/>that if we entered Confederation the<lb/>course they proposed would be fair<lb/>to the Dominion, and would prevent<lb/>jobbery in reference to the duties, and<lb/>at the same time, would be just and<lb/>fair to our own merchants. If we had<lb/>remained out of Confederation, we<lb/>should have required the extra duties<lb/>for our own purposes. If the last dele<lb break="no"/>gation had failed, and Confederation,<lb/>had not been accepted, the amendment<lb/>proposed by the Opposition would<lb/>have been the means of increasing our<lb/>Revenue during the interval. The<lb/>Opposition were on the right track,<lb/>and in the end it would prove to be so.<lb/>It was now proposed to increase the<lb/>duties on a few of the principal articles<lb/>imported. The chief difference in the<lb/>duty would be on Rum. It seemed<lb/>that the politicians of Canada were too<lb/>shrewd to allow their own interests to<lb/>be endangered by the loss of a portion<lb/>of their Revenue, and had arranged to<lb/>demand the extra duty on goods re<lb break="no"/>shipped to the other Provinces after<lb/>the first of July. He understood there<lb/>was sufficient liquor in store on this<lb/>Island for three years' consumption !<lb/>Every puncheon not required for<lb/>present use, would be re-shipped, and<lb/>drawbacks would be taken out by<lb/>those speculators in rum. All the<lb/>duties they would have to pay would<lb/>be the difference between our present<lb/>tariff and that of the Dominion. The<lb/>hon. Leader of the Government had<lb/>referred to the difficulty of preventing<lb/>the re-shipment of goods to the Do<lb break="no"/>minion, and the evasion of the pay<lb break="no"/>ment of the duties upon them. There<lb/>was but one course to be taken, and<lb/>that was to repeal the clause in the<lb/>Revenue Bill permitting drawbacks<lb/>upon goods. If no drawbacks were<lb/>allowed till after the union, we should<lb/>be able to have our Revenue ; but un<lb break="no"/>less this were done, everything im<lb break="no"/>
