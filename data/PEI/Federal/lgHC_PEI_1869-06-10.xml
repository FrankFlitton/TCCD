               arrangements having in view the admission of <lb/>

               had intended at this <lb/>
               stage to move an amendment, but as it was so <lb/>
               late, it might perhaps be more convenient to <lb/>
               defer it now, and move it at the concurrence. <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:ROSE1"> Hon. Mr. Rose</persName> said
               the object of the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions was principally the admission of Prince <lb/>
               Edward Island into the Union. After the <lb/>
               address which had just been passed, it was <lb/>
               evident that the Union would be very incom<lb break="no"/>plete without Prince Edward Island. It had a <lb/>
               low tariff and there would be great temptation <lb/>
               to send in goods from that Island to the other <lb/>
               Provinces. Its geographical position also was <lb/>
               such that the Dominion would be very incom<lb break="no"/>plete without it. Another very important <lb/>
               reason why it should be admitted had refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the ﬁsheries. The House was aware of <lb/>
               the extreme value of the ﬁsheries belonging to <lb/>
               Prince Edward Island: and it was known that <lb/>
               no permanent arrangement could be made as <lb/>
               to the ﬁsheries unless Prince Edward Island <lb/>
               were a party to it. Prince Edward Island had <lb/>
               very little debt. The principal part of it had <lb/>
               been contracted in the purchase of estates <lb/>
               from persons who held them under grants <lb/>
               from the Crown of England on terms which <lb/>
               had very materially retarded the settlement of <lb/>
               the Island. The hon. gentleman went on to <lb/>
               explain somewhat minutely the position of the <lb/>
               land question in Prince Edward Island. He <lb/>
               then explained that as the tariff was low, and <lb/>
               the debt comparatively small, it had been <lb/>

               deemed necessary to offer Prince Edward <lb/>
               Island some equivalent to induce her to enter <lb/>
               the Union. The equivalent contemplated by <lb/>
               those resolutions was that the Dominion Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment should purchase the lands still held <lb/>
               under the original grants, being about 800,000 <lb/>
               acres, or rather more than one-half the island, <lb/>
               and sell them to actual settlers, to be held in <lb/>

               deal to-night about the binding nature of the <lb/>
               resolutions of the Quebec Conference. He <lb/>
               wished to ask whether it was any part of the <lb/>
               so-called treaty then entered into, and to <lb/>
               which the Prince Edward Island delegates <lb/>
               were parties, that Canada should purchase <lb/>
               these disputed land titles? <lb/>

               said the Quebec <lb/>
               resolutions made no allusion to the land ques<lb break="no"/>tion: but the people of Prince Edward Island <lb/>
               did not think it for their interest to come into <lb/>
               Confederation on the terms speciﬁed at the <lb/>
               Conference. It was of importance to us, how<lb break="no"/>ever, to complete Confederation by the ad<lb break="no"/>mission of Prince Edward Island, and these <lb/>
               resolutions authorized the Government to <lb/>
               enter into negotiations with that view on a <lb/>
               particular basis. The negotiations must be <lb/>
               opened by one party or the other, and this <lb/>
               Government were prepared to take the in<lb break="no"/>itiative. <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:MACD1"> Sir John A. Macdonald</persName>
               thought that with a <lb/>
               view to making a clear gain it was not de<lb break="no"/>sirable at this stage to specify minutely how <lb/>
