               the consideration of <lb/>
               the resolutions reported from committee of <lb/>
               the Whole on the subject of arrangements <lb/>
               having in view the admission of the Colony <lb/>
               of Prince Edward Island into the Dominion <lb/>
               of Canada. <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MACK1">Mr. Mackenzie</persName>
               strongly objected to this <lb/>
               contemplated purchase of proprietary rights. <lb/>
               It was a want of wisdom in this Parliament <lb/>
               to assume the duties properly belonging <lb/>
               to the Local Legislatures. Whatever course <lb/>
               might be adopted in bringing Prince Edward <lb/>
               Island into the Union, he was sure of one <lb/>
               thing, and that was that the Government of <lb/>
               the Island should be dealt with. By this <lb/>
               proposition the Government of the Dominion <lb/>
               was really asked to quiet the titles of two- <lb break="yes"/>
               thirds of the entire Island. He had no objec<lb break="no"/>tion to the opening of negotiations for the <lb/>
               acquisition of this Island, but it was not <lb/>
               desirable that the Dominion should enter upon <lb/>
               duties belonging really to the Local Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and seek to acquire proprietary <lb/>
               rights, because no arrangements should be <lb/>
               concluded without the sanction of Parliament. <lb/>
               He, therefore, moved in amendment,——"1.
               That <lb/>
               all the words after the word 'Dominion' in the <lb/>
               first resolution be omitted, and the following <lb/>
               substituted in lieu thereof: 'But no negotia<lb break="no"/>tions shall be had which may involve the <lb/>
               Government or Parliament of Canada in any <lb/>
               attempt to acquire the disputed proprietary <lb/>
               rights of the original grantees of the Crown <lb/>
               of the Lands of the Island, or with a view <lb/>
               to give to the Parliament of Canada juris<lb break="no"/>diction or control in relation to any subject <lb/>
               matter that by the provisions of the British <lb/>
               North America Act of 1867 is vested in the <lb/>
               Legislature of each Province respectively.' <lb/>
               2. That the second and third resolutions be <lb/>
               expunged and the following substituted:— <lb break="yes"/>
               'That all such arrangements shall be sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to Parliament for its approval before <lb/>
               any action is taken to give them effect, or <lb/>
               to pledge the public faith to their fulfilment.' " <lb/>

the Union, but he saw
               a very grave objec<lb break="no"/>tion to the terms of these resolutions, and <lb/>
               maintained that the Government had no right <lb/>

               meet the views of the member for Lambton, <lb/>
               the Government were willing to amend the <lb/>
               lst resolution by making it provide merely <lb/>
               that it was expedient the negotiations should <lb/>
               be entered into, leaving out the latter part <lb/>
               of the resolution was struck out, and made <lb/>
               to read, in accordance with the suggestion of <lb/>
               the member for Lambton, "That all such <lb/>
               arrangements should be submitted to Par<lb break="no"/>liament for its approval before any action is <lb/>
               taken to give them effect or to pledge the <lb/>
