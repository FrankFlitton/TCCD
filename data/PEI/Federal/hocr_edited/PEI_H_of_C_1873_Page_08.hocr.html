difﬁculty had always been that in consequence of their <br />
isolated position they could not receive an appropriation for local <br />

the Island Railway. A deputation had in January been sent up to <br />
arrange terms of union. Another delegation had been recently sent <br />
up, empowered to enter into the ﬁnal arrangements which were
now <br />
submitted to Parliament. The great local works there having been <br />
now completed, there could never be any large local expenditure in <br />
the future, and it was in consideration of this fact that the Dominion <br />
Government had granted such liberal terms. <br />
