<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Lord Kimberley, would
show the position in which that Island <br />
stood, as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">follows:-“It</span>
is stated in the minute that the different <br />
Governments and Legislatures of this Colony have always <br />
hoped that these ﬁsheries (the fisheries of Prince Edward <br />
Island) would have done much to secure the advantages of <br />
another Reciprocity Treaty, or of some tariff concessions <br />
authorize the free admission into the United States of the <br />
products of our agriculturists, who form the majority of our <br />
population, and which would have resulted in promoting the <br />
prosperity of the Colony; and that, in the opinion of this <br />
Council, the inhabitants of Prince Edward Island are now <br />
asked to surrender to the citizens of the United States these <br />
invaluable fisheries without receiving in return any just or fair <br />
equivalent, such as was hoped to be obtained.” <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The people of New
Brunswick from the ﬁrst had been <br />
entirely opposed to the Treaty, and the Legislature of that <br />
Province, as well as the Lieut. Governor, had spoken of it in <br />
the strongest terms of denunciation. (Hear, hear.) The people <br />
of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland <br />
did not accept the Treaty in the spirit in which this House was <br />
asked to accept it. (Hear, hear.) <br />

one country or one province, but the whole interests of the <br />

his duty to vote against the ratiﬁcation of the treaty. <br />
(Applause) He denied that this treaty was calculated to settle <br />
all disputes between Great Britain and the United States, and he <br />
said that, if trouble arose at the present time between England and <br />
America, the latter would not ratify the treaty, and if we pressed it <br />
we would receive a snubbing for our pains. In the interest of the <br />
Dominion, and in the interest of all its products, he considered it <br />
would not be for our advantage to ratify the treaty at the present <br />
time. (Applause) <br />
