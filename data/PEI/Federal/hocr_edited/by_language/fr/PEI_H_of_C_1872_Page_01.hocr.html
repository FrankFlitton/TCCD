               every ﬁsherman in the Province, and now the same House had <br />
               been in session for over two months, and there had not been <br />
               one word of disapproval of the Treaty. He believed that the <br />
               feeling in Nova Scotia was that Parliament could not inﬂict <br />
               greater wrong on them, and could not paralyze their industries <br />
               more than by refusing to ratify the Treaty, which promoted <br />
               and protected the great national industries without injuring a <br />
               single interest, or being counterbalanced by a single drawback; <br />
               and that a refusal would also tend to prevent the obtaining of <br />
               reciprocity in the future. <br />

               but the same thing took place there. The New Brunswick <br />
               Legislature at ﬁrst strongly opposed the Treaty, but though <br />
               they had now been six or eight weeks in session, there was not <br />
               a single hostile resolution on their records. As to Prince <br />

               a stage of the discussion; but the question was one in which <br />
               not only the interests of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick and <br />
               the whole Dominion were concerned, but also the interests of <br />
               the Empire, and he would not have done justice to himself if <br />
               he had not given utterance to his views. The hon. gentleman <br />

               indulgence of the House at this late hour, while he referred to <br />
               the arguments of the hon. gentleman who had just sat down <br />
               (Hon. Mr. Tupper). He would say, in the ﬁrst place, that he <br />
               desired to approach the consideration of this subject in a <br />
               manner worthy of its importance. He would further say that he <br />
               came to the House in full expectation of being able to sustain <br />
               the Government in the course they had taken in the earlier part <br />
               of these negotiations, when it was made known through <br />
               ofﬁcial and semi-ofﬁcial sources what was the
               course the <br />
               Government were taking. He shared the views they then <br />
               expressed, and up to the present time he had seen no reason to <br />
               change his opinion. The hon. gentleman who had preceded <br />
               him, as well as others on that side of the House, had sought to <br />
               convey the impression that the adoption of this Treaty was in <br />
               the interests of permanently peaceful relations between the <br />
               United States and the Empire. <br />

               his case broke down. So it was in the case of the Ministers. <br />
               When their own statements were placed in evidence against <br />
