               Government had no right by law to take the <br />
               initiative in this matter. They did not stand in the same position <br />
               with regard to the question of the union of the outlying Provinces as <br />
               they did with regard to a matter of administrative policy. <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> There was nothing in
               the Act to justify the Government in taking <br />
               the initiative any more than any other member of the House, and <br />
               there was this very strong objection to the course pursued by the <br />
               Government, and it was the objection made against their course <br />
               with regard to British Columbia, namely: that while the people and <br />
               Legislature of Prince Edward’s Island were free to discuss
               the <br />
               matter and make amendments to the terms, the members of this <br />
               House would be obliged by the policy of the Government to either <br />
               accept or reject the terms as a whole. As this House was one of the <br />
               primary parties to any negotiations relating to Union, it was only <br />
               proper that they should decide upon the terms before proposing to <br />
               Prince Edward’s Island. <br />

               Dominion. There was no third party. The Executive have not any <br />
               authority in the Confederation Act for bringing about the union of <br />
               outlying Provinces. Any proposition from the Government could <br />
               only be from them as the agents and servants of Parliament, and <br />
               should have received the sanction of Parliament before the <br />
               Government took any action in the matter at all. <br />
