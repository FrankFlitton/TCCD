               we had adopted an exclusive policy after <br />
               the abrogation of the treaty, we would now have had control of <br />
               the American markets. The House was told that the arbitrators <br />
               appointed to decide upon the relative value of our ﬁsheries <br />
               and the American fisheries would pay us what we lost in <br />
               giving up our ﬁsheries; but the very
               ﬁrst question that would <br />
               have to be decided before they could estimate the relative <br />
               value was where were they to draw the boundary line of our <br />
               ﬁsheries, whether from headland to headland, or along the <br />
               coast? lfthe former, of course our ﬁsheries would be greatly
               <br />
               increased in value; but how were the arbitrators to decide? It <br />
               was, therefore, of the very greatest importance that the High <br />
               Joint Commissioners should have settled deﬁnitely the <br />
               question of headlands, so that the arbitrators would have had a <br />
               basis on which to make their valuation. <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The hon. gentlemen
               opposite, particularly the Premier, had <br />
               stated that the American markets were the only markets we <br />
               had for our ﬁsh. He had not had the pleasure of listening to
               the <br />
               speech of his colleague from Halifax (Mr. Power); but he <br />
               understood that gentleman had given some ﬁgures to show <br />
               that a large portion of our ﬁsh was sent to the United
               States. <br />
               He was not aware from what source that gentleman drew his <br />
               information, but he felt it his duty to be as correct as possible <br />
               and he had taken the trouble to consult the public documents <br />
               for 1862, 63, 64 under the Reciprocity Treaty, and also after <br />
               that Treaty in 1869, 70, 71, when the United States imposed <br />
               duty on our ﬁsh. He found that under the Reciprocity Treaty <br />
               only about 7 per cent more of our ﬁsh went to the United <br />
               States than when the duty was imposed. <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The American
               ﬁshermen stood in a very different position <br />
               from our ﬁshermen in many respects. 1n the ﬁrst
               place they <br />
               had larger and better vessels, larger outfits, larger capital, and <br />
               they had in operation a system of mutual insurances. They had <br />
               the additional advantage of being able to fish all the year <br />
               round. Our fishermen ﬁshed in the early part of the year
               only; <br />
               but, after the mackerel ﬁshing was over in the fall, the <br />
               American ﬁshermen went off to the banks, and caught halibut <br />
               and other fish, which our fishermen could not do. He would <br />
               tell the hon. gentleman why. lf he were to send his vessel there <br />
               he would have to sell his cargo wholesale, and would not be <br />
               able to pay the expense of taking it to market. But those <br />
               people had a market at their own doors. The American <br />
               ﬁshermen thus had the advantage over ours. They were able to
               <br />
               earn during the winter season what would pay their expenses <br />
               all the year round, and that was a very important <br />
               consideration. The hon. gentleman had referred to the position <br />
               of the American markets during that time. Within the last two <br />
               years so great had been the increase of American ﬁshermen, <br />
               since the war, since they had gone back and engaged in old <br />
               pursuits, that ﬁsh had been cheaper in Boston than Halifax, <br />
               and there had been large imports from Boston, and the West <br />
               Indies markets had been trading from Boston instead of <br />
               Halifax. 1f the hon. gentleman understood the matter as he did <br />
               he would see those people would come with better appliances <br />
