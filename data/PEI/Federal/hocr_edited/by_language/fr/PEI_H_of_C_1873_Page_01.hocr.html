               conveniently situated on a point of land which ran down from the <br />
               mainland, having the Bay of Chaleur on one side and Miramichi on <br />
               the other, and it was stated by Mr. Fleming that this port was the <br />
               nearest point, on the mainland to Europe, excepting a point on <br />
               Gaspe, which was out of the question as a shipping point. <br />

               MACDONALD regretted that Hon. Mr. <br />
               Tupper was not present, as he had always taken a special interest in <br />
               the subject. He agreed that this matter was one of very great <br />
               importance, and the House was very much indebted to the mover of <br />
               the resolution for having brought the matter before them so ably. <br />
               The Committee, he had no doubt, would be able to report some <br />
               valuable suggestions, and after that, perhaps, the question
               might be <br />
               again discussed by the House this session. The motion was agreed <br />
               to. <br />

               it is expedient to make further <br />

               certain lakes and inland waters of Canada for seamen’s wages

               that the principle of this resolution had long <br />
               been acted upon in other countries, and the Act of the Ontario <br />
               Legislature giving a lien to mechanics was an additional reason for <br />
               the passage ofthe proposed measure. He referred to cases of loss of <br />
               wages and damages, for which there was at present no remedy. If <br />
               this measure was passed, it would improve the whole shipping <br />
               interest, because it would have a tendency to reduce the rate of <br />
               wages, as employees, having a security against loss, could afford to <br />
               accept lower wages. <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> He argued that as a
               matter relating to trade and commerce, and <br />
               shipping, it came within the jurisdiction of this House, the question <br />
               of civil rights being merely incidental to it. No local Government <br />
               could deal with it, as they could not seize a foreign <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vessel-at</span> any <br />
               rate trouble would be very apt to arise if they did do so. His <br />
               measure was conﬁned to the inland waters, as he believed
               that <br />
               Admiralty Court of the Maritime Provinces had jurisdiction to deal <br />
               with the questions involved. Since he had introduced the measure <br />
               last session, he had received many assurances from gentlemen <br />
               interested in shipping that it was a much needed motion. <br />
