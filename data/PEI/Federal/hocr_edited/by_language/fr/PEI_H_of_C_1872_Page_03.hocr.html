            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The hon. member for
               Lanark North (Hon. Mr. McDougall) <br />
               had referred to the fact that Prince Edward Island and <br />
               Newfoundland had accepted the Treaty; and New Brunswick <br />
               and Nova Scotia had not apparently been very warmly <br />
               opposed to it. The hon. gentleman had also sought to create <br />
               the impression that the Government of New Brunswick were <br />
               acting in concert with the Clear Grit party when they took the <br />
               step they did in communicating with the Government of Nova <br />
               Scotia on the subject. The resolution of the New Brunswick <br />
               Legislature was passed on the 18th February, while the High <br />
               Commission was sitting, and when it was thought that the <br />
               opinion of the Legislature would strengthen the hands of those <br />
               who had charge of our interests; they accordingly telegraphed <br />
               to Newfoundland, and as the latter had no interest but the <br />
               ﬁshing interest to consider, they replied that they were
               well <br />
               satisﬁed to leave the matter to England, for the reason that
               she <br />
               had left them to exercise their own discretion and free will on <br />
               the subject of entering the Confederation or not. That was a <br />
               very good reason for Newfoundland, because she had been <br />
               accorded a privilege which had been denied Nova Scotia. <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> He might here remark,
               as an instance of the singular <br />
               inaccuracies and want of information which characterized the <br />
               whole negotiation, that the important interest of seal
               ﬁshing <br />
               had been entirely unprovided for in the Treaty. The Governor <br />
               of Newfoundland made a communication to Earl Kimberley, <br />
               enclosing a copy of a minute of the Council of the Local <br />
               Government on the subject. That minute of the Council was <br />
               not among the papers submitted to the House. The reply of the <br />
               Government of Prince Edward Island was worthy of attention, <br />
               because they occupied a position precisely similar to that of <br />
               Nova Scotia. The people of Prince Edward Island had valuable <br />
               ﬁsheries, but they said they were in the hands of the <br />
               Americans already; and the agricultural product of that Island <br />
               far exceeded the value of the ﬁsheries. <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The people of Prince
               Edward Island had precisely the same <br />
               interest in the ﬁsheries as we had, but they were willing
               for <br />
               Imperial interests alone to agree to what was asked of them by <br />
               the Government of England. The people of Prince Edward <br />
               Island did not adopt the policy of the Canadian Government <br />
               and say, “Give us so much money for our rights and we will <br />
               ratify the Treaty.” (Applause) No; they took a
               higher and <br />
               more manly and national view of the case; and pursued a <br />
               course which contrasted most favourably with that pursued by <br />
               the Canadian Government. (Applause) The people of Prince <br />
               Edward Island were not willing to put their loyalty into the <br />
               English market and have it quoted at any ﬁgure. (Hear,
               hear.) <br />
               On the contrary, they were willing to make a sacriﬁce for
               the <br />
               Empire, though the Treaty did not give their agricultural <br />
               interests the market in the United States which they had under <br />
               the Reciprocity Treaty. A minute of Council, dated July 25, <br />
               1871, from the Lieut. Governor of Prince Edward Island to <br />
