               MACDONALD said the inquiry was a very <br />
               natural one. The Government of the Island of Prince Edward has <br />
               sent two of their members to Ottawa, and they have had <br />
               negotiations with the Government here on the Union of Prince <br />
               Edward’s Island with the Dominion. <br />

               arrangements were entered into and these <br />
               gentlemen went home for the purpose of submitting them to their <br />
               colleagues, and they in turn had made up their minds to submit <br />
               them to the people before they would be laid before the Legislature. <br />
               These terms would therefore be laid before that body aﬁer
               the <br />
               elections, and it was obviously a matter of importance to that <br />
               Government that they should choose their own time and their own <br />
               mode of submitting the propositions of the Dominion Government <br />
               to their people; therefore he did not deem it advisable to place these
               <br />
               provisional returns before the Parliament here until the Government <br />
               had ascertained that they had been presented to the public of Prince <br />

               great task of submitting the question to the people and going to the <br />
               country upon it, and he thought it might be thwarting greatly the <br />
               object they all had in view if there were a premature publication. It <br />
               was a matter of little consequence whether one or the other party <br />
               published these terms ﬁrst. He expected information from the
               <br />
               Government of Prince Edward’s Island in a short time, and
               aﬁer his <br />
               Government had received that, they would be in a position, without <br />
               injury to the great cause of union, to submit the papers to this <br />

               speech of the leader of the Government. The newspapers of Prince <br />
               Edward’s Island published the proposed terms, and the
               Government <br />
               had gone to the country upon these terms. If the people of Prince <br />
               Edward’s Island heard that the Minister of Justice thought it
               might <br />
               possibly damage the cause of Confederation in that Province by <br />
               announcing to the House whether their public statement were <br />
               correct or incorrect, they might suppose there was some doubt as to <br />
               their correctness. <br />
