               possible distance from Great Britain should receive the serious <br />
               consideration of the House; and he moved that a Select Committee <br />
               be appointed for the purpose of enquiring into the matter, to consist <br />
               of Messrs. Campbell, Anglin, Fortin, Young (Montreal West), <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. Mr. ANGLlN said
               the importance ofthis subject could not <br />
               well be over-estimated, but it could not have been dealt with <br />
               sooner. He wished to point out a few of the facts, as laid down in <br />
               Fleming’s report, which had not been noticed by the mover of
               the <br />
               resolution. The proposed route was not only the shortest to Europe <br />
               from this country, but it was also the shortest from New York to <br />
               Europe, and, therefore, in the summer season a very large passenger <br />
               trafﬁc might reasonably be expected over this route, which
               would <br />
               diminish the risks and inconvenience and sufferings of a sea <br />
               voyage. <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> From his own personal
               knowledge he could say that the <br />
               expenditure on the continent would be a mere triﬂe. A branch
               <br />
               railway from the lntercolonial Railway, down to Shippegan would, <br />
               according to Mr. Fleming, be about 22 miles in length. He knew the <br />
               country, and knew that except on the prairies there was no country <br />
               where a railway could be more cheaply constructed. There would <br />
               be no bridges nor cuttings required of any importance. With regard <br />
               to the harbour, it was one of the ﬁnest in America. There
               was <br />
               magniﬁcent entrance to the Bay of Chaleur. The entrance to <br />
               Miramichi Bay would need some improvement, but some <br />
               expenditure would be required anyway. He considered the time had <br />
               now come when this subject should receive the serious <br />
               consideration of the Government and Parliament. <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> There was an
               impression that the interior of Newfoundland was <br />
               waste and uninhabited; but explorations had of late been made <br />
               which showed that the country was well watered and timbered, and <br />
               a railway could be built through it without any great expense. <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> It might be said that
               Newfoundland was not within the <br />
               Dominion, and therefore the Dominion could not be expected to <br />
               seriously entertain any project which would involve an expenditure <br />
               of public money to a very large extent upon the island. That was, no <br />
               doubt, true, but he believed the Government hoped at no distant day <br />
               to induce Newfoundland to join the Union. It was scarcely probable <br />
               that Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland would remain outside <br />
               of the Union for any very great length of time, and one of the means <br />
               of inducing Newfoundland to come into the Union probably would <br />
               be to hold out the expectation that, in addition to other advantages, <br />
               the Island would be opened up by a railway running across it, <br />
               bringing a stream oftravel to and from Europe, which would be of <br />
               great advantage to the country. <br />
