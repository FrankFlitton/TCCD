               Hon. Sir George-É. Cartier said that the 
               <br />
               tone of the debate had proved that Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion had worked great improvements on the 
               <br />
               part of Lower Canada. He thanked God that 
               <br />
               Confederation had delivered them of the petty 
               <br />
               quarrels between the representatives of differ- 
               <br />
               ent sections of politicians. He was gratified to 
               <br />
               find the confidence reposed in him, and con- 
               <br />
               gratulated the House on the patience with 
               <br />
               which the Government had listened to the 
               <br />
               complaints put forward by the Western mem- 
               <br />
               bers as to the composition of the Government 
               <br />
               and the number of Liberal members in the 
               <br />
               Cabinet. The question was for them to know 
               <br />
               whether they could depend on their fellow 
               <br />
               members to give them a majority by which to 
               <br />
               carry on the Government. It was not necessary 
               <br />
               that they should have a majority in every 
               <br />
               Province, but of course a stronger majority 
               <br />
               would be founded on a majority gained in this 
               <br />
               way. If the Western Province (Ontario) were 
               <br />
               prosperous, the other Maritime Provinces 
               <br />
               shared it, and they had no right to be bump- 
               <br />
               tious about it. The question of the day was 
               <br />
               whether the Government had such a majority 
               <br />
               as to be enabled to carry on its measures; but 
               <br />
               they did not require a majority in each Prov- 
               <br />
               ince, though the majority now commanded by 
               <br />
               the Government was a majority from each 
               <br />
               Province. The question discussed by the 
               <br />
               Ontario representatives with regard to the 
               <br />
               composition of the Cabinet, did not interest the 
               <br />
               representatives of the Maritime Provinces, 
               <br />
               among which he included Quebec. He was glad 
               <br />
               to see the member for Lambton in his seat, for 
               <br />
               they all respected his industry, his talents, and 
               <br />
               the cautious manner in which he spoke. He 
               <br />
               had, however, brought forward disagreements 
               <br />
               about the representations of the Reformers in 
               <br />
               the Cabinet.
