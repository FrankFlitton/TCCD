               accompanied with any documents necessary to enable the House to <br />
               understand the position taken by the Government. Of course it was <br />
               quite true, as the member for Bothwell (Mr. Mills) had said, the <br />
               Government had no right to make any arrangements, but he did not <br />
               object to the Government endeavouring to enter upon such <br />
               negotiations as might result in the Union of the remaining provinces <br />
               still outside the Dominion; and anything that might promote that <br />
               object would receive the assistance on his side of the House; but he <br />
               did think it was not treating Parliament with respect due to it, to <br />
               have such documents as that reach them from such address during <br />
               the session, and then, when the attention of the Government had <br />
               been called to it to tell them that as soon as ofﬁcial
               communications <br />
               were made with Prince Edward’s Island, the Government would <br />
               place the information before the House. He did not think it was the <br />
               way to carry on business in relation to such matters. <br />

               laid before them on the earliest possible occasion, so that they <br />

               The <br />
               statement might not be correct, and, if incorrect, it would be very <br />
               improper of the Government to lay the papers before the House <br />

               Edward <br />
               Island. No unauthenticated documents should be acted upon. The <br />
               Government of the Island desired that they should have an <br />
               opportunity of submitting their provisional case in their own way to <br />
               their own people, before it was brought up in the Dominion <br />
