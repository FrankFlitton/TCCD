               the Government. (Hear, hear.) In their minutes of Council of <br />
               the 28th of July <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">last-and</span>

               the provisions of the treaty just as well as they do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now-they</span> <br />
               knew then as well as now whether it was in the interests of <br />
               peace, whether it was for the interests of the Dominion, that it <br />
               should be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accepted-yet</span>
               in that minute they state as a reason <br />
               why they could not accept the treaty that the principal cause of <br />
               difference between Canada and the United States had not been <br />
               removed by the treaty but remained a subject for future <br />
               anxiety. He answered the hon. gentleman out of their own <br />
               mouths. The last speaker had referred to the remarks of his <br />
               colleague from Halifax (Mr. Power) respecting the advantage <br />
               the treaty would have conferred upon the ﬁshing trade of
               Nova <br />
               Scotia had it been in operation last year. He stated that in that <br />
               case Nova Scotia would have saved between $500,000 and <br />
               $600,000 on the duties on herrings and mackerel which had <br />
               been sent to the United States. <br />

               in his hand the trade and navigation returns <br />
               for the past year, which he presumed were tolerably accurate. He <br />
               found from this document that the total amount of pickled <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁsh-</span><br />
               herring and mackerel and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alewives-sent</span>
               into the United <br />
               States last year was 47,000 barrels, which, at $2 a barrel, <br />
               would be $94,000, instead of $600,000 as claimed by the hon. <br />
               gentleman opposite. (Hear, hear.) <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The hon. President of
               Council (Hon. Mr. Tupper) also stated <br />
               that the treaty of 1854 was a great boon. Well, no one denied <br />
               that; but contrast that treaty with the present treaty. Under the <br />
               former one, agricultural products, our coal and lumber, were <br />
               admitted free of duty into the United States. How different <br />
               was this from the present treaty! The same hon. gentleman <br />
               stated as one reason why this Treaty must be a good one for us <br />
               that the American ﬁshermen were opposed to it. The hon. <br />
               member for Durham West (Hon. Mr. Blake), the other night, <br />
               speaking on this point had hit the nail on the head. He stated <br />
               that the reason why American ﬁshermen opposed the Treaty <br />
               was that Gen. Butler had gone down to Gloucester and <br />
               harangued them, telling them that now was their time to wrest <br />
               from Congress what they had long wanted, namely, a system <br />
               of bounties and the bonding of their supplies. That was the <br />
               sole course of their outcry against the Treaty, and the Minister <br />
               of Justice (Hon. Sir John A. Macdonald) knew it very well, <br />
               and he (Mr. Jones) had grave apprehensions that such a policy <br />
               would be adopted by Congress. Of course they would not do <br />
               so while the Treaty was pending but when this Parliament <br />
               accepted the Treaty then would be their time to grant bounties <br />
               to their ﬁshermen, and to allow the bonding of their
               supplies. <br />

               Privy Council (Hon. Mr. Tupper) had <br />
               contended that the admission of American ﬁshermen into our <br />
               waters would not destroy the value of our ﬁsheries, but the <br />
               reports of the Minister of Marine and Fisheries (Hon. Senator <br />
               Mitchell) had told a different story. He gave the value of the <br />
               ﬁsheries before and during the Reciprocity Treaty, and
