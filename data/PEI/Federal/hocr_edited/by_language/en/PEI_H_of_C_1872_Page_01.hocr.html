               he could not speak as to that; but the <br />
               question was altogether a captious one, for it was well known <br />
               that the headland limit had not been enforced for years. He <br />
               maintained that the member for Durham West gave us the whole <br />
               argument when he spoke of bounties being necessary to enable <br />
               the Americans to compete with the Canadian ﬁshermen. If <br />
               however, the hon. member would read the proceedings of <br />
               Congress, he would ﬁnd that the question of bounties had
               been <br />
               scouted from the very ﬁrst, and that it was admitted on all
               hands <br />
               that a system of bounties was utterly impossible; but further, the <br />
               highest system of bounty would be $400 to a vessel, while the <br />
               relief would amount to $1,200; and therefore the bounty could <br />
               not, under any circumstances, do away with the advantages on <br />
               the side of Canadian ﬁshermen. He again referred to what he <br />
               termed the unpatriotic action of members last year. <br />

               chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means of the United <br />
               States they would see that it would be impracticable for the <br />
               United States to adopt a policy that would counteract the <br />
               advantages derived by Canadian ﬁshermen. He would now ask <br />
               hon. gentlemen to turn their attention to the effect of the <br />
               Treaty on the shipping interest of the country. The member for <br />
               Halifax (Mr. Power) had told them that he went to visit a <br />
               ﬁshery in which he was concerned, when the Treaty of 1884 <br />
               was in force, and found that, out of the forty or fifty vessels, <br />
               scarcely one was American; but that on another occasion, after <br />
               the abrogation of that treaty, among an equal number of <br />
               vessels, scarcely one was Canadian. <br />

               connection with the ﬁshery or the ship-building interest,
               the <br />
               value of the Treaty could not be over-rated. He would now <br />
               refer to the state of public opinion in Nova Scotia. When the <br />
               Treaty ﬁrst became known the Nova Scotia Government put a <br />
               very strong resolution in their journals. Since then the Treaty <br />
