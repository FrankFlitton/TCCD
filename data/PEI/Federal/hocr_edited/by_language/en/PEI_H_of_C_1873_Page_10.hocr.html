               the observations he had just heard <br />
               were very gratifying to him. Now they had the assurance of the <br />
               Government that they were going to adopt boldly the view which it <br />
               became his duty to express; and he had no doubt that the sum he <br />
               had indicated as the maximum sum for this service, to wit, half a <br />
               million dollars, would be found to be near the mark. He
               afﬁrmed <br />
               that the investigation regarding the administration of the Militia <br />
               Department had had the effect of bringing the Government to adopt <br />
               the policy which they had announced that day. <br />

               opinion that very little good resulted from <br />
               the annual camps, and referred to the reluctance with which <br />
               employers permitted employees to attend the camps. He also called <br />
               attention to the fact that in some of the companies there were four <br />
               men to each ofﬁcer, while in one company there were two
               ofﬁcers <br />
               to one man. He hoped the Minister of Militia would consider well <br />
               before he gave his consent to the calling out of the men into camp, <br />
               for the present system of camp drill was an utter and useless waste <br />
               of money. <br />

               Edward) did not approve of the camp <br />
               system of drill, and he thought if the men were called out it should <br />
               not be until September, for in the present condition of the labour <br />
               market, it would be a great hardship on the employers. He thought <br />
