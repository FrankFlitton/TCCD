            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Mackenzie said
               that the first thing <br />
               required of a man when he changed from the <br />
               Liberal side of the Government side was, to <br />
               abuse the Globe newspaper, (laughter). It was <br />
               satisfactory to find so old a member, so willing <br />
               to come into the traces of the first Minister of <br />
               the Crown, and abuse the Globe. It was a well <br />
               known fact that thirty-two or thirty-three Lib- <br />
               eral members had been brought to the House, <br />
               and, in defiance of this gross accusation, he <br />
               could say that they had not given factious <br />
               opposition, but had at all times preferred to <br />
               meet the Government in an open, manly way. <br />
               He would now ask the reason why the Union <br />
               cause had not in the slightest degree advanced. <br />
               It was simply because this combination, this <br />
               coalition was formed, not to advance the Union <br />
               cause, but to advance a political party to a <br />
               position which they might occupy, we were <br />
               told, for years to come by the influence of the <br />
               expenditure for the construction of the Inter- <br />
               colonial Railway. He would venture to say that <br />
               if the Liberal party had been in power from <br />
               that time to the present, there would have been <br />
               at this moment a completed Confederation of <br />
               all the Provinces of British North America. But <br />
               after this Parliament had provided the most <br />
               liberal terms for Newfoundland and Prince <br />
               Edward Island they had been rejected, and <br />
               other Provinces would not join the Confedera- <br />
               tion; and he held that it was because the Gov- <br />
               ernment of Canada was distrusted, that the <br />
               people of the East and West, and North and <br />
               South declined to have any political associa- <br />
               tion with them (hear, hear). He would now <br />
               proceed to discuss the measures which the <br />
               Government saw fit to take, in order, apparent- <br />
               ly, to secure the results they promised long ago. <br />
               He recollected that during the elections he had <br />
               been told that if the Government secured a <br />
               majority in Parliament there could not be a <br />
               doubt the union of the Provinces—union with <br />
               the Maritime Provinces, would be a certainty, <br />
               and union with Newfoundland and Prince <br />
               Edward Island would be a matter not of years <br />
               or months, but of weeks. He had moved for <br />
               correspondence that he expected would show <br />
               the state of advancement of this union, but to <br />
               his extreme surprise he was told that no corre- <br />
               spondence had taken place (hear, hear). Refer- <br />
               ring to the negotiations for admitting New- <br />
               foundland, he (Mr. Mackenzie) contended that <br />
               the Government had taken entirely wrong <br />
               ground in offering to assume control of the <br />
               public lands of that island. These public lands <br />
               were claimed by the Anti-Confederates at the <br />
               late election to be of immense value, and the <br />
               mineral lands to be perhaps the most valuable <br />
               upon this Continent, and that the Canadian <br />
               Government would get the entire benefit of <br />
               these riches. He maintained that the Federal <br />
               Government should have nothing to do with <br />
