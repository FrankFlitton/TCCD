               object in making the motion was to bring <br />
               the attention of the Government to the fact that the navigation of <br />
               Niagara River was likely to be seriously obstructed by the erection <br />
               of this crib. The river at this point was narrow, and a short distance <br />
               below it the lntemational bridge was being erected, and it and the <br />
               crib would form a very serious obstacle to navigation, especially as <br />
               far as lumber raﬁs were concerned. The timber trade passing
               down <br />
               the river was of great and growing importance. A large amount of <br />
               square timber was now being shipped in raﬁs from Michigan,
               and <br />
               the trade was likely to extend to the Canadian shores of the <br />
               Georgian Bay. <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> If this crib were
               allowed to be constructed it would entail great <br />
               expense upon owners of rafts, compelling them to take the rafts <br />
               apart and ﬂoat the lumber down in small tugs. It would be a
               serious <br />
               obstruction to navigation, and ought not to be allowed to be placed <br />
               there without a protest. <br />
