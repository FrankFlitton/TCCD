            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Young said that
               he should only be too <br />
               happy to hear those charges denied, but they <br />
               had not been successfully cleared up; and yet it <br />
               was to such a man that Sir John A. Macdonald <br />
               had entrusted the most important part of the <br />
               public service. He could not but apply to him in <br />
               that office the quotation of Mr. Baldwin, that <br />
               “Confidence was a plant of slow growth; when <br />
               once it was broken, it was difficult to restore <br />
               it.” Then, with regard to the policy of the <br />
               Government, they had violated the Constitu- <br />
               tion in their grant to Nova Scotia; and the <br />
               Ontario Legislature had passed resolutions <br />
               asking that Imperial legislation might be taken <br />
               which would prevent such acts in the future, <br />
               and there was no doubt that the example <br />
               would be attempted to be followed by the other <br />
               Provinces at present in the Confederation. This <br />
               would account in some measure for the dis- <br />
               turbances at Red River. The conduct of the <br />
               hon. member for Cumberland, in regard to the <br />
               grant to Nova Scotia, was answered, and he <br />
               thought that if a different course had been <br />
               pursued in regard to this matter, the difficul- <br />
               ties that had been experienced in Newfound- <br />
               land and Prince Edward IsIand would have <br />
               been overcome. He was astonished to find that <br />
               the Government had taken credit for economi- <br />
               cal management of the Dominion; and he was <br />
               astonished even more to hear the hon. mover of <br />
               the Address refer to it. He would like to know <br />
               where the economy of the Government was to <br />
               be found. Was it in the creation of new Cabinet <br />
               officials, and in the way the Intercolonial Rail- <br />
               way was being managed? He was afraid that <br />
               instead of economy the very opposite course <br />
               had been pursued. The public debt of the <br />
               Dominion, after payment of the expenses con- <br />
               templated, would amount to $120,000,000, and <br />
               would entail a heavy taxation of the country. If <br />
               they put the same duties upon articles entering <br />
               the Dominion as the Americans did, they <br />
               would be in fact cutting off their noses because <br />
               the Americans did theirs. (Laughter.) He <br />
               would go for any national policy which would <br />
               benefit Canada; but he did not approve of a <br />
               tariff which would place them in the same <br />
               position as America. <br />
