            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Blake moved an
               address for copies of the <br />
               correspondence between the Imperial and <br />
               Canadian Governments. He said that a rumour <br />
               had been current last session in that House <br />
               that a portion of the loan raised for the purpose <br />
               of the construction of the Intercolonial Rail- <br />
               way had been expended to meet some of the <br />
               general expenditure of the country. That <br />
               rumour had been commented on by various <br />
               members of the House as presenting a serious <br />
               breach of the obligations which their Govern- <br />
               ment owed to the Imperial Government, con- <br />
               sidering the terms on which their loan had <br />
               been made. A motion was made by him (Mr. <br />
               Blake) for an address on the subject, but the <br />
               address was presented at the end of the ses- <br />
               sion, and it being so late the correspondence <br />
               was not brought down. He begged to call the <br />
               attention of the gentlemen opposite to that <br />
               fact. He would say, however, in advance of the <br />
               papers that he had asked for, that the course <br />
               which was taken by the Government in the <br />
               matter was not such as ought to have been <br />
               taken. The Act provided that the Imperial Gov- <br />
               ernment might guarantee the interest on a loan <br />
               of £3,000,000 to the Government of Canada for <br />
               the purpose of constructing the road and fur- <br />
               ther provided that the guarantees should not <br />
               be given until provisions had been made on the <br />
               part of Canada for appropriation and expendi- <br />
               ture on the construction of the Railway Loan, <br />
               so that the money thus raised by Act of Parlia- <br />
               ment was secured to the appropriation and <br />
               expenditure on the construction of the line. In <br />
               accordance with that Act, the Government <br />
               passed an Act which was accepted by the Com- <br />
               missioners as a satisfactory fulfillment of the <br />
               obligations which were obliged to be fulfilled <br />
               by the Government before the money could be <br />
               raised. A part of it was left in the Treasury, the <br />
               money being raised before they were ready to <br />
               expend it for financial consideration, which it <br />
               was not now necessary to explain, and, under <br />
               these circumstances, he thought that it was the <br />
               duty of the Government that that balance <br />
               should have been kept intact, so that it should <br />
               be ready for expenditure on the completion of <br />
               the road, and that its duty to the Imperial <br />
               Government, by reason of their common inter- <br />
               est with them, and of the conditions under <br />
               which it had guaranteed the interest of the <br />
