               spoke. (Renewed laughter.) He asked what had <br />
               the Government done, he pointed to Nova <br />
               Scotia. Well, is she not conciliated? The Red <br />
               River difficulty will be expected next, and it <br />
               followed. But there was nothing to answer. He <br />
               had forgotten Newfoundland and other things. <br />
               He (Sir George), would fill up his speech on <br />
               that subject, and on Prince Edward Island. In <br />
               these cases they had no right to coerce, it must <br />
               be a mutual agreement and this had not yet <br />
               been accomplished. The member for Shefford <br />

               not expect a Customs Union without collecting <br />
               an equal tariff with theirs to the exclusion of <br />
               all foreign goods, and to the shutting up of <br />
               manufactures by the oppressive excise duties. <br />
               Protection meant the levying of taxes on the <br />
               agriculturists and land owners for the benefit <br />
               of a few. They argued for a policy in respect to <br />
               discriminating duties which had never been <br />
               admitted by Colonial or British legislation <br />
               since the inauguration of the present policy. In <br />
               1846 intimation was received from the Colonial <br />
               office to the effect that we should not impose <br />
               any more discriminating tariffs. But the mover <br />
               thought free trade and reciprocal trade were <br />
               synonymous. Yet in Manchester and Birming- <br />
