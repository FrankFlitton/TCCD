               would come, and unless we <br />
               were prepared for it, unless our legislation be <br />
               framed with that view, we would be found <br />
               then in the same position as now, and being <br />
               unprepared for separate political existence, we <br />
               would have no choice with regard to our <br />
               future. Confederation was an Act of Imperial <br />
               as well as of Colonial policy. The intention of <br />
               that Act, he believed, was to secure, by the <br />
               union of all the scattered British North Ameri- <br />
               can Colonies, a united country of sufficient <br />
               power, population and wealth, to be able to <br />
               maintain itself alone. That policy was to a <br />
               certain extent carried out by the British North <br />
               America Act and his complaint against the <br />
               Government was that they had not made use of <br />
               the prestige which Confederation gave them; <br />
               that they had not been successful in their <br />
               efforts to consolidate Confederation. They had <br />
               not heard from the Government any line of <br />
               future policy whatever, (hear, hear). Nothing <br />
               had been suggested by the Premier with refer- <br />
               ence to the future that is anticipated to arise <br />
               from Confederation. If the legislation recom- <br />
               mended by the Government had been success- <br />
               ful, instead of being obliged to beg at the doors <br />
               of Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island, <br />
               they would have come and asked us to take <br />
               them in. But the only result of Confederation, <br />
               so far, had been a simple change in the mode in <br />
               which the legislation of the country was con- <br />
               ducted. That was not what the public at large <br />
               expected from it. The prestige which was given <br />
               to this Government by the Act of Confedera- <br />
               tion ought to have enabled the Government to <br />
               do more than they had done. It was because <br />
               they had done nothing, because he saw no <br />
               prospect in His Excellency’s Speech of our <br />
               entering upon a new career, and because he felt <br />
               delay to be dangerous, that he complained of <br />
               the course of the Government. The explana- <br />
               tions they had heard in this debate with refer- <br />
               ence to the filling up of the Cabinet, and the <br />
               claims of individuals, indicated that the mind <br />
               of the Premier, at least, was more devoted to <br />
               the keeping up of the personnel of the Govern- <br />
               ment than to the consideration of great meas- <br />
               ures of public policy, (hear, hear). He was very <br />
               far from desiring to make these remarks in an <br />
               offensive way to the hon. gentleman, but no <br />
               one could avoid seeing that where his whole <br />
               attention was taken up in attempts to preserve <br />
               power, he could not give proper attention to <br />
               the great interests in his hands. He would only <br />
               repeat what he had said the other night, that <br />
               holding the views he did, with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span>
               to the <br />
               future of this country, he regretted that he <br />
               could not feel satisfied at the way the gentle- <br />
               men at the head of public affairs were manag- <br />
               ing them. He regretted very much that differ- <br />
               ing with them on this matter, he found himself <br />
               compelled to oppose them. With regard to the <br />
