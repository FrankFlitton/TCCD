               a measure of that <br />
               character, it would be absurd. One might as <br />
               well ask the people of the United States to <br />
               frame their laws on the customs of the inhabi- <br />
               tants of the Fiji Islands. If there were any <br />
               attempts to deprive the people of the Maritime <br />
               Provinces of their rights, as the member for <br />
               Bothwell seemed pleased to intimate, there <br />
               were men from those Provinces, their own rep— <br />
               resentatives, who were perfectly able to look <br />
               after their interests. The people of New Bruns- <br />
               wick were content with the franchise as they <br />
               had it, and the franchise there was based on <br />
               the £100 qualification, mixed of real and per- <br />
               sonal estate or income—and in case of land of <br />
               $100. In Ontario the franchise had always been <br />
               connected in some way or other with the land. <br />
               In the Maritime Provinces the franchise went <br />
               further, and was based on salary and income. <br />
               The principle of the Bill was to extend to <br />
               Ontario the same advantages which were pos- <br />
               sessed by the Maritime Provinces, (hear, hear). <br />

               country, by making residence a qualification of <br />
               voting. Registration as well as residence and <br />
               property was required. If the representatives <br />
               of Ontario were prepared to adopt the principle <br />
               of universal suffrage, then he would say that <br />
               the people of the Maritime Provinces would <br />
               not have it, (hear, hear). Those people were <br />
               determined that practical and not theoretical <br />
               qualifications should be the result of voting. <br />
