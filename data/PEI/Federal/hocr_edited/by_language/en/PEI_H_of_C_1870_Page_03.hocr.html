               Brunswick. He could not congratulate the 
               <br />
               House upon progress of Confederation. It was 
               <br />
               time it was carried, but from expressions he 
               <br />
               had heard from members of this House he was 
               <br />
               forced to conclude that the Province was not 
               <br />
               satisfied. The policy of the Government with 
               <br />
               reference to the Intercolonial Railway had 
               <br />
               already been fully discussed and he did not 
               <br />
               intend to say anything further than that he 
               <br />
               should have been glad to have seen the policy 
               <br />
               with reference to the construction of that road 
               <br />
               materially altered. He thought a policy of 
               <br />
               economy should have been pursued. The policy 
               <br />
               which had been adopted in the construction of 
               <br />
               the Intercolonial Railway has given us the 
               <br />
               management of several hundred miles of rail- 
               <br />
               way—an arrangement that could not be carried 
               <br />
               on as well under Government control as by 
               <br />
               private parties, and it involved responsibilities 
               <br />
               which it would have been better not to assume. 
               <br />
               He was convinced that the expenditure upon 
               <br />
               this railway would itself form a serious burden 
               <br />
               upon the resources of the country. He regretted 
               <br />
               to observe that the policy which had been pur- 
               <br />
               sued with reference to Newfoundland and 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island had borne results worse 
               <br />
               than barren. They had received a more decided 
               <br />
               negative from Newfoundland as regards Con- 
               <br />
               federation. And this House stood in the awk- 
               <br />
               ward position of having legislated with regard 
               <br />
               to terms to be offered to Prince Edward Island, 
               <br />
               which terms had been rejected entirely. With 
               <br />
               regard to the North-West question he was 
               <br />
               sorry to arrive at the same conclusion. An 
               <br />
               avowed resistance had been given to attempts 
               <br />
               to incorporate that Territory into the Domin- 
               <br />
               ion. Who was responsible for that state of 
               <br />
               things he would not pretend to say until all the 
               <br />
               correspondence and other papers connected 
               <br />
               with the matter had been laid before the 
               <br />
               House. When he looked from one end to the 
               <br />
               other of the Dominion he must pronounce the 
               <br />
               administration of the hon. member for Kings- 
               <br />
               ton a failure as regards the important measure 
               <br />
               entrusted to him, (hear, hear). He would fur— 
               <br />
               ther say that if there had been one thing that 
               <br />
               had saved Confederation from public disap- 
               <br />
               proval, it was not what had been done by the 
               <br />
               Dominion Government but the efficient man- 
               <br />
               agement which had characterized the Local 
               <br />
               Governments of Quebec and Ontario—emi- 
               <br />
               nently the populous and wealthy Province of 
               <br />
               Ontario, and these Provinces could be appealed 
               <br />
               to as a proof of the satisfactory manner in 
               <br />
               which local powers had been administered. The 
               <br />
               Speech of the Governor General was a serious 
               <br />
               disappointment to him. There was but one 
               <br />
               source of congratulation in that Speech—it was 
               <br />
               thankfulness for the bountiful harvests; there 
               <br />
               was no hope held out that there would be a 
               <br />
               reconciliation of difficulties with that Prov- 
               <br />
               ince, and there is nothing to make us hope that
