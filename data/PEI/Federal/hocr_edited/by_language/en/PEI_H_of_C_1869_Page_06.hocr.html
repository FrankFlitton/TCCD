               Island some equivalent to induce her to enter <br />
               the Union. The equivalent contemplated by <br />
               those resolutions was that the Dominion Gov- <br />
               ernment should purchase the lands still held <br />
               under the original grants, being about 800,000 <br />
               acres, or rather more than one-half the island, <br />
               and sell them to actual settlers, to be held in <br />
