               purposes, as they were entitled to, a debt having been incurred by <br />
               the Island Railway. A deputation had in January been sent up to <br />
               arrange terms of union. Another delegation had been recently sent <br />
               up, empowered to enter into the ﬁnal arrangements which were
               now <br />
               submitted to Parliament. The great local works there having been <br />
               now completed, there could never be any large local expenditure in <br />
               the future, and it was in consideration of this fact that the Dominion <br />
               Government had granted such liberal terms. <br />

               that excess would be charged against the debt of the Islands. In <br />

               11 1/2 per cent, on what the Dominion charged 15. <br />
