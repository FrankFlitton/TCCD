of the Bill to readjust the provincial debt. He said in consequence of <br />

his hon. friend the Minister of Finance desired to move its second <br />

question of the liabilities of the respective Provinces, some <br />
provision should be made by which Upper and Lower Canada <br />

when the debt of any party exceeded that stipulated in the statute be <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. Mr. WOOD said,
speaking generally, he did not see that <br />
this would in any way settle the difference between Ontario and <br />
Quebec. He wished it would. (Hear, hear.) However, they had <br />
always managed to keep their tempers over the matter. He <br />
contended that the difference surrounding this matter would be as <br />
great as before. As to the advantages to the Provinces, it seemed to <br />
him it would be very small. Ontario and Quebec would each receive <br />
between $3,000,000 and $4,000,000, Nova Scotia over $67,000, <br />
New Brunswick over $60,000, British Columbia about $11,000, and <br />
that to Manitoba as small as $6,967. This was too little for that <br />
poor, small Province, and the Minister of Finance would require to <br />
make some provision for it. Increasing subsidies all round <br />
amounted to $13,386,934. The debt at Confederation was <br />
$77,000,000, and it might surprise those who had studied the matter <br />
thoroughly that it had now reached the sum of $82,000,000. <br />

</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_10" title="bbox 149 1675 836 1899">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> This was caused by
subsidies to the several Provinces being <br />
treated as an usual charge upon the revenues instead of being <br />
capitalized and treated as a consolidated debt, as was the case in the <br />
old Provinces of Canada. Then there were $40,000,000 to be <br />
expended upon Public Works, $1,000,000 on the lntercolonial <br />
Railway, $20,000,000 on Canals and $30,000,000 upon the Canada <br />
Paciﬁc Railway subsidies alone, without accounting for the
sum <br />
voted the other day to New Brunswick, under the heading of <br />

New subsidies, as he had already stated, amounted to $13,284,000, <br />
New Brunswick export duty $3,000,000, Prince Edward Island <br />
$7,704,000; that is to say a total of $226,683,700 of debt up to the <br />
present time. These items were so simple that they were easily <br />
calculated, and he did not see how his hon. ﬁiends could
have <br />
arrived at the conclusion to which they pointed. <br />

was arrived at upon the basis of the treaty, returns, imports and <br />
exports particularly. He reminded the hon. gentleman of the debts <br />
that followed the period of ﬁnancial prosperity from 1846 to
1864, <br />
during which so many railways and public works were under <br />
construction. No doubt for a few years to come the expectations of <br />
the Finance Minister would be realized, but we were heading up <br />
against time, the tide turned and heavy burdens were being laid <br />
upon the country by this Government against the future. He <br />
reminded by asserting that our public debt was not a cent less than <br />
he had concluded, namely above $110,000,000. <br />

hoped some means could be divided by which Ontario and Quebec <br />
would agree upon the assets. <br />

Act of Confederation, when it was expected everything would work <br />
smoothly; yet they had extended upon the ﬁrst session of
the second <br />
Parliament when it was proposed to have everything to place. It was <br />
prepared to give to New Brunswick a subsidy which was agreed to <br />
about $1,000,000, and which would be $800,000 more than they <br />
were entitled to by the ﬁgures of the Finance Minister
himself <br />
When the Government were asked how it was they happened to <br />
take up the question, a reply was given that it was the member from <br />
Napierville who had proposed such arrangement two years ago. He <br />
denied that he made any such proposition. It was of a different <br />
nature. <br />

held that under the Confederation Act, the Great Western and <br />
Northern Railway debts should go to the reduction of the debt of <br />
Ontario and Quebec, and he argued that, judging from what had <br />

over the railways in these Provinces to them. <br />
