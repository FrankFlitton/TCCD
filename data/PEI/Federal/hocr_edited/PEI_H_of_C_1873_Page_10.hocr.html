<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. Mr. HOLTON said
the observations he had just heard <br />
were very gratifying to him. Now they had the assurance of the <br />
Government that they were going to adopt boldly the view which it <br />
became his duty to express; and he had no doubt that the sum he <br />
had indicated as the maximum sum for this service, to wit, half a <br />
million dollars, would be found to be near the mark. He
afﬁrmed <br />
that the investigation regarding the administration of the Militia <br />
Department had had the effect of bringing the Government to adopt <br />
the policy which they had announced that day. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. BOWELL was of
opinion that very little good resulted from <br />
the annual camps, and referred to the reluctance with which <br />
employers permitted employees to attend the camps. He also called <br />
attention to the fact that in some of the companies there were four <br />
men to each ofﬁcer, while in one company there were two
ofﬁcers <br />
to one man. He hoped the Minister of Militia would consider well <br />
before he gave his consent to the calling out of the men into camp, <br />
for the present system of camp drill was an utter and useless waste <br />
of money. <br />

the system which it was proposed to introduce next year would <br />
prove to be the proper one. <br />
