the Government. (Hear, hear.) In their minutes of Council of <br />
the 28th of July <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">last-and</span>
when they penned that they knew <br />
the provisions of the treaty just as well as they do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now-they</span> <br />
knew then as well as now whether it was in the interests of <br />
peace, whether it was for the interests of the Dominion, that it <br />
should be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accepted-yet</span>
in that minute they state as a reason <br />
why they could not accept the treaty that the principal cause of <br />
difference between Canada and the United States had not been <br />
removed by the treaty but remained a subject for future <br />
anxiety. He answered the hon. gentleman out of their own <br />
mouths. The last speaker had referred to the remarks of his <br />
colleague from Halifax (Mr. Power) respecting the advantage <br />
the treaty would have conferred upon the ﬁshing trade of
Nova <br />
Scotia had it been in operation last year. He stated that in that <br />
case Nova Scotia would have saved between $500,000 and <br />
$600,000 on the duties on herrings and mackerel which had <br />
been sent to the United States. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> He (Mr. Jones) held
in his hand the trade and navigation returns <br />
for the past year, which he presumed were tolerably accurate. He <br />
found from this document that the total amount of pickled <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁsh-</span><br />
herring and mackerel and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alewives-sent</span>
into the United <br />
States last year was 47,000 barrels, which, at $2 a barrel, <br />
would be $94,000, instead of $600,000 as claimed by the hon. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The hon. President of
Council (Hon. Mr. Tupper) also stated <br />
that the treaty of 1854 was a great boon. Well, no one denied <br />
that; but contrast that treaty with the present treaty. Under the <br />
former one, agricultural products, our coal and lumber, were <br />
admitted free of duty into the United States. How different <br />
was this from the present treaty! The same hon. gentleman <br />
stated as one reason why this Treaty must be a good one for us <br />
that the American ﬁshermen were opposed to it. The hon. <br />
member for Durham West (Hon. Mr. Blake), the other night, <br />
speaking on this point had hit the nail on the head. He stated <br />
that the reason why American ﬁshermen opposed the Treaty <br />
was that Gen. Butler had gone down to Gloucester and <br />
harangued them, telling them that now was their time to wrest <br />
from Congress what they had long wanted, namely, a system <br />
of bounties and the bonding of their supplies. That was the <br />
sole course of their outcry against the Treaty, and the Minister <br />
of Justice (Hon. Sir John A. Macdonald) knew it very well, <br />
and he (Mr. Jones) had grave apprehensions that such a policy <br />
would be adopted by Congress. Of course they would not do <br />
so while the Treaty was pending but when this Parliament <br />
accepted the Treaty then would be their time to grant bounties <br />
to their ﬁshermen, and to allow the bonding of their
supplies. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The President of the
Privy Council (Hon. Mr. Tupper) had <br />
contended that the admission of American ﬁshermen into our <br />
waters would not destroy the value of our ﬁsheries, but the <br />
reports of the Minister of Marine and Fisheries (Hon. Senator <br />
Mitchell) had told a different story. He gave the value of the <br />
ﬁsheries before and during the Reciprocity Treaty, and
showed <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> conclusively that if
we had adopted an exclusive policy after <br />
the abrogation of the treaty, we would now have had control of <br />
the American markets. The House was told that the arbitrators <br />
appointed to decide upon the relative value of our ﬁsheries <br />
and the American fisheries would pay us what we lost in <br />
giving up our ﬁsheries; but the very
ﬁrst question that would <br />
have to be decided before they could estimate the relative <br />
value was where were they to draw the boundary line of our <br />
ﬁsheries, whether from headland to headland, or along the <br />
coast? lfthe former, of course our ﬁsheries would be greatly
<br />
increased in value; but how were the arbitrators to decide? It <br />
was, therefore, of the very greatest importance that the High <br />
Joint Commissioners should have settled deﬁnitely the <br />
question of headlands, so that the arbitrators would have had a <br />
basis on which to make their valuation. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The hon. gentlemen
opposite, particularly the Premier, had <br />
stated that the American markets were the only markets we <br />
had for our ﬁsh. He had not had the pleasure of listening to
the <br />
speech of his colleague from Halifax (Mr. Power); but he <br />
understood that gentleman had given some ﬁgures to show <br />
that a large portion of our ﬁsh was sent to the United
States. <br />
He was not aware from what source that gentleman drew his <br />
information, but he felt it his duty to be as correct as possible <br />
and he had taken the trouble to consult the public documents <br />
for 1862, 63, 64 under the Reciprocity Treaty, and also after <br />
that Treaty in 1869, 70, 71, when the United States imposed <br />
duty on our ﬁsh. He found that under the Reciprocity Treaty <br />
only about 7 per cent more of our ﬁsh went to the United <br />
States than when the duty was imposed. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The American
ﬁshermen stood in a very different position <br />
from our ﬁshermen in many respects. 1n the ﬁrst
place they <br />
had larger and better vessels, larger outfits, larger capital, and <br />
they had in operation a system of mutual insurances. They had <br />
the additional advantage of being able to fish all the year <br />
round. Our fishermen ﬁshed in the early part of the year
only; <br />
but, after the mackerel ﬁshing was over in the fall, the <br />
American ﬁshermen went off to the banks, and caught halibut <br />
and other fish, which our fishermen could not do. He would <br />
tell the hon. gentleman why. lf he were to send his vessel there <br />
he would have to sell his cargo wholesale, and would not be <br />
able to pay the expense of taking it to market. But those <br />
people had a market at their own doors. The American <br />
ﬁshermen thus had the advantage over ours. They were able to
<br />
earn during the winter season what would pay their expenses <br />
all the year round, and that was a very important <br />
consideration. The hon. gentleman had referred to the position <br />
of the American markets during that time. Within the last two <br />
years so great had been the increase of American ﬁshermen, <br />
since the war, since they had gone back and engaged in old <br />
pursuits, that ﬁsh had been cheaper in Boston than Halifax, <br />
and there had been large imports from Boston, and the West <br />
Indies markets had been trading from Boston instead of <br />
Halifax. 1f the hon. gentleman understood the matter as he did <br />
he would see those people would come with better appliances <br />
