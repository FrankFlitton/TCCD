               From the fact that the Dominion Government and Parliament had 
               <br />
               undertaken the construction of the lntercolonial Railway at a cost of

               contribution on the part of the Dominion of $30,000,000, that 
               <br />
               $20,000,000 or $25,000,000 was to be expended on canals, that it

               was contemplated to readjust the debts of the Dominion by

               <br />
               in proportion to the other Provinces, it was agreed to extend the 
               <br />
               Island debt to be assumed to $50 a head. At the negotiations in 
               <br />
               January last the sum was ﬁxed at $45 a head. That had been 
               <br />
               submitted to the people of the Island and the result was that the 
               <br />
               newly elected Legislature had rejected the terms and authorised 
               <br />

               <br />
               constructed a building used as a post ofﬁce and court house, which

               <br />
               Island. The Province was in a different position to that of any other 
               <br />
               Province in the Dominion. What passed to the other Provinces as 
               <br />
               Crown Lands had, in the case of Prince Edward Island, been sold to 
               <br />
               parties in England by the Imperial Government, so that they had no 
               <br />
               Crown Lands, and derived no revenue from such a source for local 
               <br />
               purposes as every other Province did. These lands being held by 
               <br />
               absentee proprietors, the only persons living on them were tenants, 
               <br />
               and this was a very unsatisfactory state of things, and had prevented 
               <br />
               the Island from taking the position it would otherwise have taken. It 
               <br />
               was in consequence of this that the Legislature, in 1869, authorised 
               <br />
               the Government to make arrangements for the admission of the 
               <br />
               Island including the purchase of the Crown Lands. The Island had 
               <br />
               since then purchased some small portion, but a very large portion 
               <br />
               remained in the hands of absentee proprietors. The quantity yet to 
               <br />
               be purchased was between 400,000 and 500,000 acres.
