               <br />

               <br />
               ago. He considered that the life and history of Sir George-E. Cartier 
               <br />
               was mixed up with the history of Canada, and especially with the 
               <br />
               history of Confederation and believed that the country owed the 
               <br />
               latter to him more than to any other man in Canada, since it had 
               <br />
               been under British institutions.

               He was quite unprepared to make a speech on the question, but 
               <br />
               did think that if ever there was an occasion which the House should 
               <br />
               show its regard for a great man now was the time, and if ever there

               George-E. Cartier. He should therefore propose, the following

               English precedent, that the funeral of Sir George-E. Cartier should 
               <br />
