               He observed that his object in making the motion was to bring 
               <br />
               the attention of the Government to the fact that the navigation of 
               <br />
               Niagara River was likely to be seriously obstructed by the erection 
               <br />
               of this crib. The river at this point was narrow, and a short distance 
               <br />
               below it the lntemational bridge was being erected, and it and the 
               <br />
               crib would form a very serious obstacle to navigation, especially as 
               <br />
               far as lumber raﬁs were concerned. The timber trade passing down 
               <br />
               the river was of great and growing importance. A large amount of 
               <br />
               square timber was now being shipped in raﬁs from Michigan, and 
               <br />
               the trade was likely to extend to the Canadian shores of the

               <br />

               gentlemen went home for the purpose of submitting them to their

               colleagues, and they in turn had made up their minds to submit
