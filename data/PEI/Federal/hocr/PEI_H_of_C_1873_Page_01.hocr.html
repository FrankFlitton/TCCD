               Hon. Mr. ANGLlN said the importance ofthis subject could not 
               <br />
               well be over-estimated, but it could not have been dealt with 
               <br />
               sooner. He wished to point out a few of the facts, as laid down in 
               <br />
               Fleming’s report, which had not been noticed by the mover of the 
               <br />
               resolution. The proposed route was not only the shortest to Europe 
               <br />
               from this country, but it was also the shortest from New York to 
               <br />
               Europe, and, therefore, in the summer season a very large passenger 
               <br />
               trafﬁc might reasonably be expected over this route, which would 
               <br />
               diminish the risks and inconvenience and sufferings of a sea

               From his own personal knowledge he could say that the 
               <br />
               expenditure on the continent would be a mere triﬂe. A branch 
               <br />
               railway from the lntercolonial Railway, down to Shippegan would, 
               <br />
               according to Mr. Fleming, be about 22 miles in length. He knew the 
               <br />
               country, and knew that except on the prairies there was no country 
               <br />
               where a railway could be more cheaply constructed. There would 
               <br />
               be no bridges nor cuttings required of any importance. With regard 
               <br />
               to the harbour, it was one of the ﬁnest in America. There was 
               <br />
               magniﬁcent entrance to the Bay of Chaleur. The entrance to 
               <br />
               Miramichi Bay would need some improvement, but some 
               <br />
               expenditure would be required anyway. He considered the time had 
               <br />
               now come when this subject should receive the serious 
               <br />
               consideration of the Government and Parliament.

               There was an impression that the interior of Newfoundland was 
               <br />
               waste and uninhabited; but explorations had of late been made 
               <br />
               which showed that the country was well watered and timbered, and 
               <br />
               a railway could be built through it without any great expense.

               It might be said that Newfoundland was not within the 
               <br />
               Dominion, and therefore the Dominion could not be expected to 
               <br />
               seriously entertain any project which would involve an expenditure 
               <br />
               of public money to a very large extent upon the island. That was, no 
               <br />
               doubt, true, but he believed the Government hoped at no distant day 
               <br />
               to induce Newfoundland to join the Union. It was scarcely probable 
               <br />
               that Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland would remain outside 
               <br />
               of the Union for any very great length of time, and one of the means 
               <br />
               of inducing Newfoundland to come into the Union probably would 
               <br />
               be to hold out the expectation that, in addition to other advantages, 
               <br />
               the Island would be opened up by a railway running across it, 
               <br />

               <br />
               great advantage to the country.
