               It was said our fishermen were in favour of the Treaty. He 
               <br />
               denied it. (Hear, hear.) Many of them were, but he utterly

               denied that the majority of the people ofNova Scotia favoured 
               <br />
               it. He did not mean to say that every man who was in favour of

               <br />

               But ﬁsh was not all Nova Scotia produced. She had great 
               <br />
               mineral wealth, and her coal interest was of even greater 
               <br />
               importance than her fisheries, yet this had been entirely 
               <br />
               overlooked. Those interested in the case said and with very 
               <br />
               great force, that if the Government had been earnestly desirous 
               <br />
               of reducing the duty on coal, they would have avoided the 
               <br />
               seizures which they made during last year. From the moment 
               <br />
               the schooner Horton was recaptured by the Americans and 
               <br />
               towed into Gloucester, whatever chance existed for the 
               <br />
               reduction of the duty on coal and lumber was lost. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite and the Minister of Justice especially had 
               <br />
               asked hon. members not to put troublesome questions, not to 
               <br />
               suggest doubts with reference to the Treaty', yet the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Peel (Hon. Mr. Cameron) in his brilliant address 
               <br />
               had left an impression on the House that Americans almost 
               <br />
               had a right to the Fisheries, because they had enjoyed them for 
               <br />
               17 years longer than they had been excluded from them. He 
               <br />
               (Mr. Jones) took a directly opposite view of the question. His 
               <br />
               colleague referred last night to one argument in favour of the 
               <br />
               Treaty, that trade to Cuba would be injured by its annexation 
               <br />
               to the United States. The hon. gentleman should know that we 
               <br />
               are obliged to pay a duty on goods exported to that island, 
               <br />
               double that on the same goods exported to the United States:

               The hon. member for Lanark North (Hon. Mr. McDougall) 
               <br />
               had referred to the fact that Prince Edward Island and 
               <br />
               Newfoundland had accepted the Treaty', and New Brunswick 
               <br />
               and Nova Scotia had not apparently been very warmly 
               <br />
               opposed to it. The hon. gentleman had also sought to create 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               Scotia on the subject. The resolution of the New Brunswick 
               <br />
               Legislature was passed on the 18th February, while the High 
               <br />
               Commission was sitting, and when it was thought that the 
               <br />
               opinion of the Legislature would strengthen the hands of those 
               <br />
               who had charge of our interests‘, they accordingly telegraphed 
               <br />
               to Newfoundland, and as the latter had no interest but the 
               <br />
               ﬁshing interest to consider, they replied that they were well 
               <br />
               satisﬁed to leave the matter to England, for the reason that she 
               <br />
               had left them to exercise their own discretion and free will on 
               <br />
               the subject of entering the Confederation or not. That was a 
               <br />
               very good reason for Newfoundland, because she had been 
               <br />

               He might here remark, as an instance of the singular 
               <br />
               inaccuracies and want of information which characterized the 
               <br />
               whole negotiation, that the important interest of seal ﬁshing 
               <br />
               had been entirely unprovided for in the Treaty. The Governor 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland made a communication to Earl Kimberley, 
               <br />
               enclosing a copy of a minute of the Council of the Local 
               <br />

               <br />
               not among the papers submitted to the House. The reply of the 
               <br />
               Government of Prince Edward Island was worthy of attention, 
               <br />
               because they occupied a position precisely similar to that of 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia. The people of Prince Edward Island had valuable 
               <br />
               ﬁsheries, but they said they were in the hands of the 
               <br />
               Americans already', and the agricultural product of that Island 
               <br />
               far exceeded the value of the ﬁsheries.

               The people of Prince Edward Island had precisely the same 
               <br />
               interest in the ﬁsheries as we had, but they were willing for

               <br />

               <br />
               more manly and national view of the case', and pursued a 
               <br />
               course which contrasted most favourably with that pursued by 
               <br />

               On the contrary, they were willing to make a sacriﬁce for the 
               <br />
