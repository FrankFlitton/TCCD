            <p> <persName ref="pers:MACK1">Mr. Mackenzie</persName> said
               that the first thing <lb/>
               required of a man when he changed from the <lb/>
               Liberal side of the Government side was, to <lb/>
               abuse the Globe newspaper, (laughter). It was <lb/>
               satisfactory to find so old a member, so willing <lb/>
               to come into the traces of the first Minister of <lb/>
               the Crown, and abuse the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Globe</hi>. It was a well <lb/>
               known fact that thirty-two or thirty-three Lib<lb break="no"/>eral members had been brought to the House, <lb/>
               and, in defiance of this gross accusation, he <lb/>
               could say that they had not given factious <lb/>
               opposition, but had at all times preferred to <lb/>
               meet the Government in an open, manly way. <lb/>
               He would now ask the reason why the Union <lb/>
               cause had not in the slightest degree advanced. <lb/>
               It was simply because this combination, this <lb/>
               coalition was formed, not to advance the Union <lb/>
               cause, but to advance a political party to a <lb/>
               position which they might occupy, we were <lb/>
               told, for years to come by the influence of the <lb/>
               expenditure for the construction of the Inter- <lb break="yes"/>
               colonial Railway. He would venture to say that <lb/>
               if the Liberal party had been in power from <lb/>
               that time to the present, there would have been <lb/>
               at this moment a completed Confederation of <lb/>
               all the Provinces of British North America. But <lb/>
               after this Parliament had provided the most <lb/>
               liberal terms for Newfoundland and Prince <lb/>
               Edward Island they had been rejected, and <lb/>
               other Provinces would not join the Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion; and he held that it was because the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of Canada was distrusted, that the <lb/>
               people of the East and West, and North and <lb/>
               South declined to have any political associa<lb break="no"/>tion with them (hear, hear). He would now <lb/>
               proceed to discuss the measures which the <lb/>
               Government saw fit to take, in order, apparent<lb break="no"/>ly, to secure the results they promised long ago. <lb/>
               He recollected that during the elections he had <lb/>
               been told that if the Government secured a <lb/>
               majority in Parliament there could not be a <lb/>
               doubt the union of the Provinces—union with <lb/>
               the Maritime Provinces, would be a certainty, <lb/>
               and union with Newfoundland and Prince <lb/>
               Edward Island would be a matter not of years <lb/>
               or months, but of weeks. He had moved for <lb/>
               correspondence that he expected would show <lb/>
               the state of advancement of this union, but to <lb/>
               his extreme surprise he was told that no corre<lb break="no"/>spondence had taken place (hear, hear). Refer<lb break="no"/>ring to the negotiations for admitting New<lb break="no"/>foundland, he (Mr. Mackenzie) contended that <lb/>
               the Government had taken entirely wrong <lb/>
               ground in offering to assume control of the <lb/>
               public lands of that island. These public lands <lb/>
               were claimed by the Anti-Confederates at the <lb/>
               late election to be of immense value, and the <lb/>
               mineral lands to be perhaps the most valuable <lb/>
               upon this Continent, and that the Canadian <lb/>
               Government would get the entire benefit of <lb/>
               these riches. He maintained that the Federal <lb/>
               Government should have nothing to do with <lb/>
