               the electoral franchise shall be in the Prov- <br />
               inces, not yet in the Union; to tell them, in fact, <br />
               that their influence here shall not be felt. He <br />
               called the attention of the House to the irrele- <br />
               vancy of the franchise proposed. He thought <br />
               that the Minister of Justice could, with pro- <br />
               priety, adopt the franchise of the local Houses. <br />
               His opinion was that the time was not far off, <br />
               when every man in the country would have a <br />
               vote, when the political sentiment of the coun- <br />
               try would not be demoralised by the registra- <br />

               indebted to the hon. member for Bothwell for <br />
               awakening an interest in another subject of <br />
               discussion than the one they had for the last <br />
               seven or eight days, (hear). If every man were <br />
               an educated man, and if there were no moral <br />
               wrong, then the theories of the hon. gentleman <br />
               would be right. But they must take men as <br />
               they were, and look at the interest a man had <br />
               in the country in which he resided. The posses- <br />
               sion of property was an evidence of capacity of <br />
               an interest in the country to be affected by <br />
               legislation, and should serve as a criterion on <br />
               which the franchise should be based, (hear, <br />

               franchise was different from that of New- <br />

               whom we were negotiating to enter the Domin- <br />
               ion, he (Col. Gray) would say that it would be <br />
               absurd to frame a measure not based upon the <br />
               wishes, the wants, or the interests of the 4,000,- <br />
               000 of the Dominion, but on the local practice <br />
               of a population not larger than two of our <br />
               counties in Ontario, and of Provinces which <br />
