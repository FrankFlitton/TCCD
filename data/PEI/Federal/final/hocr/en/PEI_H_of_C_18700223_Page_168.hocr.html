               right to complain if the <br />
               money had been expended in any other way, <br />
               even if the finances of the country should <br />
               enable the Government to “recoup," which was <br />
               the felicitous phrase by which it had been <br />
               described, the money so expended. He believed <br />
               that a rebuke had been received from the <br />
               Imperial Government on that point, and that <br />
               rebuke was followed by remonstrance, and an <br />
               intimation that a change might take place in <br />
               the policy of Her Majesty’s Government What <br />
               was the fate of that remonstrance he did not <br />
               know, nor care how this Government thought <br />
               they could bring sufficient power to bear upon <br />
               the Imperial Government to induce them not <br />
               to change their policy; but when the papers <br />
               came down the House would have more infor- <br />
               mation on the point. He thought that the trans- <br />
               action was not one which was creditable to the <br />
               Government which had made this country <br />
               responsible for it. <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. Sir John A.
               Macdonald said there <br />
               could be no objection to bringing down the <br />
               papers; but the Government declined to enter <br />
               into a discussion on the matter before they <br />
               were so brought down. A discussion had been <br />
               entered into last session before there were any <br />
               papers on the table, and had been replied to by <br />
               Sir John Rose. He believed that Sir John Rose’s <br />
               answer was satisfactory, and that the honour <br />
               and credit of that House had been fully sus- <br />
               tained by the hon. gentleman. He believed that <br />
               the House would be of opinion when the papers <br />
               were brought down that the honour of the <br />
               House and the pecuniary interests of the coun- <br />
               try had been guarded. It would be found that <br />
               there had been no breach of faith on the part of <br />
               the Government. The papers would be brought <br />
               down without delay, and the House and the <br />
               country would have every opportunity for dis- <br />
               cussing the question. <br />
