               nature and extent of the canal works were decided <br />
               upon. Since that date, the Island Government had entered into <br />
               contracts for the construction of railways nearly 200 miles in length <br />
               at a cost of $3,250,000, including the purchase of lands and other <br />
               matters. These public works would become the property of the <br />
               Dominion. Some of the railway was under construction, and a <br />
               portion about ninety miles long would be completed by <br />
               midsummer. <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> From the fact that
               the Dominion Government and Parliament had <br />
               undertaken the construction of the lntercolonial Railway at a cost of <br />
               $20,000,000, that the Paciﬁc Railway was to be built with a <br />
               contribution on the part of the Dominion of $30,000,000, that <br />
               $20,000,000 or $25,000,000 was to be expended on canals, that it <br />
               was contemplated to readjust the debts of the Dominion by <br />
               assuming the Surplus of Ontario and Quebec and giving sums in <br />
               proportion to the other Provinces, and that the Island would not <br />
               have public works constructed aﬁer it came into the Dominion
               at all <br />
               in proportion to the other Provinces, it was agreed to extend the <br />
               Island debt to be assumed to $50 a head. At the negotiations in <br />
               January last the sum was ﬁxed at $45 a head. That had been <br />
               submitted to the people of the Island and the result was that the <br />
               newly elected Legislature had rejected the terms and authorised <br />
               another deputation to come to Ottawa, with power to enter into <br />
               negotiations with the Government for the extension of the amount <br />
               to $50. <br />

               no, that still remained. The only other <br />
               change from the proposition of 1869 was that, as the Island had <br />
               constructed a building used as a post ofﬁce and court house,
               which <br />
               would be used partly for Dominion purposes, the Government <br />
               should take that building on paying the Island $69,000. The Island <br />
               had also entered into a contract for the construction of a dredge at a <br />
               cost of$22,000 and the Dominion took that off their hands, and also <br />
               undertook to assume a liability of $2,000 a year, payable to a <br />
               Company to keep up the telegraphic communication by cable <br />
               between the Island and the Dominion. These were the changes <br />
               made in the propositions of 1869, and those in the terms agreed on <br />
               in January were only to increase the debt from $45 to $50 per head, <br />
               and to undertake to pay the $2,000 a year for the telegraphic <br />
               communication. The papers would be printed this afternoon, and <br />
