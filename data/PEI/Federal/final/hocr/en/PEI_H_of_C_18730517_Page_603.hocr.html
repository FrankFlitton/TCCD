               desired to call the attention of the House to <br />
               a matter of some importance. The House had ordered a Committee <br />
               of investigation into certain matters connected with the
               Paciﬁc <br />
               Railway. That Committee had adjourned until the 2nd July. It was <br />
               empowered to summon witnesses, and to adjourn, not only from <br />
               time to time, but from place to place. Under the ordinary procedure <br />
               of the House, committees had no authority to incur any expenditure <br />
               whatever connected with the summoning of witnesses until those <br />
               witnesses had appeared. The Committee would undoubtedly require <br />
               to incur expenses of various kinds and of a contingent nature. It was <br />
               quite possible that witnesses might decline to travel considerable <br />
               distance until their travelling expenses were furnished. <br />

               well known what was the nature of the <br />
               proposition made to the Island Government in 1869 under the <br />
               authority of this House by resolutions authorizing the Government <br />
               to enter into negotiations and in those negotiations to provide for <br />
               the purchase of lands owned by absentee proprietors. The <br />
               Government then undertook on behalf of the Parliament of Canada <br />
               to give the Island a sum of $800,000 in lieu of crown lands, to <br />
               enable the Government of the Island to purchase the lands owned <br />
               by absentee proprietors. Hon. members generally were aware that <br />
               the proposition of 1869 varied very little from that made to the <br />
               other Provinces except in this particular, and also in the fact that
               the <br />
               Government undertook to maintain steam communication between <br />
               the Island and the Dominion. <br />

               changes which had been made in subsequent <br />
               negotiations. In the proposition of 1869 the Island was to come in <br />
               with a debt of $27.77 per head according to populations, and, of <br />
               course, was to receive eighty cents per head, to be increased every <br />
               ten years aﬁer the taking of the census. One of the changes <br />
               consisted in increasing the debt to $50 per head. That was arrived at <br />
               in this manner. The expenditure on the Intercolonial Railway had <br />
               not been made in 1869, neither had the money been voted for the <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway, neither had the canal policy, involving a
               large <br />
               expenditure of money, been settled by the Parliament of Canada; <br />
               neither had the Island constructed any public works of consequence. <br />
