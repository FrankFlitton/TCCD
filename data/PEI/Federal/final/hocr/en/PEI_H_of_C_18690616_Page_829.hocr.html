            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Mackenzie
               strongly objected to this <br />
               contemplated purchase of proprietary rights. <br />
               It was a want of wisdom in this Parliament <br />
               to assume the duties properly belonging <br />
               to the Local Legislatures. Whatever course <br />
               might be adopted in bringing Prince Edward <br />
               Island into the Union, he was sure of one <br />
               thing, and that was that the Government of <br />
               the Island should be dealt with. By this <br />
               proposition the Government of the Dominion <br />
               was really asked to quiet the titles of two- <br />
               thirds of the entire Island. He had no objec- <br />
               tion to the opening of negotiations for the <br />
               acquisition of this Island, but it was not <br />
               desirable that the Dominion should enter upon <br />
               duties belonging really to the Local Gov- <br />
               ernment, and seek to acquire proprietary <br />
               rights, because no arrangements should be <br />
               concluded without the sanction of Parliament. <br />
               He, therefore, moved in amendment,——“1.
               That <br />
               all the words after the word ‘Dominion’ in the <br />
               ﬁrst resolution be omitted, and the following <br />
               substituted in lieu thereof: ‘But no negotia- <br />
               tions shall be had which may involve the <br />
               Government or Parliament of Canada in any <br />
               attempt to acquire the disputed proprietary <br />
               rights of the original grantees of the Crown <br />
               of the Lands of the Island, or with a view <br />
               to give to the Parliament of Canada juris- <br />
               diction or control in relation to any subject <br />
               matter that by the provisions of the British <br />
               North America Act of 1867 is vested in the <br />
               Legislature of each Province respectively.’ <br />
               2. That the second and third resolutions be <br />
               expunged and the following substituted:— <br />
               ‘That all such arrangements shall be sub- <br />
               mitted to Parliament for its approval before <br />
               any action is taken to give them effect, or <br />
               to pledge the public faith to their fulfilment.’ ” <br />
