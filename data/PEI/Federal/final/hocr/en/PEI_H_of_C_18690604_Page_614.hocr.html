               would be entitled to <br />
               come into the Union according to population <br />
               as compared with Nova Scotia and New <br />
               Brunswick. It was also proposed to allow <br />
               the colony an annual subsidy of $35,000, and <br />
               an allowance of eighty cents per head until <br />
               the population should increase to 400,000; the <br />
               same arrangement as that made with the other <br />
               Maritime Provinces. In consideration of the <br />
               surrender of its mineral and wild lands to the <br />
               General Goverment, there was a further pay- <br />
               ment to be made of $150,000 per annum. The <br />
               8th resolution referred to a local matter—a <br />
               water company in St. John’s—for $400,000 of <br />
               the bonds of which the Government of the <br />
               Province was responsible, and it was provided <br />
               that the Local Government should retain the <br />
               power of imposing a water rate on the inhab— <br />
               itants, and tonnage and coal dues in the <br />
               harbour of St. John’s on vessels supplied by <br />
               this Company with water. It was provided in <br />
               the resolutions that the Government of Can- <br />
               ada should assume all the charges in the Prov— <br />
               ince of Newfoundland which are borne by <br />
               it in the other Provinces. The union of New— <br />
               foundland with Canada would take place on <br />
               a day named by proclamation, which procla— <br />
               mation should also contain the names of the <br />
               four Senators to represent the Province in <br />
               the Senate of Canada. The Militia Law of the <br />
               Dominion was to be modiﬁed on its operation <br />
               in Newfoundland to meet the peculiar circum- <br />
               stances of the population, and the Dominion <br />
               Government would be pledged to use its in— <br />
               ﬂuence with the Imperial Government to <br />
               maintain a garrison at St. John’s. <br />

               a Railway formed a very conspicuous feature, <br />

               and we have in that Act, as the foundation <br />
               of his policy, a railway. In the revised edition <br />
               of the Constitution, now proposed, a steamboat <br />
               line forms a prominent feature (Hear, hear, <br />
               and laughter.) His hon. friend had earned an <br />
               additional claim to immortality by this feat. <br />
