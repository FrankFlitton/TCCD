            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> others of great
               danger to the country. I, for one, <br />
               as most of you all know, had no part in framing <br />
               this Confederation measure; it was not for a <br />
               time acceptable to me, but having come here <br />
               and having accepted it, I feel that my hon. <br />
               friends from Shefford and Sherbrooke would <br />
               act more wisely if, instead of making the great <br />
               interests of this Confederacy a party question, <br />
               they were to endeavour to combine upon some <br />
               policy that would have for its object the suc- <br />
               cess of this experiment, in the only way it <br />
               seems to be practicable, (cheers). Now, sir, <br />
               something has been said of Prince Edward <br />
               Island and Newfoundland. I would say to the <br />
               hon. gentlemen opposite, if they want Prince <br />
               Edward Island and Newfoundland to enter the <br />
               Confederacy, is it likely they will come in <br />
               when they see that in questions of this magni- <br />
               tude we cannot sink our party feelings, and <br />
               cannot consider it as a question touching our <br />
               commercial relations with other nations. If my <br />
               hon. friend therefore would be content to look <br />
               at this question merely as one touching our <br />
               commercial relations, in order to secure the <br />
               success of this great experiment of Confedera- <br />
               tion, I think it would be much more wise than <br />
               the course they have taken. Now, Mr. Speaker, <br />
               I feel I have treated the subject at greater <br />
               length than I intended, and have thrown out <br />
               observations which occurred to me during the <br />
               course of this debate, and I can only say that as <br />
               the matter has been made a party question by <br />
               the hon. members for Sherbrooke and Shef- <br />
               ford, they can hardly expect that we can allow <br />
               it to give him a party triumph, (hear, hear). My <br />
               hon. friend does not suppose we are quite so <br />
               soft as to allow him to choose the ground upon <br />
               which to fight a party fight, and therefore the <br />
               result will prove that the hon. member for <br />
               Shefford will have no other choice but to <br />
               accept the consequences of the course he has <br />
               taken. <br />
