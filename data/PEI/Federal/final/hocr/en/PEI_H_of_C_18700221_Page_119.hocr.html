            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> thankful that the
               North-West Territory would <br />
               be annexed without a drop of blood being shed, <br />
               (hear, hear). The moderation of the half-breeds <br />
               had been remarkable; and now they under- <br />
               stood the policy of the Government was to be <br />
               pacific. He was afraid that Mr. Macdougall had <br />
               been misled by some designing people in Red <br />
               River. But papers would come before the <br />
               House, and they would show the necessity of <br />
               having this unfortunate difficulty settled as <br />
               soon as possible. Some papers asserted that <br />
               Bishop Taché had encouraged the movement. <br />
               He had the authority of Bishop Taché to deny <br />
               it in toto. Some days before Bishop Taché left <br />
               for Rome in December last, Bishop Taché was <br />
               informed that Mr. Macdougall was to come. <br />
               The Bishop wrote to the College of St. Boni- <br />
               face, to the nuns in the convent there, telling <br />
               them to welcome Mr. Macdougall. The nuns <br />
               having the little children under their control, <br />
               were prepared to receive him by singing the <br />
               National Anthem. As to the remarks which Mr. <br />
               Mackenzie had made as to the militia he (Sir <br />
               George) could inform him that there were <br />
               enrolled in Lower Canada 43,000 men, or 3,500 <br />
               beyond the quota. There was also an excess <br />
               over the quota in Ontario, New Brunswick, and <br />
               Nova Scotia. There had been strictures as to <br />
               the success of Confederation, but could it be <br />
               denied that the Nova Scotian’s difficulty de <br />
               facto had been settled? It was well after all that <br />
               the Constitutional Act of Confederation had <br />
               been tested in Nova Scotia. There the Local <br />
               Parliament was against the Dominion Govern- <br />
               ment, but still it could not impede the whole of <br />
               Confederation. By the action of the last Parlia- <br />
               ment giving justice to Nova Scotia, the cause of <br />
               Confederation had been vastly strengthened. <br />
               Sir A. T. Galt had accused the Government of <br />
               slowness in carrying out Confederation; but <br />
               New Jersey and Rhode Island had been for <br />
               years out of the American Union. Let Sir A. T. <br />
               Galt, who is so great an admirer of American <br />
               institutions, give the Dominion the same time <br />
               for the work of Confederation. The work of <br />
               incorporating Red River, Newfoundland and <br />
               Prince Edward Island would be completed <br />
               before our American neighbors had settled <br />
               their difficulties. The Hon. Mr. Huntington had <br />
               taken part in a meeting in the Eastern Town- <br />
               ships, called for the discussion of Indepen- <br />
               dence, but luckily the member for Missisquoi <br />
               (Mr. Chamberlin) was there and opposed him. <br />
               The result was that Mr. Huntington did not try <br />
               to hold a meeting of the same kind anywhere <br />
               else in Lower Canada. <br />
