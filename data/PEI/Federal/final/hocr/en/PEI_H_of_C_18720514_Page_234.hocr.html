               the price more in proportion than what the hon. gentleman <br />

               fishermen were in favour of the Treaty. He <br />
               denied it. (Hear, hear.) Many of them were, but he utterly <br />
               denied that the majority of the people ofNova Scotia favoured <br />
               it. He did not mean to say that every man who was in favour of <br />
               it was an annexationist, but he did assert that every man in <br />
               Nova Scotia who was an annexationist and looked forward to <br />
               early political connection with the States was in favour of it. <br />
               (Hear, hear). And they were right enough from their point of <br />
               view, because they argued, if you give those people the water <br />
               they will soon own the land. If our ﬁshermen were not so <br />
               much opposed to the Treaty as he thought they ought to be it <br />
               was because of the argument of hon. gentlemen opposite, to <br />
               the effect “in the interest of the empire;” and
               “England would <br />
               not protect us;” and “we had better take a loaf
               than no bread;” <br />
               and that if they did not accept this emasculated arrangement, <br />
               which just condemns themselves, the Americans would get the <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whole-those</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> But ﬁsh
               was not all Nova Scotia produced. She had great <br />
               mineral wealth, and her coal interest was of even greater <br />
               importance than her fisheries, yet this had been entirely <br />
               overlooked. Those interested in the case said and with very <br />
               great force, that if the Government had been earnestly desirous <br />
               of reducing the duty on coal, they would have avoided the <br />
               seizures which they made during last year. From the moment <br />
               the schooner Horton was recaptured by the Americans and <br />
               towed into Gloucester, whatever chance existed for the <br />
               reduction of the duty on coal and lumber was lost. The hon. <br />
               gentlemen opposite and the Minister of Justice especially had <br />
               asked hon. members not to put troublesome questions, not to <br />
               suggest doubts with reference to the Treaty; yet the hon. <br />
               member for Peel (Hon. Mr. Cameron) in his brilliant address <br />
               had left an impression on the House that Americans almost <br />
               had a right to the Fisheries, because they had enjoyed them for <br />
               17 years longer than they had been excluded from them. He <br />
               (Mr. Jones) took a directly opposite view of the question. His <br />
               colleague referred last night to one argument in favour of the <br />
               Treaty, that trade to Cuba would be injured by its annexation <br />
               to the United States. The hon. gentleman should know that we <br />
               are obliged to pay a duty on goods exported to that island, <br />
               double that on the same goods exported to the United States: <br />
