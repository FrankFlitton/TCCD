            <p> for independence
               would come, and unless we <lb/>
               were prepared for it, unless our legislation be <lb/>
               framed with that view, we would be found <lb/>
               then in the same position as now, and being <lb/>
               unprepared for separate political existence, we <lb/>
               would have no choice with regard to our <lb/>
               future. Confederation was an Act of Imperial <lb/>
               as well as of Colonial policy. The intention of <lb/>
               that Act, he believed, was to secure, by the <lb/>
               union of all the scattered British North Ameri<lb break="no"/>can Colonies, a united country of sufficient <lb/>
               power, population and wealth, to be able to <lb/>
               maintain itself alone. That policy was to a <lb/>
               certain extent carried out by the British North <lb/>
               America Act and his complaint against the <lb/>
               Government was that they had not made use of <lb/>
               the prestige which Confederation gave them; <lb/>
               that they had not been successful in their <lb/>
               efforts to consolidate Confederation. They had <lb/>
               not heard from the Government any line of <lb/>
               future policy whatever, (hear, hear). Nothing <lb/>
               had been suggested by the Premier with refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the future that is anticipated to arise <lb/>
               from Confederation. If the legislation recom<lb break="no"/>mended by the Government had been success<lb break="no"/>ful, instead of being obliged to beg at the doors <lb/>
               of Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island, <lb/>
               they would have come and asked us to take <lb/>
               them in. But the only result of Confederation, <lb/>
               so far, had been a simple change in the mode in <lb/>
               which the legislation of the country was con<lb break="no"/>ducted. That was not what the public at large <lb/>
               expected from it. The prestige which was given <lb/>
               to this Government by the Act of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion ought to have enabled the Government to <lb/>
               do more than they had done. It was because <lb/>
               they had done nothing, because he saw no <lb/>
               prospect in His Excellency’s Speech of our <lb/>
               entering upon a new career, and because he felt <lb/>
               delay to be dangerous, that he complained of <lb/>
               the course of the Government. The explana<lb break="no"/>tions they had heard in this debate with refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the filling up of the Cabinet, and the <lb/>
               claims of individuals, indicated that the mind <lb/>
               of the Premier, at least, was more devoted to <lb/>
               the keeping up of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">personnel</hi> of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment than to the consideration of great meas<lb break="no"/>ures of public policy, (hear, hear). He was very <lb/>
               far from desiring to make these remarks in an <lb/>
               offensive way to the hon. gentleman, but no <lb/>
               one could avoid seeing that where his whole <lb/>
               attention was taken up in attempts to preserve <lb/>
               power, he could not give proper attention to <lb/>
               the great interests in his hands. He would only <lb/>
               repeat what he had said the other night, that <lb/>
               holding the views he did, with regard
               to the <lb/>
               future of this country, he regretted that he <lb/>
               could not feel satisfied at the way the gentle<lb break="no"/>men at the head of public affairs were manag<lb break="no"/>ing them. He regretted very much that differ<lb break="no"/>ing with them on this matter, he found himself <lb/>
               compelled to oppose them. With regard to the <lb/>
               
       
            
            <pb n="116" facs="final/images/PEI_H_of_C_18700221_Page_116.jpg"/>

               personal relations which had long existed be<lb break="no"/>tween them, he trusted that his changed posi<lb break="no"/>tion towards them politically would not impair 
               <lb/>
               these friendly personal relations.

            <p>
              <persName ref="pers:CART2"> Hon. Sir George-É. Cartier</persName> said that the 
               <lb/>
               tone of the debate had proved that Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion had worked great improvements on the 
               <lb/>
               part of Lower Canada. He thanked God that 
               <lb/>
               Confederation had delivered them of the petty 
               <lb/>
               quarrels between the representatives of differ<lb break="no"/>ent sections of politicians. He was gratified to 
               <lb/>
               find the confidence reposed in him, and con<lb break="no"/>gratulated the House on the patience with 
               <lb/>
               which the Government had listened to the 
               <lb/>
               complaints put forward by the Western mem<lb break="no"/>bers as to the composition of the Government 
               <lb/>
               and the number of Liberal members in the 
               <lb/>
               Cabinet. The question was for them to know 
               <lb/>
               whether they could depend on their fellow 
               <lb/>
               members to give them a majority by which to 
               <lb/>
               carry on the Government. It was not necessary 
               <lb/>
               that they should have a majority in every 
               <lb/>
               Province, but of course a stronger majority 
               <lb/>
               would be founded on a majority gained in this 
               <lb/>
               way. If the Western Province (Ontario) were 
               <lb/>
               prosperous, the other Maritime Provinces 
               <lb/>
               shared it, and they had no right to be bump<lb break="no"/>tious about it. The question of the day was 
               <lb/>
               whether the Government had such a majority 
               <lb/>
               as to be enabled to carry on its measures; but 
               <lb/>
               they did not require a majority in each Prov<lb break="no"/>ince, though the majority now commanded by 
               <lb/>
               the Government was a majority from each 
               <lb/>
               Province. The question discussed by the 
               <lb/>
               Ontario representatives with regard to the 
               <lb/>
               composition of the Cabinet, did not interest the 
               <lb/>
               representatives of the Maritime Provinces, 
               <lb/>
               among which he included Quebec. He was glad 
               <lb/>
               to see the member for Lambton in his seat, for 
               <lb/>
               they all respected his industry, his talents, and 
               <lb/>
               the cautious manner in which he spoke. He 
               <lb/>
               had, however, brought forward disagreements 
               <lb/>
               about the representations of the Reformers in 
               <lb/>
               the Cabinet.

               grievance, but as a deception practiced upon <lb/>
               Reformers at the elections in 1867. I wish the <lb/>
               whole of you were Conservatives, and then we <lb/>
               would have no difficulty. <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:CART2">Hon. Sir
               George-È. Cartier</persName> said the matter <lb/>
               did not affect or interest the representatives of <lb/>
               the other Provinces. The hon. member for <lb/>
               Lambton said that he wished to see them all <lb/>
               Conservatives; but let him try to get up a <lb/>
               Liberal party. With regard to the charge of the <lb/>
               want of success in Confederation, and support<lb break="no"/>ing it by the cases of Newfoundland and Prince <lb/>
               Edward Island, and the North West, he would <lb/>
               refer to those countries. With regard to New<lb break="no"/>foundland, it had rejected the proposal; but the <lb/>
               terms were not those of the Government but of <lb/>
               the House. The House agreed to their proposed <lb/>
               terms, and then they ceased to be their pro<lb break="no"/>posals; and he was surprised to see that such <lb/>
               intelligent men as the members for Lambton <lb/>
               and Sherbrooke should found their charges <lb/>
               upon such a foundation. He would tell the <lb/>
               House that if they would be quiet, in a short <lb/>
               time the terms would be accepted. With regard <lb/>
               to Prince Edward Island, the Government had <lb/>
               made certain proposals, but they did not like to <lb/>
               do anything without the approval of Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. They had telegraphed the terms they <lb/>
               should submit, and they had not yet received a <lb/>
               reply. They could not force such powerful <lb/>
               Provinces as Newfoundland and Prince <lb/>
               Edward Island to accept their terms, but they <lb/>
               must wait. With regard to the North-West Ter<lb break="no"/>ritory, the proceedings adopted had not been <lb/>
               the action simply of the Government, but had <lb/>
               been adopted by the House. After the plans had <lb/>
               been adopted by Parliament the House was <lb/>
               responsible for them. He hoped his hon. friend <lb/>
               did not object to that. The responsibility rested <lb/>
               not upon the Government, but upon the Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment which had passed it; they had done all in <lb/>
               their power to bring about the admission of the <lb/>
               North-West into Confederation. He would <lb/>
               admit that at the time the Confederation Act <lb/>
               was discussed in Quebec, and at the discus<lb break="no"/>sions on it, they were not in possession of all <lb/>
               the information that was desirable. The idea <lb/>
               was that the Hudson Bay Company were not <lb/>
               treating the inhabitants kindly, and that they <lb/>
               would enter the Union gladly, but recent cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances showed that the Government of <lb/>
               the country was not as unpopular as it was <lb/>
               represented. His own impression was that the <lb/>
               population had become indifferent to it, and <lb/>
               the late lamentable circumstances proved that <lb/>
               it was partly unpopular. He regretted that his <lb/>
               own colleague was now to be addressed as an <lb/>
               opponent. Before he accepted the office, he <lb/>
               came to him (Sir George) and asked him <lb/>

          whether he would
               support him. He promised <lb/>
               him to do so for he thought that he would have <lb/>
               been a good Governor. He thought now that he <lb/>
               would have been a good Governor if he could <lb/>
               have got into the country and could have <lb/>
               explained to the settlers that the Government <lb/>
               intended to do them no wrong. There could be <lb/>
               no doubt that the Scotch and English half<lb break="no"/>breeds did not find fault with what the French <lb/>
               Canadian half-breeds were doing. It had been <lb/>
               published in some papers that there was a <lb/>
               conspiracy against his hon. friend, because a <lb/>
               French Gouvernor ought to be sent there, and <lb/>
               that the Territory ought to be a second Quebec. <lb/>
               He thought that these statements were the <lb/>
               most wicked untruths that had ever been pub<lb break="no"/>lished. He had promised his friend his support, <lb/>
               and he should not have been guilty of doing <lb/>
               anything to give the least appearance of truth <lb/>
               to such a wicked and mischievous untruth. The <lb/>
               French Canadians were an impulsive race, and <lb/>
               he thought it very wrong for a writer or a <lb/>
               speaker to attempt to raise a disturbance in the <lb/>
               East as well as in the West. They were French <lb/>
               Canadians, but they were also British subjects <lb/>
               (cheers), and were as much British, even if not <lb/>
               more so, than the British, (cheers). He was a <lb/>
               pure Frenchman, and he defied them to pro<lb break="no"/>duce a more loyal man. Suppose that he was <lb/>
               appointed to the Governorship, would his <lb/>
               being a French Canadian make him unfit for <lb/>
               that position? (No! no.) <persName ref="pers:CART2">Sir G. -É.
               Cartier</persName> then <lb/>
               contrasted the liberality of the Provinces of <lb/>
               Ontario and Quebec, and gave a stirring <lb/>
               description of the loyalty of the old French <lb/>
               inhabitants of the Province of Quebec. As to <lb/>
               the inhabitants of the Red River, the French <lb/>
               had gone there with their fathers, but some <lb/>
               stupid fanatical papers had said there should <lb/>
               be no Frenchmen there. At any rate there was <lb/>
               no intention to send a French Government <lb/>
               there; but still their paper had no right to <lb/>
               speak of the French population as they had <lb/>
               done. The Red River must be a Province like <lb/>
               Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia, or New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, but a Province for every race to settle in. <lb/>
               He thanked God there were in Lower Canada <lb/>
               250,000 honest English-speaking residents; and <lb/>
               he and his co-nationalists only regretted that <lb/>
               there were not double the number. At the last <lb/>
               census there were 80,000 French Canadians in <lb/>
               Upper Canada. He hoped at the next census <lb/>
               there would be 100,000 more (laughter), and he <lb/>
               was convinced that the Upper Province would <lb/>
               not be the worse for this increase. The address <lb/>
               stated that the policy of conciliation would be <lb/>
               adopted. There was the case of Ireland, con<lb break="no"/>quered hundreds of years ago, and the misgov<lb break="no"/>ernment there was only now about to be <lb/>
               relieved by Protestant votes. We wanted no <lb/>
               such state of things here—no country baptized <lb/>
               in blood. The House and country ought to be <lb/>

          thankful that the
               North-West Territory would <lb/>
               be annexed without a drop of blood being shed, <lb/>
               (hear, hear). The moderation of the half-breeds <lb/>
               had been remarkable; and now they under<lb break="no"/>stood the policy of the Government was to be <lb/>
               pacific. He was afraid that Mr. Macdougall had <lb/>
               been misled by some designing people in Red <lb/>
               River. But papers would come before the <lb/>
               House, and they would show the necessity of <lb/>
               having this unfortunate difficulty settled as <lb/>
               soon as possible. Some papers asserted that <lb/>
               Bishop Taché had encouraged the movement. <lb/>
               He had the authority of Bishop Taché to deny <lb/>
               it <hi rendition="simple:italic">in toto</hi>. Some days before Bishop Taché left <lb/>
               for Rome in December last, Bishop Taché was <lb/>
               informed that Mr. Macdougall was to come. <lb/>
               The Bishop wrote to the College of St. Boni<lb break="no"/>face, to the nuns in the convent there, telling <lb/>
               them to welcome Mr. Macdougall. The nuns <lb/>
               having the little children under their control, <lb/>
               were prepared to receive him by singing the <lb/>
               National Anthem. As to the remarks which Mr. <lb/>
               Mackenzie had made as to the militia he (Sir <lb/>
               George) could inform him that there were <lb/>
               enrolled in Lower Canada 43,000 men, or 3,500 <lb/>
               beyond the quota. There was also an excess <lb/>
               over the quota in Ontario, New Brunswick, and <lb/>
               Nova Scotia. There had been strictures as to <lb/>
               the success of Confederation, but could it be <lb/>
               denied that the Nova Scotian’s difficulty <hi rendition="simple:italic">de <lb/>
               facto</hi> had been settled? It was well after all that <lb/>
               the Constitutional Act of Confederation had <lb/>
               been tested in Nova Scotia. There the Local <lb/>
               Parliament was against the Dominion Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but still it could not impede the whole of <lb/>
               Confederation. By the action of the last Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment giving justice to Nova Scotia, the cause of <lb/>
               Confederation had been vastly strengthened. <lb/>
               Sir A. T. Galt had accused the Government of <lb/>
               slowness in carrying out Confederation; but <lb/>
               New Jersey and Rhode Island had been for <lb/>
               years out of the American Union. Let Sir A. T. <lb/>
               Galt, who is so great an admirer of American <lb/>
               institutions, give the Dominion the same time <lb/>
               for the work of Confederation. The work of <lb/>
               incorporating Red River, Newfoundland and <lb/>
               Prince Edward Island would be completed <lb/>
               before our American neighbors had settled <lb/>
               their difficulties. The Hon. Mr. Huntington had <lb/>
               taken part in a meeting in the Eastern Town<lb break="no"/>ships, called for the discussion of Indepen<lb break="no"/>dence, but luckily the member for Missisquoi <lb/>
               (Mr. Chamberlin) was there and opposed him. <lb/>
               The result was that Mr. Huntington did not try <lb/>
               to hold a meeting of the same kind anywhere <lb/>
               else in Lower Canada. <lb/>
