            <p> (Sir F. Hincks) had
               not entered into the <lb/>
               charges against himself that had been pub<lb break="no"/>lished in the newspapers. <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p> <persName ref="pers:HINC1">Hon. Sir Francis Hincks</persName>â€”Of course, in <hi rendition="simple:italic">The <lb/> Globe</hi>, I suppose? <lb/>
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:YOUN2">Mr. Young</persName> said that he should only be too <lb/>
               happy to hear those charges denied, but they <lb/> had not been successfully cleared
               up; and yet it <lb/> was to such a man that Sir John A. Macdonald <lb/> had entrusted
               the most important part of the <lb/> public service. He could not but apply to him in
               <lb/> that office the quotation of Mr. Baldwin, that <lb/> "Confidence was a plant of
               slow growth; when <lb/> once it was broken, it was difficult to restore <lb/> it."
               Then, with regard to the policy of the <lb/> Government, they had violated the
                  Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion in their grant to Nova Scotia; and the <lb/> Ontario
               Legislature had passed resolutions <lb/> asking that Imperial legislation might be
               taken <lb/> which would prevent such acts in the future, <lb/> and there was no doubt
               that the example <lb/> would be attempted to be followed by the other <lb/> Provinces
               at present in the Confederation. This <lb/> would account in some measure for the
                  dis<lb break="no"/>turbances at Red River. The conduct of the <lb/> hon. member
               for Cumberland, in regard to the <lb/> grant to Nova Scotia, was answered, and he
               <lb/> thought that if a different course had been <lb/> pursued in regard to this
               matter, the difficul<lb break="no"/>ties that had been experienced in Newfound<lb break="no"/>land and Prince Edward Island would have <lb/> been overcome. He was
               astonished to find that <lb/> the Government had taken credit for economi<lb break="no"/>cal management of the Dominion; and he was <lb/> astonished even more
               to hear the hon. mover of <lb/> the Address refer to it. He would like to know <lb/>
               where the economy of the Government was to <lb/> be found. Was it in the creation of
               new Cabinet <lb/> officials, and in the way the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way
               was being managed? He was afraid that <lb/> instead of economy the very opposite
               course <lb/> had been pursued. The public debt of the <lb/> Dominion, after payment
               of the expenses con<lb break="no"/>templated, would amount to $120,000,000, and <lb/>
               would entail a heavy taxation of the country. If <lb/> they put the same duties upon
               articles entering <lb/> the Dominion as the Americans did, they <lb/> would be in
               fact cutting off their noses because <lb/> the Americans did theirs. (Laughter.) He
               <lb/> would go for any national policy which would <lb/> benefit Canada; but he did
               not approve of a <lb/> tariff which would place them in the same <lb/> position as
               America. <lb/>
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p> <persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. Dr. Tupper</persName> said that his equal tariff <lb/> referred to
               articles which now went free, but <lb/> which should then be placed on an equal
