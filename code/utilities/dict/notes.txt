In this folder are open-source Hunspell dictionary files downloaded from the Hunspell project on SourceForge:

en_CA-large.aff
en_CA-large.dict
README_en_CA-large.txt

The dictionary has been expanded to add all inflected and derived forms using the following command:

unmunch en_CA-large.dic en_CA-large.aff > en_CA-large-expanded.dic

The en_CA-large-expanded.dic file will be used for various functions during processing of typographical features such as line-end hyphenation.
