        <h2>How to return your materials to the project administrator</h2>
        
        <p>When you have finished work on the XML files in the <code>xml</code> folder,
        you need to bundle them up and send them back to the administrator who sent 
        you this package in the first place. If you are comfortable doing this yourself,
        you can create a zip file and attach it to an email. For a slightly easier option,
        you can press the red triangle button <img src="icons/transformation.png" width="22" height="22"/>.
        When prompted, answer that you want to create a package of "XML files only".</p>
