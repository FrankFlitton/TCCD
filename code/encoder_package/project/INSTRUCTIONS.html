        <h2>How to return your materials to the project administrator</h2>
        
        <p>When you have finished work on the XML files in the <code>xml</code> folder,
        you need to bundle them up and send them back to the administrator who sent 
        you this package in the first place. If you are comfortable doing this yourself,
        you can create a zip file and attach it to an email. For a slightly easier option,
        you can press the red triangle button <img src="icons/transformation.png" width="22" height="22"/>.
        When prompted, answer that you want to create a package of "XML files only". Please place your completed zipped project files in the "Complete" folder within the "TCCD Encoders Team" folder at the Dropbox site; and email Gord, lyallg@uvic.ca, to inform him that you are finished with your package. If you require a new package let him know in the email.</p>
