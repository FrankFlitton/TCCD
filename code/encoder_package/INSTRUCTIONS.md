INSTRUCTIONS FOR CREATING AN ENCODER PACKAGE
********************************************

1. Copy the XML files the encoder will be editing into the 
   directory code/encoder_package/xml. Make sure there are 
   no other XML files there. Do NOT add these files to the 
   git repository; they're only there temporarily while you 
   create the package. Leave the original copies in their
   original data folder.
   
2. Press the red triangle while looking at this instructions
   document.
   
3. Provide a filename-like version of the encoder's name when
   asked (all lower-case, no spaces or punctuation). For example:
   "Smith, John" could be turned into "smith_john". This will be
   used to create the filename for the zip file.
   
4. When the process is complete, you will find the encoder's 
   package in the "zip" folder.
