        <ol>
            <li>Copy the XML files the encoder will be editing into the 
                directory <code>code/encoder_package/xml</code>. Make sure there are 
                no other XML files there. Do NOT add these files to the 
                git repository; they're only there temporarily while you 
                create the package. Leave the original copies in their
                original data folder.</li>
            <li>Press the red triangle while looking at this instructions
                document.</li>
            <li>Provide a filename-like version of the encoder's name when
                asked (all lower-case, no spaces or punctuation). For example:
                <q>Smith, John</q> could be turned into <q><code>smith_john</code></q>. 
                This will be used to create the filename for the zip file.</li>
            <li>When the process is complete, you will find the encoder's 
                package in the <code>zip</code> folder. </li>
