<p>Canada began as 4 provinces hugging the St. Lawrence but grew to become 10
provinces and 3 territories. Each time Canada changed, its politicians debated
the purposes, benefits, and drawbacks of Confederation. With the assistance of
Canadians from across the country and the globe, <em>The Confederation
Debates</em> digitized and preserved all of these records for Canada 150.</p>
