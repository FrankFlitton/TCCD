<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The ideas and concerns that inform a country's founding inspire and
complicate politics for generations. In the United States, Americans can learn
about their country's founding ideas and debates by consulting any one of
several published editions of the Federalist Papers, or thematically organized
multi-volume sets of thematically organized papers, debates and pamphlets. For
Australia's centenary, the University of Sydney digitized the full texts of
that country's key debates from the 1890s to the 1940s.</p>

<p>Canadians do not enjoy these opportunities. Before each province and
territory became a part of Canada, their local legislatures (and the House of
Commons after 1867) debated the extent, purposes, and principles of political
union between 1865 and 1949. The vast majority of these records, however,
remain inaccessible. Indeed, many of the texts can only be found in provincial
archives. A few single-volume edited collections exist, but they had to be
heavily edited to reduce the cost of printing. </p>

<p>In addition to federal and colonial debates, the British Crown also
negotiated a series of Numbered Treaties with Canada's Indigenous Peoples.
These texts, and the records of their negotiation, are equally important to
Canada's founding yet, as the <a
href="http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=905">Truth and
Reconciliation Committee</a> recently explained, "too many Canadians still do
not know the history of Indigenous Peoples' contributions to Canada, or
understand that by virtue of the historical and modern Treaties negotiated by
our government, we are all Treaty people."</p>

<p>Embracing new research technologies and dissemination formats made it
possible for <em>The Confederation Debates</em> to finally make all of these
debates accessible to every Canadian. By bringing together these diverse
colonial, federal, and Indigenous texts for the first time, the project will
increase political awareness of historical grievances and contribute to
reconciliation. With the help of hundreds of volunteers from across Canada, the
United States, the United Kingdom and China, this project has converted these
records into searchable texts which can be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>browsed on this site via our map or search interfaces</li>
  <li>downloaded as an XML database</li>
  <li>consulted via 366 "Quotes of the Day" that the project posted both
    official languages to social media during the year preceeding 1 July
  2017</li>
  <li>taught via grade 7/8 and High School lesson plans that conform to each
    province's history and curriculum requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>To help Canadians learn more about the history of Confederation, this
project also commissioned leading historians from across the country to produce
chapters explaining when and why each province and territory became a part of
Confederation.</p>
