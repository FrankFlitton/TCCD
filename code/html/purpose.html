    <h2 lang="en">Purpose</h2>
    
    <p lang="en">The ideas and concerns that inform a country's founding inspire and
      complicate politics for generations. In the United States, Americans can learn
      about their country's founding ideas and debates by consulting any one of
      several published editions of the Federalist Papers, or thematically organized
      multi-volume sets of thematically organized papers, debates and pamphlets. For
      Australia's centenary, the University of Sydney digitized the full texts of
      that country's key debates from the 1890s to the 1940s.</p>
    
    <p lang="en">Until 2017, Canadians did not enjoy these opportunities. Before each province and
        territory became a part of Canada, their local legislatures (and the House of
        Commons after 1867) debated the extent, purposes, and principles of political
        union between 1865 and 1949. The vast majority of these records, however,
        remained inaccessible to the vast majority of Canadians. Indeed, many of the texts could only be accessed in provincial
        archives. A few single-volume edited collections existed, but they had to be
        heavily edited to reduce the cost of printing. </p>
      
      <p lang="en">In addition to federal and colonial debates, the British Crown also
        negotiated a series of Numbered Treaties with Canada's Indigenous Peoples.
        These texts, and the records of their negotiation, are equally important to
        Canada's founding yet, as the <a
          href="http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=905">Truth and
          Reconciliation Committee</a> explained, "too many Canadians still do
        not know the history of Indigenous Peoples' contributions to Canada, or
        understand that by virtue of the historical and modern Treaties negotiated by
        our government, we are all Treaty people."</p>
      
      <p lang="eng">Embracing new research technologies, dissemination formats made it
        possible for <em>The Confederation Debates</em> to finally make all of these
        debates accessible to everyone. Multiple Universities, the federal government, and the Crabtree foundation came together with <a href="#">hundreds of volunteers</a> from across Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and China, to digitize and transcribe these colonial, federal, and Indigenous texts for the first time. In so doing, the prioject increased political awareness of historical grievances and contributed to
        reconciliation. Today, these records can be:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">browsed</a> on this site via our map or search interfaces</li>
        <li><a href="#">downloaded</a> as an XML database</li>
        <li>shared via 366 "<a href="#">Quotes of the Day</a>" that the project posted both
          official languages to social media during the year preceeding 1 July
          2017</li>
        <li>taught via <a href="#">grade 7/8 and High School lesson plans</a> that conform to each
          province's history and curriculum requirements</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p lang="en">To help Canadians learn more about the history of Confederation, this
        project also commissioned leading historians from across the country to  write short chapters explaining when and why each province and territory became a part of Confederation. Their work will soon be available in: "<em><a href="#">Reconsidering Confederation: Canada's Founding Debates, 1865-1999</em></a>."</p>
