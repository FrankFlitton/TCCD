<h2 lang="en">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <p lang="en"><em>Q:</em>What is <em>The Confederation Debates?</em></p>
  <p lang="en"><em>A:</em><em>The Confederation Debates</em> was a multi-university Canada 150 project that crowdsourced the transcrpition and dissemination of Canada's founding parliamentary and Indigenous discussions. You can learn more about the project<a href="http://hcmc.uvic.ca/tccd/purpose.html">here</a>.</p>
  
  <p lang="en"><em>Q:</em>When I think of "Confederation," I think of John A. Macdonald, George Cartier, George Brown, and Maritime leaders like Leonard Tilley. Are Indigenous leaders really part of Confederation?</p>
  <p lang="en"><em>A:</em>Confederation was a long process, spanning from the 1860s, through to 1999 and the creation of Nunavut. It is now widely acknowledged that our country was founded by at least “three founding Peoples.” <em>The Confederation Debates</em> embraces this important shift by recognizing that Indigenous Peoples were and continue to be “partners in Confederation” (as the <a href="http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/aboriginal-heritage/royal-commission-aboriginal-peoples/Pages/item.aspx?IdNumber=500">Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples</a>insisted.</p>

  <p lang="en"><em>Q:</em>Can I download <em>The Confederation Debate's</em>entire dataset to do text analysis?</p>

  <p lang="en"><em>Q:</em>Why don't your records include content from the Northwest Territories and Nunavut?</p>
  <p lang="en"><em>A:</em>It was beyond the resources of this project to reproduce the records of each province and territory's establishment. We hope to eventually expand <em>The Confederation Debates</em>>to include these records.</p>
